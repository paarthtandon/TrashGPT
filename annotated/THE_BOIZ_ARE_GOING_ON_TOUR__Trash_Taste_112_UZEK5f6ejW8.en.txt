<SPEAKER_03> yeah well uh i guess welcome back to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> japan studio guys uh the la arc is not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> over yet we just thought you guys might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just miss just the three of us have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bit of a breath </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna have a little bit of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breather and just come back with just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the three of us because we haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually been able to talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anything that we've done abroad yet sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talk sure let's let's talk but uh as you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guys can see from the title of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode uh the first topic we're going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to be talking about is our tour yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we've announced it now tickets are on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sale but i know there's been a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> questions that's been up in the year uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because we haven't really been able </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk much about it on the podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because we've been busy on a different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yes we will be touring north america </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though it's just like all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> america and then one show in canada it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> north america guys it's north america </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the canadians are like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i know a lot of people asked uh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's been a ton of questions about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tour yeah because like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people like because we're too fair we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't been very good at explaining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's yes yes uh the first one was why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not other locations uh well the main </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason we chose america i think is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because uh it just made sense and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah well also uh logistics and most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more importantly visas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah visas is a massive headache uh so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you want to go to a like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> southeast asia tour or a europe tour um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we would have to think way more than uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what we would need to do in america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's basically just one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's taken up enough resources </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just setting up this one tour because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason we wanted to do this tour is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've wanted to do a tour since </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cove it happens right yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mean we've been planning this for about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a year or so uh as an as a back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> burner idea and then suddenly the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opened up and we were just like guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're going to do it now we've got to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not knowing that we kind of slid this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tour in on possibly like already the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> busiest year of our lives oh no it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely the business yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly for sure but like yeah i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the other reason as well like we chose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> america specifically because it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of on brand for trash taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know yeah if you've been on uh our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> afternoon streams especially uh which by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the way you totally should if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't then uh we uh we like to talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about america listen we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's obvious we're obviously we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obsessed with the americans yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also our biggest audience is in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> america so this just made the most sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really and you know we hate them because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we ain't them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we hate we just hate that we aren't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah okay yeah and you know i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think we've ruled out the possibility of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing tours in future in other locations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah is this but like it also no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> promises that we'll ever do another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> promises no because we might we might be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh no that was that was a lot yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we might [ __ ] hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> none of us have ever been on a tour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before none of us have ever been close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to anything like this yeah so this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new for all of us and so we figured you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know what better place to do it to start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it off than uh in a place that we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hopefully a little more familiar with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when it comes to our audience and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like that and uh you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we should go around all the us none of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> us have ever been around like every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> single state yeah yeah yeah not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> close like like there's so much of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> america considering how much we've [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on america there's so much of america </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we've just never been to yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely what are you googling uh i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> googling the exact cities that we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be going oh yeah yeah okay so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> keep keep talking guys i was going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say because i saw one comment that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's so [ __ ] they talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> america because they've only been in l.a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well [ __ ] you this is what i'm doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm going around all of your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> country absolutely not sure i am going </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> complaining </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> missouri is like right next to kansas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes yeah i think kansas city is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> literally like 10-minute [ __ ] drive </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> pollock it's very close missouri's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's ours now yeah i think so i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like let's just take that over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we've got denver colorado yeah salt lake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh salt lake city soul play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> flake if you don't come to the city </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> salt lake city in utah phoenix arizona </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> la san francisco in california uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seattle in washington and portland </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oregon nice see i haven't been to most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of those places yeah i i've always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been like a dream of mine to always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just go around the us anyway oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i think that's part of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why we wanted to do this tour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was it's a reason for us to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the places we've wanted to go in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> us and we've just never had the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opportunity uh to go to before hold on i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think we're getting breaking news </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where's hannah montana from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god oh i know my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bigger question why is hannah montana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> called hannah montana why is it not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> hannah 10. because it doesn't work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because hannah tennessee doesn't rhyme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> well then based it on montana </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] tv </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah no as god was saying like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a great excuse for us to actually go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> around america and i feel like we'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually be able to on this tour we'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be able to get kind of a more i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in-depth look into america as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because we'll actually be on a tour bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which yeah i'm really excited for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah as like someone who's like super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> into like rock music and stuff and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like seeing rock bands go on like tour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> buses and stuff i'm like i want that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think i'm i i think i'm excited for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> idea of a tube of a tour bus you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm not yeah i heard that you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have a poop on it so yeah yeah i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> disappointed because i like to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> boundaries oh well it's uh five weeks of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> constipation then boys yeah because i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> seen pictures and basically we're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be in bunk beds for an entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> closed bunk beds yeah close bunk beds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for an entire two months we're basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be asking that's fine yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we're basically just going to be in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> space shuttle for like a month right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah doesn't that sound cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's going to be a real test of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our friendship i mean these guys cool i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i love these guys i love these guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but i don't know how i'm going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after sitting with them for like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was it five weeks which one for five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> years in a cramped little bus i think uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think like aaron was especially saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely what makes a tour bus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> experience the best is if you have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a tour family quote unquote which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know like all of the other like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> producers and like tour people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming on with you like if you can vibe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with them yeah then it makes the tour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bus experience a million times better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so fingers crossed we have a nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tour family otherwise we're going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at each other's throats but um yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i guess like you know because we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chose the tour bus experience i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's you know for one i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you get to see more of america yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know because we're going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> driving from you know city to city and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff like that whereas like i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know if you fly you i feel like you miss </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of what goes on in between you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know yeah exactly because it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there there are some places where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people say they've visited but you've uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but really they've just visited like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> airport right you know and i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really count that or you like visited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the city yeah but like you haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really like actually seen outside of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cities of america and you know yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we're talking about america there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of outside the city let's be honest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys we're trash tastes we're here to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make america content right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're here to get the stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean we will be vlogging the entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing as well so you guys who aren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> attending the tour will you know still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> get something out of it hopefully i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think a lot of america is very similar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though like americans like to pretend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's very diverse but if you look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at like any pictures of any road in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> america they all look exactly the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> save it save it okay yes because because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can we we would be able to confirm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah yeah yeah i'm just saying this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> now let's see if i still feel this way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> keep the bar low so that when cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> things do happen we can be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just monstrosity gas stations that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massive they're like the middle of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> highway yeah because i've seen some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> them some of the dentist office yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in the middle of like guest stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's insane do you think people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to still be complaining about gas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> prices by the time we get there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's i i hope it is because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise i don't know how to talk to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people in the u.s that's that's my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> opening line every single time the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ultimate icebreaker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the american life hack if you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to start a conversation you just talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about gas prices it works every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> day and they're like oh thank god he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on my side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah i guess the other thing as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for you guys who have potentially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already bought tickets or are thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about buying tickets uh is uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we're going to be doing what can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do what can you expect what can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expect and you know obviously we don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to give too much away because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to you know keep an element of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> surprise for you guys who are actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming on tour but um let's just say it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> won't just be this it won't just be us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's not just a talk show yes it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a live podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if that's what you were thinking there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will be some of that there will be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit of talking yes just just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit of talking but if you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expecting some of the panels that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might have seen get leaked online from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like us at like ax </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or also like any other conventions that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've been to in the past few months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's going to be a bit more of like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be a bit of that but more crowd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interactions and more bringing what you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know trash taste for onto a live stage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah as much opportunity as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> opportunity to get you guys involved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with uh some of the [ __ ] that we get up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to on stage yeah so you guys won't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> merely just be sitting in the crowd you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know hopefully laughing to our [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jokes like you guys will actually be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> involved with the show yeah there'll be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> some segments where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of your interaction yes uh will be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> required and it should lead for some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting results because yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know because we're doing the show a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you know we're gonna be doing this 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times yeah we want it to be different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time yeah so one of the main </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasons that we decided we want to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much viewer interaction as possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that all right we want to make it so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that we don't get bored of teams yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that every single show is different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also can we try and like suss out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the segments i wonder if i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this the next time it'll it'll yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah exactly it'll it'll kind of be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a a growing theme for us as well with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every show as well so i did see a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people in the comments and stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that being like oh are they just going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to like talk on stage for now short </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> answer is no it'll be a lot more than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that basically if you've heard some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> our takes or some of the [ __ ] that we've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> said and you've ever wanted to clown on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us in real life this is probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> closest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is this is this is the closest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you're ever going to get because we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to give you that opportunity yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's all i'll say about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah i saw a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking like oh what's the how long do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you reckon the show is going to be uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still haven't like 100 percent decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the exact timing because we haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rehearsed it all yet no but we've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going through it we reckon it'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> around i don't know like hour 45 to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe just two hours yeah yeah so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know should be a good show yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i think we've been to like a few live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows in the past few months we went to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh mogul money live yeah at ludwig's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> live event as well and that definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taught us a lot because i was thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man two hours is just like a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste episode right i don't know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if that's like long enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like something special but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what i've realized being in a live show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you can't just pause the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the big thing i've noticed is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can't just pause trash taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just go off and do your own thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then come back you're going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting there for the full time and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there will be breaks maybe here and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there but we want to make the show as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entertaining as it possible for everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sitting down because it's not like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normal trash taste episode where you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just take breaks you know you can go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the toilet you can just put us on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> second monitor no we are main monitor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this time there is no other monitor okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> close those tabs there is only one tab </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's us i think as well uh one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other things is that uh [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> forgot what i was going to say and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had the thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i had it in the forefront of my head and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i threw my head off yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh uh i was going to say something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do with the show it was sent through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the show okay and i forgot oh one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> main things we i think we went into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when we planned out the show is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we understand that not every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single person who's gonna go to the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna be a gigantic trash taste fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yep we have kept in mind we just want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make a good show we didn't try to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it of like a complete fan service thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like if you want to just turn up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have hopefully a fun show should be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there yeah so if you you know say for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> example you're the only one in your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> friend group who watches and listens to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trash taste then there is i i think i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> would like to think that like we've kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of structured this show so that even if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have the bare minimum idea of who we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are and what this show is yeah you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hopefully still enjoy yourself yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should be able to yeah so you can bring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a plus one you know you can bring your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friend who has maybe not doesn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> anything about us and be like you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go watch three idiots on stage talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about some [ __ ] and do some fun stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's totally what it's gonna be yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah we want to we wanted this to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be as newbie friendly as possible like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all our content uh we just wanted to i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like we just wanted to be this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like trash tasters final form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like taking everything that we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> learned from the podcast from after dark </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah from touring around ultra instinct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is ultra instinct trash taste we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are taking trash taste and we're just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cutting off all the fat and we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> condensing everything that you love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about trash taste into this one show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um and and on top of that we got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> exclusive merch for it as well right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we do there is stuff that you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> get uh at the shows and only at the </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> that time maybe yes but no promises um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah go for it no no but all i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying was that you know hopefully this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will be an event that you guys you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it doesn't matter if you watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> us from day one or you just found us </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's all you want and for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone in everywhere else in the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just like kind of crying right now not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being able to come to the america show i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think for for all three of us this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like a litmus test yes um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we do i do want to travel to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> more places i do want to travel to more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> places across the world i mean i'd want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to travel to our home cities home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> countries go on represent our own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] regions right exactly exactly um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i think we are kind of using this tour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a barometer not only for how natural </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> barometer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we're using it as a gauge okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a gauge not only to see how much it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> affects our mental well-being doing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tour this intensive uh but just seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if this is financially viable to uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pursue visas and all the logistics in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other places that might be more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> difficult as well um so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> americans please show up because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might give the chance to uh other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from around the world to be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience what you're experiencing as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well yeah yeah and uh i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> basically everything we want to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like spoiler so if you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching uh this episode right now and </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> this is one of those things where we all </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> from traveling for about two and a half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> months i'm already [ __ ] knackered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> from traveling right sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah regardless of whether this tour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> does well or not and if we decide to do </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> like test a lot of little things to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if this tour would be possible one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was this intense travel schedule that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> had over the past three months to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like can we do this without going insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well it definitely [ __ ] burnt not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> burned me up but it definitely took a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> toll but it didn't make me go insane </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> 10 days mm-hmm don't be able to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anywhere that was worse though because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the car was tiny that's true at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the bus we can you know walk around yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have at least our own private </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> quarters but yeah i guess we should talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about the special after it's come out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just look forward to it yeah it's gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> be a good one yeah i'm i'm hoping that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my car sickness is better on a bus it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on a bus definitely yeah right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're in a [ __ ] freight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> train equivalent of a car like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're moving in a building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know because when you're in a tiny </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> car the back of the car gets [ __ ] with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suspension yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's you you get like thrown around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're on a bus it's so big did you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> motion sickness on a train </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no oh then you should be good okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember on the road trip there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot of downtime in the car and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like i could read manga or watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anime or play games and i like got read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one chapter of a manga and i'm like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't do that and basically it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of a lot of me just listening to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] music and uh just darling out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much i wish i could do more and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that's why it felt so exhausting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i wanted to do more stuff on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> car just to like chill out but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hopefully can do that on the tour bus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like communal space there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tables and stuff in the car it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever can fit on your lap is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> technically the table yep so that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also makes you just not want to work or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do anything like i just i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> comfortable this is awful the same thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on a plane right yeah yeah it's like an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> economy where you're like i'm gonna work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you'll realize your laptop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't even open up fully yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can't even like actually get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 90 degrees because the chair especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if the chair in front of you is leaned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> all the way back it's just like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah oh dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've got to say the worst flight i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> ever been on was the was the la to miami </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flight at like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh the economy flight yeah it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] awful yeah because like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> moment the flight hadn't even taken off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know you can't even like move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sorry we got one on like uh a detour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here no no no no no no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> welcome back to trash days yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually we're like a billion flights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so we've got the red-eye flight from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> la to miami and normally when you're on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a flight people wait until the plane is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in the air and the seat belt things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got off before they recline no not on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this flight it was just like immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sat down dude full reclined and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh this is going to be there like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this all right okay i saw i saw people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as they were walking up to their seats </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just grabbing the back of the seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> reclining it back and then sitting yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just like chill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we have six hours on this flight you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do it whenever it's a red-eye flight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah i assume people were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like these were seasoned veterans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm ready to sleep yeah i'd never been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a flight before people like everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was calling right before the moment of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> takeoff and the moment the plane touched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ground not even like a taxi or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything everyone's whipped out their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> phones started making calls and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't even notice that i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> notice that no because we landed in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> miami at like [ __ ] 5 30 in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> morning i'm just like struggling to open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my eyes so i just couldn't [ __ ] see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> anything yeah i don't know if i'm the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dumb one i probably am um but i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like stand up right away when the plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> takes the plane lands and in america bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a summoning salt video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were trying to like clip through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the chairs trying to get their luggage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out right away they'd be like holding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their luggage like this just to stand up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 10 minutes standing up on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first available frame </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sitting on the end and i can tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy next to me is visibly getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyed that i'm not standing up right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because we're in the back yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we're not going anywhere yeah yeah we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally are lashed to get on the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason i would stand up in a situation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like that is if my knees are killing me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which they were on that flight because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the seats were [ __ ] tiny so i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like i just need to [ __ ] stretch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out my legs yeah so then i'll stand up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for a bit you know maybe you know do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some exercise a little bit but then i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if i'm missing something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i don't know why people stand up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right away when there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe they think they can just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quickly [ __ ] go to the front yeah if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you're in a rush and you have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> connection i can kind of understand the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the you know the impatience but even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's like max you save a minute max </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because you got to wait until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the doors open anyway so you're going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> be standing up for like a good 5-10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes right yeah that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again that it's like you even if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stand up first and you're in the front </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're still not getting off until they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> open the goddamn doors like i get that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to get ready but you you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you can see the crowd moving you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> know it makes sense if you're in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> premium economy and you're at the front </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of the yeah yeah yeah because you also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have room then as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like in in economy you can see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where the line goes and people go in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> order anyway yeah right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you're sitting down you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's there's an order to this there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an order to this chaos otherwise there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't an [ __ ] like 10 seats back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being like out of the way out of the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you can't like yeah a fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would happen yeah yeah but even every it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter where i've gone in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world everyone every country does this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know why there's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people on the plane that stand up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately and they're like i'm getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off first and then max they save 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i mean if it's just purely uh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legs hurt i want to stand up all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's totally fine i get that but you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell who the the flight veterans are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they're the ones who usually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just remain seated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm lazy as [ __ ] i'm i'm if i have 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes left on my my netflix thing i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watching that until i get kicked off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what doesn't make sense is when people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do this on international flights right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you get up you save your 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seconds you're like [ __ ] yes i've saved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 seconds you've got to wait [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half an hour to get your bags anyway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it doesn't make any difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going to be leaving the airport </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the same time anyway that's true and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like customs as well you don't know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> long that's going to be i i honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just do it at a pure instinct </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't know i don't even think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it anymore i think i think for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for the most part i do it again not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because i want to get out of the plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly which i do but i know i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realistically going to for me it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i need to stretch my legs that's fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like because if it's i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because if i know it's taking a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because if i know it's taking a while </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll just sit back down yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like ah that's too early i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh damn i'm missing okay i will say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that on that one flight it had one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i'd never seen before and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that every flight should have this from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so right where the tv normally was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no tv on this on this flight but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know where it is right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so they had this thing that popped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out and it was a phone holder oh yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would it would have your phone you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> could just put your phone or ipad in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this thing and it would just be like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> love okay because i was about to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complain about one thing in every flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is uh now that we've flown so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> times within the past few months i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically seen every every movie i want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on like the flights right i know i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] catalogue i know the library </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay that is the most first world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problem ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's just like someone when you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> traveling for business there's no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entertainment left when when you've just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watched everything okay look i've look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's only so many times i can see the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> entire library of harry potter on there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and that one episode of [ __ ] hbo show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like i've wanted to load up my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> own season three episode four yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well on unlike some flights where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so like when you have to load up on your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> phone or an ipad or something you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh this is a great idea i can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> watch what i want but unfortunately the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] tray tables that come out means </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you have to like watch it like like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or you just put your phone flat on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> table and you just watch it like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> both are horrible for your neck yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly and i finished that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> plane at that plane flight with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] 80 year old neck and i have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i definitely need to visit a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> chiropractor afterwards because you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] your neck up you cannot [ __ ] get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the plane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay actually actually actually actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually question question what is your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guys's sleeping like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> economy oh bro i i look like i'm about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to like die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i like i like kneel over like i put my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> head but like between my legs if i can i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> saw you doing that on the on the florida </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flag like how the [ __ ] is he sleeping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like that i tried to because like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i thought you were throwing up no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> no i like because for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know why i just i i cannot sleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sitting up right i need to feel like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> head is resting on something like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like yeah at this i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm the same though maybe it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> pressure on my head kind of makes me i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know why no i'm the same i need to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like like i'm leaning on either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what i do is i take the you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seat at the back like the cushion thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of those cushion things you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of fold the edges yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that so what i do is i do that and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of yeah it doesn't doesn't work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that does that doesn't work but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the best we've got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now i got to work with what i've god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guys the reason i ask is because i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what it is about planes where any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other form of transportation you there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough room to get like a decent decent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleeping position i think i i can't i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> decent enough i'm i'm like i'm i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like wider than you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you call yourself dummy thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my frame is just larger like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taller but i have like a wider frame i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> swear that's like that it sucks because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're tall you can just like origami </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself into a position or right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my arms are gigantic right [ __ ] giant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> biceps right obviously you're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] arnold schwarzenegger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i got a dummy ass right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now because i have i have this dilemma </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right of like i need something to i need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be leaning my face like the sides of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my face on something to get even just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a tiny amount of sleep yeah so then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might be thinking well joey just sit on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the window seat because then you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just lean against the wall no that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't work my problem is that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> works except i have the bladder the size </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of a peanut and so i have to get up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every like hour or two to go to pee and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i need to sit on at least the aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seat because otherwise i just feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] horrible for the two other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people i'm sitting next to right so now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm stuck in this dilemma of like do i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> prioritize my bladder or do i prioritize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my sleep and most of the time i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> prioritize my bladder so i just have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] deal with this thing yeah see my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my plain sleep nerf because everyone has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a plain sleep nerf like a condition that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has to be met </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um is that my head needs to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beyond 45 degrees otherwise it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i'm actually like sleeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so when when i see people sleeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next to the window with their with their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heads on the window like i literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cannot get my head at a like a cute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough angle to like trick my brain into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking i'm going to understand that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's why i like leaning forward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like for me i think it's certain about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the pressure on my head or like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way that i don't know how the blood's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flowing yeah it makes me like it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> recreates how i sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not we're basically going to like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coma patient you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so the reason why i choose the aisle or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the window and i don't go for the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's because on the on the middle one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only place you can put your head why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you laughing so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i am a comatose patient just imagine the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one time like if connor ever gets into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like a plane crash and the pilot goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone regretted your brace position </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can literally fall asleep and he'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the brace position all right fall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> asleep in the race position okay that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's comfortable it makes sense the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why you're bracing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as i was saying before godly rudely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and if i lean in the middle i can only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go straight and my head will hit the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chair and i can't get my head into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> position i want because it's too close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i i can't just get it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough and it'll like push against my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> neck yeah if i if i do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i have to do the window because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> window the thing that the downtown by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the window right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that uh there's a little gap between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the window and the chair yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i put my head in that little </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crevice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so as long as the guy behind me doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> randomly like try to tickle my head i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good and i do the same thing on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> aisle but the problem is if you do on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the islands risky because if they bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the car they wake you up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when i said i lean on the window i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously meant that the crack between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the window and the seat belt so you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going forward so same as me no no i lean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of back oh into that crate oh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lean forward into the crack yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like really forward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i would not want to sit in front of you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because then if i look this way it'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just be like god feels so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in between the cracks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that'd be horrifying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone who sits in front of conor gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> them gets a gets a viewing of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> shining yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it pretty much imagine looks like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't turn around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how often are you looking in that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] crevice behind you well you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you might you know because sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're sitting on the window seat the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> window can be positioned a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> far back than what is normal so you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if your window's like back here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you just look good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're being a little embarrassed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a good sleep i'll tell you i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> take i'll take this how the [ __ ] do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep like that again i don't know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> have wouldn't it make more sense to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it on the back side i i can't like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> can't sleep lying down like like face uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back down yeah and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reclining the chair is just a beta </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> version wait how do you sleep normally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh on my sides </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh so you can't sleep on your back i i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep no i've never been able to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with my back really so i sleep on my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> side but like i want to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's my side but my body is very much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> leaning towards my stomach the face of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the bed all right right kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah actually just exactly how like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cat yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay yeah i've tried the coma strap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's some times where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't go overseas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i've tried and that's where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like being tall is enough because i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never like i can never get my body into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> enough of a position where because when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i try to lean forward yeah this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the this is like the most forward i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can go right i can't even get close like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the trait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even when all right even when say for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> example you do have enough space to just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be able to squeeze in to lie on the tray </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> table yeah my back just [ __ ] no i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't i don't like my trade table on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's even further down yeah doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that [ __ ] you back up uh maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i sleep so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] hell your knees yeah jesus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> christ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i put my arms on my knees as a pillow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm i feel i'm trying to i'm trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember i feel more worried about your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no that would kill me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> no the end of your knees you're on your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thighs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> try it i'm going to lean back try it try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think i can even do this because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i've i've i have a couple of friends who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have slept like they're just like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no my back the shinji position my back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just the permanent shinji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like are you asleep or depressed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'll never tell you stretch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i i got another 5 10 and i was like stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> stop stop going stop stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bro so the coma strat is a backup strat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the cop is risky because like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're rash putting your head in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the crevice and you're relying on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crevice right yeah right and you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're playing shakes it's not as not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as bouncy as your bones right the shinji </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strat is only open to those on the five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> terms yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just it's locked for us it's locked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> discovered that the american airlines uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chairs are really [ __ ] close together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to like because i've done it a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch in japan on the domestic a a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flight and i noticed you we have way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more room on those domestic economies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right than the american airlines </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one that was [ __ ] close those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> american airline flights are so goddamn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compact yeah yeah yeah i'm not [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> around yeah any closer and i'd be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kissing the person in front of me yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like pretty much the head yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hope you're having a good flight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but that that red-eye flight to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> miami was rough yeah i mean you know i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> glad we still did it because we got to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do the uh the ludwig barrier cut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> tournament yeah yeah so so super fun we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> did the ludwig bureau car which is mario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kart double dash but you can't drive um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you have to down a b you have to you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't drive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't drink and drive because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> illegal and that's bad yeah but you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to down your beer either before you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> start driving or any point when you stop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if your car still completely stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so we really wanted to do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh ludwig said that it would start 2 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> p.m and our flight was at 3. there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no way we could do it so we moved it to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a 9pm flight so we could make it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> right um but that flight was brutal that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was horrible yeah because we got to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> miami at i think it was like five or six </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we and that was the first day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of the convention as well so we had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> signing from 1 p.m that day so we got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> luckily though the airport and the hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were staying at were pretty close it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like 15 20 minute driveway uh so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just literally just got to miami got to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the hotel slept for as long as we could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then immediately headed to the con </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that was still a chill con i enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah miami was a really cool place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i thought miami was really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> beautiful um obviously i wish i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wish we had more time to actually kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of explore miami yeah yeah cause i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna ask because i've never been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> florida before um like how was florida </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in general did you meet florida man did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you meet luckily luckily not luckily not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> people were more chill in florida than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> la i think i feel like it was um the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> food was really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> food the cuban restaurant was insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> human food was nutty my god we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up there we were so full so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so much so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> much uh like peruvian food another day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was really good yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah approved that hummus they made this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was insane remember that peruvian so did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you only stay there for the weekend of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the convention uh yeah yeah yeah we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> landed on the the first day of the con </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we left the morning of the day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> after yeah it was good though i mean i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd like to go back to miami at some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point and just be a tourist yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also there's a lot of old people in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> miami i didn't notice that yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't as young as i thought it would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i guess it's a lot of old people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> retiring i guess yeah so i saw a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 60 year old looking men that were bronze </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with with uh with six-year-olds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> permanently who were bronze as well and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so is this is miami just a glorified </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> retirement home that's why all the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buildings are really bright it's so that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can find the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no but miami was really fun it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> too humid though oh it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it was basically japan wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk to me about humidity right now guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically what you're feeling here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is what it was like in my mind it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too much it was pretty brutal yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just wish i had enough time to like go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to the beach or you know even go to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pool or anything but like i didn't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> have enough time to do that we were just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tired as well because we've been in la </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a month we were in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before so i think you're just dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just so dead yeah yeah i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well we did get the taste of la life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how did you feel because we actually i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this so what we did was you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> currently in the la arc on trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um and we what we did was we rented out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an airbnb and we used it as a studio but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also it was kind of like our first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience living with each other as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of living with each other sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a disney show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just a couple of friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just filming some videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what will they get up to yeah we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> basically just made a trash taste house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know because everyone in l.a thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we already lived next to each other or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that wasn't the case in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] we live actually pretty far away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from each other like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> close enough that we can get to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> office but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not close enough where we could easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make content with each other like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone else does in l.a games yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't live together so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly exactly uh yeah and i i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a [ __ ] like a [ __ ] blast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly living with the boys it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> really really fun but i feel it was fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of the time limit that we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like if you told me you know no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> offense to you boys but like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> applies i feel with anybody yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not like your significant other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever if you lived for long enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with each other i feel like you're going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be [ __ ] sick of each other and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel that's why a lot of content houses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't work out in the long run </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because it's like it's it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> honeymoon period to begin with but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the longer you're with together you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i kind of value my privacy as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i might have my own room but it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quite the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> another thing i noticed as well is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if we did have a trash taste house like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a trash taste content house i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i'd get anything done no because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these boys are distractions like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally normally i want to hang out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally i go i i wake up go to my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> office i'm like great work starting you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know catch up to emails or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this time i go up go to the living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> see mailing or jerry up and i'm like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you what are you up to what are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you up to what do you just like have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> breakfast and chat for about three hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah just things just go slower because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're talking to other people yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like whereas maybe i get lunch and i eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in 10 minutes so i go right back to work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at my house yeah lunch becomes like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour and a half yeah exactly exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's good though i think is this the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first time i've gone to la where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went with the like express purpose of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to make like as much content as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was really fun because i there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no days where i wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh doing hanging out with someone or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making something and so it was really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> satisfying because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for me it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i feel like i get my battery recharged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through making content um yeah i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] addicted to making like youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right here yeah so like for me it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if i'm not doing that it's like oh i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm like oh i want to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something yeah i want to film something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was like a whole month of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being creative and getting to perform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting to go on stuff it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> great you are you are truly a shining </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> beacon for content creators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i think people are like oh dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like no dude i [ __ ] love this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like this is what i'm addicted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know why like i love being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on i love being on [ __ ] shows i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doing events like yeah yeah it did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly like la did constantly feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you were filling up a progress bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like something in terms like content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or connections or projects or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if even if we weren't like actively </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> filming something every day but even so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i still felt like i was way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distracted in la than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i would normally be at home yeah i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there were just like too many nights </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when like most or all of us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> were just like hanging out for the night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i was just like i could be in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> room streaming or making content but i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rather just go out onto the balcony and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just chill with everyone yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there'd be so many times where i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i could just set up a like we had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bare bones basic stream set up in one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the rooms and i was like i got time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream but joey's out there chilling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe maybe i'll go chill with joey for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a bit and then i'll just have like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quick five minute chat and then we'll go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stream and then seven hours later </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the five minute chat turns into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like half an hour then we've got to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lunch and then you know we're meeting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone in like an hour so i'm like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess i can't stream you know yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would i might my main channel would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> non-existent yeah if we had a trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste house i feel yeah i can see why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are so many streamer houses now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know living your life is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just [ __ ] content at that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty much uh and if you if i had to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like actively go out and make the kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of content i do my main channel that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just wouldn't [ __ ] happen if we had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> trash taste house no i'm not yeah these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boys are too much fun yeah exactly it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was just very motivating though yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i got very motivated oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely to make more stuff and push </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> push it i'll shout out to ludwig always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the inspiration yeah he was so nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i can love that guy yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like he's my long-lost american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disconnected from that i honestly feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> most if not all the like new and old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> faces we met up in l.a were just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really nice people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know and yeah no it is true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i always get a massive kick of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inspiration out of like hanging out with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who perhaps i've never met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before but i know their content or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know some other content creator i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get to see or talk too often and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like conventions for me are the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same thing as well just like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being in a convention setting which we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were a lot this past couple of months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like it's like oh yeah this this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why i do this like this is this is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is just motivating me to like do better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for these people you know yeah um yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no so it's good i i mean you know i may </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> necessarily motivated while we were in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> la or while we were traveling but after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i came back to japan i had like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] list of ideas so you know that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's always good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like it's important for every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> content creator to get their content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> battery recharged and i feel like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best way to do that is just to hang out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hanging out with other like creative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people because so many ideas get thrown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around and you're like damn all right i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could actually do this all right i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got so many ideas now whereas if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just sitting in a room just constantly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pumping out content it kind of like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just get into a grind and you get into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's monotonous yeah it does get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monotonous a lot of times and you forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why you started doing this in the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place and one thing i will say about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hanging out with so many people in la so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> many other content creators is that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely gets those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creative juices flowing again yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely yeah especially seeing some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of the like seeing the what motivates me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the most is seeing other people do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> something exciting yeah because then i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like damn i want to do something yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this looks [ __ ] incredible exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and la is just like the central hub of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um but yeah aside from that there were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was i mean did you guys enjoy your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> experience in la overall oh yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] loved it yeah me personally yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i enjoyed la i think because of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the people i got to see yeah if i if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't get to see anyone and i was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> living in l.a you know without ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interacting with other content creators </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah just because like i don't think the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> la lifestyle necessarily meshes with me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i i [ __ ] hate the lifestyle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but when i was there i had like an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing time oh yeah yeah definitely um </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> dude you remember this do you remember </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> i think i think on like the third day or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that we all arrived together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we wanted to go to one italian but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like uh it was like a saturday was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh look at the bapo we were originally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> going to go to boca de beauvo because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] love it but yeah yeah as god was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> saying it was a weekend so we were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a book of the pepper is probably going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to be really [ __ ] crowded so let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> find one on the way and then we found </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this uh one italian place i don't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> remember that it was like family earned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we thought oh that'd be that'd be good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to support a local business yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and maybe we shouldn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> how do i regret it yeah i forgot like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the one golden rule of like like how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> judge a restaurant which is if it's peak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time on saturday and you go in and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost empty that's that's a bit that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a big red flag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> also to do with this restaurant i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been told this and i come from japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right if a restaurant has four stars in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> google </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it must be good yeah exactly good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly apparently in america if it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> not higher than 4.5 it's dog [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i've been told really that's what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was told is it the 4.5 4.5 is apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the like if it's higher than that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can you know it's good right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't maybe americans are just nicer do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people just rate in america four stars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if the food is edible i i don't know so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember when we got there like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we got absolutely scammed right away oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all coming so we pull up into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's clear parking spots right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so and there's valet though there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> valet parking right no one is here no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one is in this restaurant this may be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we should have turned back at this point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly yeah so we go in the we gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start parking our car and this guy comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over and he knocks on the window he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh uh valet service eight dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we we i think we misunderstood that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he we thought that he was like oh you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to pay it right right but i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was you offering it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we were like oh okay so then we get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out the car hand him the eight dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he literally just continues backing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it up into the spock and gets out and is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like all right there you go he was he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was probably in the car for about eight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ten seconds ten seconds like ten seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tops that man got the biggest conversion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of time to to payment uh and known in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> history it's like those memes of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bill gates when he drops a hundred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> dollars on the floor it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was literally the car was basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parked and then he just went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i couldn't believe this man took our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money i couldn't believe he was still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> willing to take dollars for that i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like only and only in the us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am i if this happened in the uk fist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> would be thrown if you try to get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eight dollars off of me it just wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work that's why we don't have valet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> parking but that wasn't that wasn't the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only thing yeah yeah yeah so that set </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the tone yeah that definitely said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the red flag i think all of us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> were just like we we all stood there and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we were just like we just got robbed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah we we this is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't believe you've done this yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we uh immediately go into this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant after losing eight dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then afterwards we go in it looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty it looks like a pretty decent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant um and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> say something yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't like it when restaurants do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is just for me preference i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand that people don't care if i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in an italian restaurant and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to like set an ambiance don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] play an mlb game in the corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a giant monitor like i'm sorry to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that's not the italian vibes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are ruined but there was just like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giant sports games and they were just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> playing the audio and i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also there was a very american looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> bar in the middle yeah yeah yeah well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's fine i don't care about the bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being in the middle right i just it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it's got a mood i think it's i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's the bar in combination with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dmob on the screen that just made a very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> non-attack yeah it was like two giant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 50 inches on the wall blasting this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audio and you're just like eating your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing and you're saying and that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strike and that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like ah this is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what am i am i crazy like is this weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is weird right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i i get you i get you because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't like that in restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either where they play a game or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that okay yeah at a bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i get it i get it it's a bar yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's the time in a place it's a bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a bar this is this is a restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i i would prefer to you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have some music and uh just have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that set this thing up if you went on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> date there you would look bad that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what i'm saying yeah ambiance would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> already make it look you're in a rough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> spot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> better make up for it yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone ordered their food and of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course of course i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i gotta try the lasagna all right all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because i i think that's my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> default thing i order every italian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant that's like that's how i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gauge how good the rest of the italian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food is right because you'd have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try an italian would have to try really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hard to [ __ ] up a lasagna sure because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there are way more like complicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dishes in the italian cuisine so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always rewarded lasagna um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i will say the guy did look a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> panicked when you ordered the lasagna he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like oh that one yeah he was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh you're ordering that one i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's been a while since i've had lasagna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and of course it it comes out and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably been an order it's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been a while since they ordered this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it comes out and i'm just like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks it looks a little soggy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks like a little bit of a soggy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lasagna it was it was something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what 20 something dollars yes like 20. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like this but it wasn't like a giant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> piece either no no no no normal size </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a 28 like but like all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dishes in that restaurant were about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah they're all at least 20 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dollars eight dollars quite a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> money it's a lot of money um and i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i put my fork into it and it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] this this pasta just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disintegrates right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this thing wasn't made out of pasta it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was made out of air and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i've never seen pasta so soft </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life yeah and i take it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i take like my first bite and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you can immediately immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell that you're just going to have the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst meal of your life yeah so god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looks so disappointed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone everyone was like staring at me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i because they were so excited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like oh go and order lasagna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> let's see let's see what he thinks about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it i take one spoonful i think my face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conveyed everything that needed to be i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wish i had taken a photo of the face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you had made because it was like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you looked up disappointment in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dictionary that was the face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the first bite first of all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pasta was soggy all of it was soggy yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it somehow even though the pasta even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the lasagna was like full of tomato </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sauce somehow they've made tomato taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing taste of nothing like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know how you make tomato taste of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing because it just it was cold on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the inside right as well and and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called it was so obviously microwaved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah as well because the hot the outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was super super hot but then the inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was lukewarm and i was just like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is yeah to the restaurant's credit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dish was actually pretty decent i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i would have like a uh a lamb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pasta it was pretty good actually yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like uh i like a gnocchi i think which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like it wasn't the best gnocchi i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> had but it was it was decent i know you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should you get lasagna to see if the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant's good yeah i feel in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i get the calamari that's how i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> normally tell because the calamari is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one of those dishes where it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really easy to buy it frozen yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just deep like chuck it in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deep fryer yeah just call it a day but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like if they actually care you can tell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's it's fresh and it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] rubbery and then you know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything else could be good because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a very specific thing that you'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to go out of your way to make sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fresh that's true that's true that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was bad i mean like it wasn't worth the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> money it was just too expensive it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so expensive it was yeah it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely i mean the gnocchi was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decent but i would not pay the amount i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> paid for it yeah yeah i mean like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my biggest pet peeves when i go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a restaurant is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i like as someone who grew up in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole restaurant kind of like area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do you sh if you can't make a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dish don't put it on the menu like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what i mean like there are some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurants i go to where they give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the menu and it's just the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> history of your country's cuisine i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there is there is no [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you can cook all of these dishes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and like a good kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like 200 items on the menu it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are you sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like i get it if there's that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy comes to your [ __ ] restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just like oh why don't you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this dish that everyone else has you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i'm just like you know [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] you know just serve good just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> serve the dishes that you know you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cook really really well five to ten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> items i feel is like i feel a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> middle ground because it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maine's yeah okay like five to ten mains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i think is like the good middle ground </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like you know those five to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ten mains are gonna slap we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another italian place that was really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good around the same price and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing oh yeah so good oh yeah the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we went with uh yeah yeah amazing and it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was i think it was around the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> prices for like everything yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought wow okay well so it isn't just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm i'm being cheap it's like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these are the same prices we just got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ripped off in this one yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how it is and that made me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand more like when i went to more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> independent uh restaurants and more uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee places a lot of the time i kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of understand why a lot of people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want that familiarity of a chain well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what you get because it's such </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a gamble in the u.s oh like oh it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gamble everywhere yeah but like in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you you gotta be pretty unlucky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you talk about the us being a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gamble let's talk about the [ __ ] uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk's are sad this is the same though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is why like restaurants in the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like and cafes like a lot of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> independent ones struggle because a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of people don't like they want that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> familiarity yeah and they want like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know when you go to a [ __ ] wendy's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know exactly what you're getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure yeah whereas if i go out of my way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i take a date i pay a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> money and i get half-assed meal pasta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like [ __ ] i should have just gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> olive god like i know what i would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got yeah yeah cause we we talked about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the us having like the 4.5 google </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reviews kind of meta the uk just doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a meta when it comes to google </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reviews you just like people in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know how to review food that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just the end or be all the water </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was not spicy five stars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because i've been to restaurants in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uk that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> seven four point eight i'm like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this place must absolutely slap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like really there are some places that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are out there like the ratatouille </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> critic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm about to end this restaurant's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> career </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hold my pen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to be fair to be fair i've like see in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recent years especially this trip i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discovered way more decent restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in the uk that i that i had that i did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than before i moved out of the uk i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think that i think the uk have just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely upped their restaurant game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah because i don't know what you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> experienced beforehand but this was the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> first time for me that i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explore explored london and like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> food culture surrounding and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is what are people complaining about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is actually pretty decent maybe i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just got lucky i don't know but yeah we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just have it we just steal other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people's food and uh you know that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean australia kind of does the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thing yeah we don't have like a cuisine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like what do you want like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably someone here who makes it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> church do you want like new zealand rat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember when we went to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uk i think maylin landed and i think two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> days after she landed she'd had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> four meals and she'd message me being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in all caps do reviews not mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you know who to trust how do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know which google review to trust and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like do you review things i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> remember i review things really oh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never i never even looked at google </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> reviews before i moved to japan oh okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i just looked at something and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like oh that looks like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couple of photos i'm like yeah that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> good i review things i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like me are keeping society </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> together without me there won't be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so much chaos how will everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what did you always review though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i've been doing it for a long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time okay so before you move to japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah before i move to japan because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i understand the culture here because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you review something it means something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here yeah you throw you throw a review </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the in the uk google reviews it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a message and you throw a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] message in the bottle into the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sea like it's not gonna reach anyone man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a message in dark souls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i am guilty though of the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> five-star one-stop meta i am guilty of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what do you mean i'm either a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five-star guy or a one-star guy you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never rated anything three stars no i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have i just like in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if something's three a lot of the time i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to go back and confirm it's a three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but also why would i want to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back to the three because you're kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> indifferent to it right yes i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah whatever yeah yeah and like some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> places i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a lot of the times i've gone to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurants i've ordered one thing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like and then for some reason i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gone back and i've got a different dish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like oh oh this is just this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much better this dish like i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen to get the dish that they do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poorly right you could argue that that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like reflective on them and they that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they shouldn't put it on the menu it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> better whatever but i feel like it can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vary so much whereas like if you have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five-star time you're like everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was perfect it was amazing staff were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing ambiance oh everything was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing right all right well five stars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where on the on the inverse side where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like if it was all [ __ ] i i knew it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was all [ __ ] right she's terrible so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just nip it back yeah so i never go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and give it one starts right right but a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of the times i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the places i go to in japan are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> purely off recommendations yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i kind of normally go to places that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've always really liked i've not gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to many places that i haven't enjoyed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan yeah because everyone is always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is my favorite restaurant so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go tricks i'm like oh it must be pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good i mean yeah at the end of the day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> word of mouth i think is the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> effective way of finding oh dude yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly some play some places in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't even on google reviews or they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not they're not on it if you just search </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurants near me or something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah next kind of restaurant i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for sometimes you have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really really look uh and that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> word of mouth means so much here in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese food culture because people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> follow what other people say and if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see a huge line at a japanese restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know that [ __ ] [ __ ] slaps even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though i never think it's worth waiting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> an hour for any meal in my life sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sure [ __ ] that yeah i'll go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mcdonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not waiting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of waiting well outside of a restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah 20 minutes tops i'm not doing more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah for me it's like no more than 30. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think 30 minute is the absolute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> limit it really depends like okay if we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have like 20 people and they say 30 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes i'm like we're waiting 30 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes we're not gonna find somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else so it's like but if it's just me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone else 20 minutes tops yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's going to be a restaurant i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's true otherwise i'm like 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because it could just be a huge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> waste of time and the food is kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> mediocre yeah i'd rather just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere if like if you're in an area </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where there's a bunch of restaurants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> nearby i'd rather just go somewhere else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just the name yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's true yeah one one one small thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that annoyed me in some of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurants we found in l.a was that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know sometimes we were in a group we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to go out have a nice meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> together all right let's phone up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant and book a table you find out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the restaurant they're like we don't do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bookings yeah it's like a thing in l.a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right turn up in the door and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah a lot of the restaurants we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't accept i never understood why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the case is it so to avoid people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> flaking out i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i there must be some math behind it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where someone has worked out that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can make more money and get more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> customers in the door by doing it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> turn up right because if they're full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can't reserve then you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to show up but maybe you want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go maybe they can squeeze you in if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's two of you right i feel like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for the restaurants that are in really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> high demand it must make more money yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because you can get more customers in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah people are willing to wait 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 15 minutes at the door right right so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel for like yeah like what was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like sugar fish whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sugar fish was one of them there was i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we went to the first italian restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we went to before we found the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> italian restaurant yeah yeah yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was that was the biggest thing because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also when you when you go one day and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't get in you're like i should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> come back again because clearly it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good everyone's waiting and and to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fair the restaurants where i did have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait we're pretty damn good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i feel like yeah it's a strategy to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just make more money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also you don't have to deal with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> reservations not showing up yeah i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think that makes more sense to me than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because you you lose money right if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> serve a table and they don't show up or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they show up 20 minutes late or 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes late or they show up 20 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> early and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not ready basically they've just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> min maxed restaurants right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but but you know when there's a group of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like four or more preserving is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing because it's like we know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we can turn up at this time and we'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good and japan's great for that that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why i love japan yeah because you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reserve any or most places except except </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for a danny's it's not it's not even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan in most places in the world i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> been to there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most restaurants do reservations and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three two to like i've okay let me let </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me rephrase that i've never seen this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> system ever anywhere outside of l.a i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never have you ever seen it anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of valley i'm sure it's in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> new york a place like that you call them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up and they they say no reservation yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's places that just don't take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> responsibility well other than like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> other than like [ __ ] mcdonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the restaurant meter mcdonald's every </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> all right the restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for families i guess so yeah because you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know because you know throwing it back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to the time we tried to reserve for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like we don't take </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> like but i mean you at least you got to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience melbourne yeah yeah because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after the uh after smash tour and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> traveled to melbourne because we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some uh i have some family there who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never visited in australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was [ __ ] fantastic because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they live right like they live more on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the outskirts of melbourne they live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> near yarra valley which is basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a bunch of [ __ ] wineries so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was me and sydney just had a whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] field day just going around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wineries one day they took us around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you're engaging in an australian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> activity yeah yeah that is yeah wineries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is an australian activity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly how could i complain when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like what we did to to be showing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around was being shown around a bunch of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wineries and just trying a bunch of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] wines beaches wineries and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> breweries that's just australia saw some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh saw some kangaroos on a golf course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that was weird oh yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> got to i went up to like little baby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kangaroos you can like pet them and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff yeah it was fun yeah yeah joey's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah little girl yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing kangaroo i've never heard that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing kangaroos like up close in real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life for the first time um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just made me like just confirmed with me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how [ __ ] batshit natural selection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was in australia like i just what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] happened to natural selection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> australia i don't get it that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens when you have a server </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely isolated from any other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> server sure like even just looking at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kangaroos right i'm like how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what what what happened in the history </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of kangaroos to lead your evolution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know basically everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else in the world because what i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized is that kangaroos are basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just australian deers right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're basically just australian deers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but like in every other in in every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other side of the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animals just decided okay four legs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walking on four legs that's the meta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the most effective meta and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the way in [ __ ] australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kangaroos are like that's just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bounce everywhere right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> does not even [ __ ] walk let's bounce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everywhere like what the [ __ ] happened i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mean if you're talking about dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] evolution the koala is like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> king of like [ __ ] stupidity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you hear like when i did the irl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream we got to hear about the koalas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and literally every single koala </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attribute had like 20 caveats right they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> were like so goddamn dumb they all they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could only eat one [ __ ] plant yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eucalyptus tree and the best part is is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that if you take the eucalyptus leaf off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the tree they don't know what it is yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like i can't eat this yeah what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this what's this leaf what is it what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know what this is they don't eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it how how and also the reason why they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep for 16 hours a day is because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> toxins and the eucalyptus leaf basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> act the same way that marijuana does to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> humans so they're just stoned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what i realized koalas just are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just the [ __ ] stoners of the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they're just stoner bits yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all they are and the babies have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to eat the mom's poop right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i found this out at the smash con </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> panel where koalas have to like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> koalas are born the mum needs to eat the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eucalyptus leaves and [ __ ] it out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right because the because the baby's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stomach isn't strong enough to break </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down the toxins of the eucalyptus tree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's technically toxic yeah how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] did this animal survive in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia one of the most dangerous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> places in the world in terms of wildlife </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how how the [ __ ] does that happen you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know like they literally lucked out by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting all their points into cuteness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if humans didn't exist they'd be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> man oh yeah absolutely cuteness only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from a distance though because like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know if you ever got like did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever get to get like really close to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> quality yeah i got to touch it does it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> not smell like [ __ ] oh yeah they all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> smelled really good they smell [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> horrible actually yeah yeah well yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they they're literally born eating [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so of course they're gonna smell like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] as well like there are a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maintenance to keep them happy i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well yeah otherwise they just die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like ah [ __ ] it i'll die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah guess i'll die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally they will they're too stoned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to care man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like you guys didn't even get to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see like the truly weird animals that we </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> like you don't get a knife and fork </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which i'm fine with i'm fine with i just </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> us like two moist towelettes and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like rationing them while trying to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this full like quarter chicken right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was no seasoning on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chicken and this thing was bone dry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right bone with a capital b dry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right no no no no because the soup was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just tomato soup and it was like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exact kind of like you know that if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to mass manufacture tomato soup </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> my credit card just in case need to buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something i put it in and then only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after i go into security </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah my id was in that bag and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely forgot to bring my id </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we go up we go up and it's it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's actually pretty chill right it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not like we got grilled or anything like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they just you know they just ask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for id </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so i tried to explain that you know </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> and so and so they were like do you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any kind of form of id on you that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can take at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like i look at him then i was just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> but i have a wikipedia article </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i have a favorite should we do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were like oh are you serious </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> there's some mileage out of it you know </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> i was desperate for a [ __ ] beer okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i because the reason is we once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we went in we couldn't go back out so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was no way i would i thought there </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> money not these [ __ ] tickets of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> course of course yeah i guess i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the medieval times one was good in </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> should definitely go next time yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going back to australia though one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i did notice uh hanging out with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australians is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australian sarcasm is just on a level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've never seen before okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because how sir because here's the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you guys are constantly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> looking for the next target to prank and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you never talk about this verbally but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as soon as you say as soon as someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> makes up a lie or jokes about someone or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about something to a foreigner or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something everyone just univer everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in australia universally agrees to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in on this joke oh yeah yeah right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why like one thing i didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> understand before going to australia is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like why every australian just agreed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> try to trick the world about drop bears </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which uh what what is like the drop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bear law what do you mean trick they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> real </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy this guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like they pretend like people live in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right you all would live in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] house no one lives there it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> simulation so when i saw this happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first hand yeah it was uh we did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream in australia where like we found </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> out what tim tam slams were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that was my favorite thing we found </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out what happened uh we found out what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> team time slams were so tim tam slams uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so tim tams are kind of biscuits in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> australia like a chocolate biscuit yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like two uh two biscuits with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a chocolate filling and what happens is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you bite you bite off two corners and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you put it in tea or coffee or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever and then you suck out the uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liquids literally no point in doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah absolutely no there's no benefit to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> either the drink i think i think you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> have to know how to do it in order to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> get a visa yeah australia but um yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's definitely on the citizenship test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's for sure but we did it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're you know because we're on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australia set and the the live stream we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> did was australia theme so they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh let's just get the boys to do a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> team team slam exactly completely failed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at it yeah um but one person who wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were we had a panel together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone asked us on stage if we'd done a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tim tam slam and obviously me and me and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> connor had just done one so we said yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sydney's like what's a tim tam slam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for some reason as soon as she said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone every australian perks up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was just like this is this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> content right here this is content right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here and then so joey jokingly says okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so what happens in australia when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get a pack of tim tams is you just slam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it on the floor and you just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slam it uh until it's [ __ ] until it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crumbs and you eat the crumbs and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the tim tam slam yeah right and then you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know and and you know uh the crowd and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the the emcee were all just like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that's he's right and the thing is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me being british i was like they said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that so sarcastically yeah of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sydney's never going to fall for that so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my mind i was like i thought sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got the joke yeah i thought sydney had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotten the joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> she didn't really question it she was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just kind of like oh okay yeah okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after this the next day we all had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> signing together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone in sydney signings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brings her a pack of tim tams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then she go and then he goes oh do </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it was so funny i was impressed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god that the australia chose one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the most boring [ __ ] food items to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like their mascot like it's literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just a chocolate biscuit and it's a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very ordinary chocolate tasting biscuit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like you guys can't talk you you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> chips and a fried fish listen the uk is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not any better right but i expected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better from australia because you had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do-over you got to do it right and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> were like oh let's just get the generic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ash chocolate biscuit which we have we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have tin times in the uk they're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called [ __ ] normal chocolate biscuits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we have the exact same type of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> biscuits we just don't care because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're nothing special but yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australia decided oh this is gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our thing and you go to the airport and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's tim tam themed in the gift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> section like this is [ __ ] yeah no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just no it's because it's it's because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the most uh non-challenging food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> item that any foreigner from any country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can be like yes that's good that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acceptable i like chocolate i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> biscuits right like it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> difficult to be like you know oh so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> australia we have this thing called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vegemite and we have this part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's good and we have this party food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> called fairy bread uh favorite [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly right it's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> two opposites right here but i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone of any palette can agree that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah [ __ ] who doesn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chocolate biscuits </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't like drinking biscuits well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a you problem everyone else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone else likes chocolate biscuits </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that's why we used it as like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> marketing method as a kid i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate tasting stuff and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what happened as i got older i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> felt that chocolate tasting things just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taste bad and like really artificial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost i don't know why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's not because a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> times you melt chocolate in it or just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> put chocolate i don't know why i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i i'll i'll admit that i don't eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as much chocolate as i used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely i can't eat as much chocolate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like physically because i start to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get sick but like i'm not i'm too sickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to go as far as to say that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> will just pass up chocolate at any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> chance i can get like normal chocolate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like chocolate bars i'm there but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate flavored things it'll be </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> i have a feeling you've said an opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about chocolate where you were praising </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like chocolate flavored things in a part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i'm just tripping maybe our </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> i'm not trying to say this i'm trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comprehend this is not one of my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opinions where i'm like i believe that </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> definitely 100 understand my like i get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it that oh don't worry we're not this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> could definitely be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the weird opinion why is so much dust in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front of me what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> happened just like sneeze getting that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dust particles in my face yeah so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think here there's dust in my face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my oxygen has been compromised but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] dust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah no i i i just think vanilla is an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing flavor um of course you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's just too sickly for me i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know that that's not normal though i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> know that's me yeah okay look don't give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> her like i understand the point of too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> much chocolate it gets me sick right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we think but that's a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sweet things like too much vanilla will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make me sick as well i will say one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my favorite desserts is uh sticky toffee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> pudding that's good though that's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more i like it when you have the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chocolate stuff with like a big like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sauce or something to help with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flavor like a chocolate sauce for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> instance no no chocolate sauce on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chocolate is [ __ ] disgusting that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way too much well that's that wouldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that be like a chocolate lava cake like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't like those no no actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're okay it depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a few bites like one or two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> again it's a sickly thing it's not it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> not a taste thing it's a sickly thing so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> are you like this with any other sweet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things or is it just specifically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate sticky toffee pudding is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way more sickly than anything chocolate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's why you have the vanilla ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cream to neutralize it you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> mean yeah okay so are you the same with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vanilla ice cream for instance like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you eat enough vanilla ice cream will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you get some no i can i can go to town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on vanilla ice cream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that was our same brain cells just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> firing off being like yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh connor has an opinion again yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it is it's the slow head zone of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> excuse me i i i'm sure there are some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> other people out there who think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate is too sickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no i agree with you on chocolate beans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's actually like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's actually that's actually a common </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of chocolate is very very heavy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the problem tastes right is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if my opinion is a general </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shed opinion and you two are just clowns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a bit of both i think we're all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clowns here that's a bit of a point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the point of it you can't just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dismiss every chocolate item aside from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate bars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh what was the [ __ ] fountain what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the lava cake whatever yeah lava </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate cake right great example one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bite god tier i love that [ __ ] it tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great mm-hmm two bites i'm like oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> god i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why literally you use the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strat as you do with the sticky toffee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pudding you never have a chocolate lava </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cake by itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or ice cream or a whipped cream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> toffee sauce is a game changer yes i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just love toffee toffee's great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i like i i hate toffee for the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> reason you hate chocolate stuff because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly yes way too sickly i like i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like caramel stuff it's a weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one because i know i i especially on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this chocolate thing i contradict myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot yeah so it's very much dish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> dependent i i get you on the fact that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like too much chocolate is sickly but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like that with all sweet things not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just chocolate like if i eat enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] strawberry flavored ice cream or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like vanilla rice like for me i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll get sick i think chocolate ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cream has got to be like bottom tier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] f tier it's like one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> ones no strawberries bought them too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> strong okay okay strawberry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do we agree boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> strawberries strawberry ice cream unless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they they use like god tier fresh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strawberries and it's made up yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's never i know it's never done no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nevertheless you could say that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> same thing about any kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dessert right you use the fresh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ingredients yeah it's gonna be better no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well then that's like okay every every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ice cream or dish or milkshake or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever has that it has that the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distinct like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh cheap flavor that every like flavor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> alternative has like banana has that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> cheap flavor yeah yeah chocolate has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that cheap flavor go-to right strawberry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> has that but so does vanilla uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah vanilla but i think out of all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them like the cheap flavor like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strawberry is probably the worst one oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then chocolate because i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> realized like two of my favorite fruits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are strawberry and banana right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] love eating those fruits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah absolutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gods here but i hate anything that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flavored like them you know i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> flavored things do you like banana ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cream uh yeah yeah yeah i like banana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flavor but it's not my go-to it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like my fourth choice listen if i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> getting the banana i'm getting three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> scoops someone is one of them like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need something else to ride right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because yeah dude i mean there's this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one there's an ice cream place in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hokkaido and so got it's like a chain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you want to get in hokkaido dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do like the most insane flavors of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ice cream and it just makes ice cream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like another level it's like you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't go back to here but that's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hokkaido just being but like it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like you'd get ice cream and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like tiramisu ice cream and i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just i'm just there for that like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i am there okay that is a game changer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was caramel macchiato ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> cream i what oh my god that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if that's what it means to eat ice cream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that i'm i'm on board then would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you ever order a sorbet for dessert oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] no sorbet is sorbet is dog [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> here of like i think the problem with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorbet is that you can have really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorbets but at the same time you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> have some real dogs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes it's so bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you doing you must have had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they tell me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like come here just tell me you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't afford gelato or ice cream just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just say it okay because like you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally complained about chocolate ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cream being too heavy sometimes you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a heavy meal you're like they bring out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the dessert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just come in just give me a just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> come out with a tune teaspoon and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pour the flavoring directly in my mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't give it to me through this icicle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i don't want a [ __ ] ice cone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's not even an ice hole it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like an ice cream that you literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just caught sorbet it's like a hard ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cone bro it tastes like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if you need a light dessert if something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> creamy like ice cream cone sometimes i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have a meal so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want a knife it's not creamy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> enough it's just that's the whole point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of it cream's heavy it's not meant to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a heavy dessert it's like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just admit it you're you're you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> snow cone with like a droplet of cream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just get it out of the way some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you need a dessert that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> different kind of heaviness to ice cream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes i don't want ice cream to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> finish yeah sometimes i don't want ice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cream and sometimes i don't want fruit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as a dessert sometimes i want it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like the sorbet the probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> strawberry mainly is okay one the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> texture's awful i just don't like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm also i'm a i'm a snow cone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hater uh and and it's it leans too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> closely to that kind of okay you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like you don't like cocky guardian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> snowflakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's awful oh my god um and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also my other problem with it is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every sorbet flavor just seems to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awful like they just they they can never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> make it it's literally like fruit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> flavored a lot of times you know like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you know like orange orange orange is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the worst flavoring known to man i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> orange is like orange </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> orange has to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> okay i said strawberry from australian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sarcasm or are you like actually serious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i know we said that strawberry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was down there and now that i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remind me because i must have blocked it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out because i don't want to exist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strawberry is by far by far i think the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worst flavor of any fruit it's so bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> strawberry oh sorry uh orange sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> orange is such a chocolate oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right but the moment you get just orange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on its own i don't like too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate orange flavor sucks but orange </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate though orange chocolate damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the rare combination where two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flavors if they you know they they drop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their differences they can come together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> make something decent but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i hate chocolate i hate orange orange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate two negatives three negatives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make a plus it's where you should never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rule out possibilities right i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that orange sorbet awful like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> orange flavored drinks orange flavored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ice cream oh it's just so bad it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so bad i think i think i think i figured </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it out connor just has some of the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> skewed taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> food that i've ever seen where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you you really like what you really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but you really don't like what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> really do i just think that like and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are so [ __ ] particular about [ __ ] if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i went to a restaurant and it's all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i had for dessert no i'm not i just i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone who won't eat it like if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give me an orange sorbet i'm going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> eat it but i'm going to be begrudgingly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> annoyed the whole time that you gave me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> an orange so you're just a stubborn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> picky eater no no no no i i will eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anything i got a real can you give me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this [ __ ] slimy thing i'll stomach it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'll be like fine i'll [ __ ] eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this slimy thing i don't want to eat but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll eat it like i really because every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yokan we've been to together you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> passed me the slimy [ __ ] immediately if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna eat it let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let's let's move back for a second my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> point being is a picky eater somebody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't eat it i will always eat it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah let's move back for a second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this tirade against oranges what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally the vanilla of the fruit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world how'd you hate how do you hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oranges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is such it's not gonna because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vanilla is quite mild in flavor right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a very like light flavor it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> intense orange it's a very intense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flavor you just hate it it's so acidic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay let me guess do you like orange </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> juice no i hate orange we've said this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before i hate orange juice do you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because the thing is oranges are so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] refreshing do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> refreshing stuff it's like acid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] ass how weak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it is absolutely because there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of fruit juice you know i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally most fruit juices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the citrus family lemon and lime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolute god tier they figured it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how to make it refreshing you literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to have a raw lemon versus having a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> raw orange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah definitely </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> like a caveman banana easy bro you lit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just [ __ ] cut it into quarters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the banana has an elegancy to it the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the orange you gotta [ __ ] pry it open </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a caveman scrambling for his meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you literally have to do that with a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> lemon and a lime as well though i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> eat [ __ ] lemon and limes on their own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you literally just said you would rather </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> eat a raw lemon than an orange i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> never do it there's an elegance he says </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the banana you could it's oh yes oh yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yes </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> he says talking about the fruit literal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apes eat you know there's a reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't want to fumble around with an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> orange it just makes more sense it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally has two iq like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he's just like too many steps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also i just think the texture of like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just think everything about the orange </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just dislike like with the texture of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eating an orange i feel like the texture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no like the texture of bananas are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like not good it's waste waste it gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way too much it gets weighted it gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> way too mushy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay okay look it's it's a gamble with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> banana sometimes you gotta have the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect texture for it to be like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a [ __ ] amazing look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes the banana can be too hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes it's just a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> here thinking that banana has the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> texture of any fruit no it does when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's when it's the optimal texture to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a perfectly ripe banana is the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> vegetable strawberry strawberry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watermelon watermelon watermelon's good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's no not enough taste not enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strawberries like the pop rocks of fruit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> excuse me it's okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what did you say huh there's not enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taste in watermelon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a very light flavor it's a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> very light flavor it's diluted it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mostly it's literally mostly water yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why i like it yeah i will say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of all the names like our orange is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good i mean it's i assume the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> color was named after the fruit yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but watermelon yeah they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty ripe by calling your watermelon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not getting clickbaited yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i know exactly what i'm going in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for with the watermelon and you you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a better time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> melon is better than watermelon just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's too much water in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watermelon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no there is just far too much water like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i am getting way too hydrated eating a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watermelon how can you say that apple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> juice is the worst juice no so how can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you say that orange juice is the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> juice when apple juice exists yeah that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is i think i think juice is literally </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toddler they are like they are like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like neck and neck to me like apple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> juice just </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> what are you what is this orange slander </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> orange what is this orange racism the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> like no no i'd rather not you know i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to think and i know you're trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to pull something out of us i literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can't think of a fruit i just don't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what a cop out i i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sorry i just like fruits okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if i had to like pick something okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no i figured it out this is this is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me personally but for me it's grapes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what yeah i'm not a massive fan grape's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a god to you what are you talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey i know you like wine how could you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hate grapes how could you hate grapes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason why grapes is that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying how could you hate bread you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> beer it's like there's nothing alike i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to say grapes are the like and this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this puts it in s here for me grapes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's the only fruit where you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always get the perfect amount of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fruit that you want like you can have as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many grapes as that suits you always if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want a [ __ ] ton of grapes go down go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to town and it's also such a satisfying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> eating experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i'm just not a massive fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of grapes i'll eat grapes but like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would rather ha i would rather cut an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> orange open than eat some grapes i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say this that's just me personally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though i'm just gonna say it i'm i'm a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vegetable guy all the way i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vegetables are so goddamn superior to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fruit in every single way you just hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> desserts you just you just say sweet i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like sweet stuff like vegetables </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> are just so much better i hate sweet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff if it's not vanilla like if if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had to pick guns in my head worse fruit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even though i don't really hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably apple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's there is no category some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience eating in the airport it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there is no category that apple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goes in that is that can't be beaten by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> another fruit i think i i think it's one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of those i like i like i like green </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> apples i'm not huge into red apples i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like red granny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smith so yeah green ones granny smith </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> green apples banger i i it's i know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really like eating apples actually but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a lot like there's always a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of apples yeah it's one of them it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> actually i think it's the most filling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh fruit oh absolutely yeah absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it feels like you eat like ate a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] a380 it's like it's a whole meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so much food like if the apples </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in japan where the apples are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] this big like that's a meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so yeah that's kind of where i stand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on it i just think vegetables are the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> superior ones they're more look don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give me something so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> also vegetables are better for you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying is is that the reason why you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hate sorbets just because you hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] fruit i hate fruit flavored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i figured it out you just hate [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so if there was a vegetable flavored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sorbet would you oh [ __ ] no that sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> awful why would you want that just just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a hypothetical no no no no no i i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want i i just want okay first of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't want a sorbet i feel like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> texture of it is just the worst i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i think a vegetable sorbet could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> work i just gelato like a like a gelato </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and soft serve and normal ice cream all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like sometimes sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there are sometimes never an occasion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where i will say no there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are some times where you've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a [ __ ] filling heavy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> main course but you still want something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to like take the edge off because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> let's be real that's so bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's be real that whole saying of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh dessert is another stomach it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] no no no no it's not it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually not it's proved that you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuck you can actually make more room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for dessert because the way i can't the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way that it works with sweet and salty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you can trick your brain into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking that there's there's more room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> than there is i'm sure that's why you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over eat i'm sure at the time yeah but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know for a fact i stopped myself from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing it because i know i'm going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sick afterwards there's been a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> studies on this you you can actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make way more room when you're when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have something sweet right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i do notice well that's just variety of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you have one of like the same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> over and over you can eat you can you'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna eat less of it but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> emphasized when you go for something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> savory it's something really sweet uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because of how i don't know how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much stupid brains work yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um so but yeah but the great thing about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ice cream is the moment you eat it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> becomes a liquid so it it'll definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fit in there so does sorbet it'll make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is more liquidy wait no no you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> putting your argument on me i never said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's too heavy you're you're you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just put your [ __ ] argument on to my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ice cream love i never said ice cream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was too heavy i never said sorbet was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> too heavy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes ice cream is too heavy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not it can't be too heavy because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll always fit in your [ __ ] stomach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not the point the point is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling of it right and cream is way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> heavier way heavier fruit juice it is if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i if i use the same amount of ice cream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> versus the same amount of sorbet i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> feel more sick with the ice cream than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the sorbet like like the exact the exact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same for the exact same reason why you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't eat too much chocolate ice cream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus too much vanilla ice cream it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because vanilla ice cream feels lighter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> than the chocolate right i mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just it's not so much there it's more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just feels more i don't know why it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> makes me feel sick immediately i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even know what we're arguing about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm trying to argue understand too many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> arguments happening at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is just there's so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] taking husbands just been said in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just turned preferences into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> solid set and stone takes that must be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> followed yeah because you're making it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that way i'm just saying my opinion and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you guys are like connor has an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opinion what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it i just said i think orange is a dog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] which they are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate as a flavor kind of sucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone knows that vanilla is the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh well we can we have the right to uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] argue your shitty opinion you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> well i'm not saying that this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know 100 that's what it has to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all i am is calling you a clown and i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think i think that's fair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're entitled to your opinion but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely said the most unpopular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion well we don't know because we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> had takes before where i've said it and </SPEAKER_02>
