<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah boy, aw yeah.
- Oh, God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is my first coffee of the day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I need some time to
rev up the engines man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ Tell me what you gonna do now ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't talk to me until
I've had my coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You single handedly like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> exhausted our supply. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All I want is one,
Connor, all I want is one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not the one drinking like
five fucking capsules a day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't drink-
- I wonder why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're through a coffee shortage, Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its not me, okay?
- I wonder why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not me.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We live in a society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, welcome back to
this episode of Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm with the boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt and Joey.
- What did you say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all speaking gibberish) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna quit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna quit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Man, I got a new phone, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I saw the comments are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my god, Connor got
the Pixel 6 already." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got it day one, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're a fake fan. I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So my last phone as some of you guys know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've sort of complained about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I had the Pixel 4 before, it was dying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I got this phone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone was like, "How is it Connor?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's good, but it's also really shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (man laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why?
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's so many annoying things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that like I don't know why like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay.
- So... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, you guys know me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big fan of my Chromecasts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think we're all aware
I love my Chromecasts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think its your most used appliance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like your Nespresso right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly, so I
get on my bed, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Oh, the volume's too loud, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> let me turn it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Normally I would just like
press the volume button </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on my phone when its
being cached to the TV </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it would go down.
- Yeah? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It isn't doing it and
I'm like, "That's weird." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, maybe it's just like
this, maybe its a one off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then it doesn't happen again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Doesn't happen again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Turns out, yeah, it's
like an intended feature </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> they just removed it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I was like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then apparently there was
like, "It's a legal issue." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "It's a legal issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me to turn my volume up and down? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> What's going on Google?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it to stop people at parties </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from like turning the
volume too high maybe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would that be a legal issue? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a dick friend issue, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like what- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Has Google been taking
notes off Apple or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Guys! Guys!
This is an intended issue." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'm still like the only
person left in fucking 2021 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that misses the fucking auxiliary hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't want that shit bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you need it.
- Very rarely it's useful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you fucking need it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kids today will never know
the joy of the aux cord. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Garnt is the reason we don't
have progress in humanity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> He holds on to the artifacts of old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry that sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go in an old car or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sorry that not everyone
owns a fucking Tesla </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or something, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That makes its own music. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, some people our
age are still fucking broke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and their radios or their
fucking music player </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> needs an auxiliary cable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I miss the day when I could
say, "Yo, pass me the aux." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't say that shit anymore, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't be like, "Yo,
pass me the Bluetooth." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My brother had the same problem, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when his first car, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he had the cassettes only
that would go into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aw, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So he had to get a
cassette to aux cable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was really cool though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just seeing how it worked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand the technology. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's gonna come back
in a couple years time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's gonna be cassette to Bluetooth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a Bluetooth
cassette you pop in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it works, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought that was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Soon we're gonna have
vinyl to Bluetooth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Point is Garnt is halting progress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not the one halting progress. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the corporations selling us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're making an issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they're selling us the solution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like have you seen that Apple are now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like adding more ports- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I saw that, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even though the people
who've removed the ports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are Apple themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So they're just like, "Apple,
let me sell you on this okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's create an issue ourselves, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then let's sell the
solution to our customers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and frame it as a solution </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we didn't make in the first place." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what, what!? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genius.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I really hope that everything
just goes USB-C as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I want everything to be the fucking same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and thank God Europe is like, "Hey Apple, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> fuck you, do USB-C." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - "We don't care if you're
Apple, we're Europe." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say I like it, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> As much as, yeah, proprietary
technology and all that shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Wouldn't it be nice if it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Can I borrow your charger?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You don't have to ask,
"What charger do you have?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a society we would live in bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's that meme with
the flying spaceships </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this advanced civilization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is civilization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is where we would have been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if everyone agreed on
USB-C like years ago, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that's literally like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it's just basically
everyone and then Apple, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just how things are. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But also USB definitely
suffered from all that shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a while back as well
with micro B and micro- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then USB-C came along
and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then everyone was like "Well, hold up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's actually not that bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's good. We like this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you can plug it in either way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and people were just like,
"What, you can do that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It solved an issue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, no, I think
buying this phone was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all that's good about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but everything else is kind
of, I'm not a big fan of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, going back on
the like auxiliary thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and just proprietary things that I miss, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is just a lot of the times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really see a point
in buying a new phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I normally just buy a new
phone most of the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the battery life
just gets shit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I was completely
fine with my old phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If the battery life
hadn't reduced over time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would have still kept my old phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because what new features are
you using your new phone for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you're not using your old phone for? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will say one thing, and
this is just a YouTuber thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Being able to have a somewhat
good camera in your pocket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> if I need some B-roll or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> or I need like a little
vlog bit is super useful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the only reason why
updated to the new iPhone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because the camera on that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't have to lug around
a huge DSLR all the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also I'm a big tech nerd, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I want to get the new stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the fact that it lines up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like a justifiable
reason in my mind for work, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a no brainer for
me, like I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, this is the first
year in like five years </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I didn't upgrade
my phone after one year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have waited-
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Normally I did it every year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just found that I must
have been buying shit phones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that kept getting... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To be fair, I used my phone a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like more than the average person I'd say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm playing videos on it nonstop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, this time I waited two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I really felt it in the last year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like my God was
my phone being shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but was being shit about it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Battery was the main issue obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's always the main issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was definitely getting
like the CPU slowdown issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like stuff was getting slow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes I would press
the lock screen button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and more often than not
it just wouldn't open, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then sometimes it would open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then I had been pressing it so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that now it was buffering
all of the opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I was trying to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it would like just start spazzing out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So a lot of issues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] Doesn't happen to an iPhone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it does happen to an iPhone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It definitely does happen to an iPhone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck right off, I've had iPhones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally had an iPhone
and then I switched to Samsung </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was like encountering </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> too many different issues with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reason why I changed to Android </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is 'cause my iPhone was just
being so fucking temperamental. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it was breaking
so much after one year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really, that was the opposite for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my Samsung phone was being so shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I changed back to an iPhone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess it depends like on
which phone you get, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the last one I got
was like the 6, iPhone 6. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That was quite awhile ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then that's because
I done iPhone 4, 5 and 6, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was getting more and more annoyed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with each generation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Fuck this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Ah, fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I just like the customizability </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have with these
Android phones as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really easy to like download apps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you aren't supposed to on Android, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that aren't on the app store. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> On Apple it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Android, built for the bad boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - On Apple it's like, "Hey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you wanna just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do a criminal offense in some countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and void your warranty
in every other country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by jailbreaking it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It kinda sucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And sometimes, I didn't
want to jailbreak it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just wanted one thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I had to jailbreak it for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, "Okay, well shit." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just didn't jailbreak it in the end </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was like, "I'm a good boy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> fine, I'll be a good boy, fine." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] I'll be a good Christian boy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause Android it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just download the APK
and then install it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, is that phone
bigger than your last phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I noticed that
it was like a chonky boi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when I held it.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The chonk chart.
- I like the visor though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like this, it's like Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's got like mad Daft Punk vibes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, I was going- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It looks kind of like like "Among Us." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it doesn't look
like fucking Among... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Get the fuck outta of here! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This does not look like "Among Us." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't be the only one
that thought that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't be the only one that thought that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - This doesn't look like "Among Us." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You will never not see it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I can't unsee it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, you should
get a red case for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, get a red case.
- Get a red case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But keep the visor, keep the visor over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who makes skins? dbrand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that who it is?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - dbrand, give me an "Among Us" skin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, a red skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get the "Among Us" skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Overall, right, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been waiting for the Pixel 6 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for like, I'd watch every..
- Why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like I got sucked up into that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd watch the Marques Brownlee's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd watch the whoever else there was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone who isn't Marques Brownlee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause no one else has like, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Marques Brownlee and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how it is with tech YouTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Its like Marques
Brownlee, Linus Tech Tips, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody else, to the normies, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know there's other
people, I'm just joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Austin Evans crying right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum can watch Marques Brownlee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> My mum likes Marques
Brownlee's videos, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know what it is-
- Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because somehow he makes
tech very approachable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like absolutely anybody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when I watched Linus Tech Tips, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's good but it's definitely for someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who like likes their tech.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you have to have knowledge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like there were some other
ones as well who had decent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think Marques
Brownlee somehow just gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the perfect balance of like
appealing to like enthusiasts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also appealing to like my mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's probably why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he's just so successful though as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, like when I was
like gonna upgrade my phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Should I
move away from Samsung?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I like started watching
a load of tech videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like comparison videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the best phone to get in 2021. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I watched like several </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking 20 minute long videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comparing like the Samsung to the iPhone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the Pixel and you know, the
OnePlus and then I realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea what any of
these guys are talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, the difference
that I'm gonna find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be minuscule with every- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've just found out that
with most of those videos, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the end of it all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll give you all
these like tech rundowns </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like, "Yeah, it's
better than the iPhone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but better on the Samsung," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then at the end you'll just be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, so which one's better? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It really depends on what you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to use the phone for really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's up to you I guess.
Whatever you prefer." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "The Samsung is like .5% better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at taking pictures at night time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so if you're gonna take
pictures at night," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you're a night photographer only. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And here in my mind, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, "Well, I've
never taken pictures at night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but maybe I'm gonna start
in the next year, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This might be something I need
to like pay attention to." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And then after like overloading
myself with information, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just realized none of this
actually fucking matters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All that matters is
the fucking price point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the functioning.
- And your personal choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And your personal choice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The camera clearly
doesn't fucking matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because every single
video of any public event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with a camera ever seems to be in 360p. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like clearly, the
people who are at these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking Walmart fights, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have the newest
iPhone filming in 4K HDR. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I don't see these fights in 4K. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People aren't uploading TikTok's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like fucking 8K resolution, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> although our phones can't
shoot 8K resolution. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know when we'd ever use it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what's weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that I've had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so my last phone was the Pixel 4, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Before that I had the OnePlus 7 Pro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Whichever one had the camera
that like manually came out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was a motor but the
camera came out the top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And to this day that's
still like the best camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I used for filming on my phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was better than my Pixel 4 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think it's still better than this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it can do 4K.
- [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you can change all the
settings like in the camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Problem was is that I
had to buy a new phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> OnePlus doesn't work in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Japan has its own
type of frequency waves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or something that it uses
that no other country uses. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're not like the others. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, so if you want
to buy a phone make sure, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure like none
of the Chinese phones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, that's not true.
- Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used a Huawei phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huawei works.
- Huawei's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huawei works?
- Yeah, Huawei works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh okay well OnePlus doesn't
work and a few other ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just fuck OnePlus in particular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think OPPO phones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't see them ever here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They do sell them here.
- Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen OPPO phones being sold. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder was it just fuck OnePlus then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally just fuck OnePlus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair, I hadn't heard of OnePlus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> until you bought one and
you started raving about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd never heard of fucking OnePlus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, to be fair I had it,
way back, it was really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then recently their
phones have been kinda- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You are the only person I've ever known </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's owned a OnePlus.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> If somebody owns a OnePlus, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then normally like they
follow like tech stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's definitely
like a tech person phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or at least it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like really good specs
and stuff for a good price. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For a good price, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then now they just do
what everyone else is doing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like good specs for high prices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't fucking matter.
- Fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, that's just like that's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't pay too much
attention to the tech world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I pay attention when I
need to buy something new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, here's the problem with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's the problem
with phones, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like as much as I think like
the Galaxy Fold looks sick, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like I didn't want to
buy a phone at that time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then by the time
I want to get a phone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably want to get one that's newer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that I'm not getting one that's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, is the Galaxy Fold even worth it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, it just
looks sick doesn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It looks really cool.
- Imagine folding your phone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's the unique selling
point apart from just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it folds.
- It folds! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's it! That's all you need! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, imagine the power
move where you text someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you fucking slam your
phone right afterwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Fuck this person." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] There's the same
thing with the Motorola. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They came up with the
new smartphone as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where it can just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's basically a flip phone but it's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So it's a fashion piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so is everything in your fucking life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's why Apple
makes so much money, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, even though I like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some things that
Apple make that I don't like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I-
- Have you seen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have you seen the conference
video of when Apple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> announced the price of their monitor arm? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was so good.
- That was pretty ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That felt like that should
have been like the website, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like just let it
pop up on the website. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know when you're
making a presentation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know if the audience
isn't gonna be happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like, "Oh
and so the monitor arm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna be priced at $999. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And moving on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like you can just
tell how nervous he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much he had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mentally rehearse that in his mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before he said it out loud. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like me listing my Christmas list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> to my mum when I was a child. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a $200. Anyway, the other one is $10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It is a pack of Uno cards after all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One thing that I've
never understood, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got smart watch, right?"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate, I think that Apple
watches look like toys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand why people wear them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair, I think they
look kind of ugly as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - They look like a toy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They look like something
that like Ben 10 would wear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Except less cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It looks like something
I'd raise like Pokemon on, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you know? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And everyone wears them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, I like the smart watches- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't like square watches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like the smart watches
that look like watches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because then you don't look like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're about to go to Silicon Valley </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and sell stock, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you guys look at the Apple watches </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or are you indifferent?
- I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm very indifferent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wear watches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't even wear a watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wear smart watches either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wear smartwatch but just
because I like the buzz, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just buzzes, I don't look at it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just want to know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I put my phone on silent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, I don't like that
because I get bombarded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with enough notifications on my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that sometimes I just need
to like put my phone aside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and be like "Okay, there's a separation." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But to me if I wear a smart watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I'm constantly like getting bombarded </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with notifications and you know- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I stopped
wearing a smart watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I just wear the Jojo watch
just because again like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to wear my Jojo watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but I also don't want to ruin it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm scared to like ruin it's value. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess but it's like I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I liked the smart watch at first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I was like, "Oh cool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can fucking see everything
without opening my phone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is great. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe it'll stop me from
getting on my phone." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It didn't. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It just prolonged the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of me actually pulling out
my phone to check everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know for me
personally it's helped where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't always want to, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 99% of texts I don't reply to immediately. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I want to find out do
I need to reply to this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so when I feel a buzz, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I just check, all right, not important. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, and I'm not
getting my phone out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna carry on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- That's kind of what I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me, because we do get bombarded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a lot of notifications, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> emails like Twitter whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just want to like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I'm trying to be productive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to just like get
all this done in one point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I want to reply to all
my messages in one point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all my notifications in one point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just leave it aside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like I feel for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if I had that constant
buzz on my fucking wrist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wouldn't be able to concentrate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'd be like is this... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd think so, at first yes, you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then after time it's like anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just kind of become numb to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes I've been buzzed a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't even realize it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Doesn't that completely
defeat the purpose though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I need to like
build in a taser or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Ah! Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You need to replace it
with like a shock dog collar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I think so like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And also honestly I kind
of like how it looks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, I like the style. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is a nice watch.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's one of the ones that
looks decent so, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Something about the it
being square makes it... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause the watch in your mind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> is like ingrained as a circular shape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Watch is circular, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like when I see a square, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is about
my brain that just thinks... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a construct of your mind, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, just how like a stand
should cost less than $100 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is a construct of my mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we...
- Bro, just expand your mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not just a PC
case that costs a grand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a cheese grater. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, just wait. Circular monitors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The future is now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Think about it, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We make our watches square
and our monitors circular. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to the future. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it weird that I care
about the watch being square? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Like am I being pedantic there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's the exact
reason why I don't have a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you're being pedantic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck you, Garnt. Fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the exact reason why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't have a fucking iWatch either. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Is it called an iWatch?
- Well, (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you wear a square watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you like about the square watch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just square, is nice.
- He likes squares. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a SpongeBob on your hand? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] Yeah. It's like...
(imitates SpongeBob) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuck was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] It's like I really
like my square watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why I feel
so strongly about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand I completely have no right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I feel what you're saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> just not as strongly as you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why I I
feel so strongly about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, for me, like
tech has always just been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> application and functionality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I've never really
cared too much about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> having the newest tech </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as I get something
that gets me my work done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or gets me the functionality that I need, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I guess that's just
like my engineering mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like I don't care how it works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just care that it gets
the fucking job done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- He's just min-maxing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> his life, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's why this new
phone's annoyed me so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that in like from
a specification level, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's amazing and it's got
some really cool features, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the one thing that it pisses me off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that just sometimes little
things are being annoying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on this phone and that's
what pisses me off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you know the biggest thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that me off about this phone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's such a minor thing
- What's the phone by the way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a Samsung S21, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. S21. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So where'd you think the power button is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On the side?
- Oh, is it below the volume? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, so the power button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is you have to press these two buttons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the same time.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It used to be, it used to be this button </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but what's this button? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the Bixby button. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Bixby is like meant to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the Samsung equivalent to like Siri, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I don't know a single fucking person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> who's ever used Bixby in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've just heard about
Bixby about five seconds ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You didn't know what Bixby was? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who the fuck uses Bixby? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one, but Samsung
puts it in every device. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like a Rugrats character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like being someone
who uses Bing, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like who are these people? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Who are these people? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I'm still using
Ask Jeeves actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, that's a good brand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, all right.
- I'm still using Clippy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay this is what, I love Android right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this is what they have been
pissing me off with lately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time they add something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they take away something
or change it a lot, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> So I remember on my old phone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you used to be able to
screenshot the whole page. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it would scroll down, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then for some reason one day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they just removed it, they didn't say why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why would you remove that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then not add anything to replace it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And now they've added it
back in with the new one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but for like two years I lost the ability </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to screenshot the whole page. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's right, the selling point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're being sold on
the new functionality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a classic Apple, a classic Apple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember when
you wanted to screenshot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it used to be simple, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you just press
the power button down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and then it would like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, no, no, you could press like a combo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you could screenshot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then they changed it to
like hold the power button down </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you press it to
screenshot, something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't remember exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But they just change shit for
no fucking apparent reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they call it new,
and I'm like fuck off! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not new if you just made shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more complicated for me, fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And yet he somehow still
is part of the system. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're part of the cycle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are trapped, you are trapped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're trapped in the tech cycle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They've sucked you in,
they've made you angry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can't get out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just like Android too much, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I don't really have anything to go, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I think a lot
of the time with Apple, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the reason why people are quite loyal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I know, you know, I understand this, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they buy a lot of Apple products. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's why you
put the Pixel, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you're part of the Google- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're part of
the Googlers out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's because like
Android works well with Windows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it all kind of works well
with each other, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And emulation is easier on
Android and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Except isn't it weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that the Pixel doesn't
work with the Chromecast? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now it doesn't but
Chromecast is Google's thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So you'd think the one
phone that would work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> with something Google related </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> would be the Google phone, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, why did they
remove the functionality? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I can control mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can control it with the iPhone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so now what I have to
do when I want to control it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of going to volume, I
have to go to Google home app, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> scroll down to the-
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scroll down to-
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (both retching) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Scroll down to the device. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I have three devices in my home as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So then I have to click it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then I have to go
on the volume slider, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why Google did this shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like they fucking hate me, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They already paying my bills with YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, why you making me suffer, Google? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm already trapped in your web. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what does the volume button do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just normal, normal volume.
- Nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's your phone volume. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but normally when
you'd Chromecast things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd be able to choose
all of the volumes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like sometimes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can still do that on my Samsung. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because sometimes
I'll for whatever reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm feeling like a psychopath, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll play a video through my phone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cast a video and then
maybe I'll be on call </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can control all the
three volumes separately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I do that sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Welcome to an influencer's life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've become that meme
of just like that guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has like four screens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> looking at like the stock
market or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Four different videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Instead of stocks, it's just memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You need to like
consume all of the memes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the same time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did something one time and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck's wrong with me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just watching two videos
and both volumes were playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I realized 30
seconds into doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like yeah, I can't
hear, I can't hear it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I was just listening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to both at the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and trying to take them both in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's no apparent reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really challenging yourself or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I wasn't doing it consciously. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I just did it by accident and
then I just didn't stop it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just letting them
both play and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this is good.
- I need some more sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have an issue of opening too many tabs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and sometimes-
- Yeah, I've seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes one of the
tabs is playing volume </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like fucking
trying to find where's Wally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the fucking tab section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like which one of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is playing fucking music right now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many tabs on
average do you have open? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not a psychopath. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen some people who have like 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like you know- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can the browser
even run at that point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen tabs when it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it gets like 20 tabs and
then you have to like click </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and expand shit to get
like the next 20 tabs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just like a fucking psychopath. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think when it
gets to like 50 tabs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it condenses it down into one drop down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think its like 30. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it?
- Yeah, it's like 30. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Too many, too many. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so what I do
is if it's like 10 tabs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I you know, in case
I don't want to close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> one of the tabs, I just
open another window </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and I stack them on top of each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much ram is that using? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much ram do you have in your PC? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like...
- Not enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's funny because when I'm editing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm editing even like
heavy intensive videos, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I look at the ram usage and
Google Chrome is like still more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than my editing software
a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Close your fucking browsers, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if I need it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What if I need it? Just in case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't need it.
- There's a thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> called history that
saves it all, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously you do not know how many memes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to go through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe you should just view your memes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in like incognito or something
that is not important. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like what if
I have to have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if I have like one
important research topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I need to use for
like a video or something- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Research topic, you're
just watching fucking memes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I have the one tab </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is the important research topic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm working on for a video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I have like 30 meme tabs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and finding that one research
tab is fucking impossible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if you just separate the research </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into a different window? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because with the length that memes last, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm always constantly
looking up new memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you have some
kind of issues here, Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just putting them into
categories and actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, organizing
your fucking tabs, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably that would help me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that would help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally try to have as
little tabs open as possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I just don't want tabs open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I have more than five, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I start closing ones that I don't need. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Five is like the limit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Five is a limit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, five is like, five is basic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Level one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll have Twitter open, emails, YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's it really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I have to have more
than five tabs open, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm opening another window. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah on the another
monitor or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just put it on another monitor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you got a tab for
YouTube, Twitter, emails, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> something for music maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like a video to play in the background. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I just sing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I am the juke box, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that's what they called me in high school. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whatever you're searching at the time- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't constantly have like
Twitter open or my emails. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I do.
- I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How are you going to
go to the fresh memes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> How are you gonna see what
hentai you've watched? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have my phone open constantly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just scrolling with the other hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do the fucking awful thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I have Twitter open like I scroll, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I scroll up on my Twitter, I
see the completed timeline, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> close that, open my phone and
open up Twitter. (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God fucking dammit, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, yeah, I do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Social media has
hacked your fucking mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll open the BBC's or
read the news articles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll close it and then 10 minutes later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll open it again to
see if anything happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, so here's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You wake up, you open your phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's the first thing you check? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's the first app you open up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's whatever the
notifications are really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I look at the notifications. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I kind of like look at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is there any of these which
are like super important? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Any of these- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are there ever any
super important though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you wake up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like shit's gone wrong or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - My LINE messages really are
the first ones where I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yes, this requires immediate attention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Everything else is like whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - If it's email, then it's
not gonna be important. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because if someone-
- If I see a video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I wake up and I see
an email from YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like-
- Okay, no, that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's when my heart sinks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> No YouTuber ever wants to
see an email from YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally like you never
want to hear from your boss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If you get a YouTube, it's sucks right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because sometimes you
YouTube will email you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "Here's the
community roundup of stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, fuck off YouTube you scared me! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because normally it means a
copyright claim or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So YouTubers are scared to death </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of seeing anything related to YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in their fucking inbox.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a copyright claim or worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like your channel has
been terminated or your- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your video has been age restricted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, your video has
been age restricted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Nothing good ever comes
out of a YouTube email. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I could get a YouTube email being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> "We've decided to send you $1 million </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> for being such a good YouTuber," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'd still get a fucking
heart attack or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I go through my
notifications first obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- So I'll check it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, LINE. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you have multiple messaging apps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that people can contact you on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes.
- And do you have a personal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like number one priority
app, that one that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the one where if
you messaged me on here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will actually see it and reply. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, to me it's like LINE
and Facebook Messenger, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Facebook Messenger is like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a fucking lie, you
don't respond to your LINE. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt doesn't respond to messages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt does not respond to messages, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> its actually impossible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I respond to messages
when I check my messages </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I do not check my messages
when I get notifications. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just what I have to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are like my friend from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had a friend from school, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was always kinda a little odd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but he was a good friend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we used to play Xbox a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but he was just always so stoic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and very strange with like communication. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we would always play Xbox right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then when summer
holidays would come around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he'd be like, "All right, guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just not gonna talk
to you all summer." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were like, "All right," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but he wouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He would just disappear all summer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was like okay, strange. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then whenever you messaged him, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd see him at school you're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yo, why don't you reply to my messages?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "I didn't want to." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And, we'd be like what? (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What an asshole.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then at prom, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were at prom and we're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're just having a good
time and then we're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah dude, we should grab some drinks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And then at prom he was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I'm never gonna see any
of you guys ever again." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And we were like, what?
- Wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then to this day,
we never saw him again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta say, he's a man of his word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you can't say he was wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, you know what was weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like two or three years later
he messaged us on Facebook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and we played during the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it might've been, when
was "Fortnite" popular? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When was Ninja like the biggest- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Two or three years ago? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, whenever that happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we played like a few games
of "Fortnite" one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then haven't heard from him again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So that was interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Last online, nine years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, actually I know what he's up to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my friend is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my friend's dad is best
friends with his dad so, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, he's alive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, he's alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's doing well. He's doing well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just doesn't want
to see you. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people want to move on after school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it but I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to me it was like damn, this man was sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its not like he was getting
like bullied or anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. We were his friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We were literally his friends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, clearly not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - We hung out with him more than anyone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this guy has decided </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he was just done. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like friendship over, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man like just did
the IRL friendship remove </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of us and like we
thought he was like joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Friendship with Connor ended. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fortnite" is my friend now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I met up with some of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was back in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was the two friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we had a friend group of the four of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was the three of us and not him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We met up and we were just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, that was weird. Huh? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> How he just, he really was a
man of his word to the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Really just disappeared." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He literally just went through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> his Facebook friend list
IRL and was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Guys, I'm gonna start
clearing off my friend list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? If I unfriend
you don't worry about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he didn't delete
any of us on Facebook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and I think if I messaged
him, he would reply </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but he just was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I'm never gonna ever make an effort </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to talk to you ever again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - The man knows what he wants, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - In some ways I respect the conviction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I had that amount
of conviction at age 18 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to decide to make a life choice like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just cut people out. </SPEAKER_01>

sponsoring this episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Now back to the show. Bye! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> how many of the people
you still like met at 18 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> or friends with in high school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you still keep in contact with? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - High school? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ah, like actually a fair amount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> occasionally just because
it was very small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I still have like a Facebook group </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like all my friends from high school. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a really small town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's a lot easier to, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you knew everyone.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, your
parents know everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's really hard not to
like have some form of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, this so-and-so is up to this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's weird for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I remember whenever
I go visit Sidney's hometown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Sidney's family, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we'd just be like go
shopping to a supermarket </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or like going in town and she'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, she taught me
history in high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah, she's friends with the fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just small town things.
- Just small town things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I right fellow Wisconsinites? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like I can't imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever like running into
my teacher in normal life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if that happens like in my city, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like DECFCON five, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like something bad's gone wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, my teachers emailed me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they told me to, did I say I went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and gave a presentation at school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I did, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause my old teacher
guy reached out to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like, "Hey, Connor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Old teacher guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually no, the students reached out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then he liked me so
he was like, "Hey Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, come on over, come on in." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I can just like walk in... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that I was speaking
to an American and they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, this is gonna sound like another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's American story.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were sitting there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so they were from Florida, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were talking about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were like, "Wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so there's like no
security at your school?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like "No, there's
no security at my school." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> They were like, "What if
like something bad happens?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "Bad things
don't happen at school." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- This is school. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the teachers can handle it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you mean? It's kids. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like what if someone comes in with a gun? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> No one has guns. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> No 12 year olds have guns. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> "There's no metal detectors?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, that's crazy.
- That's so alien to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think we can afford metal detectors? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We can barely afford chairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We're like we've been
using the same chairs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like the past 80 years in my school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't have chairs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like if you're in a school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you had to open up the textbook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you didn't have to
share your fucking textbook, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you knew you're in a good fucking school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- So like I could like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, I could, if I was going in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, if I just said
one of the teachers is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> is asking me to come in, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even if they don't know anything, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can just walk in and be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Hey, the school told me I was coming" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they're like "Oh okay, cool." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause they like, know who I am. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- 'Cause I was an ex student. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah and even if its like a good school, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the most you have to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is maybe like, you know,
go to the reception </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and say like "Hey, I'm
here for da, da, da." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you can just go in, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't have to go through
this whole like prison system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I was like what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't have to go through the TSA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time you go to school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah and then when I was done, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I just went around to speak
to the teachers that I liked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Hi, how you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you doing well? Nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Nice, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> How's life? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, still teaching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cool, great. Nice."
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Imagine going to a school
that's actually safe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Worst thing that happened was
fucking me climbing a tree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then nearly just jumping out of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's the worst thing that happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thought it was it like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> getting into fights or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That too, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you have to go
to detention for that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What punishment system did
you have in your school? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nothing physical I
assume in this day and age. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think some of the tutors
would have loved to though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Some of the older ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I could tell they were
more than happy to try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like undoing the belt.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Now? Now? Aw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, did you guys have
detention in your school? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had a thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I forgot what it was called in Welsh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You sit in a room facing a wall, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a tiny, tiny room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just face a wall.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We had the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where our teachers would
just tell the students </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to just look at the fucking corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like go stand on the wall, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's how it was until
I entered high school, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because to me the word detention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that was an American thing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that was an American punishment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Our school was in Britain,
we just looked at the wall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We looked at a wall.
- We called it Blair witching. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, whenever I got into a fight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I only went there once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was from one of the fights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but most of the time I
went like full lawyer mode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was a kid I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hell no, your honor! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He hit me first! There is
no way I'm doing this!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Self defense!
- Yeah, yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think one time they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You need to go to detention." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm not going to detention." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, "What do you mean why?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Because he hit me fucking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going in detention." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they were like, "Hm." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've gone to detention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they actually made me do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was like trying to fight back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And one time they did make me go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - See, I didn't have the
balls to like retaliate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think after I'd got in fight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like adrenaline was like high, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I was willing to fight back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause most of the time
I'd be like okay so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the reason why
I could never retaliate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to my teachers is because
like in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if I did that to my dad for instance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he'd beat my ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, what's to say that the teacher's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not gonna beat my ass as well? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I was conditioned from a young age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Same though, like if
I know if my teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> called up my parents, which
they did multiple times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would get fucking annihilated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Oh I'm dead, I'm dead." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They would kill me. They
would actually kill me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They would like take away
my Xbox for like two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'd rather frankly-
- Sure death. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They honestly could like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> could leave me out to dry with no food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Easy, right? I'll do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Take my Xbox away for two weeks? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> All right. Real shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, now, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now I'm gonna do anything
possible to avoid- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They never told me that there
was a fate worse than death. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Legitimately, they could take away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they could like starve me for three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd be like, "As long
as I have my 'Halo 3' copy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and 'Halo: Reach', I'll be fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like legitimately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure I would
have preferred that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I avoided it but I know the one thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one thing that my parents
would like have my back on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is if someone started a fight
with me and I fought back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was always very confident. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Yeah, what you gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell my parents? Yeah, they'll
tell me, 'Good on you.'" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll be like, "My son's good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad will be like,
"Did he win?" (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Comes out with a towel, wipe you down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Ready for round two? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, you guys ready? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They'll pour some water on me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like, "Get back in
there, son, go back in." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hit him with a jab, hit him with a jab! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its genuinely one of the only things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I felt like I could
get away with doing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because my parents legitimately
would have my back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's why I didn't mind fighting back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I knew that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I genuinely felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I was in a position to
fight back, I would. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It worked, but I wouldn't
recommend it for everyone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> If you fight back and
you lose, it's worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a different thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Its almost terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're gonna be bullied everyone so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> To the kids watching
this, know your limits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - High risk, high reward, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not even high reward,
its just high risk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's just high
risk. It's just high risk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. We spoke about that a bunch so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. All right, I need a piss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Connor, the psychopath. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gotta make piss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, how were we talking
about like a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how like in like 10 years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna be laughing out
fucking bass boosted braille </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like Morse code memes or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So like, I think I've
already reached that point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I was watching
a meme the other day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the meme is just like
called gamers in 2030 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just... (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's already funny. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was just pissing myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just that scene
from "WALL-E", right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> With like the kids on like
the tricycles or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was just them looking
at sorting algorithms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know why it was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just them sorting
algorithm and fart noises. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like I have to see this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - My sense of humor is so fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is most certainly
one of those memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is fucking awful to explain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't explain why I think it's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably the farting noises. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was more laughing at the
fact that I found this funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like a fucking laugh loop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just kept going.
- You're laughing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at yourself laughing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally can't explain the science </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of why found this funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it makes absolute zero sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of memes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I recently invested in? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let me show you boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, I saw that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, yeah. I saw that, saw that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got the Goku Drip jacket.
- How much was that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't want to know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't want to know.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I think-
- Is it official? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> so I think it's estimated value is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> estimated value, the same way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like NFTs are worth value. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I think two and a half grand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I managed to find it on Yahoo Auction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or some shit for like a grand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it was like "ripped and torn." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they showed a picture of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's Japanese standard
of ripped and torn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> On the sleeve, it's like a
tiny bit ripped and stained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so obviously they'd
like gutted the price </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because of that and I was
like "Bro, I'll take that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its for a meme, I don't need it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not gonna lie, the jacket's kind of sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought it specifically
for a meme in a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that will come out at some point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like I'm gonna wear this maybe/ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm probably not gonna wear it much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably just get it for the meme- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need to wear it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then I am like
okay, I kind of like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then I wore it and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, this is kind of sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of sick.
- Yo, this actual drip now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually understand why it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He finally has the drip.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I put it on and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh shit, this is fucking sick." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Finally, something
to rival the Jojo suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Connor discovers
drip for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So now when somebody
says I don't have Drip, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just threw money at the problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Money made it go. Don't
even think about fashion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I literally bought the definition of drip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I bought the Goku jacket. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was gonna get the Supreme shirt as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like "fuck that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just bought a knockoff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a thousand dollars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not buying that for a fucking shirt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The coat, at least it's a North Face coat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So at least it's a decent coat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but I mean still it's way over priced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for what it is though, Jesus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is North Face though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It felt very high quality though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but not $1,000 high quality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you gonna wear that when you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like snowboarding
or something like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Ah, dude, imagine snowboarding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I'm thinking, man.
- Oh dude! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That would be so... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, I'd be so scared to like rip it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or fall on it though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like, dude, what if
I ripped that jacket though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the most expensive
fucking piece of clothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever bought in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.|
- That's insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well like what was I gonna say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like going back to your
Yahoo Auction thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just noticed that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever like a Japanese
person goes to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> they say on their secondhand store </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it is like bad quality </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or it is like a little
ripped, a little something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Its basically new 'cause
I had a similar experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just recently
bought a Gilgamesh watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So you know how we have
like the Jojo watches? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So they recently, before
that they did a collaboration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with you know, Fate and Faye characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I bought the Gilgamesh one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like really, really discounted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because on the website it said
"scratches and dents" right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like okay, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want it 'cause it's a Gilgamesh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So I get it and the scratches and dents </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which was like one little
dent on the corner of the box </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and one scratch on the
fucking box itself, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what put its price down. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not even on the watch itself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was on like the packaging </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> which I'm not even gonna
show off anyway, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Japanese secondhand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is not secondhand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like 1.5 hand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's weird 'cause some websites, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's other websites like Mercari </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have ratings and
like, it'll be like AAA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> which literally means </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it is probably better than
the fucking factory quality. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, like mint condition.
- It's literally like insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> A is like very good, like a store quality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just like normal A is like good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've bought, so I think the jacket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was listed like AB or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right.
- Or like BA or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Something B and it was fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally fine, but
it was like "stained" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I looked at it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even fucking find the stain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was in the photo so I don't
understand what's happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I used Mercari once to
get that CRT TV that I have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- And like, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so I bought that
for like 300 bucks, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I was like okay,
you know, decent, decent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Turns out later I found out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally for good condition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that thing's usually like five grand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh my God.
- And the only reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was 300 bucks is because
it was owned by a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who took perfect care of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "What, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could have easily extorted me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for a couple of grand at least for this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the dude was like, "300 please." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Japan is one of the only countries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where I think a lot of
stuff you can just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just get it secondhand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like you don't really need
to worry about it like don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Clothes I've noticed online </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are like insane condition somehow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand how. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wear an item of clothing once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I look shit, it looks
like it's been destroyed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wash it once and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is a washed clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can feel it. I can see it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what I'm doing wrong, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe I'm just like a Neanderthal
with my caveman machine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I suppose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like even when you go
to like Book Off, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and you go to like the
second hand clothing sections </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like this is
clearly like old clothing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's been slashed down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you look at it and it's
like what's wrong with it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also video game consoles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, it is insane how easy it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> to get like Nintendo 64 games
in box for less than $10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like you see "Super
Mario 64" in box everywhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like 500 yen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like $5 for an in box
copy of "Super Mario 64." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've got one and I
paid like 700 yen for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's insane. It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can get Nintendo
64's in box for like $20. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I got mine for like 30. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's absurd.
- Its actually stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only consoles that are expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> are stuff like the Neo Geo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and some of the Sega stuff-
- Sega Saturn </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is usually quite expensive.
- Some of the Sega ones, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like any NESes SNESes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's so many of them in box </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so many of them outside of the box. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you can just get like a plastic bag </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with a perfect condition N64
or NES or SNES for like $10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can get like the fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> limited edition GameCubes for cheap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know that like the orange one- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got the orange one, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like 60 bucks, 80 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Recently like Japan is
just a collector's dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because there is so many like rare items </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can find here
for like mint condition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's actually insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how good they take care of their stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I opened something out of the box, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow I get a scratch on it immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know.
- Yeah, exactly right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like my hands touch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just like, I leave
some kind of mark on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how it's possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know how these guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> are taking care of these
mint condition everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Every item is mint condition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - People are just so
careful with stuff here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not saying I'm reckless with my, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not fucking throwing them everywhere- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- But I think they go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to an extreme level of care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to make sure everything is perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's kept properly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause like even the books, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even the books, you buy
a book of something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Normally when I read a book, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you get like the natural
bends with it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Somehow the books are
just perfectly straight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like mint condition a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, how are you doing this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you like reading it with a tweezer? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this like a CSI
crime scene or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're just like-
- Puts on the gloves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They open it for a second, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> take a picture on the phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they read it on the phone.
- Yeah, (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't crease it, I can't
expose the paper to oxygen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> God forbid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> how they got this kind
of culture around them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but that's good for us </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause we can find so many things here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> You can find so many rare items here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get a cheaper drip jacket
for a ridiculous price. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's because
in Japan, especially, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's that whole idea of
like, not so much recycling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I guess like the whole idea of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, if I move or something happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or if I run out of money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then like I'm gonna have
to like resell this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think a lot of people
just buy it naturally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with the intent to resell it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah because like I
feel like resell culture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least outside it's just to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like never worth
the time investment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to try and resell something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unless I knew I owned
something that was like super, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> super valuable, like most everyday stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, I don't need this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, most of the time
you just throw it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's more effort to sell for example, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe your used clothes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's because it's
such a fucking pain in the ass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to throw anything out here in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Like into like trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And also you have to pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> for anything even remotely big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anything bigger than
like 40 centimeters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why would I pay to get rid of this thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I could just resell it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and make money to get rid of it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and also when you
want to throw something away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Japan, you have to book
when you want to throw it away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it takes like a month. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, so when I was in my
old place I bought the toilet, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but in the new place there
was already one installed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I didn't need the bidet, sorry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I had to throw it away </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I had to wait two
months to throw it away. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it was just in my apartment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just collecting dust for two months </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before I could throw it away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Isn't this insane? Two months. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had that with my desk as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like tables and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like oh, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 40 days from now I can
throw out this piece of shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need any more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, in UK you can just
stick it on Gumtree for free </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone would come around and take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hmm, I mean, there are sites
like that in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> There just not like
really readily available, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or mostly known about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and also probably not
the best for like foreigners </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> if you can't read Japanese.
- Yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could probably make it work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with like Google Translate but you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You probably do it on like Mercari </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's probably why it's so popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, true, true.
- Yeah, I've realized now that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of websites can be figured out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once you just you have
Google Translate or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like most of them
work exactly the same way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as most websites work so, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it's a big deterrent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because once the rest of
the world figure it out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure people can be
buying like way cooler shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but now it's like we have
all the access to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, might as well use it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well yeah, I mean a lot of the sites </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are popping up with proxy shipping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we've ordered some of the podcasts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so yeah, I mean, a lot of the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you are getting a fucking steal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think the hardest one actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just Yahoo Action. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yahoo Auction- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, I know the language
and I still don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've got it set up so I can use it now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but like I have to memorize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some kind of weird like Simon Says, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which panel to click on for which thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because it's not like Amazon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where you're just like, "Oh, buy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you have to like bid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not bidding is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You bid, you bid, but
there is also buy now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like eBay, it's literally eBay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's an etiquette and
this is where I fucked up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause now my account is poorly reviewed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't reply saying
I got the item to the seller. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I assumed that he got the confirmation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that the package had been sent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so he wrote like a really angry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> passive aggressive review
in Google Translate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> asking why I didn't fucking say I got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't think it's that
big of a deal is it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sure, I didn't reply, it's all good right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You did your job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I paid you the money and it's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause he gets the money immediately so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so you'd think
that if he got the money, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then that means it arrived safely, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and also it was weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you can't use a normal
email for Yahoo Auction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you have to use Yahoo account. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I don't have notifications set up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> so I didn't see it so,
but I got my Jojo figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I got my Jojo figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that the only thing you
bought off Yahoo Auction? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, he bought the
drip shirt thing right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, sorry, that's Mercari, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that's Mercari, oh okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause there's tons of it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but the prices were like totally wild </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and also getting the size was difficult </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I want to get an L size. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's a jacket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't mind if it's a little big, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it looks cool, it's drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bro, it's drip. Drip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> But all the ones in Japan were S or M. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't find anyone who had a fucking L </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and there was one that was L </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it happened to be the cheapest one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I was like, "This is an absolute win." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause no ones big
enough here to wear the L. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? I was like this is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fantastic. Yeah, it was great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is the big problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about just clothes sizes in America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Not America.
- Just in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Trash Taste takes any
opportunity to mock America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - America just is in my head constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh no, in Asia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You said that sentence
like it was pre programmed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just muscle memory at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I hate America, but actually- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not shitting on America right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> No, yeah like especially shoe sizes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shoe sizes are like fucking impossible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't buy shoes here, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I know.
- Its fucking impossible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You have to go to
like a specialized store </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just like pray, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> pray that they have the shoe size. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like the maximum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the only store
I've ever found in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has shoes my size is
the ABC Mart in Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is where most
of the foreigners are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gotta get to where all
the foreigners are, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I can't buy that shit online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't buy it like anywhere
outside of Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking stupid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's so many
like amazing collabs as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like the fucking New Balance collab </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they did with Eva, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so pissed off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they had like these nice Eva shoes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like "Oh, what
size does it go up to?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "Oh, 26." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Do you have
any 29 and a halfs?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 26 is really small. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 26 is tiny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I wish shirts came in sizes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like shoe sizes, right?
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do because okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you get an S, you get an M, you get an L- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Logistical nightmare of that though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What does that, that
means different things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> depending on what country you're in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, we should have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I agree that we should have
some form of uniform rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on what S, M and L is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I guess not
every country would agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you know the normal in America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is totally different
to the normal in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get an L in Japan, it's too small. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the first Jojo suits I bought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was an L and it was too small, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get an L in the US, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like three sizes too big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like at least with shoe
sizes it's a number </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which I can correlate to something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With like shirt sizes and suit sizes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a fucking free for all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on what country you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have to hope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to hope that the
store you're buying from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is a local Japanese produced store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you're buying American
shirts in a Japanese store, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you're still fucked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're buying American sizes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you gotta got to make sure.
- But shoes do the same thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You have UK sizes, you have
US sizes, you have JP sizes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but there is a
conversion chart for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like all universal shoes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never had a problem with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know if they have it in my size. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I'm buying clothes in Japan online, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a fucking lottery man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, is it the M or the L? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or is it the LL? Fuck, it
could be either one, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It could be either one.
- Now, the worse ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> are the ones that don't
even use like S, M or L. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The ones that use like one,
two, three, four, five, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like what does that mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> What does that actually mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they're just like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have the size conversion
charts on the website." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Who the fuck uses a size
conversion chart for T-shirts?!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know a single person
who wants to buy a T-shirt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're just all right, let
me get the tape measure out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> all right, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what's the shoulder
width of an M size? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate the whole tall, short
nonsense with coffee as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like tall is not the biggest one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it sounds tall and
then grande's medium </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then what's the big one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Venti. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Venti.
- [Joey] Venti. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck does any
does any of this shit mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it's Italian right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, fuck that.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just do small, medium,
large, extra large. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've had this, like you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't do like fucking hot or cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in some other language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just do hot or cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the rules aren't uniform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the coffee shop or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are we changing the fucking rules? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] Apparently there's
another size bigger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's called trenta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like when you pay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't pay in fucking euro, do you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just sounds fancy.
- Yeah, it just sounds fancy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what I hate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like why are you turning
an agreed upon standard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into like your fucking passion project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for your chain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why until I got
fucking used to the whole like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially Starbucks sizes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I never went to
Starbucks in Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The first time I went to
America and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, I'll get the tall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's that's the biggest one, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I got this pissy little thing
and I was like all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Next time I went I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Biggest size, please." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Big size.
- Big size. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you know in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I would order the venti size </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was a reasonably big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hmm.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One time I made the
mistake at Anime Expo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> of ordering a venti size
at Starbucks in America, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I swear I heard
fucking boss music playing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when they were like serving
this fucking drink to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> It took like four of them
to fucking hold it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This massive Frappuccino.
- It's like a bucket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like one liter of
ice cream in this Frappuccino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Fucking hell,
how many calories is in this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I went online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was something like 2,100 calories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2,100! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Holy shit.
- What's wrong, doll? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You haven't touched your
bucket of ice cream yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's wrong, honey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You haven't touched your
Oreo Baskin-Robbins, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 2000 calorie milkshake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How could they serve this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How is that legal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on the flip side though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> coffee sizes in Japan, way too small. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, this is the biggest one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a large size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This is a standard large size </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you'd find in any
Japanese coffee shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the biggest they have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But here's the problem, right, in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes, this just normally
what I always want now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like the size that
I've gotten accustomed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I actually quite like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a good amount.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I got a
good milk to coffee ratio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I always order the
largest thing they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's normally like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I get caught off
guard when you go to a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you order the large </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it's like, "Oh
shit, it's actually large." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I didn't expect this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I have no
idea what the large is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some coffee shops, MVPs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They have like a little display </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that has the small, medium and large. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, like the cups, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What a nice MVP I can visualize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> how much coffee or drink
I'm going to receive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, there are some places </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where they like show you how
many milliliters it is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Those ones are like nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like going to an
American restaurant in Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like, well,
it's an American restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so is it gonna be American sizes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it gonna be Japanese sizes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if it's gonna be Japanese sizes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna need to order an appetizer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's American sizes, you
don't need to order that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The appetizer is the meal.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, yeah, I ordered fucking
nachos at the Hard Rock Cafe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the nachos was like, my God, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you could fit like four
children on this plate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It was insane and it
was just my appetizer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought was gonna be a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could eat the nachos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone at the table could
have eaten the nachos alone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we'd been full, and
it was free refills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Japan.
- Yeah, in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what gets you, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause you expect Japanese sizes in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but whenever it's like American style, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to some American styled restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's still like
Japanese sizes, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you go to some
American style restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they ain't playing around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're going all the way.
- Full assimilation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're fully assimilated
to American culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> through and through.(laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine though, I mean,
we're already used to all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Imagine like, just like an innocent, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Japanese girl being like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I heard about this
thing called Hard Rock Cafe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm quite hungry. Let's
get the biggest size." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> She just gets a fucking mammoth of food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, 'cause it wasn't expensive either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So that's why I was kind of like normally- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Misleading, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Normally like the price to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like if the appetizers like 15 bucks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like okay, it's
probably gonna either be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like really high quality
ingredients or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or it's gonna be pretty big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's probably normally pretty big. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was massive. It was gargantuan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could like, again, I
could hear the boss music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fucking Sephirot theme playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as they were all bringing it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like that meme of
like the chess grandmaster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> versus the kid in the Russian TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I heard you wanted a large, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we prepared a bucket for you, Connor!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey humming) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a quick time event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna fucking try and
do something to survive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I just remembered like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the first time I went to America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it completely blew my mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like the scale of the meals. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wasn't prepared, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I had always heard about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think we have spoken
about this before, right?. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's never ending stories about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah because like
I'd heard about it before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't think anything
can fully prepare you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the first time that first
plate gets put in front of you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just think this is
food that I need to consume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like the first
time I went to America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the first week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I needed something that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't just greasy or you
know, wasn't too filling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Impossible.
- A hard task. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By that time I'd like
eaten like burgers and pizzas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking Denny's or whatever every day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so I'm just like I just
want something healthy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want something light. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want a light lunch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we're at this diner.
- An oxymoron in America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we were at this diner </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, "What's the
lightest thing they have?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well, it's possibly a salad, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no way you can make a salad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not anything but a light lunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "I'm safe, I'm safe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll order the salad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember just walking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I see this fucking
massive bowl in front of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Who the fuck deforested
the Amazon rainforest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and put it on my bowl?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how have Americans found a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make salads unhealthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like they fucking
drenched that shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in dressing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like what? How? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How is this possible?
- I think if you want to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> any healthier than that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you just have to like get
just a bucket of water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't get any healthier than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like healthy? What's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You want some water? </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> back to the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, I love wings in the US. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I love wings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh no.
- Buffalo? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like you never know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (phone buzzing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God, Garnt.
- Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You never know how many
wings you're getting sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is always the hard part. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes they don't say
how many wings you get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Which I hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also sometimes you don't
know how beefy the wings are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you get like final boss wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you get like level
one starter Pokemon wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you like Buffalo Wild Wings? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love Buffalo Wild Wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like in America
like fuck me, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, 'cause in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like in the UK and in Europe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have like regular size wings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like normal, like
average size wings, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because some places in Thailand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you order chicken wings
or you order like chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this chicken's fucking anorexic, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Japan, all the
wings here are anorexic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're fucking fighting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to get all the fucking
meat off the bones, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's basically frogs legs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meanwhile in America it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, is this an albatross? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this boy's got a fucking wingspan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, how much did
this chicken deadlift? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bro, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like the fucking
Tyler1 of chickens, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thick and chonky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, like I went
to Buffalo Wild Wings once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like, I don't
know if I like it or not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I love Buffalo Wild Wings. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - See, the problem I have with
Buffalo Wild Wings is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like they shouldn't call
it Buffalo Wild Wings. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> They should call it Buffalo Wild Sauce </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because there is more sauce on that wing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than there is actual wing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been a few times 'cause
I really like going there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause you get like craft
beer and stuff as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like I'm already becoming
a 40 year old white dad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm already on my way there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love Buffalo Wild Wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love craft beer so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like wings goes so well with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah.
- I don't mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's bone or boneless, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just prefer bone.
- On bone, on bone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just like, I just
don't like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The sauce is like too overpowering. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It depends what sauce you get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then sometimes they
have the audacity to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "Would you like extra sauce?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like "No, I'm good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you get a sauce
that's so goddamn good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, bro, I don't mind
that they lathered this on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe it's just the sauce
I got was kind of meh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Buffalo Wild Wings in my experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have had a lot of sauces where
I'm like, "This is shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe I just got the shit one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like sometimes like
the honey mustard one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes honey mustard
is a hit or a miss for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes it's done right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes it just tastes
like artificial as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And it's awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I really
wished we had in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spicy food challenges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have like, there's so many
big food challenges in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We do have spicy food challenges. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where?
- Like most ramen shops. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are they like actual challenges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or are they like we have a spicy ramen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, there's ones that are like actually- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that spicy for you
Joey, or like actually spicy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like we're talking like ghost pepper-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I think for you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it needs to be like nuclear level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> for you to be like "Ooh, that's a little, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> mm, that hits back." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd love to do a video where I go to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like a spicy food challenge place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I haven't been able
to find anything yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've seen a lot of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was like entire
programs on Japanese TV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that were about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw one ramen shop
that did spicy ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But it didn't advertise it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like if you complete
it, you get something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, we just have
a really spicy ramen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you can order it.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like the part of
the charm of the challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that there's like, you
get it for free or, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- There's a challenge to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's some kind
of reward there, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause then then I feel like the video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> can like have a cycle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - The only one I know, it's not in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's in Korea.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's this like restaurant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I think some YouTuber did a video on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's this restaurant
in Korea that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it serves like tonkotsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like insanely spicy tonkotsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like if you complete
it within like a certain time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you get, I think it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you complete it within five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can eat there for free for six months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's apparently so spicy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's only been one person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's ever completed
it under five minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the rest of them
have gone to hospital. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Because it's so spicy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently when you walk
into this restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the first thing they give
you is a carton of milk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like a stomach medicine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You want to do that, Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You want to do that?
- No, I'm good, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if I found one in Japan,
do you wanna do it, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just take a little sip, you
don't have to eat it all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just take a little bite.
- Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're like I am done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was a part of me when, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like I grew up
watching a lot of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kinds of like programs on
TV and it was hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like there was like 1%
of my brain that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You should do it for a video." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah., </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like curse you, content brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you'd actually
be suffering for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Great, now that I said
it on the fucking podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We're gonna be bombarded for it now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Get Joey to do it, force him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll do it if you guys do it with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt & Connor] Yeah, sure, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just to show how much
of a pussy I really am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because when I had the
ghost pepper on live streams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were like "Oh, that can't be real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It can't be real ghost pepper." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was a real ghost pepper.
- Connor badly reacted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's 'cause you're white.
- Yeah, because I'm white </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they don't want to believe
that I can handle it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've fucked my body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by eating too much of
these fucking peppers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I feel like with
a lot of white people... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. No, go ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No fault taken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's either like
one extreme or the other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's either like people
like you who've like actively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> searched for it and they've
just like nuked their body. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or people that say that water is spicy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we had all the "Hot Ones" sauces, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right, at your house?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like lathering the hottest one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on my burgers and stuff and
like it wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it was kind of nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it wasn't that spicy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I watch the show and
I'm like, "It's not that bad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I like coated a burger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I want to do the
"Hot Ones" challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but I'd have to like pretend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh geeze, it's getting kind of hot! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Meanwhile, I'm just like.
- Delicious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No because I feel like
you'd have to like up the ante </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if you just take
like one little dab, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not gonna do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you like fucking coat it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you'll probably get some
kind of sensation from it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I completely
lathered a burger up with it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was fine, but I
feel like I'd need like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the one that's
like apparently horrible? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Its like the extract, isn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- That's like the extreme one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the extract.
- The sauce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's like pure capsaicin extract. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- I want to try that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not real though,
it's just your brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just your brain making shit up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's your brain, isn't it? Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like if you think you're
gonna go into shock, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you'll go into shock. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just don't panic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just don't go into shock.
- Just don't go into shock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's simple, it's not real pain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're about to have a heart attack, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not a real heart attack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just tell your heart to stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, you're scared?
Just don't be scared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just don't die.
- Just don't be scared. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just get a strong hart.
- It's literally fake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mind over matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally fake
news. Bro, you're good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why do people die from beestings? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just don't be allergic,
just don't be allergic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, a bee sting is actual
physical chemical reaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There's nothing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is spice not a chemical reaction? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's your brain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's your brain making the pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you not know that?
- Wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, 'cause I noticed like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not a single person has died from spice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a reaction that your brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sends to the receptors
saying that you have pain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's no actual reaction going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's causing you pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> It's your brain telling your
body that it's happening. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But you can die from the shock. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] No.
- Can you not? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, so you can die
from going into shock </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in general, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you can die from that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the pepper alone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> will not 'cause you to go into shock. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like your brain, you
panicking and freaking out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will 'cause you to die.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like telling someone
who's having a panic attack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just not to panic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That works, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like generally you
won't die from a panic attack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you're having like heart problems. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's impossible to
die from a panic attack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> unless they were like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have like cardiac arrest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like the odds of someone our age </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> having cardiac arrest is like super low. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd have to really have
an unhealthy lifestyle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also be in extreme shock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm correct in saying
this, I could be wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There might be doctors watching this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but as far as far as I'm
aware, like it's, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this whole thing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't take our word for this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is not medical advice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this is not medical advice,
I don't know what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is definitely the
opposite of medical advice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - As far as I know this whole-
- Medical risk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This whole thing of
like yeah, you can die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I think you can faint </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think you can faint from like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like just absolutely exhausted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and freaking out and panicking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm pretty sure
you can't die from it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are we talking about spice now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spice, yeah.
- Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm pretty sure if you're healthy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're under a certain age </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have no heart
problems, you'll be fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, suffice to say
I don't eat spicy food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I'm afraid of dying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just don't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, understandable, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's just gotten to
the point for me where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I have something
that is like particularly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's saucy or meaty, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something about having spice on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just elevates it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There are some dishes that I feel- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Curry especially.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some dishes I feel that
are just made for spice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah, we can do the spice challenge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I genuinely
enjoy spice with my food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a lot of food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It depends on the dish, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you go to CoCo ICHIBANYA, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have like the spice scale, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can get the
level 10, that's spicy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel like at that
level, it's just spicy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not enjoyable
- It's not enjoyable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's spicy for the sake of being spicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just hurts and it just
ruins the taste of the food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've heard between level five and 10, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't really change
in terms of the flavor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I normally get seven when I go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That's normally like
a happy medium for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 10 is just like too much pain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what they put in it at 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't explain it, the
spice just feels artificial. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't feel like real spice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just feels like well,
you're just kind of adding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> some kind of chemical to make this spicy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what they
do to make it more spicy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I grew up on obviously
Thai dishes and Thai food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and it just feels like some dishes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are just made for spice, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you remove like the chilies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or the aspects of spice from some dishes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you're losing part of that
dish in my opinion, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw a picture and it was
like from a Thai restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause apparently Thai's known </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for being the spiciest foods in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really?
- I believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's either like Thai or like
Indian or something, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or Mexican maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chinese, maybe like Szechwan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Szechwan? Szechwan is like
a different kind of spice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like peppercorn spice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's peppercorn spice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It like numbs your tongue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was like a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a picture outside
of a Thai restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like, "We will
no longer give refunds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if your food is too spicy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And apparently it happens all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People have returned
food to Thai restaurants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's too spicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Thailand? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, in like America and
Europe and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, that's how you know it's
a true Thai restaurant, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. That's the
true Thai experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I understand that if it's that spicy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't eat it but at
the same time it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hmm, yeah, well, you are ordering a food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you want the native food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are gonna get it
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like it hurts my soul a bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because at our restaurant,
at my family restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have to like make sure
the spice is less spicy- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you offer like the original spice? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> If they ask for it but you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> part of my soul dies inside.
- If they can speak Thai. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, part of my soul
dies inside just knowing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're serving less
spicy dishes to everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they can't handle, it man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] That does hurt, that does hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause that's just not the true dish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to me, it does
actually hurt the flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To me it's like actually like
having sushi without wasabi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I don't have wasabi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't always need the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That hurts my soul.
- That hurts my soul. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Horseradish wasabi sucks
dick man, it's awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well you're not going to
the good restaurants then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, sometimes I want
the 100 yen sushi, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's what you get then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what you paid for. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get off my case. Get
off my fucking case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Man can buy a thousand dollar drip shirt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but can only afford a 100 yen sushi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, that is a business
investment, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to hear it from you, J. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is more than just a jacket, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that is a historical art
piece that I purchased, Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You sound like someone who buys NFTs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is not just a gif of yawn cat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it is a historical art piece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, you can't right
click, save that jacket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> You can right click, save in NFT. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That doesn't apply. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This also doesn't ruin the environment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a historical piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In 10 years, this will
be a monumentous jacket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I will make sure everybody
remembers single handedly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Monumentous? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a piece of meme history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that a word? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a piece of meme history, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man, it's
like stained and ripped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, no, you can't say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Second hand right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't see it, bro.
I'll take pictures in 360p. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Next time I go to
your house, I'll see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll see that rip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Get some Japanese to grade it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a Mona Lisa, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got a story, it's been robbed once, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had little scuffs here and there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it adds to the character of the piece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, that to me is not a jacket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is an encapsulation of
our time and meme history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Has everyone screenshoted
this for poorly aged things? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do it now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is meme history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there was other memes where
I could buy a physical thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would buy it as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's a meme do you think
that is historical then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is already historical.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Harambe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Harambe is historical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, really?
- Harambe is historical. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a meme that is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're a memer you know Harambe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but that's the
same thing as like fucking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That doesn't make it historical. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's historical. Harambe's historical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just because you know it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Harambe's historical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like there was so
little memes at that time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that every meme is historical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like back then
there would be like 10 memes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the entire fucking year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deez nuts? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Deez nuts a milestone of comedy and memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unfortunately there's
nothing physical you can buy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for deez nuts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deez nuts is an idea man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a concept. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It can't be owned by the people! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It belongs to the people! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It can't be owned by a single person! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Our nuts. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, the drip jacket belongs
to Goku first and foremost, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and then me second, nobody else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can a meme really be owned though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Can it be owned, Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can participate in the meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fueling the meme economy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The meme economy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If that jacket wasn't a meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I wouldn't buy it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- I don't think anyone would. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, it looks kind of cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought how much it was at retail, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it might have been $400. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You think that meme's gonna
be remembered in two years? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If it then it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that has staying power as a meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair, the Drip Goku meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> has weirdly lasted a long time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it pops up a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I feel it's because you can fit it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into anything, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because 'cause
drip has lasted awhile, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it goes hand in hand with drip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If drip is around Goku Drip is around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he is the embodiment
of the word drip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like what memes has prevailed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like past two years? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Has there been any meme?
- There probably has. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Deez nuts has lasted a very long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's 'cause this guy just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> won't let it fucking die.
- No, 'cause everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Deez nuts is literally- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even count Deez nuts as a meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's gotten so popular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just a thing you say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It gets more popular like every month. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Minecraft, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it died off and now it's
like having a resurgence man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just...
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Minecraft music, Minecraft song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's that guy who sings
Minecraft songs really badly? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a guy who sings like
Minecraft parodies something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He sings really amazing
Minecraft parody songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with a shit mic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds funny already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that the same guy who
made the "Fortnite" song? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, "Chug Jug With You"?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that didn't last long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> That lasted like two
months, remember that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Man] Nyan Cat is history. Nyan Cat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Only because of the NFTs, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well Nyan Cat is history </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just because at that time-
- It was inescapable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was inescapable </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there wasn't anything
to compete with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> If Nyan Cat came out like today, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people would forget it
in like a millisecond. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should do a three by three of memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should, we should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even think Harambe
was like that funny though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't funny but it
was just around for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it came back a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did it come back?
- I can't... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm Googling most
popular memes of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to remember
like funny Harambe memes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Troll Face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, that
was like the beginning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But now that's just like cringe right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dat Boi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I love Dat Boi, dude! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh shit, what up, it's Dat Boi! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still have a Dat Boi T-shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now, that makes me feel
like a fucking boomer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I still have a T-shirt of Dat Boi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, is it weird that
you think of Troll Face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you feel like a boomer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You think of Dat Boi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you definitely feel like a millennial. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like a generational meme gap, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they're both like still cringe now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, something about Dat Boi, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just like a funny image. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you couldn't use it in any memes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The only time I ever
saw like a Dat Boi meme </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that was actually funny was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone took like the movie poster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for "The Boy in Striped Pajamas" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and just called it "Dat Boi
in the Striped Pajamas." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the only one that made me laugh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> everything else is just fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a frog on a unicycle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going through all of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What about Rage Comics? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that a meme?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that a meme?
- Well, that's the OGs right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, well they had the
Troll Face and all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Troll Face and then like Forever Alone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Troll Face is pretty iconic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> 420, 69, all that stuff? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is that a meme?
- I think so. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 420 is a meme like straight up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And 420 has somehow prevailed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it's like not that funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's kind of like just a
public holiday right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the closest we're gonna get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a meme public holiday, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> The one day we come together
and celebrate a meme. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Meme Day is April the 20th. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going through all of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you think like our kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are still gonna be saying 420? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hope not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're probably gonna
find it cringe, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hey dad, 420. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "Shut up son." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't know the
meaning behind that word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I feel like sometimes
memes come back around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and become funny again, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with the Ancient Memes Twitter account </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've found Rage Comics funny again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like ironically funny now, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rickrolling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a classic meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true. That is the classic meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably the most classic and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] Unexpected. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not unexpected.
It's always expected. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the most long lasting prevalent meme. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- And this one's obvious, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like pretty much every
fucking SpongeBob screenshot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Out of any show, somehow
SpongeBob has the most memes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a meme factory.
- And they're good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're good, they're really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like think of all the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some of the funniest meme screenshots, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 50% of them are from SpongeBob. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah.
- That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He was ahead of his time, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, SpongeBob was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - SpongeBob invented memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Felt different, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I guess in terms of the long lasting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably 420 in my mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> SpongeBob and probably Rickrolling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are some of the three
most powerful influential. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Influential.
- And you can't own them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't own them.
- Belongs to nobody, Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna have to make
Drip Goku stay around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> for a long time so I can
get some like investment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But okay, if you try to sell the jacket </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> in like a year right,
it'd be worth more, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If the meme is still popular? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the meme's still popular. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna sell it though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm owning history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're hodling, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. Diamond hands! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> No, I actually want to wear it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you're not gonna sell them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> why are we talking about
the durability of a meme? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just saying like you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are some memes that where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's hard to gauge whether
it will stick around or not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and most of them- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's 'cause 99% of them don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you remember how quickly
the fucking cake meme died? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What cake meme?
- Where everything is cake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you remember that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, that's a shit meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But everyone was like this
is the new hottest thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and three days later
it's like, "What cake?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, that prevailed for like a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You think?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You guys don't watch "Lessons
in Meme Culture", do you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Basically it talks about memes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like every single
day there's this new meme </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I've just never heard of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and dies like within a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they're like weird ass shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like can you even call
it a meme at that point? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like sometimes there's you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes there's a meme
that which lasts a day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like if a meme
truly has staying power </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it should like, a week is
like the minimum requirement. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, what's the line between
a meme and an inside joke? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think you're
confusing memes on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's levels of memes right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like the public memes
where everyone is in the loop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then there's internet only memes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's only certain groups
on the internet do this meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's this meme name, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what this meme name is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I find it fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the one where they
take stock pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and make really shitty jokes with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stonks?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the one where- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the boyfriend looking behind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, not that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like-
- Hide the Pain Harold? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stuff like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, they take stock pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, for example, there's
a girl like laying down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a guy, and she says
call me an ambulance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the guy like kneels over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he says, "You're an ambulance." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why I find those hilarious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't know what
the name of that meme is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I want to find more pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and more memes in that category. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the one where the
son and the dad are in the car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like, "Oh, we named
your sister after roses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because your mum loves roses." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like, "Oh,
what am I named after?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "Oh, you wouldn't
understand 420 blaze it" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - My favorite one is
the, "Honey, wake up." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a very popular one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, if anyone knows
the name of that meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> please tell me because I want to Google it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I want to find more memes like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just call those
like stock photo memes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like stock
photo memes are so like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so wide and varied and broad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you've got like
the guy looking back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't count that, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Well why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I'm talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is like a very specific
shitty joke that works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you've got shitty
stock images with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you've seen the meme, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you've seen the same
images in the same category, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you will know exactly
what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just so hard to
put like a fucking word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a name to it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what the name is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, you're
gonna have to show me these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right.
- Do you need to pee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I need to pee. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you to Honey for

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - So "League of Legends." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes Garnt, what about it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just gonna drown myself real quick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What about it?
- So Joey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have you heard of this new anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or animated series called "Arcane"? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is the "League of
Legends" anime I assume? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is the "League of Legends." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've seen pictures of it yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so at the time of recording </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> only the first three episodes are out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it might be a massive failure
if the next six came out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So we don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But after the first three episodes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks and was really fucking good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like really good.
- Yeah, it looks good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The visuals are insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is genuinely like I came into this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, you know, me and
Connor both play "League", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know?
- We're both toxic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we're both very
toxic gamers in that sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and every time we talk about "League" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey just like just like conks out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what I was expecting was
just a mediocre video game- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fan servicey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, fan servicey adaptation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanted some cool fight scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> basically just like an extended version </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the "League" cinematics,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey & Connor] Yeah.
- And I would have been happy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I watched the
first three episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just so unprepared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for what I think is like one of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is just watching three episodes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's legitimately like
the best three episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like any show I've watched this year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't think of like a show
that just has a stronger start. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like an, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the visuals are like Pixar level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> of like detail at times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> into like a nine episode show.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just don't understand
how they're doing it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the animation is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Joey look, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I know you've like quit anime
and everything like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but I swear to God this is something that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you have zero
interest in "League." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even if fucking hate "League" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you need zero fucking
knowledge about the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's all about... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love that I focuses on
like the character and worlds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because what this series made me realize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is that "League" actually has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really fucking interesting world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's what really drew me in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was there was so much thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was put into the
world building and the lore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like "League" lore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like the meme for the longest time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a mess because
they kept rewriting it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because they would introduce
characters and then aw, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they had like this mess of characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that people really like with
really interesting backstories, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but they didn't really
know how to like connect it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then they just literally
at one point just gave up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> they just stopped doing it.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- They're like all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one's reading it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They used to do like
articles all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you remember?
- And no one read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it was a mess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it made like no, I
mean, it did make sense, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was just so
confusing and hard to digest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that the only way people consumed it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was through YouTube videos
of people explaining it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- And I think most players </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't really care to begin with, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, fuck no.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And no one's playing
"League" for the lore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's like how many like curse words </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> can you say per minute </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of how many
character lores do you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's different but like I
think you would enjoy it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you give it a shot, Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like "League" at all really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only benefit you get
of being a "League" fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> is that character's names come up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where you're like, "Oh,
I know that character!", </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but then in the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like nothing like
the character in game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't even fucking matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because a lot of the times you're guessing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that that character? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that that champion? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But most of the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just characters in the show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what I like, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't like fan
service certain characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they are characters in the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of the times there is
just this world that exists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some people in this world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happen to be "League" characters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a show where I feel like it just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have to be
"League" fan to enjoy it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it prevails with like
mass marketing "League" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a franchise as
opposed to just the game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like honestly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only video game adaptation I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that even like stands close
to it is "Castlevania." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like "Castlevania" level </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like video game adaptations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess we'll have to see
where the next six episodes go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like right now goddamn, goddamn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was very impressed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was interesting
watching a show like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with Twitch shout though,
because (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd have these like really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really serious moments going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you'd watch Twitch shout </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone was just
like fucking memeing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jungle feeding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - ADCFK, ADCFK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like okay, it's pretty fun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but at the same time, is it
ruining my viewing experience? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not quite sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like genuinely like
a movie quality experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this thing but
like in a TV series, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everything was so on point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the sound design was insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The animation, especially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could go on and on about
how good the animation is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the voice acting's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everything so far has been good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like absolute bangers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know like the meme is, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lol, Netflix live-action adaptation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but man, Netflix video game adaptations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are fucking knocking it
out of the park, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So far. So far.
- So far. So far. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, I'm really hoping
that this doesn't age poorly- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm really hoping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, 'cause like
the episodes like as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like at one point I thought aw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're getting a predictable story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it just kind of
like flips you on its head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like, "Oh! Oh, shit. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What!? Oh, Jesus!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really good. Really, really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like what other
video game adaptations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have they done? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I know-
- Just "Castlevania" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so far, right?
- "Castlevania." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? Netflix.
- Yeah, Netflix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "DOTA."
- Well, they did "DOTA." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "DOTA" had an anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was bad.
- Yeah. It wasn't good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, DOTA's a bad game too so... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "DOTA" fans are seething right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I watched a little bit of the "DOTA" anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and it wasn't good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But why?
- Just because I was curious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should watch the "League" anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you're curious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll add it to my watch list. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No!
- I guess- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please, Joey, please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never wanted you to
watch an anime more than this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll watch it later.
- Please, it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's actually good! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, Joey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually would prefer for
you to watch "League" animation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than to watch any anime this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please, it's actually good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Please give it a shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It actually so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll be sure to check it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Getting this guy to watch anime
is like fucking impossible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's Anime Man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He refuses to watch an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I guess it settles
it though, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "League" better than DOTA", right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Checkmate "DOTA" fans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, one thing that "League" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> has always been good
at was making anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but "League" game gameplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like anything that wasn't the game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> they were amazing at making. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like every single animation
thing we got was insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - All the K/DA shit was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like think about fucking
everything they've made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of "League" is amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In terms of aside from the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember when K/DA first came out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'League' is cool now?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like that lasted for a week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was like the
most surreal week ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Remember everyone was like,
"Yeah, I play 'League.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course I play 'League.'" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just had the one week
where like fake "League" fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> came out where it was like
cool to play "League." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then now it's gone back to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now it's gone back, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Balanced as all things should be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They couldn't last.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No amount of hot K-pop girls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> can get people to play that game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair though, that K/DA
was so fucking inescapable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, it was good.
- Oh. it was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I watched it and I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Wait, do I like K-pop?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "Do I like 'League'?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I used to play
"League", right, way back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, way, way, back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then Aki was like,
"Yeah, I don't play it anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not a big deal." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then K/DA came out and Aki was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I'm a 'League' player. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bro, I'm a 'League' player
through and through." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he's like
telling me all his lores, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all the K/DA characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "oh, wow." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, "All right. Okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The truth comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I remember I was actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause K/DA debuted at the 2018 final- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we know. Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You love to tell everyone you were there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Rub it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt won't fucking stop telling people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that he was there when K/DA premiered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, because people ask me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because whenever I meet- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Two things people ask me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> did you work at the BBC and were you at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the "League Premiere of K/DA? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I meet a fellow "League" fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Oh yeah, I
was at the 2018 World Final" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm always there and
I fucking roll my eyes- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then people ask, "Oh, how was it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Oh, K/DA was great." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they ask, "Oh, how's the match?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Oh, K/DA was great." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I can't remember anything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that was the only highlight of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we lost, Garnt, we fucking lost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we didn't just lose, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> we got fucking obliterated, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But K/DA was great.
- It's all right though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You saw K/DA though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's all that matters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - K/DA was great and that's what matters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> That was worth the
ticket and cost of flying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> all the way to fucking Korea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Korea was great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to go back to Korea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - "League" Worlds may have ended, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the real shit was the "Arcane" anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was like, end of
"League" worlds, I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> "Arcane," real shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Bro, please, Joey,
please, I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just give it a watch.
- I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, please. Actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will definitely watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never wanted
something more in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will absolutely watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] As a "DOTA" fan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I give you the permission
to watch "Arcane." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a "DOTA" fan, I give
you permission to be happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, honestly, if there
are any viewers watching this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> who are not a fan of "League",
even if you hate "League," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> please watch "Arcane", you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it continues to get even
better than it is right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which I would be impressed if it does, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it genuinely is gonna be
like a fucking hood classic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wouldn't be surprised though- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gonna be a certified hood classic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wouldn't be surprised though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because like every, as you said, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like everything that they've
released that's not the game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> has been amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like even for the people
who don't give a shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about the game.
- I don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what's going on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't understand why Riot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> still pretends to be a gaming company. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely because I would welcome- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Riot, multimedia company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, if they nail this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "League" in the lore has so
many different like actions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, I guess, eras, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and different areas that can
completely have characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that don't even ever
interact with each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're focusing on a certain area now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has certain characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if this kicks it out the park, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just excited for the
opportunities of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we could get the "League" universe- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, the LCU, I'll be
fucking down for the LCU. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - The LCU? (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, 'cause that's
like in "League" lore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like, I don't
know anything about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I know there was like
a great war and stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that could be fucking hype, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Arcane" has made me
care about "League" lore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like after I've watched "Arcane," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I started reading fucking Wiki articles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, "Yo, yo, what else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> can we explore?"
- It's that good, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's such an interesting war </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's so many
opportunities for just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different elements to clash together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there are some "League," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like right now we're focusing
on like human characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like a city, you know,
but there are other cities, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other civilization. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there are just like fucking gods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the "League" lore as well- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and there's
like one-off characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which I'm thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they can like integrate that somehow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then it is literally just the
MCU all over again, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I could just see it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There's just like the fucking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how like, spoilers
for "Endgame" I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You know how like Captain
America just gets his hammer? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There could be shit like that I guess, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Zach turns into a blob
I guess, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's some random ass characters as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I would love to see
how they would integrate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a character in "League," right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> called Tahm Kench, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This whole story of this character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that he's just a massive... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is he a frog or some shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck is Tahm Kench? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think he's a frog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A massive frog-esque thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He just lives in a swamp, but eats humans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he has no connection to
like any of the characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> except for like Pyke I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like how would
you include a character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just eats people like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> How would you do that? I'd love to see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's amazing because the
best thing about this character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that he speaks in like a
really thick Southern drawl- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, like a swamp guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I don't even know
what some of his lines are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "This is my swamp. Yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just like, "I'll give you a daughter" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, he's just
like really interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd love to see how they would integrate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these weird ass characters
in the "League" lore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I don't know how
it is for the viewers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just seeing Joe pretend, like
try his hardest to like care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm smiling through the pain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And if he sits here and
explains arrow games to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's okay for me to sit here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and explain "League" lore for 10 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look forward to my in-depth review </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for next week's episode,
which is definitely coming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Legitimately, if you watch it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you'll actually enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Like legitimately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He'll come back and he'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, I've made a mistake." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're just gonna keep talking about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until like he'll just have
to like buckle one day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna read "One Piece"
and he's gonna watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the comparison you're gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Sure.
- This is easy to watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You get a treat watching this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I haver to slog through "One Piece." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, yeah, I legitimately think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it is one of the best things
I've watched this year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like anime or not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I can't even think of how many things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I've just watched this year.
- Not sure if that's telling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of this year's content or not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've actually had some
pretty good stuff this year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - We've had some good stuff this year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, because I'm trying to, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to think of all of the things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've like read and watched
that's come out this year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can hear the dial-up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's been a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd have to like go back through because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's a lot?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like movies has been not so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Movies has been not so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, they've barely released any movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's still a pandemic.
- Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, they've
really geared up recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've watched a lot of movies recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They've been kind of been-
- It feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> all the big movies are
just starting to come out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they're just
starting to come out now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because they was supposed
to come out like a year ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like I know like
there's been some new MCU movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I just haven't watched. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you care about the MCU anymore? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo, I heard "Eternals" was like bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- "Eternals" was rated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really badly.
- Really bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I'm gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not that I ever gave
a shit about the MCU, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but-
- I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, the MCU now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, okay, now
you need to prove to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why I should care again
now that it's over... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me, it's like
I don't think they can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> just coast off the success
of the previous entries. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, yeah, sure,
we'll get like the series </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that everyone's gonna go and watch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Dr. Strange and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, that's gonna be cool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but if they're trying to
sell us on new characters, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, okay, how are you gonna sell us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now that there's no, at the moment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no big thing that
we're planning towards? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like I wanted to watch
like "Shang-chi" for example, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also I had no like incentive
to go out and watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I heard it was amazing though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a lot of people
said it was really good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also-
- It was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also I-
- Yeah, I thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But again, you're kind
of like the same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm like, okay, I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little burnt out on the
whole superhero thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like the only thing
I'm really excited for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> superhero-wise is "Batman"
with Robert Pattinson. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just 'cause I love Robert Pattinson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he's so fucking
good in everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like the "Batman" movies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, all the "Batman" movies are chill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, 'cause they've cast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like what everyone thought
was quite an unusual choice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which like Robert
Pattinson is definitely a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I mean, it's unusual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you watched any of his
stuff that he's been in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Like some of the indie
films that he's done? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've seen one indie film that he was in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I forgot the name of it, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happened in it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Roughly, do you remember or no? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally the
first indie film he did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> after the "Twilight." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so obviously like
he kinda had a bad rap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> from "Twilight" 'cause before
he wasn't really acting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, he was type casted as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I love interviews of him
like shitting on "Twilight." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, he fucking hates it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He hates it.
- Rightfully so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He absolutely hates it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can only imagine what it felt like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where he was like I am a serious actor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who trained professionally, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> went to like the most
prestigious shit in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all that, and now I'm here doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking half dead
vampire who barely emotes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he went on the whole
kind of like indie film, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a bit like series where he
just did so many indie films </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He tried to change his image so hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and then he was doing
really good artistic films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Some of them were amazing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - "The Lighthouse" was amazing
if you haven't watched that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- Really amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Highly recommend it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It's got what's his name? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dafoe.
- Yeah, Willem Dafoe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ryuk, you may know him from
"Death Note." (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My favorite Will Dafoe role. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually like an amazing movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so far I've just loved watching him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I feel like he's
probably gonna do something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting in "Batman" that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of type casted actors though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have gone down that route. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like Daniel Radcliffe went down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like a massive indie film route, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know, everyone just knows him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> as fucking Harry, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When he's not busy fucking kissing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and fucking everyone on set. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> No, but I went on like a massive binge </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like Daniel Radcliffe indie films. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And like some of them are fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like "Kill Your Darlings"
is an amazing film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He did a lot of odd films. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And he did a lot of theater.
- He does a lot of stage, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, theater stuff, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was quite a big thing in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> right after "Harry Potter"
ended or during "Harry Potter," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he did something that
required him to be like naked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> with like a horse or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I remember in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tabloids were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Daniel Radcliffe's a porn star now!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then like people were
really trying to drag him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously, British tabloids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like the fucking worst on earth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like they're so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're like drama
YouTubers, you know, just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just imagine if every newspaper
just turned into Keemstar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, but like it's weird
because remember when someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like Leonardo DiCaprio was
seen as the teen heartthrob, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know?
- "The Titanic" guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "The Titanic" guy, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And how hard he had to work
to like change that image </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even though, even back then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, aging, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, but even back then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was like a hell of an actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't think people gave
him enough credit at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I remember it was
like a prevailing joke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like, if you
ever feel bad about your day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember that you have
the same amount of Oscars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as Leonardo DiCaprio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He finally got one, he finally got one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He finally got one, he finally got one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But now you see him aged up and it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> he couldn't be more different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He didn't age up, he glowed up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He fucking glowed up.
- That boy glowed up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Did you watch... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what else here I
actually quite enjoyed recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- "The Suicide Squad", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not "Suicide Squad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, "The Suicide Squad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "The Suicide Squad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's two Suicide Squads? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a newer one
that released on HBO. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the one, I know
James Gunn directed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Was that good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really good. Really, really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Better than Snyder cut?
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like night and day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you watch the Snyder cut? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? My name's Katana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That means sword or something in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the best line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that a real line? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one of the swords is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Her name's Katana. It
means sword in Japanese." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something along those lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be misquoting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. It was really good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Idris Elba was the main character in it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and Idris Elba is just a
pleasure to watch always, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> he seems to always just kill it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And John Cena's really good in it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, John Cena. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - He plays like a psychopath justice man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, he plays a character
called like Peacemaker, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's just like a fucking murderer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's just like, "It's all for peace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's all for peace." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so he's very funny, really good in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Really, really, really, it just, it works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he's getting his
own movie now, "Peacekeeper." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, John's Cena's just
like fucking hilarious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in every role I see him in.
- He's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's a really good actor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's actually a good actor. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the whole film
was just really good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really fun, really well made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it like a standalone
thing or is it gonna- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yep. Standalone. Completely... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As far as I know they're
not doing a sequel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause nowadays you just
can't have a superhero movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without someone being
like, "Oh, this is part two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the cinematic universe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's, just go watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess the other characters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like Peacemaker's getting his own thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in terms of like this thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude, you can just watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Suicide Squad Cinematic
Universe starting now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can just watch it
and turn your brain off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's really good- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it have anything
to do with the original? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I watched the
original and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most five-hour 10
movie I've seen in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's in the same thing so
it's like the same premise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but good.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a soft reboot.
- Yeah, it's a reboot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like just watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's one of those films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like you don't have
to pay much attention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just turn your brain off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really good time for two hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - At which point are we just
gonna not be able to track </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which new superhero franchises,
like which one's a reboot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> which one's are building onto
like the Cinematic Universe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which one fits into one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I already am at that stage.
- I'm burnt out on superheros. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is the new "Batman" film,
is that part of the original? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that something separate
or is that following on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from like these Zack Snyder "Batman"? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm so fucking confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, controversial take. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As much as Batman is a superhero, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't watch "Batman"
movies as a superhero movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It doesn't feel like a
superhero movie to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I kind of agree with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's ever since the
"Dark Knight" trilogy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Because that kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like that kind of redefined- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you don't get the,
whereas you watch a Marvel movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know exactly what you're getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And like, to some extent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do with "Batman" as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for some reason- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - When "Batman" goes
down that route though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they do it in like kind of campy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> tongue-in-cheek route, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the George Clooney "Batman" route. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it's just like
with the "Batman" movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like I always think is
this like a "Batman" movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or a "Batman" in the DC Universe movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if they make Batman in a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has to integrate with
the rest of the DC Universe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are some rules that you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to like acknowledge, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas if it's a
standalone "Batman" movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can do whatever the
fuck you want with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's such a weirdo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> John Wayne's just bizarre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what the fuck is he doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is this this man's hobby? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> But I mean, yeah, I've really
enjoyed the "Batman" movies. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And again, yeah, like I
said, when it comes around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't feel like it's the same thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And when I watch a Marvel movie, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they've kind of gone to
this formula recently </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that is kind of really
boring and predictable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> where it'll be like, "All right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna have the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the really big stakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we'll crack a few jokes along the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course, we're a family-friendly movie." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so now they've all turned into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> these pseudo action
comedies in some aspects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like "Thor: Ragnarok" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really like led the way for this I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> After "Thor: Ragnarok" like
every single Marvel movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had to be funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it was always like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- It was always like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It really turned up to 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, you watched
the first "Avengers" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like,
"Oh, everyone's got quips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's got something funny to say." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but it's just
like "Thor: Ragnarok" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was more of a comedy movie
than an action movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you watch it?
- Yeah, of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was more jokes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than fucking plot points in that thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but that's also
what I liked about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'd argue like, so is
like "Guardians of the Galaxy," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which came before "Thor" right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's the
same kind of vain, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it just felt like
everything started doing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel like everything's
just kind of ramped up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not sure if the newest
model of movies do it or not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because I haven't watched them obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently "Eternals" has something- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] I think "Thor:
Ragnarok is just that formula </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Taika Waititi
was was directing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> because that's like basically his formula. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I see, I see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Man] His staff was like tired </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of doing all Shakespearian thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, well, every single </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god damn Marvel movie now
has the funny guy there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? Someone who's like
just there to crack jokes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You mean Iron Man?
- Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, no, he doesn't crack jokes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, there's someone
else like, "Oh gosh, geez. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what was going on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, some fucking
terrible joke to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] "Ant-Man" in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like most of it. Like all of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but who gives
a fuck about Ant-Man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I give a fuck about "Ant-Man," okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was a fun movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the D tier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of fucking Marvel characters, all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like literally, no one gave
a shit about "Ant-Man." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I feel like that's
what they're doing now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like the newer superhero movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like some of them you watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're just like, "Oh,
you're really scraping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the bottom of the barrel." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I just like don't care </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> about Marvel movies anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like literally the last
good Marvel movie I watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was probably like "Iron Man 2." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What! (laughing)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Infinity War" was
just, did you watch that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- Oh, it's such a good film. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like "Infinity War"
was actually very good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only know about the film
through all the fucking memes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, is that the last
Marvel movie you've watched? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You don't go to the cinema much, huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I just don't watch
fucking Marvel films </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I just don't care
about super hero stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, wait. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wait. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fucking "Deadpool" was Marvel, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Technically it was Marvel,
but it was also Fox owned. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it doesn't feel like a Marvel film. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah.
- Well, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's kind of, it's
in the X-Men universe, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- More along those lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But the X-Men Universe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has gone to shit too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the X-Men
Universe has gone to shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which sucks because I really
enjoyed the X-Men stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, "Logan" was like the best film, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last best X-Men film.
- Well yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then every subsequent film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> with anything to do with
X-Men was just terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I mean, I don't
even even think X-Men </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like that great of a
franchise to begin with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they've always struggled with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've always struggled to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they've had like some good films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the X-Men franchise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you take a franchise as a whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and lay them in front of me, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there's more bad movies
than there are good movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the X-Men franchise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, especially the new stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And any movies out now you
want to go and watch, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to watch, what's
out in cinemas right now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Dune."
- "Dune." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dune." That's the one I want to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's pretty much the only thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've been hyped about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to watch "Shang-Chi" I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When that's coming out on like Blu-ray? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It might already be out on DVD. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's already out on DVD? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You still buy Blu-rays? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, because like when
it's out on Blu-ray, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when it's out to the public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how like my mind
fucking works I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's rare for me to go to
a cinema to watch a movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that means I better be
hyped for this fucking movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, you said that
last time we talked about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Man] End of this month. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, what other movies
are coming out this... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I still wanna go see "Belle." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normally the holiday period
has a lot of stuff coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> The new "King's Man" movie coming out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- Don't care. I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kind of want to watch that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - "King's Man" is definitely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I can watch this at home kind of movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- I'm not going out of my way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch "King's Man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I want to see the new "Matrix" movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever that comes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I'm watching that in cinemas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm watching that in cinemas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all I really know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - When is the next "John
Wick" movie coming out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I want to know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Soon, soon.
- It is actually soon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] Oh wait. Sorry. I
think there's still filming so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been like two years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I need it! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It takes time to make a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it Donnie, what's his name? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Donnie Yen. Yeah? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> He's in the new "John Wick." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He is?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Donnie Yen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he took a selfie
with Keanu Reeves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What!? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I love Donnie Yen, he's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So when you go to a screening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like a hype screening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the new "Avengers" movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate it when it's full. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you think if the crowd is hyped up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and reacts to it and says shit- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate that.
- I hate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- I think we've established </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this before on the podcast actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Have we? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've spoken about this before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate going to a cinema
where the crowd is loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've definitely said this on an episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is deja vu, the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I said like, I'm not
here to see a fucking concert. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm here to see a movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it's like, I hate it when
people are like whispering </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and being like, "Oh, this is the part </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where this thing comes." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Shut up, shut up!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like when a hype scene happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the fucking cinema erupts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you like it when it happens or- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, when it's like at the climax, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, it's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But like when they're
nonstop doing it, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like shut the fuck up.
- Okay. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like if it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, like the scene in "Endgame" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when he gets the fucking hammer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, sure, everyone lost their shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I want it to be completely silent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was annoyed in "Endgame though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the guy next to kept,
like he'd already seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so was with someone
and he kept telling them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this part's gonna be sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "We're in the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shut the fuck up! Let him watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're telling me, I'm
right next to you. Shut up!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What'd you think's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best cinematic
experience you've had then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - "John Wick 3."
- "John Wick 3." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That shit was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I loved watching that in cinemas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The cinema was empty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I had a great time. It was beautiful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I watched like the last
viewing of the day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was totally empty. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I got to like put my feet up
on the chair in front of me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Had popcorn, it was beautiful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was wonderful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I said it in
the previous episode, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but "Dune" was fucking amazing for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the best cinematic
experience you've ever had? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of recent time that I can remember, yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was incredible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, any movie with
like a Hans Zimmer soundtrack, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't hear the fucking soundtrack, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you fucking feel- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You feel that shit, yeah.
- Holy shit, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That Dolby digital audio 7.1
shit your pants experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When I went to go see fucking
"Inception" in cinemas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the first time you hear that boom, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like I told my colon was gonna explode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from how bassy that shit was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - This man must like
edit on like fucking iPod </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like first-generation headphones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like no way can a man
listen to that much bass daily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they can't be healthy.
- And not be deaf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He must listen to them through
like some shitty earphones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so he can barely hear it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So he's like, "Oh shit, it
needs more bass I think." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this point, he doesn't listen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> He fucking feels the bass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if he like goes
to the cinema, he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck, that's how much bass I put in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Shit. I didn't realize, I
couldn't hear it. Fuck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - More bass! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cut the subwoofers on
his fucking speakers, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd like to think he's just editing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off of laptop speakers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> On like Garage Band or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Add more bass I think. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It needs a little more bass I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why Hans Zimmer's house
doesn't have any windows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just explodes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Imagine being Hans Zimmer's neighbor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's 2:00 a.m. and all I hear is bass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's an alien
spaceship docking outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so much bass going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nope, it's just Hans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hans, man, come on, man.
You know it's 3:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Our kids are going to school
tomorrow. Can you please stop? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> We understand you're making the soundtrack </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to "Inception" but this- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It sounds lit,
Hans, but not right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come on, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This is too much, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on, please. Hans, stop, stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you imagine if
Hans Zimmer was Japanese? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> My God, his neighbors must think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that there is like a
magnitude six earthquake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every other day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - If Hans was Japanese he'd be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I would like to buy the
entire building please." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much rent is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Easy. I got you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, Hans Zimmer has to like
locate his house in a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where seismographs cannot pick it up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it'll false positive
earthquakes otherwise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - He'll like set off an earthquake warning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every other day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hans Zimmer is always recording audio. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (imitates alarm beeping) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hans Zimmer is testing
out his new subwoofer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's terrible. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my lord. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Worth it, though. It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Man, you know what the hardest thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> about being an adult is that
I realized the other day? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Go on, youngest one here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you said my mom or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like what do you mean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That too. Daddy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Something that you can't
be prepared for as a child. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Something that you don't get exposed to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Menopause.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Obviously. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Picture it, I was at my local bakery </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I go to go and get my favorite item. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They changed the recipe,
they changed the item. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's no longer the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They substitute the materials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that made this fantastic piece of food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do the kids call
that again? Pain picker. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, no one prepares you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for your favorite food
items at a fast food chain </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or a food place changing.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How do you deal with that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you cope with that?
- I can do one better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- So you go to a restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a local restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a local, you
know, local restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not a chain or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just it's your
local restaurant. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then one day you go
there and for some reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know why, the food
just tastes different, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The food just doesn't hit as hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you can't put your finger
on why until you realize, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, the chef's gone somewhere else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That food will never
taste the same ever again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The chef's gone independent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it was the chef all the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that made the food tastes good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't the restaurant itself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have actually had that in Japan once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was so fucking trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I never wanted to cry more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while eating food in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "This doesn't taste bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but my childhood is just
over there somewhere." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree that's bad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think the fast food one's worse, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause the fast food is like comfort. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You always go to get the
same thing with fast food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what it's selling point is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I think the local
restaurant is the comfort. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a person who
murdered your best friend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is just wearing their skin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he walks into your house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's just pretending
to be your best friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hello friend, it's me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So McDonald's did this like in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's a problem with Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you've got these
amazing seasonal items, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or items that come around is it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they only last like three weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So when you find an absolute
banger of a food item </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a menu, you know the time is ticking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're okay with it leaving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you you knew the rules of the game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you went into order that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You knew that you were about to get hurt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you didn't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You wanted that spicy.
- You knew the rules. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You knew the rules.
- And so did I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You knew the rules and so did I. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate that how said that
'cause I was thinking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You knew the rules and so did I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like don't say it, this is dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But when there's an item </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that has been there for like ages, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're talking like years- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Did you get
Rickrolled by the slice? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, and then, fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, and then the food item changes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have been doing this your whole life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've been eating there, you've
been getting this one item </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it changes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like a betrayal of the century. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you could have murdered my family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You walk in, you look at
the menu, and you just fear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey hum
"Never Gonna Give You Up") </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll have the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you mean? Where's it gone? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why would they do this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This must be a mistake.
I'll have this item. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They said they don't have it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I cry. No. This must be a mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Please check the back, check the back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There must be some left! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Please! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I do still think the
local restaurant is worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The local restaurant one hits the worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Because you
move, you move all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you experienced it though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I have, but you fucking move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no.
- What do you mean you move? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look, if it's a local restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you move every fucking two years, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, like the local restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like the same people
running the restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just the chef's different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but like fast food items, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's some stuff that's
been there for like decades </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Your local restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll only experience it
for like two years at a time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's why you live there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. No
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are some restaurants
that are just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you never find food as good as that again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where?
- Anywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are some places like anywhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anywhere you live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, but you move
every move every two years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or every year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but sometimes you go
back to the restaurant and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, that's the worst though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you go back to your hometown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there is like this specific restaurant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's just changed, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And you'll never get a taste
of your childhood ever again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Or you'll never get a taste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of that taste of home ever again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you didn't know before you move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you were saying
goodbye to that piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That Indonesian restaurant
in my local mall in Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The moment that disappeared,
I had to like hug my mom. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like losing a family member. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I still think when they
change an item of groceries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or fast food is worse, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause that's what you have
all the time, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember I used
to get Dairylea Dunkers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time in the UK.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even as an adult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's called-
- Great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of like a
fake cheese cream whip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds disgusting.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not like a whip though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a cheese kind of spread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> How would you describe Dairylea Dunkers? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ah...
- How would you describe it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of like a breadstick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like a breadstick that you dunk in- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a breadstick in one part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like a cheese kind of esque thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the other.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You probably have something-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> We have something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So they made that in the UK, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then I think they changed their recipe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I was like 20 years old. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They changed how they made the cheese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's tasted significantly cheaper. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why are we eating
that at 20 years of age? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, don't question why the fuck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was eating that at 20 years, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it was really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it was a really nice snack. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It tasted amazing and I'd love to get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was a blast of
nostalgia every time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they had it in my local supermarket </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I would get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And one time I got it, I
bought like a four pack, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a big like, like a family
four pack, I stocked up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Hell yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dug in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I opened it up, one bite and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Something has changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There has been a
disturbance on the cheese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Isn't that the worst though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and then at that moment, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's when you realize I bought
a whole pack of this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did another one and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "They've changed it, they've
definitely changed it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's definitely not me.
- I asked my friend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Listen, did
you have the old one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I gave it to
them and they were like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Okay, try it now,
like try this new one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tell me if it's changed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "No, it
doesn't taste any different." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "When's the
last time you had it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, "Over a year ago." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "You wouldn't know, then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You wouldn't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] 'Cause it's
a slow gradual change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one year, you wouldn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I emailed the company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I wanted to know if they did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to know if I
was being crazy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you're definitely
crazy. That's for sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who did you email? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the.. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The email on the back of the packet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I found the company online. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is only because
I wouldn't have done this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if my friend didn't say,
"No, they didn't change it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "They changed it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like,
"They didn't change it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "They changed it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And so I found out the company- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It sounds like a deleted
scene from "American Psycho." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like you're so infatuated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, I understand
this sounds stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's because it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like an "Always Sunny" episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I wanted- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He didn't realize the cheese was wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They deny it, Connor
goes to the fucking factory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like," Tell me the truth! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you're lying to me!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanted to know
because I wanted to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if my taste buds have changed
or if I was being crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or I just needed to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was driving me insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I emailed them, right? No response. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I call up their customer
service, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now I need to know
'cause they didn't reply. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I call them up and I asked
them and I'm like, "Hey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so this type of Dairylea Dunker thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did you change the recipe at
any point in recent time?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And they were like, "Hmm,
can I get back to you?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "You're not
gonna get fucking back to me." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- How long ago was this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, this was like three years ago. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] And I'm still
waiting for the reply. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like four years
ago. Four years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, I gave them my number </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they actually called me back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They said no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no."
- Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who would've fucking thought? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I said, "Check again,
check again." Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then I was like, "What the fuck, man?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was so annoyed, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought, fuck, like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucked it up, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why am I an idiot? Why
did I think it changed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- A year later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I got an email reply </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying that they had
changed one of the aspects </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the cheese or
something that they did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, I felt vindicated, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt like, you know how like
when you watch those movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about someone being
wrongly convicted in court </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they finally get out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Thank you. Thank
you guys. I'm finally free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I finally solve the mystery
that they fucking changed it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't believe they
emailed you back a year later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Me too, me too.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, like that employee
must've really fucking cared,. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know?
- I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We care about all our customers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not really sure
how that happened though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really bizarre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Somebody like fucking
dusted off their inbox </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, (blows) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember that one guy,
he emailed us last year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the ingredients changed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're probably sorting
out the spam folder </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're like, "Oh, what's this?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't expect them to
even answer my call back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the fact they call me
back just to tell me no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like that's weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's probably because
you're probably the one person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who actually fucking called them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, great
customer service you guys have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> At least I can say that much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never heard of a single person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> actually phoning customer
service for like a food item. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you call me a Karen.
- No, it wasn't a Karen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't like, "I demand to know!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "By the way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did you change the recipe by any chance?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't matter how
strongly you say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean, a Karen- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the fact that
you even fucking did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is like more telling than anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why am I not allowed to ask that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because who cares?
- I care. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Who actually fucking cares? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why am I not allowed to know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a cheese stick
that is given to children. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It is the literal children's snack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I wanted to know.
- You're an adult. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanted to know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't ask rudely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just asked them, "By the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just wondering, did
you change the recipe?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that rude? That's not rude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not about being
rude, it's just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It's strange.
I understand it's strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's very strange. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] But there's
nothing wrong with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The determination. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What what's wrong with that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It took like 10 seconds to email them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But the fact that you
also called them up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, wait, I got to know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how long did they put you on hold? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, like instant.
- How long was that ringing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was instant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They literally- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because no one
probably calls that number. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because no one's calling them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's calling them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can only imagine like the receptionist </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, "That phone rings?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Disappointed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they had to blow the dust off it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before they pick it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, 'cause I think
what inspired me to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> is that on UK there's a
TV show on channel four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where they would try and find out where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> food items came from in the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So like if it was like canned tomatoes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and it would say like "made
in Argentina" or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would just like go
on this relentless triad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go and like fucking find out
where it actually came from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And then they would go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and visit the place where it came from. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Right. I mean,
that's interesting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I think I was inspired. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, I want to
know, tell me, tell me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, I understand that it's not, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never done that since, but- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I don't think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I was being rude or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just asked them if they changed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'm not criticizing you being rude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I've done
something badly here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm being criticized for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted know one of
my favorite child food- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you're not being criticized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for being rude or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like shocked
that you were that bored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it wasn't boredom,
it was determination. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just surprised you with that bored </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> to be that determined. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, I had other stuff to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just ignored it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Clear, they weren't that important then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you telling me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've never procrastinated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in intriguing ways on your work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish I could say I could procrastinate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in intriguing ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, it's never an intriguing way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, if that is what is the benchmark </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for intriguing then no- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just load up a meme on
YouTube and I'm just like fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like, I don't know, play a game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, in some weird way in my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to justify my procrastination, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like if I've done
something that was on my mind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I wanted to do, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's almost not procrastination in a way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] All right.
- Like when I'm (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes there are some videos
that I don't want to film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm dreading the filming process, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's quite a difficult video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might struggle with it or I'm not too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'm not like a
100% on the video idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know until it's edited, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So I kind of dread it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So sometimes I might just put it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes it's like great procrastination </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like doing my chores. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like this is procrastination </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that is justified in my head. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But I know-
- But is it really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it is because I should
have done that one thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm lying to myself by doing
tasks that I need to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could easily be done any other time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm just pushing forward now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't want to do that one thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That is procrastination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is because that's
the procrastination I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It's efficient procrastination, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's still procrastination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think there's such a thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as efficient procrastination.
- No, there is, there is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, there's slightly more
efficient procrastination, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the same time, you have
a task that you need to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you are putting that task off, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can lie to yourself and say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, I'm doing something else
productive, like cleaning," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I do as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, I'm just like-
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes there are videos
that you need to do ASAP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're just putting them off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you don't want to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's procrastination, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> regardless of what you're
doing to put it off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you could be
doing CPR on someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and saving their life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're still procrastinating
on that video, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let them die, bro. Do the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm kidding. It's a joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would not have chosen to clean that day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only reason I chose to clean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was because I didn't want
to do the fucking video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thus I'm procrastinating on that video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you ever do the cleaning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where you don't need to procrastinate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically you
procrastinate on the cleaning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> until you tried to procrastinate
with something else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you procrastinate by cleaning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you not found
yourself doing those tasks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've been putting off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when you really don't
want to do something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, I just don't lie to myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's horrible.
- I just don't lie to myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I only clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm procrastinating on making videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the other day-
- So you admit it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The other day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like cleaned my house
about five million times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'd run out of things
to procrastinate on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I made this video called like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Jojo fans when they figure out
their bros don't suck dick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was made because
I was procrastinating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on making videos and I'd
already cleaned the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like... (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is really scraping
the bottom of the barrel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that is still procrastinating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know still procrastinating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just said it wasn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You said it wasn't procrastinating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm saying like
there's no such thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like every procrastination is made equal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it procrastination
if it's monetizable? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It's still procrastination. Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was trying to help you, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I threw the rope and
you threw it back at me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm arguing-
- [Connor] What do you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you don't want to film a video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, sorry, you were arguing. Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm arguing that all
procrastination is made the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's essentially you
are putting something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an important task-
- But that's what I argued </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you disagreed with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You said that you can like
min-max procrastination, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I said you're still procrastinating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you're like cleaning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's still procrastinating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I argued.
- Oh, I thought you- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never said it was a good thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I thought you were
just arguing the opposite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No!
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't say that at all! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Listen to me, Garnt! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is why the Trash
Taste Podcast is arguments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because Garnt- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Because no one fucking listens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you, Connor, you're wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I just want it
to disagree with, Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mother fucker, Garnt! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally said your point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, hold on for a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to readjust for a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I was like halfway
through that conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like you just made the same point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you just said my
point. What the fuck... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry, I was just back
to the fucking Dairylea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> My mind was just like
I can't believe this- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you like the Babybels? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you have those in Australia? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah.
- Fucking love Babybels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I miss those man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nothing beats cheese string. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We've talked about this.
Nothing beats cheese string. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cheese string.
- Cheese string's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> on another level, but
Babybels next in line. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does America have Babybel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All this talk of food is
making me fucking starving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm starving too.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's get some food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Fuck the episode, let's get food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That salad wasn't enough
for me earlier today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm actually starving right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> All this talk about food, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, fuck the episode.
Here's the Patrons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. Yeah, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gamers, we're about to have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> some fucking Dairylea Dunkers right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Old recipe Dairylea Dunkers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Apparently not because it's shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even though it's the same recipe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. We don't know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were two different companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so one of them said no
one of them said yes so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So we will never know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was your favorite
snacks growing up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Have they changed over time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure you've had a local restaurant- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you ever called
them up or emailed them? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure you've had a local restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> change on you as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> That is probably heartbreaking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yep.
- I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, I feel like being
told Santa isn't real </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> every time I go to my local restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and something's changed about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You know?
- Get over it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's called being an adult, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get over it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey, do the Patreon thing. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> You know? It's whatever, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I wonder, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how did they find
out that, for example, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like the horse meat thing in the UK? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Who figured that out? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Someone who eats a lot of horse meat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, someone who just loves horses. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I smell it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Someone probably just tested it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- People like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, scientists always test
stuff from supermarkets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do they?
- Do they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can't just not test the meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How else we gonna check
it's what they say it is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, clearly no one did for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because the horse meat was in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, you know,
it's constantly checked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, you could do it one
way, change your supplier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then no one checks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, we're getting something different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Anyway, horse meat. We're hungry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're fucking hungry.
I'm fucking hungry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - See you guys next episode, bye! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bye!
