<SPEAKER_02> - Come into my makeup first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) Do I look good? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, this is gonna be used, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's up ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And welcome to the first episode
of the Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The official first episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The official first episode,
we've finally made it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm your host for today Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and joining me every
week is Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey guys.
- What's up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, is finally happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's finally happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do not know how long
we've been planning this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how long we've
wanted this to have this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how long has it been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we've been conceptualize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this podcast for like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Over a year.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, t's been year, a year,
at least possibly years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I mean, when we
decided we were gonna move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to Japan, I think the first thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in our mind was we've
been gonna make a podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I think even before that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea of just us
finally getting into a room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just, you know, not
doing a one of collabo doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a continual collabo
has been, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in our minds for ages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I wanna say several years at least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least almost as known
as like along is half known, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't do really cool a podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just left out here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was tacked on at the end, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's talk about that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like how we first met each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think that's a good
introduction to this podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and how we've grown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes because you never know
there might be someone watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who doesn't know like who is that guy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who is that guy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's this guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hi, I'm Connor, hi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And another channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hopefully surprised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if there is someone watching first episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who doesn't know like who's three of us? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or maybe they've seen us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You see if you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then can you please
tell us in the comments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well how you found this video.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because we're just so famous
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then you've not this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for not knowing who we are there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I swear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, yeah let's actually, you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before we talk about that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we should probably talk
about what this podcast is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We just like rushing into things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause there's so, we're so like excited. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm finally (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who's so excited to get
this thing off the ground? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So basically Trash Taste as
the name implies is a podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we us three and maybe sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even a guest you never
know, comes onto the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and we basically talk
about our Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whether it comes to Anime,
Manga, and Otaku culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in general, or you never know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we might talk about
whatever the fuck we want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who knows? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause if, if you didn't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are all like Anime YouTubers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So
- No why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This guy called the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really felt myself
for that one definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This guy called CDAWG VA which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt that too.
- What is VAsten for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Virginia is all the comments
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's from Virginia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's okay, 'cause the amount of years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I still get comments, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like, they call me Gigg UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and not Gigguk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean listen, people
might call you Gigg UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I still know you as
the animation (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But AC in the thumbnails,
in the old thumbnails. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how I knew I was
watching an Anime Zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually I'm not curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How long have you been watching my videos? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because this ties into
how we first met as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've known you I mean,
I obviously, as I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've known you since the Anime Zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like...
- Which is like a long time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think I, like, I watched
you probably not knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you will like this
like YouTube personality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like, I was
in like a weird state. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I discovered
YouTubers until maybe about 2011. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe because they'd been around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for a long time since then.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And obviously you've
been around since then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I never like went onto YouTube being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm gonna go check
out my favorite YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of just use YouTube
up until around 2011. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I just use YouTube
as to like either watch music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or listen to music videos or just to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh this is an interesting looking video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think a couple of your videos will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the interesting looking ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I remember actually
the first video I ever watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from you surprisingly was not EvAbridged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh share okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched EvAbridged
when I like the idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of an came around.
- And an bridged series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah and I was like, oh a bridging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That sounds fun, but tedious as fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no, I think the first
video I watched from you was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh God, I probably wanna say it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Summer Wars Review you did? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the one you did like 2000 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's going (mumbles)
what's the fuck man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never even saw your EvAbridged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just, cause I didn't watch Davis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was a lot of watched your bri... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what is sounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I wanna watch that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think I watched some of your stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just knew you always the British one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's my brand name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause there was like,
it was like Tristin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you in my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that was it to a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was, when I got into it like 2013, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I start watching YouTube a
lot, especially anime stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but so how long have
you been doing YouTube for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been doing it since 2007. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like an actual OG. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll have to like Trace
Back, but I'm thinking I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the fifth ever Anime YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all the time might be
like four, four fifth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I've been there since the beginning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can recite the entire
history of Anime YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which we're definitely
gonna do with like a future </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not for this episode,
'cause there's a lot to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for now I remember the first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember the exact first
video I saw from you, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember your videos
just getting recommended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be constantly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like my first thought was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how was no one taking the
handle, the anime (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been on usual for
so many fucking years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just now someone
it's called the Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No but the thing is,
someone did take the hand land </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's why like on
like even my YouTube URL </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like my Twitter and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the Anime Man but it's I it's a one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because somebody over a
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like YouTube someone took the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like this guy who
never uploaded any videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's been around since like 2007. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah it's always just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "men you are such a son of a bitch." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, well, what am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right fuck (mumbles) to one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Somehow that caught on and
I don't know how the fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I've regret that name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it works for as you ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the reason I was
called the Anime Zone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're an Anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah because back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He will sing the song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you could just type an Anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was just all my videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, man, I've won this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've playing the game correctly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I came along,
I was like, hold my beat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're in the zone, I'm the man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I remember the
first time I have was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I don't think I ever
saw one of your videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The first time I heard about
you Conner was actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you "auditioned" for
one of my Abridged series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah is yes so I
haven't told this story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to Joey yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I did a casting call for one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in minutes videos, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I told people to send
in their some of the videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm trying to remember what this was now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's going all the way back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I asked people to
send in their demo reel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and most people send in their demo reel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this guy, this fuck doesn't
even send in a demo reel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He just sends in a YouTube video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of him doing League of
Legends character impressions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So why you should also
never do that yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah don't, don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When someone asked for
demos, send a demo reel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know I think at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have a character demo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I still don't have
a character demo reel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I never needed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, his things were a
lot of character demos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on Twitter, you'll hear them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They've really, really bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the thing is when
you're making it yourself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have anyone to say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "hey you displease kind of sucks." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like every time I've
made a professional demo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had like a director
who's at hand shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in every scene and told me what to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it sounds good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because someone who can
hear your voice and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do this and that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Back then, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is before I started doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of professional stuff and that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a great way to introduce someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is also another thing
you shouldn't send a demo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to someone if it's garbage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you guy, like this
guy still remembers that shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I even remember because
he was the only person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who didn't send a demo reel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just sent a YouTube video
of him doing impressions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Never send like if there is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a checklist of things
not to send for a demo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do not send character impression. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's such a big, that's
such a big dick move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I don't even
need cast demo reels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> My impressions are good enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sorry about that.- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, I mean, would you remember
which characters you did? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just to bunch them manly
guys from League Legends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just anyone with a low voice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did long still (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, its been awesome
seeing you how far you've come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from sending in a character
impression reel to be like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like, I
thought it must have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a year or two
after I started as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I still like, you think
that you figure stuff out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> after a year but like you
realize when you look back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're still, you
just didn't know share </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what year did you start? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - YouTube? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube I started 2015,
- 2015. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 2015, I started voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really in like 2013, like 2014. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So that gave me a big like advantage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went into it with like
a great mind microphone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which a lot of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause that voice acting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I mean, funny
enough how I met you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> actually have the email sent to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Weuh, weuh, weuh you have an email? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have the email. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before we started recording this one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we're going to talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like how we all met one another. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This guy was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think Joey remembers
the first time we met. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I do though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, (mumbles) read the email that I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay this is what I had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why you you sent it to me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah so this was about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how I must've been like four
months into me doing YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I had like maybe 30, 40K subs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I think Joey, I think
he had like 900K at this time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably.
- He was something like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you had a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like way more than I had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I sent you an
email saying (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like formal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hello there, my name is
Connor or CDawgVA on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why this is making any
sense grammatically? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbles) I wish is commas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hello there. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> and then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Channel here

<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, here's where it starts
to get real crunch again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I've been working on a Levi
versus Sebastian Rap Battle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay wait, I'll finish

<SPEAKER_02> "And it is about 90% complete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I noticed you recently did a Rap Battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was well done." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wow, I couldn't have
kissed your ass more here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's more of an insulting
each other a character rap. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> I'm kind of mean when
I see a video normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like collabo,

<SPEAKER_00> - Its normally like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> You're pitching the

<SPEAKER_03> So that's how I met you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I fucking remember that too, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because yeah, the the rap
battle I did was so bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ♪ I could've spend more time ♪ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ pwning royals at chess ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ but looks like I gotta prove to you ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ that I'm the best. ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ You wanna fight, little emo? ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ Well, be my guest! ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ I fought till the end ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ until I got a knife in my chest. ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was pretty fucking
battle at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was the first time I
ever used the green screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It might be (cheering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even like because I was
in like my tiny bedroom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was no place to like
prop up the green screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what I had to do, it's so ghetto. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What I had to do was I had
to get the green screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and literally like tape it to the ceiling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've done exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like let it down and
just stand in front of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I had no lights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could see my shadow fucking flickering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in and out the whole video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I obviously couldn't rap at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a little bit better now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah it was, what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a light no it was L from Death Note </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus Lelouch from Code Geass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember.
- And I played Lelouche </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and another friend of mine played L. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think that video has
like half a million views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how?
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean this is back when it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like Epic Rap Battles of History. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah we basically
wanted to do an history </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but with no cost plays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a just. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rapping in front of a green screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Checks out that's like 2015 YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But basically like that
kind of somehow popped off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for my channel and then yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I actually was writing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with Gray Fox at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Amazing guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought like we had like a burger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We had like so many like
Grey Fox had made the tracks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for many beats and they were like amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man sending emails. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's such a boom away
to slide into something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not to mention, we
added each other on Skype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The back, the good old days of Skype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I think like your
Skype account got hacked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like a sort. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it got hacked twice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That I know how I met
you, but it was weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw Sydney was following me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Sydsnap my fiance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and I think I followed her back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so I knew of Sydney and then Sydney DM me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She'll say that she
didn't Sydney DM first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like, you're going to MCM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a convention in London </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like yeah okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then Sydney was like,
"come, come to this meetup, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can meet me in Garnt." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't get to meet
Garnt he was too busy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I turned up like an idiot like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like sea dog and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the time I had like 200 K subscribers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like a substantial
amount for that time period. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was funny because you had a audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was vastly different from
every other Anime YouTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean still like that to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] Yeah, yeah.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gone like a lot less so at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and around 2000, the peak of it at 2014, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a 93% female audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is unheard of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think his nickname when
first met him was the 93%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> We would just like how's the 90% doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay I got bullied for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really wanna start
calling you (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like 55, 60% now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's leveled up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like you are going to enjoy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's crazy though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's like a whole
YouTube is in Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All dudes there was like one
or two girls but just all dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So every time I turned up to
like an Anime YouTuber meetup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like, "fuck
who the is this guy?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How's he got 200K, how
does, how did he get that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How would no one of us know who he is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why this guy from Virginia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I mean that time had gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we went from there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah can I tell the story about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how the first time we met? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sure?
- Yeah, 'cause. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know where you're
gonna start this case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay so the first time we met in person, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so it was like a 2000 and is it 17 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] or 16 or 17? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so, I knew Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know that he knew who I was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, and vice versa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I knew Garnt, but I
didn't know if he knew me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so this was back when I had, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you didn't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I took a hiatus on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two years because
like got a real time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a real job and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And in that time I had gone from being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of the most
popular Anime YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to just, you know someone
who had taken a hiatus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in that time Joey had like exploded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you've reached numbers
that's back in my time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know was even fucking possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you were like close to a million, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you were like be like
(mumbles) at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the first time I saw Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we were like in Little Tokyo or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I remember
exactly where it was too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was that part in like the
back half of Little Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wrack it's like underneath a building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you go into where there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a figuring shop there in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you were walking with Jeff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah that's what a Jeff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think Jeff said hello to Misty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they were both tall motherfucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he was just like standing
next to two fucking skyscrapers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while we're just hanging out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember looking at
you and you looked at me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we didn't say shit to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought this, I
thought this motherfucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> must hate me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This, motherfucker hates me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And at the same time I like gone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like looked at each other in the eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy definitely hates me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This guy hates my guts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm just like man, Joey
is such an arrogant piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of shit man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I can't believe this guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember we shook hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like, "hi I'm Joey, nice to me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, "hi, I'm
Garnt, nice to meet you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that was it, that's was the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so awkward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Had never heard this story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well because the only people
who were there was Misty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jeff and Arche. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just thinking, us too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was like very small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fast-forward like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who he is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was next year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it might've been even less than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I came to a trip,
went onto a trip to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something and then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You randomly DMed me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason he follows me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So maybe he doesn't hate me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - May be he is cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - May be he is cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah, we we DMed each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we met in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we just like instantly just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fucking great friends, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and from that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We went to in his no
we met up in our Cobre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we like hang out a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we went to in Izakaya in Ueno </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Till like two in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like something
ridiculous like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We missed the last train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we were like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like a bromance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- We missed the last train. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We had so much fun together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause we had the moment when we just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were singing in there Izakaya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, I thought you hated me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, how
don't you hate on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we don't hate each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then after that we
had like a Karaoke Night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where we... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I think it was
like a few days later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and I think that's when the seeds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the podcast was so in my think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we were up to,
we missed the last train </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were just with Karaoke
with each other and Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was like two other people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then everyone else had fallen asleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was just us two and one other guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was it like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember who the other guy was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Four guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't like a
friend of Garnt or mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just a dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He didn't know who we were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, he didn't know that we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Anime YouTubers or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So we were up at 5:00 AM, drunk shits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then me and Joey just
start hosting this panel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this one guy all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We each had like a
Karaoke microphone each </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like echo you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were just like,
welcome to the panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's this one dude across the table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like (cheers). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause yeah, he didn't know who we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we still would just hosted
this Anime panel for him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even know him,
if he watched anime or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm like Joey, what's your opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Bucky Mourner Gutter,
who is the best skill? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when all for like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and this went on for like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then after that, we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we need to host a panel together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we managed to do that last year at AX </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which was awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was amazing.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like two, three years in the making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in between that, we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surely we gonna make a
podcast all the time then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And here we are after fucking what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Three or four years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - From like first conception. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, even like planning
this whole podcast out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as well like took a very, very long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because this is
actually a studio for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes so we had to
like, get our own studio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as you can see, we're still working on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still working on it,
but give us some time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stick around for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like getting a studio in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Tokyo my God don't
even get me started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on how hard that was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure we can talk about
in future our experiences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with just renting stuff in Japan, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah now you know, what's
funny when you guys are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you said, he like just clicked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that after you guys
start talking it's so like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that happens easily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're both like around
the same, like sub thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause there's no question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're trying to leach off each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember like
when I first started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and when I was trying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were like first like hanging out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always felt like, man they wonder if I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like a leach or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause like I had like 150, 200 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they had like million plus right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you just get this thing in your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, man, am I like leaching? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do they think that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then like when you get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think now I don't give a shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because like I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like concerning you and I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we popped off very naturally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because spoiler we never ended up doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that fucking Rap Battle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that just like disappeared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think the first time
I like publicly did something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with you was on your stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah you did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we played BROFORCE together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like three hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's still up on, on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah and then I think we just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I played a lot of games
on your stream with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think we just hang out at AX </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just went and then obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause we tie like Metal Slug (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Metal Slugs is like my favorite games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I think we
just did British things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and met up and got, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's so easy to
befriend other British people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's just like, we
just get it I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not, like going off to what you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about feeling like your
leaching from someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird right because you can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as someone who's been in the position of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, not being a smaller YouTuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and in a larger YouTuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's you can kind of get a sense just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from meeting a plus in this house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually if you meet
them in real life, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Online it's so fucking difficult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to gauge what a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what someone's character is actually like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, if they're
trying to, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> leach off you get clout or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but especially at a event like AX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where the real person comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you can definitely
get a better judge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of character at a convention
or meeting someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in real life, like a big event, like AX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there's also a lot with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that when you're at AX, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think some people think, okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've only got five minutes with this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've got to like befriend him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they, I think they, like
sometimes they go overboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with like trying to impress
you where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck is this guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, one thing I've noticed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with when it comes to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I've been to so many conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like people have come up to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just for that like five
minutes that they have time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with somebody that's an like just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna say kiss us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know, when
someone's trying to kiss us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like, but like the thing is that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least earlier on when I
would meet people like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're trying to be nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me during those five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know if they were
Just trying to kiss my ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or if they would genuinely nice people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the one way I
found it is if they can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess like maybe try and
maintain that friendship </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with you and try and stay contact with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after that event. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I think there like
genuinely nice people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I don't
wanna make it sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're all fucking assholes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Talking with, hearing about how you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just messaged Conner back
from just that one email, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I also remember the point when
I would just try to like talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to everyone and collaborate with everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then you get to a
point when you see that 90% </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of these emails, 90%
of these people talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to you don't actually mean what
they mean or they're looking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for something and you get a sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get a sense for that as time goes by. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like you can just
glance at an email now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know what they're up to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What I'm trying to get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Usually if it starts
with I'm 13 years old, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's something (mumbles) to delete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually here's a question for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the way I know
you've got some stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this Conner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are some of like
the weirdest fun emails, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've ever received? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, I get them every week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like to say every week, but it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gotten some where it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely think like I'm
actually scared to open it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though there's like
no attachments, no links </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything, but even a subject title. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally just, I open
it and it says, "you're cool." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Opening an email like
that at like midnight is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the scariest ever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm just like did
my computer just get act. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if this is like an elaborate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like chores or if it's
just like a 10-year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's learning to use email
for the first time like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like thanks but who are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When they just send a link, that's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's sounds like (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No that's all it looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Men I don't know, I've
got so many stories, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess of emails because
I guess it's my fault </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I kind of encouraged
that a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've made multiple videos
where I've got content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from my email sometimes it's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then also I think now
since I've joined an agency, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad for the agency </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they sometimes
see the shit I get said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily I normally like delete the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know are like
they're just trolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The full by agency can see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I don't want some
Japanese worker opening my email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it being like, "hey, I
think you're dummy thick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm 13 by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You get stuff where they'll say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they wanna date you
and they'll put the 13. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is Chris Hansen is
Chris Hansen emailing me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've spoken about
this in a video once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But there was someone who emailed me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I still remember this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause like I had an
interview, I replied to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was this interaction
where they sent me a script </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of phone sex that we'll gonna have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it looked like it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually still have the script. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna read it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's more to the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's the reason why
I decided not make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into a video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was like a script and (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first it was one script was me and her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and there was also a music setlist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that she'd chosen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that was when the music was playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You in the end by Lincoln Park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like pour some sugar on me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know like the cheesiest song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I thought in my head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause back then I read
all of them in depth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I thought wow, this is the video idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I can like, keep this going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's also another
script where is me having gay sex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with Sebastian Michael's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course
- Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that would be expected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's funny that's like
not the weirdest story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm surprised you didn't make a video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, okay this why and I feel bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope this person isn't watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So I interacted with them
a bit and they were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously I knew they were
gonna be strange right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you sent an email like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I started interacting
with them more and more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they started sending
me way too much information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's also another guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who sent me his birth
certificate by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't do that.
- That's dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't ask for his opening email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was his my birth certificate,
driving license, address. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also mentioned this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know which video I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mentioned all this, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I replied to this
person, I kept replying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with them 'cause they kept
replying with really funny stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, Oh my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can get an amazing video out of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, with the one thing they said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which made me think, okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now I just have to like completely
scrapple this is the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they said like, "oh
here are my hobbies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hobbies, blah, blah, blah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the way, I'm in the Special
Olympics Team for the USA." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "oh my God, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, no, no, like why you
shouldn't be sending this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I explained to
them, you know, I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, maybe you shouldn't
send this email to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, I don't think
this is appropriate way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm very sorry for like messing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with your time and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just, it was a whole
thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God, I'm in a asshole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Jesus Christ like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah there's so
many emails I've gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I made a whole video where, I went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a date with someone in it was a date. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- From an email. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was scary watching that video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were like Connor's gotta get cancer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This kid's gonna get stabbed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember you pitching
that video idea to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Conner I don't know if
that's the best idea, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean it turned out a good video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I pitched it like 10 of our friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's like, "wow, wow, wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Conner, Conner no, don't
do that, don't do that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whenever I ask my friend
was like genuinely worried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for you is like, I really don't think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think Connor's going to die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think if you watch the video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they felt more concerned for the girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because we turned up with light, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me, Evan Budan and another guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just won't go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah I just said one go alone right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like you know, but it
also awesome in the end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was all awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - She really nice about the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She actually liked the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So that was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She just walked into a casting couch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess like I don't get so about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly, I can't talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually don't get
that many weird emails </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or weird fan mails. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I guess, it's
'cause I mostly talk about anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's less about my
own personality, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I guess like
one weird email I got recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which wasn't even an emailed to me, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So someone used my email
and pretended to be me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and emailed STUDIO WIT. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I got the email here actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They emailed STUDIO WIT
pretending to be me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they use my email
and I got a notification </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the official studio
with like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the automatic notification that says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "hey you've submitted this email to us." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay so the email reads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hello, I am anime reviewer Gigguk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Conner laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will make a request of you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Many people once Eren and
Mikasa to have a relationship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Eren X Mikasa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think if this happens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> many people will enjoy the anime more." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And this has to be a troll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I would be pleased with
the development of events </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in this direction that it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hope you will evaluates my proposal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish you good day."
- Man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I wish you good day." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This sounds like the
email I sent contactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for more so we can
figure out the logistics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can figure the
logistics of Eren X Mikasa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, let's just
completely bypass this SAR </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> might just go straight to I, feel like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They have that the final say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like how they just emailed STUDIO WIT </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has no creative control </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over how Attack on Titan
is gonna end anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really want, I really wish that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like STUDIO WIT took that email seriously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like actually hooked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you say, "I'm a being late." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this popular animated review was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know Gigguk of right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "You know Gigg of right, Gigg UK?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If she wants Eren and Mikasa together?. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you think that's possible? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you make this a thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you please make this a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, season four, Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm ready, I'm ready. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, you never know like
none of us have caught up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on the manga, right?
- Yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it might, it might happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, it's a crime to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And if it does happen, we
can thank a certain email. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eren X Mikasa is a thing I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know, who calls this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think, I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To break out this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This is been a long time coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome to Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you want to know
drinking is going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of quite frequent occurrence on this show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So get used to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't imagine our intro
is gonna be that long though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> In my head I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (cheering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Finally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think , would you guys all say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that an Attack on Titan season four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as your most anticipated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Absolutely.
- Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So how do you even match
that hype of this point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait it's takes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it was meant to
be airing this fall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No this Summer I believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it was definitely, it was fall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I should have gone up
against the guy emails to deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Personal contact that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I think it's, I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's Eren it was scheduled to a next fall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've heard from,
because I made a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the first three seasons of (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've heard from pretty much everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's read the manga
that season four is going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be the best season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I have also heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean even if it was just mediocre, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it would still
like, just think it's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I did journey to
get there has been sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this last part was, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every (mumbles) was as hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's so rare that
you get to see a series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just improve over time every season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when Attack on Titan season
one was airing right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was, it was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I felt like it was very forgettable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the sense of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, I remember when season two ads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't remember anything
that happened in season one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't I remember
specifically in your video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the like seasonal review, you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember the Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you just play cricket noises. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember being like well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm watching Attack on Titan season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's good and I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I do agree like season two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because season one when I watched it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then season two came around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and actually dropped it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one cared drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think what it was, was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because season one was, you
know, all about like the action </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like building the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then season two was a lot of politics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes season two just took the pace </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause season one was like
a fucking roller coaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You were going up and
down every few episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you didn't know
what was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But to me it felt a bit empty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and season two felt much slower paced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was more of like a slow burn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they focus more on the characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I actually got really
drawn into the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way more into season two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But by the time season two ended, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, okay I'm now way more invested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but nothing really big has happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it was 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah it was just 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think everyone was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck we've waited four years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something for 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they rushed it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But you expected it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, definitely I think in season three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when that scene with Levi came out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as I think when it just exploded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone saw that GIF on Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like I got a fucking catch up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like saying like just
thinking about that scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like gives me goosebumps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember season three, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> part one I enjoyed so fucking much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I didn't realize I could care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the politics that
much in the Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember by the
time season three started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was enjoying Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for completely different
reasons than season one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can say the same thing
about every season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I've heard season four is going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be completely different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> completely different to
what's previously been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I mean like, I
don't remember when it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but me and Aki went to the
Attack on Titan exhibit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they did in Roppongi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And basically it was really tough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because what they did was essentially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they really catered to the Manga Reader, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately and I am
not the Manga Reader. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So in like the late of
rooms of this exhibit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they basically like on all the walls, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would have like the
original Ganga of the Manga right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in these frames, which is fucking cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then as he got
further down the exhibit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they would start showing stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that hadn't been adapted yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cover my eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But obviously there was just some stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I couldn't really avoid seeing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the tiny little bit that
I did say out of context, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow, there is no fucking
way that's happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then to top it off,
there was this room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This was like a really
experimental move on them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their part but there was this room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you had to go into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was completely pitch-black room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's just audio
playing on the speakers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this pitch-black room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what that audio is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's audio of what he say I'm
envisions the final chapter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the Attack on Titan time to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so this you should handled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no visuals, there's no visuals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just audio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's what he envisions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It will sound like adapted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The only thing we've heard was a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like background noises
and like ambient noises </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and Mikasa yelling Eren
from a long way away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that could mean anything (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was could mean anything, I mean like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm obviously not doing the audio justice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but sound it epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we get a one-to-one
reenact (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (cheering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all the well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt meows) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just were screaming in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm obviously not doing the audit just as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it sounded like when
I just like close my eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and heard that I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow I've never been more
excited for anime in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good to know that the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Manga will end
with Mikasa screaming Eren </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and she has that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Technically a spoiler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - She has done for the
entire fucking series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean with the track
record the Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean it's, every episode you could argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been really good, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean this story has just been, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no faults in
the story so far, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It holding up pretty well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I say it had been
building on his story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right really well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really, really well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like what if this, if
they nail this ending, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what like category is this end-of-life? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Master piece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What would you put it
as like in like anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the same category then if
it killed this last season? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My fucking God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like 'cause couldn't
even be in its own thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where like no anime is like as good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would say
- It's hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not to say, that's
a big statement right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I mean, I'm just
trying to think how many, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how many anime series have there been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's stretched out for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean
- Over 50 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Over 50 episodes, like
let's say four or five seasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and has like killed at this hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I would say it
be similar to something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter Hunter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Although I'd say it's, I haven't
seen Fullmetal Alchemist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I get that's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey screaming) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My fan base, my fan base knows this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a big fucking Meme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but Fullmetal Alchemist is that one anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I haven't seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We all have that one anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess when I think about you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Hunter Hunter for it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it hasn't ended though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is probably the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where you couldn't argue
it's in the same class </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess from a Locus
Brotherhood, maybe you could. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because you never
know like Hunter Hunter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> might, I'm hoping God, but you never know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but Hunter Hunter, might
end up like Yu Yu Hakusho. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's the problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think everyone's kind of beginning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to accept that slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the world is just especially now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with the dark continent stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which, you know it's a lot
of stuff in Hunter Hunter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's looking like it's
even more ambitious than before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's not releasing
chapters at a very slow, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gonna take a whole
lifetime to catch up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but going back to Attack on Titan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I called it like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's even if it was of the quality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of season three part two
ended in that quality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would be a modern classic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, for sure? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if it's even better than that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no fucking clue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that makes me so excited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we might be getting the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fact that there's
a possibility of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's just nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the last time I
was possibly that excited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like a followup was
One-Punch Man season two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all know how that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like it wasn't okay I
rewatched a few clips recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of One-Punch Man season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know like it wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we set our expectations
disgusting we have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was painfully mediocre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Seven Deadly Sins season one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what I'm hoping, what I'm hoping is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the next season, assuming
we get another one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of One-Punch Man is it
doesn't go to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That shit is still
like, I haven't seen any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of Seven Deadly Sins. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know anything about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never had the manga and
never watched the anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a part of me when I
saw footage of season three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I kind of wanna watch this now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just to see it devolve
into this current state. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember because the
fight that they fucked up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was one of the most collective sites. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the manga, right the survival. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah he was one of the most hyped fights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they fought it up
so much that fan animation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of that fight that was released before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looked better than the official fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because when I found out about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that scene is someone put it up on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and had to preface it by saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no this is not a fun animation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the official episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because everybody in that tweet was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this fun made? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This has to be fun made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like some guy
who like just learn how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to use flash like a week ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just, you know what
sticks out in my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that kick, the kick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When that give first came
out and I saw the kick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which you probably see
him on screen right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I lost it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, I laughed so hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I'd ever,
like, I've watched all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of Seven Deadly Sins up until that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I wasn't like a huge fun, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we bought every time
a new season was announced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be of UVA's I'd watched them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd never so quickly
lost interest in a series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just from seeing that one screenshot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Melitis like getting the bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what did they do to him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What did they do to him? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We've never seen anything like
is that happen anime before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like where a season is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so drastically like
changed studios and lost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure like if you take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know there have been, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know I'm going to kill myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for not remembering like what this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's been so many times that's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That drastic though.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It has been a few months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - May be because the difference
was is when it happened back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then is that there wasn't Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And when it happens now or
you know, when it happens now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there was just like a
bunch of light we'll talk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gathering, being linked, (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the only thing I
can think of right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is like off the top of my head is Bizarre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which I mean, it's changed studio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was technically a continuation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, what's worse than Bizarre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The second adaptation of Bizarre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the Seven Deadly Sins the new seasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bizarre.
- Really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It might say Bizarre, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I mean, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm seeing that from like
a hardcore Bizarre fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't heard the Mangas so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah so if he goes,
if you've read the manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm sure everybody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who's read the Manga can agree with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have never wanted
to like cry from sadness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how could they
do my boy guards like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, yeah, this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the Bizarre
adaptation was just a failure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on pretty much
- Every level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every level from like the animation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which everyone likes to point out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like the composition,
the sound design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, if you've heard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you heard that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (body parts breaking) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like sound, it's just,
what how did you get this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Who did you hire to do the sound artists? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking came up with that sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, how did you see
this big fucking iron sword? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's pull it out the Cal Bell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just do Jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Make everything a gunshot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean gun would been
even better honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can I talk about Jojo sound design? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I love Jojo sound design so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because sound design is something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that people don't normally talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you don't, you don't really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really hear people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like voice (mumbles) right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> When it's done well, you don't notice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so with Jojo sound design, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's one of the few shows where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you hear like a sound, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know is from Jojo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know the exact stance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, like sometimes
it's the exact episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the exact fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're that recognized when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're like not generic at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I fucking love Jojo sound design </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the reason why I
think the anime is as good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as it is, one of the reasons is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the sound design is so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, have you guys seen the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I assume you guys have seen the Jojo OPs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they add the sound effects. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's so much better, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why they didn't do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the Eren versions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's not really
what you see in an OPs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is pretty unconventional </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I mean, there's so many sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you could say, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I call it, like, when
you hear that gunshot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the punch, you know
what the Jojo punch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it makes it sound so meaty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I love that
- That's the punching sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like every time, you know like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a mood or like or
an oral or on like, the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is almost like gun like, isn't it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure it's like gunshot here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a gunshot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then obviously
there's a Waldo timestamp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (light strikes) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I feel like has almost
become the universal sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of stopping time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's also the you know, I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you talk about music alone, my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of the new season absolutely killed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, I think super, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a part of Giorno said this
in his review of Golden Wind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I feel the same way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this is Golden Wind
was the first adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of a Jojo where I think
the anime is better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you lose so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you take away that sound right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially the music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When you hear that Giorno's Theme come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Giorno's Theme is one of the few tracks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in anime that has been means to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it is Al megalomania. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I have not gotten bored of it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every like every version of heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of Giorno's Theme have the equally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just be like yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so like a piano
version, middle version, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's always been so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah go on so on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When we can go back to the gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the best music to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're working out is Jojo's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It works so well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know it should work well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but man when that piano hits, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing an extra rep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how tired you are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing that extra rep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's almost too hype sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you are like a shit I got
to keep doing this rapper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm dying right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know where my boy, Jojo down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of anime adaptations though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there is one topic I would like to cover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is quite timely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But just yesterday I
actually recording over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as of us recording this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I found or I I guess AKI found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that somebody is adapting,
Killing Stalking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mean it's not an official </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This needs the biggest
quote marks ever adapting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Adapting" Killing Stalking "Anime." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You there is no an
official animate adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone on Twitter thinks it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like pop most
the original Twitter post </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that blew this up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said an official adaptation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then in the reply to that tweet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they doubled down saying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, it was all official." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the thing that caught
my eye is the picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone was re-tweeting right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Three pictures of this tweet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One of them, it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The fuck it's a chAosOPUS STUDIO </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so like, 'cause AKI
found that on a timeline </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like Holy shit they're making us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Killing Stalking anime adaptation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, really let me see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I saw the pictures
on like the first two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like coming soon, 2020. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh shit okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I looked at the last one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like,
- Yeah, yeah right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who? (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is the Studio? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I legitimately had to look
it up on Wikipedia being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's just one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know, recently there've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many fucking Japanese
anime studio guys come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like ridiculous names. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, probably it's just one of those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I looked it up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Nope, it's literally just one dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a one dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel bad for whoever's making this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like my God they wanna hype, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just got thrusted on them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone's assuming
this is like legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, how did the hype just happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Did they just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is literally just the tweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just the tweet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the original Twitter I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has all of us recording, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it has like 40,000
likes and like 20,000 retweets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something that.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because Killing Stalking
fans are flawless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They are ruthlessly dedicated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I saw, the thing
was this one in the lower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the replies to that
people weren't questioning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whether like it was legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People were just questioning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Should it get an adaptation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was the main argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's why it was
getting so many reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should you guys think he
should get an adaptation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, let me change the question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you guys read it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've read the first like story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What is it like it came out
and like stories, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like seasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I watched, I read the first season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I quite liked it
and you know, it's a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like from
what I've heard as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that handles it quite
well towards the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I did a video on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually looked back
on when I did my video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it was four years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Was it that long ago?
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember you released
that like yesterday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought was like maybe
like a year or two ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah
- Was four years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's because I only
reviewed the first season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think the series ended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think it was like last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was like a huge gap right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I've only really seen or read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first half of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was, you know,
it was marketed as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a really hard call,
like gruesome yellowish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you know, all these
fan girls getting on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I don't know if
I'm gonna enjoy it as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'm not exactly
the target demographic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like a genuinely good story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like yeah it had yellow elements in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, I'm an
adult, I can handle that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So other than, if you take
away the yellow elements, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a really, really
good horror mystery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when I sold that they
were gonna make a quote </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "anime adaptation for it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because immediately what I
thought of is all of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other like over-sexualized series getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime adaptations recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause as someone who hasn't read, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it seems like it's a very sexual story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that would have to be heavily sensitive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is hardcore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is one of, I think it
will say it has such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's divided a lot of community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think a lot of
people really sexualize it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it's just a really fucked up dynamic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and a lot of, I mean a
lot of really deep shit of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like possessiveness and all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you've thinking about reading it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a lot like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going into with caution definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely be over the age of 18. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have to legally say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you should read it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then also like I can
totally recommend you not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to read it like it's your
life would be totally fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - May be I'll watch the anime instead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my opinion they're. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Talking about the anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I said, I feel bad for this person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause a lot of people are
putting a lot of hype on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But also what I saw, it's a one man job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like this guy's doing everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know if it's a guy or a girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they seem to be in charge of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they seem to be 3D modelers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's what that trade is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I saw the voice acting Casting Call </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and as someone who's, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> done a lot of voice acting Casting Calls, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've made my own, I've worked with a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of professional ones
like it is not normal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna be mean to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't think that
like that experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think other voice actors
are helping them with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But first of all, normally you don't name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's gotten what role publicly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Right so on the Casting Call Document </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I think we've maybe
show on screen for a second. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It says like one person who has the role </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's showing publicly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not normally the case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally it's just here with the lines, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> auditioned for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the way it's laid out is really old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just over, I mean, over Twitter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't that weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's no mention of pay or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I guess, I mean,
it is a fan made project </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but normally, still you
say if it's paid or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You normally say how, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how many lines they're gonna be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It looks like it belongs
on like Casting Call Club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is an amateur voice hunting website. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which makes me uneasy because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it is gonna be a USB
microphone kind of deal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not can sound good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there was no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's the minimum the requirements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for you to sanitary
room, there was nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just, if you wanna audition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I saw the replies to this thread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 13-year old sounding girls auditioning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but that's because
the main like readership all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of Killing Stalking our 13 year old girls, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though it shouldn't be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from purely based on context, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it should not be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just worrying with
these kinds of things as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause normally like when
I've done plus 18 projects, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I normally ask for proof of ID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they if I cast someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they need to show me their ID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this should definitely
be one of those situations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I like those
precautions should be taken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's fan made right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, yeah, not good look for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're getting 13-old girls to voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in your thing about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know some pretty fun shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's still very early days, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean from what it sounds like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's sounds like a situation where someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - way too much press. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got way too much press, way too quickly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I have no doubt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they probably have
no fucking experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I saw it on the Twitter actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just this morning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah they tweeted out
being like, oh my God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after someone retweeted my thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gained like 10,000 Twitter
followers in like overnight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, you know, this
person obviously like came </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from like pretty much
close to zero followers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So for them that's a lot.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a lot of like
pressure just immediately built </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up on them because you're going after such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I don't want to say iconic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like a very, like very,
very dedicated series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's not just that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I think what
really built up the hype </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well as we're in like
this environment now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Webtoons animated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They could be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are being major so you wouldn't be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wouldn't have been surprising </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say Killing Stalking
is getting an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as opposed to like last
year even two years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where, you know we didn't
have any precedents for that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now we've Tower of God airing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and a God of High School </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Noblesse all getting anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like maybe we're in a new era </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where people are expecting
that their favorite Webtoons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or their favorite webcomics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for whatever country could
get anime adaptations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah sure, sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean to be fired, I
wouldn't be against the idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of actually getting an
official adaptation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or Killing Stalking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I think it could
be definitely make waves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it would make
sense considering that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recently there's been
like a big trend of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as I said earlier, like
over-sexualized series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we've got a Shu Matson airing getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah my fucking God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how they gonna handle it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How are they gonna handle that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there is legitimately a sex scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> every three pages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm not even kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I don't know anything
about this monograph. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So wait, what is it called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's called Shu Matson Harold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or Wild Hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And basically the overall
plum oversimplifying this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a handclap flawed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Humanity has gone to shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where there was a disease
that is killing all males. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's already affecting males. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a hentai plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a hentai plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically males now are becoming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a commodity they're
basically being treated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like males that have like
survived this disease. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically like treated
as like national defenses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me just wait, first
of all the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between this hentai, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that if it was a hentai,
it'd be an ugly bastard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a handsome young guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like several handsome young guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay that's how it happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's an ugly bastard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a hentai (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like the dynamic it could see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is where a difference from a hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> though is that our main
character has like this girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he's been thinking
about his whole life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And basically like, doesn't
wanna just go around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like just scrap their
sex everyone in order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to save him he'd rather
keep his like purity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for the goal that he
needs to be thinking of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's about waiting
for the right person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically blue balls, the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because everyone else all five other guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a fucking great time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're fucking different
chicks every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're pretty much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're pretty much like
what hentai of protagonist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not being sold on this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but saying that I wasn't sold
to Interspecies Reviewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> until I watched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is pretty funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not gonna be as good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Interspecies Reviewers
is like a really weird case </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was something
that was definitely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely itchy in the manga,
in the manga in the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just made it porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I still like, I still, I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Interspecies Reviewers to me is that line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> between hentai and (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you don't watch
Interspecies Reviewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to jack off right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's undeniable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that there is just a
straight up sex scene in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is really interesting though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the one sex scene
that everyone was raving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on about in the anime, I
think it was episode four, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Three
- Three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Episode three was never in the Manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was implied all sex
scenes of the series is implied </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the Manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in the anime that
was just like fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just show it, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put things into perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You didn't even see nipple in the Manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you didn't see nipple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I own all the volumes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You seen this man's Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He knows a nipple when he sees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I all know the volumes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've enjoyed every single one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we talk about your Twitter in a bit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we please talk legit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it would make me play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - By the way follow me on
Twitter guys that the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a wrong clip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you please explain your Twitter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's meanings explain my Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - First of all, whenever
I go on Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't follow Hentai artists on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this man's got me COVID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I actually know on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you, like a picture,
there's a good chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason, especially
Joey's specifically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it comes on my Twitter and I must get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least every time I open
Twitter, six or seven, like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either like follow on sex
things or like very, very loose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I'm like I don't follow porn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like Joey Bissinger and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how does she get to this point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay here's what I
don't understand, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like how many people do
you follow on Twitter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like on average </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I have 600 something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay 600
- Above them I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, right you both
follow about over 500 people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like this isn't just YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've had this from
like mutual friends of mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone says, it's you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is it that my likes end
up on everybody's timeline? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, am I only like Twitter preferred? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have no fucking clue, but it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say 70 to 80%
of the time I see Ludes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on my timeline, it is you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is trade-off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First of all, you're welcome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay 'cause this thing
used to be the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, I swear, you were
way more timid about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How did, 'cause I'm scared of doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know 'cause I
mean, I shouldn't really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause there basically
half naked into my videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't know I was getting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just worried about
like, she just having porn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on my thing, but now I guess
I can get away with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How did you go from not sharing porn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to basically just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - To being the Hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always shared it, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear you didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean maybe not only. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This one now you're seeking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was just Twitter
changing the like button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be basically the retweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's exactly what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because for the entirety
that I've been on Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've liked hentai
because I followed hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like people like hentai out side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Titan I've discovered, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've never retweeted it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of this exact reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want other people's timelines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be filled with hentai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Twitter was just like,
hey, let's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> make the like button, like
a better retweet button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gonna ask how much
of your feed is Just had? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I asked, I
asked to see his phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you wanna see it now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't that bad when I first saw it,. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the thing is I don't follow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that many hentai artists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that's hard to believe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I genuinely don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing is I follow a hentai artists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that love retweeting other hentai artists. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's where I find all the people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scroll, scroll through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want scroll down my Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's see how many come up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There one, one and three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you also like
everyone that opinions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You go to his likes from when this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go to my likes, go to my likes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hope that's another one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's two in a row. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, wait that's a Jimmy Neutron there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's my mentor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my phone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, let me, while they're
looking through the Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let me defend myself real quick, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The reason why I like it's
because at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these are just drawings, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a difference between
liking like actual human porn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versus just a picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This man is about to go the hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am genuinely one of those people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who looks at hentai as odd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally agree with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Conner laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Shut up, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm talking on behalf </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of every hentai lover
watching this episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> including you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just I don't know if I
look at it and be unlike, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just crack open a beer and just enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The boy, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've gotten to that point, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gotten to the point
of you seeing fucking room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see my fucking office, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is just like full
of like anime thighs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's gotten to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where sometimes you just see this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like drawing of a girl
or a thigh or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just don't even get horny anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, I'm fucking impressed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at how good they make. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was me when I saw them (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in Seven Deadly Sins.(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because they're genuinely
like some hentai artists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I know of where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you made an all ages manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would sell like crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no and people have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And people have like
look at like (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who made fucking easy
on Nathan Novato song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah I love that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, you know put up a picture of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But okay everyone has seen
this chick before, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nano she was originally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a hardcore lowly hentai artist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he made a really
fucking six for all ages, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> comedy Manga which is hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like and even if
they don't make all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just stuff, look
at artists like Nambata </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who is like genuinely an amazing artist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what I will
like, because you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've gotten to this point
where hentai has just become </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like ha ha anime, boobs,
hilarious and horny on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's all just
become like a joke thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want that anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sick of those jokes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to save this
topic because I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want this to be a whole episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm ready. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to dedicate a whole episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm ready. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have too many things to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about hentai artists that I can't fit all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smashed like on this episode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want hentai episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're gonna do it either way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're gonna do it any way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To give this guy is
like three sips of beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they start talking about hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I shouldn't had a strong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is strong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, I don't know
like when I watch hentai, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's for a service, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I do it to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do the deed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't sit there and
like swallow my wine glass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Am I weird? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah this is probably the answer to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Am I weird to be like sometimes I kinda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanna watch Hentai just doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes that's totally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) That's fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on he's probably going
through that phase right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no I don't, hentai to
me hasn't got to that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The Doujinshi and manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Has definitely go into that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's see if this (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is no part of me
in a porn while I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watch a porn and I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately skip two minutes then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are the degenerates
here, motherfucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bought a lot Doujinshi
from my artists I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I've actually read </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like physical copies of and
like hijacked off to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that's TMI I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will recommend you some share. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll come on and see in Twitter likes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and in like four episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll come back on and be like
totally agree with everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything these guys say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know I just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also like, you'll like
progression from like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck to like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love this artist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's, if you've
read enough Doujinshi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you've, if you've
read enough like H manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many the Doujinshi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just have really, really good plots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's this.
- (mumbles) sphere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah I do agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I must say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gotten to this
point where sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just want the series to
be adapted into hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just so you can see an animated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and sometimes you read the series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just do something new with porn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or hentai that you just
have never seen before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, wow, this
is like awakening something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in me right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seriously. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard someone describe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've watched hentai and
awakened something in him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How Levi you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was some Doujinshi (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at first I was like,
okay, I dig this art. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I see like the ECI scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, okay, I'm digging this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know me, I have
like a quarter child. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then as the story continues, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck the HTC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (mumbles) of the
podcast to the wrong boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That question to you a
question to all of you watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why do you think thigh highs are sexy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if the answer isn't anime
and anime awakened your love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for fire highs, you're fucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No I did I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because let's be real Japanese
girls don't have thighs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so like, if you just think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you fire thighs is
like entry level right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the world of the Doujinshi and H manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like some normie shit man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've gotten to that
point with enormous fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe in future, we
can return to this topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I've you know done my research. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Will come back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're gonna come back to it,
don't worry, don't worry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we're getting ahead
of ourselves right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's an understatement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was meant to be
an introductory episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when we introduced whatever,
well we're gonna be doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If don't like these topics, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Always be hentai by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can I just preface that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, but I think, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the main reason we started this as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because we always hang out together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's not one of those things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some YouTube is hangout. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They make videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It seems like they're friendships great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we all actually hang out
together all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And we always talk for like two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What we're looking at it's essentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what we do on a daily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah like, we easily have conversations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we just talk for like three hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about manga an anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even about manga anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the last time
we were at your house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we talked about like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what was the best book you joined? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) Do you remember that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We like legitimately like hardcore arguing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about like easy in-and-out
overrated or not for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not by the way.
- It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay we're not gonna get into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I suppose, I guess that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're gonna be talking about like anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's gonna evolve over the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean the core of this anime and manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I have a lot of
things about anime and manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wanna talk about,
but I also want to talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the culture, the community, hentai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> more hentai I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and I mean,
- I'm for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also like just general </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we're YouTubers is we
wanna talk about sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's YouTube drama that we feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we can probably add
something to it like of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, sometimes if there's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like standard banter of just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the fuck then, will talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if any of our
mutuals are ever in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you wanna talk anime
manga with us hit us up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And not even just our
mutuals, like if you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't wanna like come onto the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like talk, first of all
you gotta come on to the show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> physically sit right here next to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because we wanna ideally this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will be a full person podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And hopefully, I mean
I'd be really interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in to bring YouTube is on who, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really get to talk about anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah
- Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I just hear that side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean if there were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any YouTube is watching
this video or you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Twitter or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I guess let us know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you'd like to come onto the podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we will happily welcome come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's surprising
I've met so many YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who have nothing to do
with anime or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who watch anime.
- Who watch anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just really wanna talk
about anime to somewhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think it's pretty awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I remember anime was nowhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> near this popular before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember the feeling
of being the only anime fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have having nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no one to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I think that's why
I started my YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But that was like my
reasoning is that I had no one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk to this about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's just say like kids
today, have it fucking easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're an anime fan like
today, you know, High School, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you have it so much
easier than any of busted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My God, I wish I'm so jealous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I wish I could have just talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to my fucking friends
about Narrow Toe or Bleach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or One Piece or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to convince my
friends to get into anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in order for them in order
to find someone about anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, this is like another thing that I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I talked to Americans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't have this problem, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least in my age group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like we had Americans
had a good but British people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think probably Australian people are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more closer to British like
fucking ruthless school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh yeah.
- No, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I remember I got shiffer
gaming too much at school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So am I other fuck my gonna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I go shiffer gaming too much in school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So am I gonna sit there
and be like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So call of duty, that thing that you play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but give me shit for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how about you check out
these animated, he's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how do I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I built up years getting to
like a medium level of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in between a level of popularity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was never popular, but I
got out of the bullying zone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Didn't wanna go back to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really crazy just how like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to say mainstream animes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not mainstream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not mainstream at all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I guess just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how much more accepted it's
become as a subculture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's get enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's definitely,
definitely is because I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like anime works so
well with Meme culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my,
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> An anime in a sense is Meme culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in a lot of ways, I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Flying a room when you
mentioned Meme culture and anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You all know what we're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I feel like because of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a lot more people know what anime is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or at least have seen
a Meme or a screenshot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or a gift of probably Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is usually where they start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's usually will happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And as it should be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the only enemy that matters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then people would just
recognize that a lot more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I remember when I was growing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people didn't even know what anime was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the word anime they're
like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's some cartoon porn,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird 'cause I
think one of the biggest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like double-edged swords to anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has been Netflix, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like in the sense that like
it's got a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into anime.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then when you get really into anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it becomes like the fucking (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean are we definitely
gonna talk about light, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - True that more future. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think Netflix is also helped a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I mean, they've been pushing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I remember like when
they started getting anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like Death and it would not
get off my fucking recommended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like Fullmetal lockers brother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had I think they have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they have all the classics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is pretty impressive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean they have all the
entry level most for me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Need to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Now they have Evangelion as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly
- Which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crazy they call that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just, I can't
imagine how much money Netflix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> through no, be like, hey,
can we grab your series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that has been pretty much out of print </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like 20 plus years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna hear the story
about how they got that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people have tried for decades, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally decades to
get the often ADV died </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get the licensing over to the West. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So there must be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lots and lots of money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wrote whatever that use it badly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, this is like one
of the biggest achievements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because it is like, like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without you know wrapping
it up in a package nicely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like Evangelion is one of the
biggest anime like ever made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like I know we all know
I know is like hardcore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to protecting it's IP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I remember for the
longest time Hollywood wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make that Evangelion adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and unknown was just like, fuck off fame. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like he did a solid, he does this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are so many
live action adaptations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being made right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't keep track of them all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember when there was just one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone would just
wait a shit on that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> over 10 adaptations being made right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need to do an episode
or we do like a Tier List </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the worst Netflix adaptations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need to do a Tier
List of the fly back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So anyways guys look
forward to all of that stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was just a taster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't really plan much
of what we were gonna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - As you can see, we're
just talking out of our. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were just talking about
there wasn't a topic planned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just kind of evolved (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only talk we talked
about was Killing Stalking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which last five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There we a lot more structure in future </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when we get a bit more used to it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me have more topics to talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but because right now,
we'll do wanna cover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it would make it
really interesting video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear our opinions pretty early </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on about things that are
like evolving situations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also, if you wanna hear anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or if you wanna request anything </SPEAKER_02>
