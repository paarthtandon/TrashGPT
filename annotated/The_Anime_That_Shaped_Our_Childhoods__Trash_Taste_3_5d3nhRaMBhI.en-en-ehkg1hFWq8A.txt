<SPEAKER_00> - That's, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was definitely one of
those people who put it at 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know you did it you piece of shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I knew exactly what my- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is going on here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - School Day sucks. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> like we gotta have something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was going to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but you interrupted me

<SPEAKER_03> - What? I didn't interrupt

<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna say your
names then the topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is gonna be smooth as fuck.
- There was no prefix </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Anime Zone] Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What I would like to discuss
today with you gentlemen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is your anime origin story, if you will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you get into anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And how you discovered
that you were gonna go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down this rapid hole of never coming back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This beautiful medium
that's we all love and... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And hate
(laughing softly ). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the same time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who'd like to go first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, do you wanna go first Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I feel like you
have the most unique- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Most likely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel you're putting the
pressure on me, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably have all that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, okay, having a follow up his story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna be fun, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's not that exciting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess like mine is unique
in the sense that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you say I'm the only
anituber that has like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grown up with anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when I say growing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like from age
of conceptual thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly)
- You know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Age of conceptual thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think just being raised in a household </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to the Japanese parent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> probably has an immediately
different attitude towards anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> than one that we would
experience in Western. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, because like you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when most people say like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh I grew up with anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anime was my childhood." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you know that usually
start age 12 maybe 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the real question is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> did you know what anime was growing up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's all I ever knew. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so when you were
growing up in your head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even at like age five or six, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a clear distinction between like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Pokemon" and like I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Cartoon Network shows.
- Yeah like Batman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That there was a difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or "Ed, Edd and Eddy
or something like that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you knew that they
wanted them as Japanese? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah because unlike
a lot of kids in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and like probably around my age group. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I grew up watching "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like "Dragon Ball" in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have thought "Pokemon"
was an American cartoon... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] A lot of people did.
- And my mind was blown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at like age 10 when I
heard the Japanese version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's on YouTube clips, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're like, oh
wait, this is the original? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- How? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because to me "Pokemon"
when I was growing up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just seemed like this very weird genre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I couldn't put my finger on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I felt it was a genre, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was "Pokemon",
"Digimon", "Cardcaptor Sakura", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which was "Cardcaptors"
in the UK and America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah it was called Cardcaptors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sakura, that's too Asian
sound get rid of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it wasn't even Sakura, it's Sakura. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sakura.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the other girl was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they changed her name to Madison, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what
her original name was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this is back in the
age of four kids dubbing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it was a given even for kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that dubbed "Cardcaptor Sakura." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was in the day that's
localization was a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We were eating jelly donuts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly)
- Except only Garry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't believe
that at the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you know like, being, as you said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like growing up in an Asian
household, Japanese household. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Onigiri was just like the
most like normal concept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever seen.
- Yeah, that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your bread.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly)
exactly, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you know-
- What did you do to my boy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know it's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as you said, it's like bread, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like watching an American cartoon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like "Dexter's Laboratory." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And like a scene of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making toasts, for example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it gets over dubbed into Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know I'm making a rice bowl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a flat rice ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's just 'cause at that time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember a lot of my friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just didn't really know the
concept of just eating rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you weren't Asian you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "why would you eat rice with every meal?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing softly)
Right, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess so.
- Yeah, I think I can remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what my family thinking rice was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exotic isn't that-
- [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I mean it was something you had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with foreign foods. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, you just don't really eat rice- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like that's on the
contrary though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like do you eat bread with everything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because at least in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the concept of eating bread
with everything is like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like at least in British culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you could put bread with anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you get away with it.
- Well that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess like the food culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that country revolves around- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anyway, we're getting off topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing softly)
We're like the food culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but so like basically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I grew up watching "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, what else can
I remember watching? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess like before that
though, before "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before I started watching
"One Piece" or "Dragon ball" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like all the Shaun and jump stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese kids grew up with this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very certain array of kids anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just absolutely
not known overseas at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like "Doraemon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Doraemon" is probably
the most well-known. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like you don't like see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an anetuber like reviewing "Doraemon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Episode 5,000 review
"Doraemon" let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, or like you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like one series that I grew up watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like alongside "Doraemon" , </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was this show called "Sazae-san." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is like the longest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> running Japanese anime-
- Longest running anime ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and nobody outside
of Japan has heard of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know about it until you... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was having a conversation with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean just to put it in perspective, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my mum grew up watching that show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I grew up watching that show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's been going on since the 60s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 5,000 episodes or something?
- It's ridiculous, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's absurd.
- It's still going, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> till this day.
- Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I don't know how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know because
like it's really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the concept of that show is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just revolving around
this family living in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like the most like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normal slice of life
show that I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I also think to myself like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how can you come up with like
40 years worth of topics? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And not be like maybe
we did cover this topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 25 years ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in one of those episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There must be episodes that overlap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I feel you can't
make that many episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and not overlap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- I mean they probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could overlap but no one's
gonna be bothered to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching and cross referencing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one's re-watching that show, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's one of those things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's on TV you watch it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, oh oh, they covered
this topic in episode 1,743. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's you know, there's
one super fan in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just seen every episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And just knows everything
about every episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That seems to be "Sazae-san?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Sazae-san." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And "Doraemon" seem to
be the one thing where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you ask anyone in
Japan, do you watch anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll be like, oh yeah,
"Doraemon" and just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I grew up with
"Doraemon" and "Sazae-san." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I'm like, I
mean the other anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, because-
- Like anime, anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a distinction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no boobs in that, what the fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing softly). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna imagine
Doraemon with boobs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That exists somewhere on the internet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Please don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But watching "Doraemon"
and like "Sazae-san" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I could list off a number of shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but no one would probably know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like there's just like
a certain number of shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think like it's
just become tradition now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter what generation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or like if you're born
and raised in the city </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you know, the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every kid grows up watching these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like really specific set of shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's just like normal to them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like watching you know "Peppa Pig." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Both] Yeah.
- It's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't even think about
like, oh yes it's a cartoon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just something on the TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then, yeah, I guess like
the concept of anime, anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't hit me until maybe like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> at least when I started
watching "One piece" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and "Dragon Ball." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And probably around the
like "Pokemon" time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I reckon when I was
like five or six years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So when you started
realizing what anime is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and probably getting into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's when probably we started to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch our first animated,
which was "Pokemon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But like in my head I'm like,
yeah, "Pokemon" is an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like "Samurai Jack" is a cartoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because at that time around
five or six years old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when I started like
watching Cartoon Network. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd like to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we grew up in like the
golden age of cartoon network. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean...
- I'd say so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had "Samurai Jack." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had "Samurai Jack," "Dexter's Lab," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Cow and Chicken," "Ed, Edd n Eddy," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so many amazing shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And to me it's like, okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things on Cartoon Network are cartoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But things that are on like the VHS tapes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that my grandma would send to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, for me there was a
really clear distinction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, I didn't have like
one day this sudden realization </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like oh shit "Doraemon" is an anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it was just so natural to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See I don't even remember
when I got that realization. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think I must have got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I properly started getting into anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with "Naruto" was my
first like anime anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was purely because
I just kept seeing avatars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and GIFs on the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like this kind of
looks like "Dragon Ball Z," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I grew up on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which that cartoon now I was really into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they have ridiculously spiky hair? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing softly)
Yeah, probably the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think because
I was on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> way before I started watching anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think obviously
being on the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just thinking
like, what is this shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What I'm trying to play B.R.U.C.E Escape, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are they talking about this stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All I knew is that their
opinion didn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they had anime profile pictures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which I guess still is
like entertaining to say- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a timeless thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just a meme now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's generational now is generational. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No man, I mean "Pokemon"
was the first one for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I must've been like, God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean "Pokemon" was always
one of my favorite shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think we've mentioned this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like episode zero or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that it had like an overarching story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Which you only really got, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't really get it actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in any except for like "Avatar,"
but that came way later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like an olds '90s. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just called "Avatar" an anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay like cartoon, so
I was comparing cartoon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you don't watch
"Courage the Cowardly Dog" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for the overarching story, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You watch it 'cause
every episode is great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I remember "Pokemon" was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, they're actually
working towards something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that era of anime as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like a lot of cartoons, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes there was like episodic moments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But as you said, there was
like an overarching story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, even if it was a filler, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you knew they had a goal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that seemed to be the case where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that kind of structure really spoke to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as if for whatever reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really enjoyed that as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then "Yu-Gi-Oh!" had the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh well what are these things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with all the spiky head people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're really well-drawn things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like these kind of cartoons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so weird that for me
at least with "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I didn't know
"Yu-Gi-Oh!" was an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I grew up with
the card game first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah, same I got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the card game and then watch the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right?
- Everyone in your school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was playing Yu-Gi-Oh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't get that phase, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't get that Yu-Gi-Oh phase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because when I was in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was like trading Pokemon cards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and nobody knew how to
play the actual game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no, no. No one did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have like a black market </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like trade deal with Pokemon cards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a really dark Yu-Gi-Oh phase. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was legit like fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my dad like used to work
for like a printing company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what he would do is he
would find like high res </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like pictures of Exodia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no.
- My parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did that one time it was wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he would print them out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would come to school and I'd be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> y'all I got all five pieces of Exodia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they'd be like "a 10 year
old doesn't know, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, "they'd be like oh
no way, you got Exodia?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was funny as well because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yu-Gi-Oh! Pokemon cards, no
one knew how to play Yu-Gi-Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just like, "cool you have Exodia?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I feel the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were easier to understand
the rules of Pokemon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Pokemon was hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I don't think anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my school played the Pokemon card game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just collect them.
- Yeah, you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collected them, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was easy to understand you had a Shiny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just-
- Shahzad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah once you get Shahzad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's the thing though, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like in order to play
the Pokemon card games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need it to like not
throw away the energy cards- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which no one wanted.
- Everybody did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everybody was the
energy card and all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which like in my school like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my school everyone was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yep, go, go, go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing softly)
have and go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just collecting them.
- That's was just lunch time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyday at my school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've I started to realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've really liked anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when everyone got into Pokemon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we had the Pokemon
card game phase as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was just like a global craze. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that how long did that last? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That lasted like a year
or something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think-
- Or like a few months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The year I was born 1996, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think Pokemon was the most
Googled thing of that year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well because the game had just came out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Had just came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and obviously since that point onwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> through the mid 2000s
it was pretty insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pokemon was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and arguably still today
is one of the biggest like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I just kept watching "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even after when the craze gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And my mum and dad wondering like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is this kid still into Pokemon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly)
What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had the same thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my parents they were worried for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do we need to like do
something about this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he's still watching cartoons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my older brother
had forgotten cartoons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a sign of pride </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that he'd stopped watching cartoons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I only watch reality TV
show now with my parents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to watch this kid show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watch MTV, but not for the music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I fucking loved "Samurai Jack" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like I would always try
and watch "Samurai Jack." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Courage the Cowardly Dog" anime as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my parents genuinely
were concerned for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if they still
are still concern for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm watching just a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think much less so
now that you've made one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the exact point 'cause
all the way up to university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when I rediscovered what anime was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "He's doing it again, why?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We thought we're past this fucking phase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they found out I was
watching more anime than ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were even more concerned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, oh he's
caught even harder into this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We thought it would stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember my dad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the funniest thing my dad ever said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was like maybe the
last year of high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was like when I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is right before I
made my YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like watching every anime ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And my dad would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "what are you doing in your room?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause he thought I was
doing something else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when I told him that
I was watching anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember my dad saying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "okay, at this point I think
I'd rather you just do drugs." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like I would've
been less disappointed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I found that you were
doing drugs in your room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which one's more life crushing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Arguably they're both around the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
- Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah but like I don't know like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really have like a phase of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I discovered anime or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because as long as I've known. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do.
- Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even Manga as well like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I started reading Manga like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> around the same time that
I discovered Doraemon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is probably around when I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four or five years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh damn, so you've been
reading Manga since four or five? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably, maybe earlier than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But I specifically remember
the first ever volume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of Manga I ever got was
volume two of "Doraemon", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why my mum didn't get me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> volume one of the Doraemon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would've been cooler? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I didn't know that it
was an overarching story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, okay I'll
just start reading this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> had no idea what the fuck
was going on at first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until I got volume one and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "oh now it makes sense." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like-
- Wow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> man I feel like my anime thing was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's three points
in my life where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can very vividly
remember watching anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first was like "Pokemon." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And occasionally seeing a
"Yu-Gi-Oh!" episode of the cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think maybe when I
got access to the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's when another one came, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause I remember watching like "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was GX. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My parts, three parts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The three parts on YouTube.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know is an OG anime fan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "oh yeah don't you hate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you find an espanol sub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Yu-Gi-Oh!"" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so envision it right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's 2000, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You watch episode one,
part one of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like okay, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna watch episode one, part two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You click it, it's the
next recommended video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's an espanol, what do you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you keep looking or do you just give up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and go to the next part? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember so many times I had to do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was confused as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think what's worst than that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when you like could
someone uploads like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a full anime movie onto YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but because it had to be
split into like eight parts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like always, always like
either part six or part five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Always one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Always fucking one part.
- There's always one part. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's always one part that was missing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you just had to give
up and just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right I'll just skip 15 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and just hopefully try and catch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's 15 minutes
of the first narrative movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've just never seen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've watched it on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what's happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It might be the best 15 minutes
of narrative of the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking know,
'cause I haven't seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the max upload
time was 10 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube right before.
- 10 yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so that's why it split into three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember that was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the biggest phases of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the third part would always just be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was the outro
whose half off of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh man yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that was definitely a big phase for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I could have been
around 13, 14 at that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Question to you then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> did you grow up during
the "Toonami" phase? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I feel like "Toonami"
has played such a big factor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into making the anime fans of today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> did we have "Toonami" in the UK? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Joey]We did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We did, but you needed Sky TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you needed Cartoon Network, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to be able to watch "Toonami." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So Sky is basically cable in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, you guys didn't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cartoon Network just free to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
- No, no, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you had to pay for Carton Network. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really, 'cause I'm pretty
sure in Australia was free- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh wow yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I remember my parents paid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my dad wanted to pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the football matches in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you basically got the whole bundle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would watch the cartoon stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember there
was loads of cartoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I never saw anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was airing really late. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And by then my parents were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "why aren't you in bed son? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What are doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause what was on "Toonami." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like "Dragon Ball Z, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> " Gundam Wing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember seeing "Dragon Ball." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never watched it there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it was always a mess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause they had it out of order. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I didn't know what was going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I thought it was cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I couldn't get into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think "Dragon Ball Z" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and "Gundam Wing" were the only two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was able to watch whenever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause our family didn't have Sky TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I could only watch it when
I go to my cousin's house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll be watching
episodes out of order. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Gundam Wing" made no fucking sense to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Gundam Wing" still makes no sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can watch
"Gundam Wing" all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it will still make no sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I'll be watching a scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and for some reason the
guy wants to kill this girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the girl still wants
to get with the guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes no fucking sense to me as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Gundam Wing" already
confusing enough as it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Dragon Ball Z" was okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I could skip five episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'd be still- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It'd still the same fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It'd be still the same fight, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goku would just be like
three steps closer to Frieza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I remember like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I would have to be watching
these scenes in "Dragon Ball Z." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Goku was like
powering up the spirit bomb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'd not be
able to go to my cousins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> till like two weeks later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Then Goku was still
powering that spirit bomb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I was like this is
just the next episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it was like I missed
three four episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just still the same shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And to this day he's
still powering it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Still hasn't finished, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If he hasn't died for the seven times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come back to life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because my exposure
to anime has got like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I think back to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's the main phases of
like the "Pokemon" phase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there's the "Toonami" phase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I'd see it on Toonami and TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there was this huge gap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then like I realized
now that in this huge gap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still had like small exposures to anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like whenever I go to
Thailand we'd always have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these shitty Thai dubs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like "Ultraman" was like
a massive in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even though that's not an anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we'd have like "Dragon Ball Z" dubs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and man having listening to Thai dubs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they've already got five
voice actors and actresses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they voiced every
character in every anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I respect it, I respect it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We got to play it for the audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
I just want to hear it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyone whose grown up in Southeast Asia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knows what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you have five voice actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who plays every character in every show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then my cousin showed me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was "Princess
Mononoke," just as it came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know it was anime Just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was this animated film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was Disney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How old are you when you
watch "Princess Mononoke?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it came out in '97. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, so I must've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the year after it came out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it was out on DVD. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pretty gruesome
movie to watch, it like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing softly).
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the first movie I watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought that movie was just Disney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then just,
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I discovered narrative
and everything like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went through the LimeWire phase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I had that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just from music though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't, I don't know-
- No, just for music, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same era. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I would be browsing LimeWire for music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably would like
downloading Linkin Park </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or Papa Roach or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As you do in 2004. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - As you do in 2004 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then something else like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know sometimes you download a file </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not the file you aim for, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you mean
very file in LimeWire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Bill Clinton file like-
- Bill Clinton file. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God, so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, in LimeWire someone
was just circulating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Bible Black clips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The dub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah the dub, it was the dubbed as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I never knew that Bible
Black was a Japanese anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this shitty
porn that I'm watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As a kid I'm like,-
- Yeah, it's kinda hot though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck, this is fucking amazing! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's exactly how AKI
discovered it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She said in multiple videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that going through LimeWire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously looking for the
new Linkin Park album. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean you just trust people, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was the technical
scene of Bible Black. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like she had like an epiphany. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, "This is the
most amazing thing ever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can imagine though, like
because I don't even remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to get onto the topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I don't remember
how I discovered that site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are like get on
the topic, get on the topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I didn't I obviously
didn't know it was hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or I didn't even know it was anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But holy shit I'm having a
fucking epiphany right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Bible Black" wasn't the only
hentai I downloaded on there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause I remember downloading full length </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and "Hansei", that came out in the '90s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember the name, but I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you downloading
a full length hentai pal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I like you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just downloading random files. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I got one of these
files that I downloaded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was this hentai that I
can't remember the title, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had angel in the name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a lot of '90s-
- In a million, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It had an angel on the name, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if I just put this
title into LimeWire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and see what comes up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there were like six
titles that came up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So as a kid, I'm like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll download all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm downloading all of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How to destroy your laptop, speed run. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you ruin any laptops or PCs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I blamed it on my brother </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got blamed for it, but it was
totally me the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't blame it on anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I'm the oldest in the family so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the reason why
and I just realized this now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just wondering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck was I doing
between like 13 and 18? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was cripplingly like addicted to Xbox. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like every second I got free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was playing Call Of Duty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause as you're with your
friends as well, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the golden
age of playing games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have to play with
your friends after school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like immediately when I was done, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd go home play games
until I had to go to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that was like the
golden age of card as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, that was perfect, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Modern Warfare two.
- Modern Warfare two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came out when I was like 15, 16, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like the perfect time to play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I had an age like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a gap as well that I didn't watch anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was around the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know exactly why I wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm not gonna say
it cause it's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not appropriate for YouTube.
(laughing softly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But you can take a guess
to what that might be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But weirdly enough, even
though like during that gap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until like probably the
last year of high school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was still reading Mongo religiously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, so I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I had this burnout with anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or maybe just like a loss
of interest with anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mongo was always one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I would just come home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just read the shit out of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is a little more engaging almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to like actively make an effort. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also because I was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like reading in general, I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I mean the question to you guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what drew you to anime over
like cartoons or other things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what drew you to
this medium specifically? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a child or like-
- As a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and growing up as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, it was just the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that my mom would just push it a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because she knew that it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the easiest way for me
to keep my Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Appreciate the Japanese culture, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I'm just fucking jealous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
- Yeah and so, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I realize Joey was
born on Japanese household, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> speaks Japanese, God I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mom knew that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I just kept talking to her in Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would most likely stick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but she wanted me to like not
just be competent in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like appreciate the whole culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not just appreciate the culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also excel in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like thank God
because now I think I have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have learnt like appreciate the culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just anime in
general and the language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I did like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learn fucked up of Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though I say it in a lot of videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't use anime to learn Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of admit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I learned a lot of Japanese
from watching anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean any amount of language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you take in to learn, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you're watching anything
in a language it's good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it'll help. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it the best way?
- I feel Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as a kid, you just
absorb it through osmosis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like like that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember learning Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just because whenever I'd go to Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would just absorb it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I was talking to my family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or just watching TV shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you learn any Thai from Thai dub? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd love to hear a comic in Thai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably the same, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know it's the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Okay, okay.
- It's the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just very bad quality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, there wasn't a lot of money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> put into the dubbing industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I reckon, so-
- Back then as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Still not that much to your fact. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that should be true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all learn in our
second language then purely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we were just raised in
an area where it was spoken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the thing is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well when you were a kid you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have way more time to just sit there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and absorb it when you're an adult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get 10 minutes a day on Jeweling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, maybe right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas a kid it's like eight hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of just you're hearing this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So obviously you're gonna pick it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- I mean that was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from as far as I can
remember with my childhood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the only memories I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like either watching anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> reading Mongo or like
watching cosmic books. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, already just from that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two thirds of my
childhood essentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is me just absorbing the Japanese language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in any way possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I think that just helped me... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I never got into anime or Mongo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like to think that I would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nowhere near as good at
the language as I am now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think definitely for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was watching anime
the thing that appealed to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially my younger age is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like I said earlier like there's
more of a structure, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's always an
overarching like point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's normally a journey to go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also I felt like, you know I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this wasn't a problem back
then when with all cartoons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the ones that
we grew up with, but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like anime didn't
treat the audience stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know like if you're like 16, 18. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe you don't want to watch "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can still
appreciate it and enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I felt that some cartoons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, you can watch
"Samurai Jack" any age, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's time, it's part-
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was a lot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was growing up the very
treated you as a kid, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mmh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas "Pokemon" was
like, "you're a teenager, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going on the journey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can catch Pokemon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was so cool to
imagine yourself as that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it sounds dumb, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How old was Ash again?
- 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ash 10, but I mean he
had his shit together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a 10 year old right?
- No, he did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and Brock is like 35 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is he hanging with this kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you imagine a mom
just letting a 10 year old go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into the fucking world by
himself with a fucking rat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to keep him company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, wasn't the whole joke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like the mom sent her also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that she can like have a
family with professor Oak, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't that the whole thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Brock commits crimes and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I guess that was
really irresponsible of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to let him go with a 45 year old man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And how is Misty okay with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ash hanging out with this 10 year old kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like throws your bike into a river. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "I'll pay you back." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How also as like a 10 year old Ash, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do you have any concept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of Brock constantly hitting on people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> How do you like perceive that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what does that to
you as a 10 year old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine being Brock and
just leaving your family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and your job to like
follow this 10 year old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just totally ditch his job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is so irresponsible.
- Remember he missed Illa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He had a massive family as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the fuck are you doing Brock? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He had like 10 brothers and sisters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Needless to say that
kind of reckless behavior </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really appealed to me as a kid, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just often leaving my family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I was supporting with my job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Leaving my family for what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To follow this ten-year-old
so I can go slay some posts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like strangely
reminiscent of like "Hisoka" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from hunt to hunter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like grown man just
wants to follow a kid around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and see him grow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The biggest thing for
me though with "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just made no sense to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is how Gary Oak is like
essentially the same age as Ash, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yet he can get like all these pus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it bad that I actually
liked Garry more than Ash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I loved it when he was a dick to Ash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yeah, you should
be catching Pokemon Ash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he was actually
achieving the goal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of trying to become a Pokemon master. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe you appreciate Ash more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but as an adult you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Gary is kind of got his shit together." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Gary's achieving his dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it was cool that
you saved that Butterfree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and reunited it with Ash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like-
- But Gary has 10 bags, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there are not even 10 bags in the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did Butterfree start a
patron to pay your bills? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No he didn't, go and get a job Ash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gary's on like a gold split speed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> running this entire shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was doing 80% Pokemon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if most speed was a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 80% it like getting all the pussies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just doing it all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That man did it all like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yet we still we're
supposed to hate him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like are you okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] You got to fucking
cheerleaders with him as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
- [Anime Zone] Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember there was one episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I think when they were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when Ash was about to
like go to Kyogre I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Gary just rocks up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a fucking like..
- [Connor] Lamborghini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lamborghini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> With like 10 chicks just to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "you're still here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I already got all the badges." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I'm just like
"who's driving the car?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, not only is he
an expert Pokemon master. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He's a logistic expert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Getting all these women around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always in his Lamborghini, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he doesn't worry about
parking tickets, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like, Ash is walking everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Point being I think Ash's kind of shitty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah definitely as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that whole kind of structure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the kind of you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on a journey I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you guys feel really disappointed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when Ash got beaten in the Pokemon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is our destiny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He formed these artificial
bonds with these Pokemon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and fucking Shahzad had the balls to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the final fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you serious Shahzad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As a kid, it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> top 10 anime twist of all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, it was-
- Top 10 anime twist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at all time.
- All time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shahzad he saved you bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he saved you help him please
(laughing softly). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's actually this really funny thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've found the other day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was looking at the
like "Pokemon" speed runs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, there's a
thing called Ash percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I yeah I saw that.
- Where you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to play the game exactly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like catch every Pokemon
exactly the same as Ash did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have to release your Butterfree, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to release your Charizard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you have to
purposely lose at the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That would drive me mental man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know (laughing softly). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like shirtless Mario speed run, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on Super Mario Odyssey.
- [Joey] Odyssey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah you basically just do a speed run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Super Mario Odyssey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you try and get Mario
shirtless quick as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah Nipple percent, it's the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love the troll speed runs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyway, we got off topic.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, okay and I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was it the same thing as
well for you as a kid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't quite put my finger on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was this huge overarching plots. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they had a goal and they
were working towards a goal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like "Pokemon" turned out to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as I watched more anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started liking "Pokemon" less and less. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when I see things
like "Digimon" came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they had an actual like story arc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> instead of being cut by Charizard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly)
at the most crucial moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Digimon" for me was probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the moment when I actually
fell in love with anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- You wanna know something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I never watched the "Digimon" anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anything "Digimon" that I ever consumed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are the two movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I played the games as well as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the only thing I remember
is them being hot as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, they are.
- There are games with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's games and I think at
least the Digimon world games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how old they are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember some of the
hardest games to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full completion of any games ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they're like insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember as a kid thinking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "what the fuck, why can't
I get past the first level? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I beat all the Pokemon in French. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the hell like?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I never, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe because I was just
so obsessed with "Pokemon." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I always knew "Digimon" was a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But I never watched any of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was always the joke as a kid, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You were like the fucking comedian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I guess you're the Digimon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're the Digimon kid.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one want's to be the Digimon kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a question for you specifically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Cause obviously this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't apply to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but did you as a kid have a sense of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I kind of liked this whole
like Japanese culture thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever it propped up,
in like TV or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean to me it was less exotic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause to me it was Asian culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I guess, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I had seen more of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I didn't exactly
grow up in Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I would visit there
at least once a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'd spend like my summer
holidays in Thailand every year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, seeing some of the
more Japanese culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or the more Asian oriented culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not that different from what you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from flying to Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Japanese specific, like say onigiri </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no idea what the fuck-
- Onigiri donuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, onigiri donuts,
but I could see that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just a ball of rice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I know what rice is, I
can see what this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess that's the
difference of me coming from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the whitest place on earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And not being exposed to any other, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially Asian cultures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only Asian exposure I had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> apart from media, it was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the shitty Chinese stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know down the road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've had awful Chinese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I think whenever
I saw Japanese stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in media I thought it was so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna sound so fucking
dumb that I will say this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on.
- Do you remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Jackass:The Movie" or whatever? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where one of them goes to Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's all just stripping
in a store and dancing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The whole time, I just ignore that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, dude look at
those fucking appliances, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're having. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was so cool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they had all these appliances in the store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I have never seen them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because in the West we never got those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> TV and radio built-in things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And they had the numbers on the side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought those were
cool as as fuck as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then obviously watching
like Samurai stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then "Samurai Jack" was a
huge thing that made me think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking love Samurai's as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like they were like
the coolest things to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was either, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on if you
were into anime or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The two things that
got people into Samurai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> were at the "Samurai Jack" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or "The Last Samurai"
- I can still watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Samurai Jack" today and
like fucking love everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude the newest season
was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God the fuck
make you cry like a baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Samurai Jack" is just a fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> great show period.
- Amazing, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Samurai Jack" was like
the one Cartoon Network show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> other than "Ed Edd n Eddy" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that my dad would be just
as excited to watch with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude, "Samurai Jack" is
on move out of the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember the episode
with like the assassin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you remember this one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He had the robot dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's one of my favorites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think in my head looking back now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like it was inevitable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I was gonna get into anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I had a fondness
for Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well it wasn't like intense
or weepy or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked the movies, I liked
all the culture that I saw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved video games and
being a video game fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're gonna run into
stuff so you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> huh, why is it like this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, oh it's Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then also watching anime
from a young age and like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I felt like it was
inevitable at some point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life I was gonna find anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like I fucking love this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I completely forgot about video games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and just JRPGs in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a big push, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't realize how
much you're like pushing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, and I realized a
lot of the same story tropes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that drew me to anime,
like I liked in JRPGs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's why I really
get into JRPGs as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do you remember the time
when Japan just felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this foreign concept?
- Oh, yeah (laughing softly). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is way past even
when me discovering anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember after discovering anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started discovering
narrative and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so weird to find
anyone who went to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or see any kind of like Japanese media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even outside of the Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's only recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> become a tourist destination.
- [Anime Zone] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Definitely yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If my parents who never
wanna leave Europe, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, if it's not
Europe, it's not a vacation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If they're considering
career in Japan sounds cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If that don't like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well now I guess everyone's up to it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are they thinking that?
- Yeah, they were planning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not just 'cause I lived here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they wanna come anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yeah I feel like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that kind of mainstreamness of it anyways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is really had a big impact recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember when I first started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching stuff on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no like vloggers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No.
- [Anime Zone] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except for like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember watching a Chris Broad video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like the only guy, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was one of the OGs.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd like to think, yeah.
- And I remember back then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wanted to find
something in Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would have to be
like a BBC documentary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone going there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was not a YouTube thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The weird working world of Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, whereas now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can find out anything
you want about this country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Exactly.
- It's not hard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember yeah, like same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I had no fucking clue.
- You'd see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these weird commercials. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd see these clips
from these talk shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or the variety shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, what the fuck
is going on in this country? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean there was like that
giant "Takeshi's Castle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I totally forgot that.
- I forgot about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Takeshi's Castle" at 7:00
a.m. every day on challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I used to wake up early before school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would like watch every episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't think you
guys get this excited. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just totally glossed over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally watched "Takeshi's castle" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> all throughout high school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what same here.
- Even though it's reruns. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking loved it every time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you just watch the
same episodes over and over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like watching "Top Gear" on Dave, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something you can
always watch over and over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just so fucking weird- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's recently that I found out though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like "Takeshi's castle", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys had reruns
with "Takeshi's Castle?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- And I found that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really interesting because
that's a show from the '80s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it's strange </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think America has
their own version as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like "Takeshi's
Castle" is this kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is it called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The most extreme game show is it called- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty much, it's like "Ninja Warrior," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the modern anime- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like "Ninja warrior,"
but imagine if it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the contestants were
just everyday people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was horribly
unfair, it was so unfair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was so fun and it was just brutal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> These courses they would just send people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would all fail.
- Especially "Ninja Warrior" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> across the Jackass.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it looked dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of the courses look
so fucking dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean there's a reason why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't do that show anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
- Because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> legit OHNS.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That show had a huge following </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK because of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think in America did as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but each localization had
a different style to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So, the Japanese
obviously showed the show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the British one had like this- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Craig Charles.
- Craig Charles who's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> quite a famous person
back in the '90s, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because he did "Robot Wars" and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, and. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was really big and in
America they had a kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine a pseudo kind
of football commentators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, what do
you think of that Jeff? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was supposed to be
kind of like jokey things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually watched clips of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's as good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but each country got its own localization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And the one that UK was huge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I remember there was petitions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even when I was like 16, 17. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> People wanting to bring it back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, how can you bring it back when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just dubbing over the old clips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Thailand actually had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think a version like
a few years ago as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did they?
- They made their own version. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have no fucking a clue.
- 'Cause I remember watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and thinking like, nope, not the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just didn't think, quite catch it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was a huge factor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in why also I love Japanese culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you watch that show and like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's crazy.
- It's hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's amazing and it's also a blatantly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> extremely Japanese.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're seeing Katakana Kanji everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's purely Japanse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like '80 HD, like
editing, you know anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that was my first introduction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like crazy Japanese.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pure chaos, I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what it is about Japanese variety shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just about having as
much information on screen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to distract your eyes as possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - After making YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've come to feel sorry
for every Japanese editor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With the sheer amount of texts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have to put on the screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Changing colors and shit
popping up everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because everybody's
dialogue has subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing lightly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like we can hear them fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't worry about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what I hate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Whenever I see an anime trailer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's from Japanese TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they always got this guy reacting to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that.
- In the corner right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then not even reacting that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's the thing that
Jordan said about game shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll have a really normal thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'll have a guy in the corner like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like a really
interesting behind the scenes clip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this anime or show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember seeing the journal
clip of the guy doing MOODA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just the guy
reacting in the corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like I don't give
a shit about that guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Taking a valuable screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I know, just
let me see the fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna watch the guy doing the MOODA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I have to say that
with "Takeshi's Castle," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking loved growing
up while watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, what a show.
- What was your guys' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite segment of that show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because for me to this
day if I have a bad day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll always watch clips
of Lotion Staircase. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, I think they have different names </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to that in UK challenges.
- [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it was title screens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You could tell that they
cast tried to mimic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean did you guys watch
like the Lotion Staircase one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a giant staircase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just covered in lotion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they have to try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and get to the top of it.
- Yeah, I remember that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I liked the one that they would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the Honeycomb Maze, like the Hexagon Maze. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was basically this maze
and you got a up top-down view, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you would see them
go through this maze </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're basically these fucking dudes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which grab them in the face, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and throw them around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's also the rolling things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they would try and run
on, that looked impossible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The one, that sticks out to my mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is the one where they're rock skipping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just like
- That was dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You fucking go full
pelt over these like rocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over a river, and some of
the rocks would just sink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ye
- Now just imagine if like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're running full pelts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then one of the rocks
sinks and you just face bonds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into a real rock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God, that looks painful.
- If you haven't watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in for a treat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just so good, it's such good fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think a show like
that could happen today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no and like and it's
not just "Takeshi's Castle" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like I've realized there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many shows that
either America or the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or like just some Western country is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Silent Library." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like "Wipeout" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and even like "Ninja Warrior," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're all like originally Japanese show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love "Ninja Warrior,"
watching the Japanese version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They could never go as
crazy as the Japanese version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I think that was
definitely game shares. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything kind of got
me into anime, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just that kind of buildup of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of think this culture
is kind of sick, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I like what they do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like all the media that they put out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just jives with me, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just seem to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I remember the
first anime anime, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This is what we're talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like finally getting into like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the shit, right?
- Modern days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like real shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember, I really, for
some reason I wanted to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like a TV and film snob. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why, I wanted to be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen everything, you know like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you go through
the IMDb top 100 phase? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I think, I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's gone to this point.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone in uni. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone at uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like uni was a big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was in the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I just finished watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "24" and "Prison Break" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was feeling like, man
I'm such a TV connoisseur. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've watched "Prison Break" and "24." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I went through the list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and "Death Note" was like
eighth or something at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This must've been like 2012, 13. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I skipped it initially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm like, I don't
watch them cartoons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a grown ass man, I grew up.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want some real show.
- 'Cause again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents and all my family
and cousins and whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were telling me dude
stop watching cartoons, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're an adult, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I naturally skipped it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for some reason I did
a double take like two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or three weeks later, read
the synopsis and I thought, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay this sounds pretty
fucking sick actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And if it's in the top 10, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's got to be pretty good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Watched one episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to school the next day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I stayed up the whole
night up until school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to leave with two
episodes left to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I binged it the whole
season of "Death Note," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in one night and oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just immediately like became obsessed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like overnight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all my other plans to watch
all these famous movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and TV shows get that outta here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone on YouTube said
watch "Code Geass," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm gonna do that now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing lightly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just obviously that
phase where you discover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the golden anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like banger after banger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like three months straight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all you think about is
watching the next anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like remember that phase, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've even missed that phase so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything's you've watched was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look back at some of the shit now, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Even the shitty stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even the shitty like I
remember going through this phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was obsessed with Love Hina right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think everyone had
that phase back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, if we all have
that phase back in the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can I ask what was the show
that ruined that for you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you remember? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I knew exactly what it was for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No because I feel like once
you watched enough anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you start like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do you remember the
feeling of the void, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The void where you watch
this really, really good show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like no one's gonna top this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing's gonna top this
and you just feel empty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you hit your boom woo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing lightly)
- Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughING loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then the more shows you watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the more that void shrinks.
- [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Till you find the next amazing show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you were like,
and then you watch enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you find your
top 10 favorite shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- And then that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of when it starts cementing for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the next phase where
you start watching stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not as good a feeling
as when you first started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, what was it for you then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "School Days." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I distinctly remember this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember being
really annoyed about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm not saying that for
the meme is totally accurate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ' Cause-
- Why can I never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> escape "School Days."
- Okay, you wanna know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's even worse, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that, so I was watching anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on YouTube still at this point, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, and I remember, 'cause
I would got my anime list. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's what everyone did, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You would look at which
ones are high rated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and which ones you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For some reason School Days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like one of the highest rated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was split right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was either a 10 or a two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna be in the 10 categories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah
- Everything I've watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so far I fucking love, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, first off I already had a bad start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching School Days because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember watching "School
Days HQ" or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like-
- well, like a spinoff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like 40 minutes.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "School Days HQ" to explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the original visual
novel of "School days." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But the original visual
novel of School Days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was basically just a full on anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right, it was all animated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- I didn't know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was the first time
I just found that out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you can watch all
the "School Days HQ" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on something like Pornhub or X videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which if you're ready to just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - X Hamsters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you're really just looking to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the clips that you're looking for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can just find it over there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they would have
showed the clips in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't get that far. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got about, cause it was
a 40-minute episode one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I watched 40 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, this doesn't seem right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I watching the right thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's saying it's
good, like is this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny that you say it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the School Days is like mal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is either like a 10 or a two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was definitely one of those
people who put it as a 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know you did you piece of shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know exactly what my-
- What is going on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know what mindset you were in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you were like,
I'm in the fucking hood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta say yes.
- What is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Why am I sitting next to someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who gave School Days a 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay look.
- Is that sheep, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who everyone else has set it at 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he doesn't wanna be
that one guy who was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I have good taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I have good tastes,
I can appreciate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because for me, right, School Days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was-
- [Connor] Garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - it was crap until the last episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the last episode I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> first of all I remember
just sitting there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're obviously not gonna say it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm sure there's
lots of people who know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor humming) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you don't know at the
end of the "School Days." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Boat couldn't comes out, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like School Days
for me, that ending was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most satisfying thing
I'd ever seen in anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I will give you that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was satisfying, but then I remembered, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just sat through 11 of the
most boring shit in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't think this is
big enough to redeem it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the first 11
episodes was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I need anger
management, right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Because oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate the main character so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, I hated him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then the fucking orgasm,
you've got at episode 12 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where what happened, happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh thank God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That ending for me made it a 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like for me-
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I specifically remember I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm glad I went through those 11 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the I got to watch
the most satisfying ending, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever seen.
- That's bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's recency bias, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you're basing your
review of how it ended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not the fucking, the absolute shit truck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to like
shovel through to get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, no, but here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've said this so many times in videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the ending for me
is so fucking important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I had the exact opposite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you got that goldfish brain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones that tunes everything out before- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I have the
exact opposite experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with "Deadman Wonderland."
- No, I still liked that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Deadman Wonderland."
- Because "Deadman Wonderland" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for me was amazing first 10 episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the ending was just the most garbage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bullshit like okay, we
ran out of budget ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That it just completely
ruin the experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that doesn't mean it's a one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not putting, no, no.
- I mean, it means. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't put "Deadman
Wonderland" like a one- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did you give "Deadman Wonderland?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The anime?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a five.
- What no, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's better than a five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because then I read the
"Monga" and the "Monga" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is infinitely better.
- You think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I thought where the "Monga." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the "Monga" actually ends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like the fucking anime.
- Do you like the ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the "Monga" though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's better than the fucking anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess, I remember
reading "Deadman Wonderland." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I kind of liked
what it did a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the ending, I wasn't too
big of a fan over the "Monga." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, but I enjoyed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if it was just like
a mediocre ending, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] At least you got an ending. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least I got an okay ending. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas the anime just
left me wanting more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like don't cock tease me like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after the 10 amazing episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But would you rather a show that has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 amazing episodes with no ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or 24 episodes with 10 amazing episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it starts to go kind of man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ending's a little questionable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first.
- I think this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is what we got with Deadman there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- We got 10 bangers, and then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm just trying
to wrap my head around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how he could justify the "School Days." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay let me.
- I've just been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting here for the past few minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> having a fucking mental
breakdown by myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me rephrase, let me rephrase, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had so many opinion changes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on the ending of the "School
Days," so many times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so what would you
give School Days now then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I would give it a six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my gosh man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a phase where I'm
like, is this ending genius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or is it the worst garbage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever seen?
- It's not genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I make a character that is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking appealing and then I kill him off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You shouldn't be-
- He's not even a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good character, he's not a good character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's exactly the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the ending is satisfying.
- No, but it's satisfying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just so fucking surface level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> watch it again.
- 'Cause </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this protagonist, it's
the one that we follow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He made this character
dog shit on purpose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then there's also a
little bits where he tries to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make you like the guy and
that's the worst part. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's what I fucking hate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, no, don't
try make me sympathize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with this cunt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just had a threesome in class three B, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just have a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's supposed to be a dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or some shit.
- I loved, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the one character development that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck was, Makoto
had that's that was his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Makoto that was his, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause he's so fucking blunt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't even remember his, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember any
of the character names. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love one character
that all of the Makoto had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like, he started out as this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absolute simp for sake guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just turned into these most these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most like fucking-
- Kotonaha, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was her fucking name.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He became like the Giga-chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Giga-chat.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The episode for me that made me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had to pause and go like.
(sighs loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When they wanted to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a threesome or something.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly)
- I like paused it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
(Joey clapping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shut them out there,
shut the fucking there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was so like porn, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was literally a
porn plot, how it happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it is a fucking porn plot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is.
- Yeah, it was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "School Days HQ" is a porn plot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the worst thing about it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that they try and sell you
that it's not a porn plot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they hit you with
the, in front of my salad plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, no,
this isn't what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the fact that people on mal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had the fucking balls to be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is an artistic
masterpiece of our generation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm definitely that one
guy, I could say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like this ending is absolutely genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys just throw me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at the thin air.
- The timing is impeccable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay if my dog got rabies
and I've watched it die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for three hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I'd probably see it put down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it would be satisfying, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's just suffering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what the anime was,
it was just suffering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the fact that I had
to then watch 40 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a let's play or
whatever the fuck it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the first thing.
- See I didn't watch that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the worst part was is that imagined, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, before you could even
start the dog shit pile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is fucking "School Days." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You had to watch 40
minutes of the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you started the same thing again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I remember watching the first episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already bored out of my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'd seen this shit before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a slightly different way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, okay,
I hate "School Days." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen to this.
- School Days sucks (beep). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just having a fucking
mental breakdown right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I thought I had left
School Days in the past. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I never thought I'd hear
those two words again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I never thought I'd be
sitting next to the guy who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, I remember that mal phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought everyone must be trolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like the inter-species
reviewers kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's giving this a 10, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's being fucking ironic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no way that there can be a guy- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there were, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can't imagine you
ironically gave it a 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just can't, I just.
- I just remember like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is happening? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing lightly)
- I had a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is a video-
- Well yeah you corrected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your opinion.
- Yeah, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not enough.
- So, I made two videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The first video I've
ever made on School Days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was right after I finished watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think it's a six-year-old video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's called, is the School Days ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a masterpiece or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was me going
like, yeah, I think it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine "Code Geass" is ending, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You heard that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then 25 episodes was
just us following Nunally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just her daily life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That shit's boring, I don't wanna fuck- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The ending was satisfying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was just a boring show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a boring show for half of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the second half was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anger management issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I gave it such a high score </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just appreciated the meta behind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how the director and producer
chose the literal worst ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of any visual novel in existence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a great trolling in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's why I
said it was kind of genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's definitely different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That ending like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't seen anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that since-
- Because there's a reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why we're still talking about School Days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after fucking how many years
of it since it's been out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah okay, here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that sometimes
(laughing lightly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is a good ending, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you think of it as a good ending? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the story made sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It really like the whole thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like, wow that's a great ending, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it really made sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All the characters built up to this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, it's a good ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the main character
was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone in that show was god awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We just wanted to see
them get like revenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I would argue that an
ending that is good, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't necessarily have
to be memorable, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is a different
between a memorable ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a good ending.
- It's a memorable ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> not a good ending
(laughing lightly). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like pure shock factor, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like pure shock factor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's got no much substance
behind that shock factor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, and that was my big
problem with "School Days." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause at least with the visual novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you could see fucking sex scenes for one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can watch the Giga-chat in that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get some tips, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he's getting threesomes like age 16, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause at least in that
point it actually made sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why he was getting all this fucking pussy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did he though, did he really- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it made sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he was a fucking hentai, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- It made sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in the visual novel, not in the anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because they didn't explain
the hentai sub plot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or the subtext, I guess
that it is a hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was the
first time as a teenager </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was like, sex again.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're gonna go with sex
again, all right Jeez? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but like, around that time, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the age where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you start to be beyond those kinds of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sex and poop jokes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's all about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this isn't challenging
my 16 year old atheist brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's not good material. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm pretty sure I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that like pp ppoo poo
thing that made me laugh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on YouTube like two weeks ago.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know if I'm fully gone but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, but it always goes back, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd laugh at poop jokes
at age 10, not at age 15. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you love a poop
jokes as you get to age 20. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Being a teenager is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just like, that's all I can say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucking weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause teenagers we're
horny as fuck, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I guess when you're
a teenager you wanna.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is weird thing that you
don't do as an adult right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you're an adult, you
fully accept what you're into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But as a teenager, you're
like trying to mold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your interest into what you
think you should be right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I felt like the
shows that you watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is probably why this guy gave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking School Days a 10 he's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna be this smart
guy who can see through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the bullshit to see the masterpiece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would fully admit
that's exactly what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'm not gonna sit here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and say I did that too, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's probably a part
of me that would argue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that "Prison Break" was a
masterpiece of our time, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I look back now, I'm
like what the was I thinking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was 15.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you're a teenager,
you'd have dumb opinions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why you should never start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an anime YouTube channel in your teen age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no.
- Because you're very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> highly regret it later on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My first video was on fucking "Bleach." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, how old are you, when
you started YouTube then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 17.
- Shit, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> See, I would do still do dumb up until 20. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And I started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my YouTube at 19, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was 19 as well when I started. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I holy crap, some of the stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I said that I look back now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you look back and you know the motives </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well to why you said the dumb shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah
- You'd never have now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like, I want
to be seen in this way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm gonna say opinion
that isn't really mine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know people will view me if I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I look back at my,
some of my first videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I fucking cringe, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could not finish them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly)
Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm so fucking glad that
the way the internet was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the perfect time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think for when I was growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there was still
the kind of thing of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could say whatever the fuck you wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you got away with it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure I said some
fucking horrible stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Room Escape and Xbox
live to people right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like-
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I mean kind of stuff
gets hold against you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I'm glad that I had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that room to grow, room to know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> School Days was garbage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Without having to make a video about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like School Days
is a masterpiece, guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, don't make the
same mistake I made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you actually make a video on that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Well you did? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it up in your channel? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's on my channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a video from six years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like-
- We're watching that tonight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like five minutes, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't watch it 'cause it's so clingy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's me in a fucking
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I had this giant chopper
hat for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why I was wearing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was during the era </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was known as the guy
as to where the weird hats. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a chopper hat that
was the huge chopper hat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was also wearing this rainbow beanie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a scarf attached to it and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I looked gross to say the least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno why anyone was like,
Oh yeah, this guy looks good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, an ironically, I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I'd like mulling it over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think School Days is ending
is really freaking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's on my channel right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll keep that up because it is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just getting hard drive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's gonna.
(laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like to keep it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to kind of remind my audience
that I used to be like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but now obviously I've changed
my opinion on School Days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of shows
because I've, as you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had the room to grow
now and the room to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's funny to look back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at your old videos where
you were clingy as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Just to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what I'm like now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean you can see clear improvement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I liked seeing the growth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That feels good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels it hurts to watch
some of your older videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually watched it and I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sound so much more British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My accent has changed so fucking much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't realize that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had such a Northern accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I started YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well when I meet you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you had like the thickest
Northern accent and I'm- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> been like destroyed now, which is nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I speak speak clearly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But I think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it to coincide with all
like YouTube growth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you have that as
well, especially in your taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and anime when you're a teenager </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what you like and you
kind of lie to yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're called Trash Taste for a reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean Joey's is really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pulling his weight on that
Trash Taste, he's really- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode has been on fucking point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had to bring the trash in, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If someone someone's
gonna do is gonna be me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is it every podcast I'm one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can never escape "School Days?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's that
moment as an anime fan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you watch School Days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like two paths, which
one are you gonna go down? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you're gonna go down like
just admitting your taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is like the modern day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like "Pokemon" versus "Digimon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like School Days
good or School Days bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the anime litmus test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm thinking, was "School Days," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just way more culturally important </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the anime fandom than
I've realized it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it is.
- At least for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the mid 2010 that round.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that was a big taste indicator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 100%.
- And also anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who said they liked it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a fucking liar at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, and that means you couldn't trust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any of his opinions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anyone subscribed after
that I don't understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because at that time I remember this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt like I was the idiot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm like the only guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that thinks the show is garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'm I going crazy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When did School Days come out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like 2007, I think it came. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was during the golden age. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so its 2007 yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I think it was 2007. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Saying that, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched that at like
2013 and that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that argument was still
going on until 2013. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to some aspect that's
still going on today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously a lot lesser, but-
- I mean you can argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we brought it back.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, how many anime do you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that have had discussions like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's brought up
time and it's so decisive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think this is the only anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's properly trashy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, it's so trashy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just keeps being brought up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I can, point shows
like say "Evangelion" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can discuss till the end of times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And fans probably we'll discuss
that too at the end of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But in terms of shows that
I count as fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - School Days is just a show
that just doesn't refuse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking cockroach,
every time I step on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I think it's fucking died. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It comes back.
- Two other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come back and say, I like
the end of the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Please, I thought I was past this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'll never escape from it, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's that's the beauty of School Days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's 2020, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love how this was just
supposed to be an origin story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of the downfall of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the absolute, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> roasting of my 10 out of 10 opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like a Brazzers of anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's basically what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine if a Brazzers had a good ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we probably all be
arguing about it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the equivalent of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not, it's fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, so heated about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It gives like a visceral reaction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to everyone who dislikes it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This guy's just living it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just looking forward
to the giant discussion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is gonna cause in the sub Reddit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is gonna be a whole thread again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is gonna come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm interested to see what you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the viewers if you have seen School Days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think of it and if you're wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your thoughts of "School Days." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing lightly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is there anything else we
can talk about other than- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's a good
place to end it for today? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I just took
the wind out of my sails. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how I can possibly be calm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about anything else today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing softly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you do have something
important to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We do have something to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We've actually started
the Trash Taste patron </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you can see, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the production value is
quite high for this podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and we have editors helping us and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's a whole system that we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and sadly it doesn't fund it's self- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It cost a lot of money to run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically, I just
wanna talk about, because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like when we
were making this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we didn't wanna settle for
cheap production values, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We wanted this to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comparable to any other
high budget podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to us, this was a passion project. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've put quite a lot of
our own savings into this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's an understatement.
- It's like super expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing lightly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like several thousand
dollars to making this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and plus, we are renting
out a studio, in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of time, a lot of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, near Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So right now, not to say that we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all three of us are pretty well off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're probably fine (laugh). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're probably fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We just don't want our passion project </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be bleeding money,
which right now it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So any help that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can give to help us just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go even 'cause that's my goal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I can just do this and not have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to worry about-
- to worry about losing money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like just constantly losing money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I would be more comfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I would just be happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And hopefully with
your guys' support too, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we'll be able to evolve this podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into like bigger and better
things in the near future. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and if you want
us to stand the viewer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who doesn't care about patron, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anything, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing will change to your Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna be exact same way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You get everything, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The patrons don't get anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not gonna pay wall anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- And please, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll be fine financially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't support
it, it's totally fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's purely optional.
- Purely optional. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you like the podcasts.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And is that, what else
do we have to discuss? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anything else we need to
shout out or anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Follow us on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> whether this would be in Spotify. </SPEAKER_04>
