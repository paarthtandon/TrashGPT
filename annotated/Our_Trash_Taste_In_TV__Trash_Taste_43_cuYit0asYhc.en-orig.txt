<SPEAKER_02> that was a what country originally made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that america america but we had like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australian version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah the british one went for a long </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> time yeah we had like who's the host </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no edmunds yeah have you seen the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> american deal or no deal no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's like deal or no deal but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way more hollywoodized is it literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just like the kitchen nightmares deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like kitchen nightmares usa is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boom you won't believe what happened and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then the uk one is like gordon's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right come on you gotta you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> acting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's just it's way bigger they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got like it you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of just [ __ ] noel edmunds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like opening the briefcase or some or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've got like the proper you know um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boxing ring chicks that like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah yeah like the models that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> open up the briefcase you compared to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the british version and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just night and day wait does the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> british version not have because i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really see the boxes we have the boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh because in australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that we took the american thing we lined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> up like 30 chicks can we explain what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deal and no deal is you're someone who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> might not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay basically like a contestant comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> um oh wait opens a bunch of briefcases </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have to get down to how do you even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wait so they get down to two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boxes don't they yeah okay so uh if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember correctly you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't remember like 15 boxes or 15 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> briefcases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like 25. is that like a lot yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to like you have to choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> random briefcases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they get knocked out and then like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every briefcase has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a different amount of money in it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you choose that briefcase that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of money is knocked out of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prize pool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and no but isn't it they they pick a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> briefcase first and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they hang on to it but they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know what it is oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there's basically what they do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't just immediately skip to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> final one which you pick is because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along the way based on what you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> knocked out or got in so say you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> knocked out all the lower prize pools </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the 1000 pounds the 2000 they'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> offer you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> deals yeah so the whole point of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> show is that you kind of want to knock </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out all the small ones at first so that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might offer you a really generous deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which yeah because your box might be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the one that's left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it's it was always a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun game show and i really liked it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the uk i don't know if this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same in australia but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all ages watch like the quiz shows like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the daily show yes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just couldn't see like my my grandma </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like bikini models [ __ ] open up dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my grandma was [ __ ] obsessed with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deal or no deal oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my my great grandma too as well yeah she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was i don't know what it is watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> every day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah wait but did you guys not have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the supermodels like without cases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no all game shows are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unapologetically like just like chill </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just doing like like for normally for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> small amounts of money but yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but then on the opposite of the side of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the spectrum you guys have shows like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> naked attraction yeah i mean i i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i mean that's still a small scale i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would say because even like pointless </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which has been like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh if you don't know what pointless is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of hard to just [ __ ] google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know i want to explain every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single game that we talk about um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pointless the prize pools only have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 1 000 pounds right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which is really yeah which is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to go on i think to go on you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> national tv it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for like what like 1 500 no 1 300 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not really a lot if that's if you win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah nothing if you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least no deal had like i think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> prize pool the top price was like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> million dollars or something it's 250 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 250 000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it pounds forward oh really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay and australia was like a million </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's not too far off but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean you never saw anyone winning the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> milk the price pools in general on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quiz shows are pretty small except for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the big ones which are marketers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the big ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the biggest one we had was who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wants to be millionaire yeah that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the whole i mean i think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was the biggest one anywhere right i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they're probably like the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> version was probably like the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive just like [ __ ] why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is our currency so god damn strong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a million pounds a lot of times imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a japanese who wants to be a millionaire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have that it's like did you just win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a million yen uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 grand i think uh wait what is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ashley do you remember like how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> money is it for the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who wants to be a millionaire i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know japan oh yeah never mind i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> million no it's 10 million yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> would make sense because we spoke about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it before i remember like to keshi's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> castle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like uh the japanese version i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think it was three million yen was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> prize yeah i thought for a game show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that [ __ ] hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> thirty thousand dollars doesn't seem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a fair reward for a show that only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like five people ever won but in most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> quiz shows yeah well it is about the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> money but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it is about the money the max you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get is like 10k </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and usually and usually that's split </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because like usually it's like a team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> based </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no i think so it's like you guys win </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 10k split between the five of you so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's small and then after taxes so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about a grand like what's your like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> favorite australian or like american </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i already liked family fortunes i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know i don't know what the american one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family feuds i've seen like the american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like clips of the american one and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as fun if not even better than the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> british version because like on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> american one i feel like they have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> more celebrities to choose from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly right exactly we only have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> a few very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> giants yeah we had like les dennis which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't even remember what he was famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for in the first place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because because like in america you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like celebrities which normally are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> known like the world over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah that's just how it is but in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk you have like two tiers of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> celebrities which are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legit like massive celebrities known all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around the world like you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally musical artists or like really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big actors and then the locals then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> have like the locally known ones which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are normally like just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um the comedians are pretty good like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of that you have like someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he said the a racist word on tv and made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a career out of it one time well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yes i mean okay i mean it's the same in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> australia yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in australia it's like you're either an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> internationally known like star who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hosting the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're an australian comedian that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> failed to like market themselves outside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of australia yeah yeah so he's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll give you a spot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you speak in australia we had okay we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had this one game show i think it was i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know if it was british first it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> called golden balls did you ever watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i didn't watch that yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know i know yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> teehee golden balls and i can't so what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> would happen is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they would get like five balls each and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they all had different amounts of money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in them right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they basically have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> negotiate i think ah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no so you could kick off sorry so no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no no um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like a football game no i i've seen i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't actually seen it but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think we're thinking with the right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one where the last round the last round </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the most it's the most interesting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one so you have a prize pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's it's i think it's based on like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the prisoner's dilemma or something i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably wrong on that but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you have two people and you basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> agree if you're going to share the prize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and or like okay so you have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> steal or share yeah all right you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> steal the entire prize pool or you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> share the prize pool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and if you share if if both people pick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> share then you share the prize money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if one person picks steel they get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> amount of the prize oh okay but if both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people pick steal then no one gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nobody gets surprised you saw like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> biggest pieces of [ __ ] on this show like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you'd win the money but like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> really seems like a show to like expose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was brutal right because this tv show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] loved it because they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever you got to do to get this money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you ham it up so these people would do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive sob stories to the person next </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you yeah right and they would believe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'd be like man my kids you know they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> need this thing real bad man they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know they need this expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing etcetera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then and then they you know they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would do it and then they reveal like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they stole all the money yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's like okay sure you won 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grand but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what cost what costs at what cost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you they go through their like entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life story to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i uh i'm a devout christian i've given </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to charity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i am the most honest person you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever meet in your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally did a dion was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm going to reject humanity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get this money i don't remember this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> one guy i think i've seen the same clip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right was it which one which one was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy who just [ __ ] hacked like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> and you're gonna have to trust me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm going to share the prize money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after the after after the show ends and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the other guy asked the host is </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> is by picking share right such a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five head moves like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but at the end he didn't pick steel he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> picked cher </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> this is what i saw right here i i saw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i swear i don't know if this was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a popular clip i remember one time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy like literally came into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's four contestants at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start i believe he was literally just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right from the start being like i'm a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> steal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm going to steal no matter what life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he stole and then he didn't get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> anything see the person also stole wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so it was like the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like small brain version where he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was he was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna steal to everyone i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we know i'm not giving you anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so am i god imagine you you wait for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months right you go through all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interviews and [ __ ] you get on the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finally you have a chance of winning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> money and some [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately just said to everyone i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to ruin the show for all of you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't give a [ __ ] you'd be like well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] what am i supposed to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like the that's like the what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] the thing uh the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> millionaire hot seat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing as well did you have those no we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't have that i don't think okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know if it wasn't we definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had it in australia though so there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know there's like who wants to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be a millionaire which is just like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one-on-one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there's this other version of it called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> millionaire hot seat which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is basically it's one game of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> millionaire but then there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four other people in basically like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting on the benches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for the person to [ __ ] up and if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one person gets the answer wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then it goes to the next person from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they started that's pretty cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember i saw this clip which is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you start off with five people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and uh they got to i don't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like the 2000 you know not even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> halfway up kind of thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i guess it was like a really hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> question so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the first guy gets a wrong and he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] all right whatever see you later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next person comes along fully confident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like well he basically just got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rid of one of the answers for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i got this and not only does he get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wrong but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the next person during 50 50 he also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gets it wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so the fourth person comes up is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so there's only one answer remaining um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you're correct but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting on the benches all that time to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just come up and be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you for giving me this money thank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you for the free money thank you for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> free money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jkc yeah i'm trying to remember what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> else was that the weakest link </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> german the weakest link yeah like what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his name uh was it phil or dan which one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of them was on the weakest link </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh were they yeah one of them yeah one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of them was on the weakest link </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the weakest link oh it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just not going anywhere is it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think so it was this really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popular daytime british tv show where we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had this like really like she was famous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for being like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically okay because that was her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole character was that she was there i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember her name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and she was just a quiz show and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically like it would just keep going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking questions and you basically like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the question the round </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd ask eight people you have to vote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone off and it was normally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person who was letting the team down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you got a question wrong you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ruined the streak and it's like a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game where more bonus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more streaks so if someone gets a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> question wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they ruin it and you get less money yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like as it's going around so if i get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one right i get 100 points then you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 200 then 400. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone has to like say bank so that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the points get saved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the stream can keep going until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone saves it so if you're the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who's like i'm gonna get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the big boy question and then you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it up and lose the money that everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just earned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you're probably gonna get voted off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right but then like there was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meta game behind it as well because if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are too good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> then people then then people would just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like gang up in you and vote you off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they would have won the best chance of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> winning right right you were on the game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> show right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then there was a that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably and i think i can't wish one it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was dan or phil one of them was on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before they became a youtuber oh wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's really good you should watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like uh the hosts are just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> roasting them that sounds fun it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty it's really endearing watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> someone before they were a youtuber like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it's really fun i've always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to be on like trivia shows like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean i think i'd like to go on a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show that has like literally that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just a game show just go up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do it like yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no no no no no no no no hey play this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> character no just let me just [ __ ] go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> myself like is there like uh what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really how a game show is still going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah they are i think like it's like i'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like to think that most game shows are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the complete opposite of like the talent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because the talent shows are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just heavily scripted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> narratives yeah yeah yeah yeah all this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff i think we just don't know because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't watch tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we i just stopped watching tv so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually have no [ __ ] idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore yeah yeah me too there was this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> youtuber now who's uploading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um he entered uh an american talent show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i'd never heard of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i think he's called reckless ben on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube and he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he he basically signed up for this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then wore secret glasses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while he's on it so now he's uploading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos of him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> behind the scenes and his narration is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really [ __ ] funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah now they're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> threatening him to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take the video yeah of course yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he's uploading videos be like i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna take it down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the next video i'm taking it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's right it's really interesting it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just really living up to his name yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause he's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he's in it and he's just narrating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really stupid and he's just like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complete clown in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best way possible yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really interesting you should watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these youtube videos i didn't sell it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> very well i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i still want to explain too much you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should go watch them it's pretty really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> underrated yeah no one's watching these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> videos they have like 80k 100k </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which is that's that's still decent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> amounts well like as crazy as this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot bigger but i know it's is it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even a big kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exposure that hey this is kind of faked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and no but it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all scripted it's really fun just seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a producer go up to him and be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no not now oh hey this is your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh like you know like when the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> crowd's cheering yeah yeah like he shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the video footage of like what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the show see that he cuts to what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's happening to him and it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him in the middle of a giant stage and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there's nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like no noise or anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think there's a big difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like hearing and knowing that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rigged versus actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing that you know like all those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talent shows as well have like on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on-site therapists because of like how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like brutal the schedule it's like some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of them uh in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> america's got talent had to like sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around for like 19 hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to like wait to practice [ __ ] jesus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so they had on-site therapists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would like there was like cases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where they're injecting them with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vitamins and stuff to keep them awake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during these shows what the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then obviously you know these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> contracts you sign which have come out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before for like x factor in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah it's kind of horrible yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my god like some of them i swear it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> x factor uk where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you literally sign away your rights to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything you've ever done online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and any right anything you do in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> future yeah like if you became a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> youtuber they own it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you can't do without their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> permission yeah it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not i get why they do because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to cover their ass but they go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like so beyond where it's like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like this is going to have just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> agreed exploitative but like people want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their five minutes of fame right that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right and it's like what are you gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do get five minutes of fame yourself no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think you don't think so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you do build a career good one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not without my help not without simon </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> on someone else yeah it was like um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the other one there was like these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was one of them i think it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh he was like a south african guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the other one was like an american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh she was like super activist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff and like he was just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like the most laid-back man on earth was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah yeah wherever wherever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she was just like i need you to know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i care about these things and she </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was psychotic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like watching her like behave around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this guy was like awful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was just like this is terrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is awful why is he doing this how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much is he getting paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that's what i'm wondering it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> plc like i need to know no no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no no no no no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> no no no no no no no no no it's tlc so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're definitely paying attention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you sure they're getting paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they're getting paid pennies like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like i hope they're getting paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because if they're not getting paid i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know why they're putting up with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> half of this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it is i'm pretty sure tlc pays all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of the people that they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure but yeah but like i use the word </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> paid very loosely like they're probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting paid scraps for that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's just like it's like i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching this and i'm like how much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you have to pay me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know that uh you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> rose the the filipino </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> girl she's like a youtuber now yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saw sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's just like you probably got paid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] all but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hey you got a youtube career now i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know you haven't followed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the rap situation where if the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> side is just so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> goddamn awful it makes you look amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i did her solid it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always weird for me watching american </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reality tv show versus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> british reality tv show because i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like british reality tv show is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much more toned down than americans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i think when i think of british </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reality tv shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the peak that comes to me is something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like come dine with me that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty good or like uh what's the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one that that [ __ ] guy does where you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just come up to him at a table and he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buy [ __ ] off you for like a hundred quid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was the antique hunters or something oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> antiques roadshow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anti-road show is that is that it oh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like that i like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been on the air for like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how long and it's just fun to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people to bring in some things i'll give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you [ __ ] 20 quid for it yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the [ __ ] you know like porn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stars right but like legitimately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more legit than that yeah yeah come down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with me it's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably the best british reality show i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think i enjoy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my favorite trash reality tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shows i can't remember the name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the concept is they take this couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who you know doesn't have a lot of money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are wanting but want to get married oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my god i want to get married it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lovely yeah not cheap as weddings that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the australian is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the australian australian voters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they get like they give them 10k </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to sort out this wedding right now oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's uh uh and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the bride has no control she she doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know anything and it's all up to the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lucky's obsessed with that show it was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bbc three show yeah yeah yeah and uh who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> called the bride or something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like something like that who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wants the bride who wants to write </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's such a it was such a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept in my opinion because like 10k i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the right amount of money to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> able to make a wedding happen but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not enough to make everything you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of a wedding happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's pretty genius yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ingenious and like making the guy do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean you don't need producers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right you just sit there and follow the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if he does nothing that's fantastic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> content yeah he's like and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they must be fully aware of it too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they always shoot they always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> choose to use the 10k in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> worst [ __ ] we should have done that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with god's wedding yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because the guys in the show right the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first thing they do it's like call up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the crew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and they call it like their boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they call up their boys and they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like the main guy will be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] clueless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one friend is like i really don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you should you know hire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> inflatable dinosaurs for your wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that seems like a bad idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like no no i got this that's why you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> waiting there's always like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always that there's either the guy who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like there was never a guy who got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like 100 right because yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a guy who was like pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> close and then like did a modest attempt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was just the other type of guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm gonna do [ __ ] star wars themed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my favorite one is the one where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the the the groom like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> decides to get married in like a pig </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> barn oh yes yeah i've seen this one like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they go to like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the dead is gonna like a farm with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a [ __ ] muddiest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i think it's like but you love pigs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i saw one where the guy like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> hosted the wedding in a cave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a proper an actress okay yes you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not caving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i mean that's that's badass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then like not in the nutty buddy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like he knew that the bride's mum was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> claustrophobic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so the bride's not match he couldn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attend like the wedding ceremony because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like standing outside the cave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's [ __ ] big brain that's so big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so uh my in-laws hate boats so i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> decided let's get on the cruise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean as someone who's like planning a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wedding now it's it's it's great for me </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> it's like my favorite moment is always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when they try to pick the dress </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's not even like a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bit wrong it's always the complete </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opposite of what the bride picks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally like m123 and have a </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> i would you know even if i got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like paid on top of doing the wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i'm assuming the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the like kind of the reason why people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apply for that show is you get a free </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like man organizing a wedding seems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the easiest things to get wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like just i thought about this yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought about this and i was like god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn just the like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know like all right you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friends right but like not every friend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to come to your wedding right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that must be so [ __ ] awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> deciding like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're you're a good enough friend but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't know if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like good enough for the wedding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i can barely organize a boys night out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let alone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] also like you have like how many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> friends do you have right and like where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you draw the line who's close enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you decide </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is it like a mutual thing you're like no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't like ted like what winning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> politics is like definitely i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so difficult my my cousin went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through it as well and it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's ah there's there's a lot that goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into a wedding that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like i i have no interest i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like trying to plan a wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself is hard enough trying to plan a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> internet like when you're not in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country yeah and also during like covert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this this is this is like not even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard mode this is like dark souls no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no like there's so many things that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can like that can [ __ ] up as well i love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how i love that nowadays whenever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anything is like extremely hard the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first thing you think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dark souls no hit nothing's harder than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean it's stressful but it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rewarding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it must be i think i mean is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going on i mean it's rewarding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yes yes it's rewarding until like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it will be rewarding once it actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> finishes right yeah and everything goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smooth i mean i mean like the planning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parts some of it's better than the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> others like i remember like my favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> moment so far has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually going to the venue and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like yeah this is the place this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the place that's an amazing feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything up to that like searching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through about 50 catalogues of possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places and driving to about 10 different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> places and being like uh do i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> settle on this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know can i see myself getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> married in a barn or a cave </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> they're like we think there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wedding politics in western weddings no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in asia it's a [ __ ] statement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right and i hate that i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely hate that because there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so many unspoken rules that are changing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the amount that they must spend on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> weddings here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's nice yeah it's insane if you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like any like fancy hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan like you just cause you know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you go there for like a lunch or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something you'll see that like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wedding planning rooms are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> full with people yeah and like those </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> family members doing i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i don't know i don't care i kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't agree with this is that where it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comes from like where does that come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly i have no idea does it come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from something more sinister like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you've been doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean i'm not i'm not sure how the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> custom started because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like it's it's something that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've attended thai weddings and i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> seen happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i've i've never kind of asked where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where where this where this came from i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i don't think i want to do that so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys just kind of died did you buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like she pressed i did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it's my bargain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the same customary where it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bride's dad is expected to play for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like no that shouldn't be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the case either yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's it's to me a wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many customaries to weddings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that revolve around money that i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't understand i guess because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean that was common that's pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> common in the west still right that the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the other person the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bridegroom the bride's parents will pay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i mean it's understandable when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> marriage used to be way younger like 21. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i get it then because you don't have any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> money but now people getting married at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 27 30 30 so it's like you know i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you probably should have your own money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by then you know like yeah should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> planning a wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're unemployed at 30. maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just dissing yourself yeah i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just sorry for that guy who just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know had like five children and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> all of them ended up being daughters and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like come on come on son son </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> son oh my god it's like the uh like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> aging population like pyramid thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it won't bite you now it'll bite you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because isn't it like i remember i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw like this i don't remember it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vice documentary or some kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> documentary on youtube where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i forgot which country it was somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle east where like they still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have the tradition of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wife napping where it's like they they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i forgot which country it was but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember i saw this documentary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's this tradition quote-unquote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tradition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where guys if they find a girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that they find attractive and they see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as wife material </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them will actually like dead-ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kidnap them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in broad daylight take them back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their parents place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the girl is then forced to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> married to this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this like [ __ ] real life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pokemon sounds like runescape this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like runescape </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like and like traditionally the girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't decline it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really yeah so like that she has to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> married in and and there's always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this documentary i saw is like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so [ __ ] disturbing because there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these girls who are literally just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breaking down while they get the veil </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put on top of them and [ __ ] and it's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> bonded with a police officer over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> apex yeah luckily it was nice but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's pretty like alerting when you first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stop you and i'm like why are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stopping yeah right why are you stopping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then someone told me uh they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah apparently there's like um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some police officers like quotas of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> people they have to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh really it makes sense certain areas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they've just got so little work to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> here right so and they're normally told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to i guess they're getting paid to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> something this is like the least like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> xenophobic way of like saying this but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've i've been told i don't know if this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is true that some police officers are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> told to stop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh foreigners to practice their english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that makes sense that makes sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> feels wrong like if that happened in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> another country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or i would be like yeah that's [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not right yeah yeah but i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like at least they're nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it though right yeah i just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that they asked like my id </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't know someone about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels weird i guess they check my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> colleagues </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's never a way where a policeman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> asks for your id and you don't at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sweat a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah right like i'm like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> audible like swallow like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> white guy gets like discriminated first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time in his life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pov like this is like the story right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is what it feels like to be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> minority [ __ ] oh god fish is [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm kidding i know it's [ __ ] bad yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like yeah i mean it's happened a few </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> times but it's because it's happened at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 10 p.m i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know for some reason when it happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at night it feels like way more like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whoa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like why are you stopping anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> else i'm the only i'm the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> non-japanese you shouldn't have told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this story on trash days you could have </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> huge scene for it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> apex right now is massive because also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shockingly because the v youtubers that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are playing it was popular before that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but the beach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ninja signs propelled the [ __ ] out of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah because like when we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> moved to japan i think is when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pub g was big right pubg was big but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think apex either just released or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> released like a while back and they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing a huge push for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i the month where we moved here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single ad i got was apex legends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really in japan yeah everything was and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i thought wow that's kind of weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's kind of like a dead game in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the west </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> at least it was i feel like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flip-flops and whether it's popular or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> not yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what even counts as a dead game anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right overwatch i'd say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's because overwatch 2's coming out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so they're just like abandoned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um but like you know i mean i not a dead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game but like not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the public discourse is what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> would consider like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah when people when people say dead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game i think that's what they mean like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like no one plays it like the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> population is talking about it or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah yeah like it's not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you you know you're not expected to have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some general knowledge about it because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not expected to have a police </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> officer come up to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do you play overwatch do you play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overwatch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> who do you mean who's your overwatch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> player right like you tankers like they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna sound like such a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boomer right now like what even are the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> popular games right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because because like when i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee all that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i when i think popular game i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know whatever the fad is right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> among us and four guys well i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after the among us kind of like settled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it definitely became a bit more variety </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like tends to be quite a lot like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> valheim's picking up steam which is kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like a reimagining of runescape </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all i've heard valheim is is just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minecraft but better graphics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> oh i heard runescape with like mixed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with minecraft oh really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um apex has obviously had a really big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> resurgence yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good numbers like a lot of big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streamers are getting back into it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i think valerian's still doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> leagues obviously league league's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always up there i think csgo is still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same thing where it's always been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of like you know the scrappy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> little underdog because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the thing is like i look at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> top watch games on twitch and they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally like the games that i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> never end up playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i don't actually i i never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually know what and what everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ends up playing or what's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> popular right now um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know we haven't had any massive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> games recently after a manga we haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really had anything that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stolen the spotlight i don't yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think the last time i spoke about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> games i got things very wrong people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gave me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fair enough go ahead i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole idea of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like the most popular game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowadays is a little bit blurred </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just because like anyone can i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like they're gonna be the top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> games yeah yeah like chess has had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> already big resurgence obviously yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> balloons tower defense six man i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> telling you man it's coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's playing it man before it gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fortnite obviously is just fortnite i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know like i feel like a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games are just kind of like settled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we haven't really had anything to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> shake i mean i remember for the longest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time we're in the league community where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yo league's dying league's dying it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's never gonna well it's never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna die um it got it plateaued but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like there's a difference between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something plateauing and something kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of like and also the league of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> viewership has been like pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> consistent just because of the plateaus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't mean it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know yeah no no i mean i mean league </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is still like you know you can still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> support a billion dollar company people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are playing it so you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like it's like is it in public </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> discourse right or not i usually i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually chalk up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> whether a game is popular if like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> minecraft is like like small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like the younger generation of playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it true like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you go to like a primary school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're talking about apex and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fortnite and minecraft then it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay this is like the big games right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> now yeah it's funny man i mean my mom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was telling me she works in primary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> school she told me like one kid got like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really bullied because um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like bad is it for tonight no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't there uh there was a story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> skin as well yeah there was a story in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> japan where a kid got bullied because he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> had the default skin fortnite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> serves him right wow i mean i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've talked about this before but i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> heard the same story as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> um but like i think minecraft is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely probably the biggest i'd say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minecraft's still the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> minecraft's just a juggernaut at this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> point it's not going anywhere since </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> since our last stream i've been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> should i play minecraft sure should i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] should i play minecraft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's dead it's so relaxing if we all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> play minecraft you guys got to try apex </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we should do that we should do like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a game cultural cross </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cross-pollination </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we should do that come on it's what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people want god </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> this song because i know if you guys try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it you'll have a good time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think you will i think every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person who ever offered me an fps game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the same thing it's because this is with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the boys i heard it about fortnight i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heard it about overwatch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've already talked about this we'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> give it a shot we'll give it a shot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll try it guys don't worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll convince them so i guess switching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gears did you guys hear about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like deep fake story that happens i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or yesterday so yesterday for us but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would be like three weeks for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> audience yeah three weeks three weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for the audience facts may come out i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean yeah i i have not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like with deep fake becoming like such a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> big thought like a bigger thing now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i uh i can't we're gonna go back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't remember every detail of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story but i think the main gist of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was his mom and she had a daughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was on the cheerleading squad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we get maylene to check the story while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we're talking about it yeah just google </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deep fake news that'll be like a top </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i believe there was mom who had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> daughter who was on the cheerleading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> squad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and there were other girls on that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cheerleading squad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for some reason she wanted the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> she wanted to kick these other girls off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the squad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so what she did is she made some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deep fakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like of the other girls like smoking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like smoking drinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> doing doing like bad illegal activities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think threatening them with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right or like i can't remember if she </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> threatened them or she sent them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> straight to them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sure how she did it but i think they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they saw it and the reason why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it got even found out was because they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> took it to the police yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and how she got found out was she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> used the fake number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she used like this internet service that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gave them a gave her a fake number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but that didn't hide her ip address </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's the only reason she found out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sponsored by you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think she would have got caught </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if she was sponsored by it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't think our sponsor would be very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happy now that's why we're not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mention any names </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i mean i i saw it and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like well i can't believe they actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this long or something like this to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happen you know the most unbelievable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part of the story is there's a mum out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there that's tech savvy enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that's what i thought mike you i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't even think my mum knows what a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] deep fake is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let alone had it she doesn't even know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how to search for files on windows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm actually impressed her mum knew how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make a difference because i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> impressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i'm impressed that mom knew how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do a deep fake but i'm even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more like because okay um i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not sure if any of this is confirmed so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to put out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a disclaimer that we could be totally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wrong this could be please check this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> out do your own research yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time this comes out all right all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll cut the story awhile by the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this come out comes out everything might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be confirmed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this might all have been like false </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> information or it would it might have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> claims but at the time of recording we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if it's real or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but these are what the allegations are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right uh and the allegation was that she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did this because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the daughters on the cheerleading squad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she stopped hanging out with her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> daughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so she she wanted to get them kicked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off because of that and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if someone's this petty to be this crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how dare you are not friends how did she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manage to figure out how to do deep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they all she also sent them anonymous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> messages tying them to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they should you know end their own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> lives as well to the these kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the mom did that the mom did that what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how this is something some people are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not supposed to be scared this is so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cartoon villain like it's so absurd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that someone could be this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] oh my god yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i saw that and i'm just thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my first thought was i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one i'm surprised that it took this long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for something like this to happen right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this mug shot looks like she's tore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's face off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god she looks like a disney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> villain doesn't it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like maleficent just ripped someone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> face off and stitched it that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should i say that it's probably too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> going too far isn't it that's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like i shouldn't [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling kids to watch that actually it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks like she's wearing someone else's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> face oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know there's more concerning about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that that was someone's parent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah holy [ __ ] imagine being raised by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> someone like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holy [ __ ] that kid's gonna be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but apparently the kid knew nothing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the mom did this without telling the kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she did this by herself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so how would you even tell the kid like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the kid's like are you cool with this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i'm not mom what's wrong with your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a nasty tweet and then there's creating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deep faces please please don't tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my schoolmates to go kill themselves and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> make these fakes when i would tell my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mum that i was being bullied she wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thrilled about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah she was like you know i'm not happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about this i'm putting a word to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> teacher but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're on your own yeah yeah yeah this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is your problem exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't deal with this [ __ ] i don't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know what's going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like i mean [ __ ] hell that's scary i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just so many these the parts of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this story is actually insane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that this could happen it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> literally like a horror movie plot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what this is this is kind of like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just it's almost too cartoony to be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> black mirror episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what that's what it is it is it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so like if this was a blackberry episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd be like yeah twist's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> predictable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like really really over the top yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean like it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> great horror film like the mom's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an unbelievable villain here she could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have used more character development </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more motivation no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is reality but what scares me is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what what does this mean for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> future of deep fakes now because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh this week especially this new apps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come up where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gotten really easy to deflate yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know deflate you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> use use it for memes use it for harmless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> memes to make people sing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] bakami thai i mean you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we're used to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know people doing [ __ ] terrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> photoshops or doing stuff like that so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone sent me a video of me doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something i clearly didn't do or never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever did i'd be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't give a [ __ ] it's fake right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll say it's fake and yeah that'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably be the end of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but to someone who's never really had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything online or any kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know posted anything about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> themselves inside like their personal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> facebook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can see why receiving a video that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing something that you didn't do could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be [ __ ] terrible yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right absolutely you would think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wow people are really going to believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know realistically they're probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> not going to you explain that it's fake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean it's it's gotten to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like for people like us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially where we show our faces on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camera pretty often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wouldn't be hard to make a convincing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deep fake with you know us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> coming on camera literally every week i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think we all uh we all agree on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that you do not have permission to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any deep fakes of us and we don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> condone any of them by the way just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> saying that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're legally not allowed to do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean is there anything legal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know that yeah you can't you're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i think legally speaking you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just do that yeah um depending on what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jurisdiction you're in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah tom scott did a video about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i think i think the laws around it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but iffy and obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff like this always takes because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's such a new thing yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a really new thing because like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i've seen like the buccaneer tie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> deep fake someone just like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> funny meme whatever but then i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how it i would feel if i saw the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you know the ksi ainsley harrier deep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fake because that's that's so good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's so good it's funny as [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> also something at the back of my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which makes me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's [ __ ] worrying that's how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good like how good it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm glad it's been used as a funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meme but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my god if if i saw if i saw my face on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody else like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i would just think damn i'm glad this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being used </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for a funny meme but this could be used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for something that's really luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as many deep fake things are being made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just as many things that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> detecting if deep fakes have been made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like programs that are being written to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> detect them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so right now it's like it's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> software's will detect when the when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a deep fake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but whether it'll get to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in future that it that it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think like it's only a matter of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time before we get our first deep fake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cancellation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no i think we're quite far away from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that right i think i think they're still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> too rough and the technology isn't there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yet but i think it's possible within </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've seen some defects that are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] convincing though but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the videos are like always in like 480p </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> max right like and well that's like kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the video you'd expect for i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of phone quality exposed videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're never like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 720p 4k it's always like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playstation eye camera </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but i think the the more the easier it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets to cancel someone from a deep fake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the less cancelling will happen because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone will be like it's a deep fake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it a deep fake or everyone's going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> defense is going to be it's a deep fake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah all right but like how did that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> video of me punching a baby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing how long until the deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fake argument is going to be legitimate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah well i mean the moment that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can counsel someone for a deep fake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is when that argument will become valid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because they'll be like oh i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you sure you saw that do you think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was yeah it was deeply it's a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good deep faith </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> looks so real oh my god i can't believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> our world's going to become a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> messy when he gets there unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's uh yeah i mean there's nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what's scary is that there's nothing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop the technology being out there but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i i guess you can argue this for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of things because i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you know 3d printers became a thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can still 3d print guns yeah exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you can still 3d print guns you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shouldn't but i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you shouldn't and i believe it's illegal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well it's it's most around it real weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i think i think what it is is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> most uh 3d printing machines can detect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's like the blueprint of a gun or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> firearm or something and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not well it's like a photoshop if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> put a picture of the the dollar bill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in uh they won't let you do anything to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah it'll like stop you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh really yeah i had no idea yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so they don't want to photoshop it to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like try and like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the software's so powerful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> photoshop print out free money yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> photoshop is really powerful tool yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the stuff that they're constantly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> adding to it is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know adding to the repertoire of how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strong it is and it's like very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concerning but then again you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like when photoshop first started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well like we were all like oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are going to be like it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's going to start getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cancelled they're going to be people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to put nicholas cage in orgies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> although that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't remember there being a case </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where someone got in trouble for a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> photoshop picture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like a big story like because normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a picture at least you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there needs to be a lot more context </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> behind why the picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> exists yeah yeah exactly and without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> reasonable context of why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the picture would exist people aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really gonna believe it yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably gonna be the same for a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if there's a video of like i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know like robert downey jr just like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said like punching a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like a park or something it's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like well one why is robert down a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> junior in a park </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is he playing basketball with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kid then punching it right this is gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the context is gonna be needed like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's gonna be so many questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're gonna need to be answered before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you take a video seriously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's good yeah but but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long until you do run into like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect situation where it's like oh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story is there the narrative is there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything lines up the only difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that robert downey jr didn't actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> punch the kid yeah i mean like but i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make him punch the kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he was close i mean i mean [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fake news articles are bad enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with with how you know there are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anti-vaxxers and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flat earthers and just things that have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> been enabled because it's so easy to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stay in your bubble and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really like strengthen your own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> argument and you're right it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> worrying time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it is definitely a worrying time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but i don't let it get to me i'm trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to enjoy life you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm just trying to live my best life the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> world may be ending but i'm gonna have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> good time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i still laugh at these memes i care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about what i need to care about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no more that's kind of how i like to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like i just think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> after a certain point if you just start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worrying about everything you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be [ __ ] miserable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like i think obviously you know when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it comes to like you know you're voting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your politician your area yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should care about that and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should matter but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beyond that do i care if a news </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presenter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the u.s says like something [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> abhorrent i'm like no honestly it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really my problem and i don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe that that's i don't know is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that like elitist to think that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of my like like you know i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know to me like stuff that goes on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> u.s sometimes i'm like that's honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not my problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like is that bad like so some people say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a prejudiced or ignorant mindset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> work it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i have the luxury right it depends it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> depends on the context right because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problem is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the problem with that argument i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feel is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no way a human can care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> true so at some point you're going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to pick and choose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you care about otherwise one you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably going to be a miserable [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and two you're gonna wake up and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna you're just gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exhausted i'm not gonna have to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anything on the day because you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel flooded and i feel flooded enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with my own social media right now and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like and this is me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like where social media is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> intertwined with our jobs so i see this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and i'm just like i can't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about it i'm pretty sure that's how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people become nihilists right they just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they look at the world it's like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the world is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess nothing matters i mean like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like it's just been so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like heavier as well i've since the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pandemic as well because yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just trying to like get by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know life's already difficult enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then shit's going on you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] man like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm i'm literally just trying to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happy for like 10 seconds here can i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have this yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of feel a bit jealous of our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parents when they only had to care care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the [ __ ] that was happening around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now i have to care about [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> happening halfway across the world yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like when i see like you know my my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> parents get [ __ ] furious that they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> change the bin size of like the council </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by like ten percent lower they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god this is unreasonable you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i just missed the days where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> could give a [ __ ] about stupid [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> now i've got to worry about like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cultural engagement nothing to do with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you right yeah it's just like i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know man i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i want to care about everything and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to give like people who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting for like legitimate like good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fights i want to help them out but at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the same time it's like there's so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like [ __ ] going on and obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the internet has obviously made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the information even more accessible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so there's so many more things to care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm talking about global warming right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't waste too much food right what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on over here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a civil war going on in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> country and like atrocities happen how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how do i like legitimately like give my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> energy literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how to live yeah like that's that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life isn't it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't want to be like um global </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> warming is more important than people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dying in this country yeah i mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how where do you where do you draw the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> line on where to start well i mean i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> think you can like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know pick and choose what you care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about but it's the difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being publicly open about this stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right it's like yo i mean i wouldn't say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't care about something as much or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as like yeah it's oh my god this is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tough to talk yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is it literally makes you sound like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an [ __ ] yeah you don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like what do you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're our manager we are we going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> get cancelled for this mailing but no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but no i i totally understand because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that's just part of being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> human right you know there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be people that's you know make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the argument well you're privileged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough that you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to care about it right but i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would argue that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surely surely you can't you also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't care about every single issue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> happening in the world because you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel strongly about this one issue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it definitely affects you and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand that but surely that means </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't put the energy into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> caring about another issue i don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's i don't think there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any person out there living any type of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life pre like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh prejudice or not prejudiced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> privileged or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who can dead ass be in a position where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything in the world i need to worry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about because it's important to me like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it doesn't matter who you are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's going to be one piece of news </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're just like that has nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do with anything that resonates with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that like that you really believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in yeah and that you fight towards like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> helping that like i'm i'm down with that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah at least you're fighting towards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something it's better than someone just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting up in the morning being like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't care about any of this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean like it's it's it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really bother me much when people get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like angry about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like oh my god you don't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about this but i hate people who are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you don't care enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about this specific thing yeah like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should be so angry about this thing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> man i'm literally just trying to get by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like what dictates like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quantitative worth of how much you care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about some people who get willing to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like outraged and like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of fire up their ass for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something you know and like i don't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we need we need people like that yeah of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> course yeah although [ __ ] doesn't get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> done i can't expect any everyone to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah but then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i hate it when i see people like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> blackmailing other people being like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should count more you should care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so much more about it because because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the problem with the argument is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way to frame it without the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without the person who you know cares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> less about the topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way to frame the argument </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without making them making them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like look good you know because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just okay you don't care about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> therefore you are the [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't care about this important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> issue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i feel like can we just accept that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are all human </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know we why we are all just trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get by everyone has different issues </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some matter more than others but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a lack of empathy you know we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in order to empathize with your problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you at least have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give us some empathy as well you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i feel like there's there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just there's just like a lack of empathy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in that sense and that kind of argument </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd like to think about being ignorant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on any of this that you know it won't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> result in [ __ ] let's cancel the boys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean just let me know down below i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i will read the comments so if i am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> missing any like big point here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or i'm being ignorant please do let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know because i would like to judge my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mindset i don't think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think it's ignorance personally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it's just like being honest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i mean i'm exactly the same i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> try to keep it as open-minded as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about everything um and i've you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i've definitely changed my viewpoints on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain topics thanks to what people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have said about what they've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> discussing of course there's words i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there was one person who um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i think uh uh someone tweeted me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like connor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shouldn't say the word crackhead is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a descriptive word </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a bad word uh because it apparently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has to do with a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um you know like racial stereotyping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back in the war on drugs in america and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff and is used as a derogatory term </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i just stopped saying it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was because someone tweeted at me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying stop saying it i was like well i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really need this word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know because i said it on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> podcast and you know i realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> afterwards i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean there's like way better ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to describe that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i was trying to that feeling i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to get across without using that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like yeah i don't really need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use that word i haven't said it since on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like podcast or anything so i'm like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i haven't said it ever and i just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel the need to and i'm like cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thanks for letting me know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> commented like if i have a bad habit let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me know i'll try and get rid of it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> uh if you're like connor you're fat [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> it's in that situation it's rough but </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> comments really do pick apart like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> everything yeah yeah but it's cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though because sometimes you miss </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly it i i feel like having a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good balance is the healthy thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you have to find this balance between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knowing that you can't please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone um and finding a balance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between okay this this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person's making a legitimate point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i i can change my behavior </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know he yeah they they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making a sound argument and i completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> understand i mean the comment section </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> it like man i wish connor would [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quit the podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm sorry that's not gonna happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anytime it's not gonna happen but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if it did do you really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think everyone wants that like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know there are some that are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like man i wish connor would just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> deck gaunt in the faces i'm just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> will off camera </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like man is this is this how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends act you know at least wait till </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the trash tastes special where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to have a boxing match or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right not that we have anything planned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and that was just me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boxing confirmed i'd actually like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ironically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love to be like a youtuber boxing match </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i just think like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mailing's like getting ideas right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like multi-million dollar day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i wish i could bring in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> multi-millionaire i i don't know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one you get an excuse to train you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably hire a personal coach you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'd probably get in mad shape for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that and it would probably be fun i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess i'll play the villain i'd love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that'd be so much fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but who would i fight though you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing right yeah i haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got any enemies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i should start beef with someone now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop flexing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you want is not having enemies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like something to brag about like man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conor doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> god doesn't hate anyone i mean i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even ask for enemies and i have enemies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean enemies are very strong yeah some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> people who dislike me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but like i i don't have any like open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beef with anyone on youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i mean i don't really [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> anything i just kind of just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do my own thing i mean there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difference between having youtuber beef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and having actual real beef where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a big problem with someone yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i was like would you what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> categorize like the ksi logan paul stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you just you pure youtube b </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for like legit that has to be youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beef right it was so over the top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i don't like i think they're here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i think along the way they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started liking it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm pretty sure it started as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legitimate beef and then they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we can make money off we're making tens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of millions of dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hold on hold the phone i mean i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the line is blurred </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have a financial incentive to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have beef oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah if not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if they're just like [ __ ] talking to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> each other see the light bulb light and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and over mailings head right now just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like lighting up bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's like she has a pog face right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they made they made like over like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> twenty thirty million dollars each </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like that because it's not it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually beef like personal beef about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really matters like no one told like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of their moms to go [ __ ] themselves or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah the insults were dude the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] uh the pre-match [ __ ] like beef </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] talking things were the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the boxing matches they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so bad at talking [ __ ] to each other it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was like it was like wrestling well </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> for boxing it did like wonders yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like it's like the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the renaissance of boxing right now well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean for like the people in our age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my dad loves boxing and my dad's age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bracket love boxing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they they love it but like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> under under 30 and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mid 30s i don't [ __ ] give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about boxing yeah a lot of people don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i'm sure there is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a good there's a good segment of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people who probably love boxing and mma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all that yeah but it wasn't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nearly as popular as it used to be with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> our age group at least yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because boxing was like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the most classic moments in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sports in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our boxing matches like anything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rumble in the jungle you know anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with muhammad iconic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] iconic to this day and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i i grew up in an era where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't even watch any boxing match i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think i don't i didn't watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> boxing i think i've ever sat down and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched a boxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> match in my life i i would just my dad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> loved watching it and he'd be like man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this guy's fighting this guy for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> world heavyweight and i'm like who are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> these two people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no no because if you're a kid and your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parents weren't into it then how the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afford to watch the pay-per-view yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like there's no way you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch it it's always an american time so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's always that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 3 a.m like sky which is already like 40 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pounds a month and you pay an extra 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pounds on top to get the pay-per-view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah it's just yeah crazy yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i don't know it's like uh what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about the whole i don't know this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is changing gears too fast but uh we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing where everyone's like man they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're ruining like boxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> by bringing in these influences to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's happened with chess as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh by bringing in these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> non-traditions where you bring in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you kind of i guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the way they would argue is that you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> diluting like the sport right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't unders i don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting more eyes onto a sport ruins it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because the whole point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of keeping a sport alive is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a sport is kept alive by how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> viewers watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean there's there's a side of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where i can understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know for chess like at least </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what if you start at age 12 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and then you're like you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 now you're a grandmaster you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally been playing your whole life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for chess right yeah you're about to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is your time to shine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then [ __ ] pogchamps has like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 20 30 times more viewers than anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you ever will get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i i could i could understand why they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mad yeah right that just sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just sounds like a villain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> protagonist to some sports animals i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been in backstory to some sport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's super easy to understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why they would get mad but then you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you like anyone it's like a youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video right if i make a youtube video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm a small youtuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right about um about this mike wazowski </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right and then gone you know who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a million uh let's say gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say ghana's three million right and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtuber ten thousand makes a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about mike wazowski and god pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> does like nearly a one for one video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know but in god's style right yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that guy will be angry he's like god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just made my video but to a bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> audience he's gonna get all the views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you're not seeing is a huge kick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're gonna get a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trickle-down views yeah of course and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what's gonna happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with all the stuff is that yeah you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna see the immediate results of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know getting uh the trickle-down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> effect from all these massive events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> normies if you will right but they but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the problem is that most of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> quote-unquote purists don't see it as a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trickle-down effect they just no no i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they see it as like sloppy seconds right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well yeah they see it as like you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> ruining the sanctity of my sport it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i wanted all the guys to come to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah but you know it's you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know again more eyes more sponsor money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all good yeah i mean like i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we talked about this like two weeks ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you have to evolve with the times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's got that you have to have do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to find a way to garner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> interest in your sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like keep up or get left behind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean you know sports like boxing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and chess are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky that they've been they've had such </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a good history and a good legacy where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has like kind of carried them a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the modern age yeah where they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a solid fan base </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but obviously you know if they want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to modernize to a point where they want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring in a bunch of new viewers you got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to mix it up and chass is having like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive renaissance now yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm happy for chess like chess streamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest ones are yeah hey cara is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pulling in like plus 25k i think a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh like and a bunch of the other bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> ones pulling in like over 5k </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> viewers on twitch and it's not like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> know just because you're like pulling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> new viewers i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't like dilute you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> history that has already been built </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like people are still going to look back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to like the greats of the times yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> once they get all the greats people just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people just don't like that they're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ones that are solely being talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i think one of one of the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things is that i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i might be talking out my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ass but it seems like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of the younger generations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are less there's less of a focus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on sports and more people are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting into like video games and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that like we literally talked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how uh my nephew got bullied because he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to play sports but everyone was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing fortnite whereas when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> growing up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was the other way around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cool kids were playing sport and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had such like so many eyes in it and now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i think because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> less kids might be interested in sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to find a new way to appeal to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a young audience otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just not going to give a [ __ ] at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the end of the day this is going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sound weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but i think that video games are now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more accessible than sports yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why they're doing better like if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to play a game of rugby or football </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you need what like at least five aside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need a lot of people to get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done you gotta get out and a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> space yeah a lot of space right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone can play a video game on their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smartphone or whatever anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone can download channels yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a lot of the sports like i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i love swimming but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> finding a swimming pool in japan is so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hot yeah without paying out the ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah and there's not one anywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> near us and like i don't i don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> know where to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean there's one there's like gyms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have them but you have to pay like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 150 bucks a month to access them yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most sports that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> liked as a kid i realized how lucky i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that there was like in the uk you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sports centers all around where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do this but now i'm like fine it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so hard to do the sports that i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do and get into it yeah i want to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back into sports and get like a newer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> generation into them because it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i'm not being funny how are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to convince a kid to go you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> play golf when he can play mario golf </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so accessible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so easy like and the problem is golf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks so boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sorry but golf like i i cannot there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are some sports where i'm just like i do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not understand how people can watch this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be entertained because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've like i've played golf before um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um i used to like live kind of near </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> driving range and it's just so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i you know had a period where i i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really enjoyed playing golf it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really satisfying to like smack the ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um i wasn't rich enough to afford my own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> golf club so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know i had another barrier to entry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah it's like that's not a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> barrier to entry but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really fun to play golf my god it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so boring to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i cannot watch a golf game i mean i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure the people who are watching this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who love watching golf and i'm sorry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> disappointing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's like there's so many sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that though like i used to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tennis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot i can but i cannot sit down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and watch a tennis match oh i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes some games but they all long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they are live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's so but i find it just so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and interesting how like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can i myself love playing the sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yet i can't bear to sit down and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch the sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like you'd think if someone played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the sport they would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just as interested to watch it as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right because they're not always because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the inverse is also true as well where i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> might like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have no interest in playing the sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i love watching it oh yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like me with league is that a sport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but uh yeah i mean like for example i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know there's there's always going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like massive sports like football </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah uh which that's not going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> away that's like too deeply ingrained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that that's why the olympics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is so weird to me right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you end up watching a load of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these sports which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would in any other circumstances </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have no interest in watching but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's the olympics you know does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone want to watch like men's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> volleyball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone you know i never gave a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about archery until i watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are a lot of it that are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting when you have them or you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experience them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once every four years oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're and your country's kind of in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the race right cause you've got a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got a horse to root for right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think uh archery week by week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> monday night archery you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know you've got to build your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little story lines you've got to build </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> up yeah the olympics definitely opened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> my eyes to like some sports being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> really fun i never [ __ ] saw him oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> god curling and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i never thought i'd be into it but i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this this is hype as [ __ ] i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> why curling is like a mario party game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> got turned into a realtor it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mini game but like every round is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> curling literally like by accident </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like let's just [ __ ] make it real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's one sport i really want to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like try out is there like a sport that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've never done that you want to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> uh speed ice skating looks so cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there was um that's that's that seems so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dangerous i thought about that because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there was uh somebody watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reached out to me on twitter and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because they were verified and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like 1 000 followers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were they were on like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were a pro ice skater and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> america canada yeah yeah i love trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste they were on the olympic team </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh wow wow like ice skating and they </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> ice skating is real cool real cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> teach me i love ice skating i'd love to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like go fast and do it but i mean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's too dangerous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i slammed my face i'd have to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get past that mental barrier of just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know you know when you reach a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> certain speed and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you're not used to it you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to get past that barrier i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm going a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too fast now if i fall it's really gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> hurt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i want you know what olympic sport i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to exist but will never exist it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go to like round one here and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get the the zorb ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like football where you're wearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is the ball where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> run into each other that'd be such a fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> olympic sport </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> people on the field [ __ ] just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy honestly like if you ever come to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> japan come to round one because most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> round one have this </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> lot of round ones in japan yeah they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bb gun shooting yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> surprisingly because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we i remember when we did it right in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] summer which was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] stupid move right right after we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had like the biggest bowl of curry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so we were like we were in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sword balls just like rolling around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh i'm going to throw up it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> surprisingly uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was back there we haven't been there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in so long yeah it was surprisingly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] tiring to do that though oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks it looks really light to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> run around no it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is it's kind of like playing a mario </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> party game right because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like you're because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing football but it's got this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really janky physics engine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like trying to drive a car and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cyberpunk or something like that custom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game mode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like big head mode where you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i love that to be a sport are you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go watch any of the olympic sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if it happens what the [ __ ] do i apply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no well no supposedly now that like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's being confirmed that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not going to bring any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigners in right so but you can go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> see it at the stadium which means </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's going to be way more available </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seats for the actual olympics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i kind of want to do it just because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like do you know how to get tickets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm going to look into it i have no idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like if i can find it out then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd want to go just to say i've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah the only time i've ever seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tickets available the only way you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> win it was by buying something from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> panasonic and you get entered into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lottery </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah which which of maybe you'll get the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right to buy it yeah that's that sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a very japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese thing to do i don't want to buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> panasonic i want a ticket to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> olympics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this would be the second time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that i've lived in a city </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the olympics was held because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was there for london </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you went there in london i was in wales </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at that time oh yeah so i was like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was living in london at the time and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during the normal olympics things just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like get super super busy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i don't really like crowds that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so go like i didn't want to go through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the hassle of going through it to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sporting event and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i i didn't care enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me to want to go to this big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sporting event where i you know i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i literally just said the olympics is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you watch sports you normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't care about but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you watch it because it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> olympics right um </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> want to watch like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> would you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like a bad game like it's a bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matchup it's like a stomp it'll be like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> kinds of stuff i feel it's just you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to just enjoy the atmosphere you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have you been i've never been to the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> you're not into like the nfl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything like that oh my god bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> watching nfl is hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the amount of ads they have i'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get yeah but it's also very stop start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> heavy game right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like i feel like the nfl is like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can get into the end of nfl because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when the game is in motion that i i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's hard to find a sport as exciting as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the nfl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when everything is in motion right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> winning over our american audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because there's so there's so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things going on in such a short period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas you know i look at something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cricket or baseball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's only you know there's yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very stop stop it's it's very stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> start and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's you know there's i'm gonna sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so i'm so sounds so bad it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just see like a guy trying to hit a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ball you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you prefer american football or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> rugby oh it's hard i think rugby i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like overall i prefer rugby but i i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> had more exciting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like moments watching american football </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i feel then you would really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoy afl what's the afl the australian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> football </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's like it's basically like nfl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no it's australian if we're representing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our own country i have to talk about afl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because someone's going to talk about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but afl is basically like it's it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's australian football but think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nfl but if it was just one continuous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> play that never stopped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right okay that sounds pretty fun and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> twice the field size as well okay it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exhausting it's [ __ ] exciting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> afl players are legitimate athletes like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they how do they do that in australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as opposed to like every other sport i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> think i saw something which is like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an average </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> afl game a player can run upwards of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like 20 kilometers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] for like well for and it's and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a two-hour game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] oh my god and a split but they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> split i bet they made that game that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> long on how long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australians need to drink yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why afl games are the best to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch at home because it's like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> hours of drinking [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 30 minute recess you know it's good it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect yeah but i think you'd really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you don't like the start stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aspect of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> nfl i think you'd really like because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do i really like a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sports where like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> things in motion you know oh yeah love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> football love watching basketball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i when i went to canada i loved watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the hockey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i could read against you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fun yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fast-paced that's that's a sport where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think watching that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like live would be super super fun right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'd love to watch that like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> atmosphere just sound this looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> super like and in the background it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh this might turn into a fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sadly i've never lived anywhere where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a popular sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah sucks i want to but like every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i when i went to canada i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally like i was watching it all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's so funny it's really i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go and watch one next time i go canada </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah i would see i said something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice about america for once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i got an angry email that was like um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like the subject was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please educate yourself on america okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you talk about america all the time but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you always get everything wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in our culture totally incorrect i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should find it i think i deleted it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> though because i was like shut the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't wha what about uh what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about like the sumo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sumo oh i cuz i really want to go watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the summer i think that would be fun to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch yeah i i don't watch enough sumo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to have an opinion or i haven't tried to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watch enough zoomer to have an opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know someone in the someone in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twitch chat notified me that there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> twitch channel that streams the sumo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really yeah with english commentary oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my god so like every now and then when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on i just kind of flick it on leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it in the background while i'm working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like don't even have to turn my tv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on it's on twitch that's [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever like gotten into a sport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something because of a show you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched or an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that because like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only reason i gave the nfl a chance was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of [ __ ] eye shield and i hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i sound like such a weeb for saying this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i'm gonna give an nfl i'm gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> give the nfl a chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mine's even worse i got into tennis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because of prince of tennis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey hey i got into like cycling from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yomushi did you actually yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i found the email all right hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> khan i love the podcast but if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you could do me and the rest of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> american fans a favor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could you please stop throwing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> misconceptions around about us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe educate yourself a little bit and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how we do things here instead of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believing the typical stereotypes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's almost every podcast now you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something about america that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely false so it only applies to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one percent of us that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just annoying like what i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i wish they gave examples so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could be like okay it's fair right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are we wrong about things most the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mailing a lot of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of it's right a lot of it's right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently here's the problem with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> america right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait wait go on okay okay well there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> many problems </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so right something that applies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to one state does not apply to another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because america is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so varied like meline do you not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you feel very different to other states </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like you don't feel like you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything in common with people from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> florida right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so like someone from like i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> relate to someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from any part of the uk and i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand everything i understand how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's the same but yeah for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone in like california right you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> can't possibly relate completely to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone from like minnesota </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no like it's a team totally different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> culture a totally different vibe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> shut up maybe like there's so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's so vast there's so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> micro cultures and everything yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely like whenever i go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> visit sydney's family in milwaukee and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wisconsin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's like there's definitely a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> midwestern culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's oh yeah yeah from traveling the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you realize like how different they all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> view each other as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like americans yeah it's completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different it's really interesting yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> did he did say he was a big fan of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> foreign sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah have you guys seen any like obscure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sport that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you like that you've only you only know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about because it's been recommended on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then like it actually looks pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] hype ah there was one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i forgot what it was but i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like an indian sport or a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> southeast asian sport where it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> volleyball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you kick the ball what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally just think of volleyball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like you know how vulnerable you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pass it with your hands yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but instead of your hands you kick it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not just football tennis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of don't say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every sibling like players like how gay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you ruin the sanctity of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds good like have you seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like professional tag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like really skill tag is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] awesome like vox did a video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about how it came to be as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you think how did they come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> together just a guy who was like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> obsessed with the idea of making like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tag courses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kept like building them and people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> were like yeah this is pretty fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> actually you know what's one excuse what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i really enjoy watching ultimate frisbee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah ultimate yeah that's a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] that's really fun well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the us i think it's quite popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like monkus brownlee right plays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh really yeah he plays it is it an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> olympic sport it's not is it no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not olympic sport he mentioned it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> quite a lot though in his videos and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's shared videos of him playing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i guess outside of america it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like a thing i mean i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we played it for like sports once for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> school and it was really fun yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we played it in school as well so it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely a thing but it was more seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just as just it sounds like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> college sport ever yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what i mean like i am past time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i have the luxury of being able to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ultimately frisbee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the ultimate it's the ultimate that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah why why ultimately we don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ultimate football </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah we do what what if they called it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like epic frisbee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd be playing it right now yeah i'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like to join our epic frisbee team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the kind of sports you you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think you'd see on twitch or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> frisbee i could see the ultimate frisbee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why not that'd be [ __ ] awesome like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i feel like twitch would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the perfect platform for a lot of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more obscure sports like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> professional arm wrestling as well have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you seen that that's like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude bro sport i've ever seen right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the slapping slapping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah most critical love to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> commentate on like what i love what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love about watching professional uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> professional arm wrestling is is it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> egging each other on to do better right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's almost like it's almost like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gym session was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got this bro no no you got this bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually you know the best one is i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> decided this is the best one the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sport you've seen on the internet three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> times forget about but remember there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> badass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's the like sumo but with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like robot wars oh yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like sumo it's a sumo ring with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they have like mini robots and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have to push each other out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's from where the on my own machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like the what was that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in japan wars i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no but america did a version of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that clip is from a japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from the japanese one where they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it with miniature ones because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> battle bots and robot wars in the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> giant yeah yeah yeah like these ones are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like tabletop well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's something to destroy it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> supposed to push the other thing out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's really cool it's really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool there's nothing getting destroyed i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> am not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interested my man monkey brain not happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no destruction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i kind of miss robot wars i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it got cancelled is it still a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing it's probably not silly i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think that's right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't think battle boxes are the sort </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of thing either male 1 check that out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one it's one of the few things we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> growing up with that made engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because because it's really hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make engineering look cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right but you you see you see these like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mechanics that would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a really cool way to teach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> engineering coding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like an all-in-one thing yeah get them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to make just a little thing [ __ ] move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> around a little bit like why not teach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one thing i loved about uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battlebots though was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just just the fluctuation between like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the different people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that who clearly had completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> different skills in engineering like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> robot was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this robot is an automated arm that can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know grab and pick up robots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's another dude's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> challenger comes in it's like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> attached 60 knives onto this point and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the only function he can do is go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> forwards and backwards saw on wheels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's literally it like it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you see like some like piddly robots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that had like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing flipper of all time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't even flip my grandma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it goes up against like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hypno disc or something it just gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely destroyed half of them like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't even move like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in practice so it's just like it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the door stopper on wheels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then like i don't know if battlebots </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had this but the uk one had this where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the show runners had their own like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ops </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> robots oh yeah yeah that would just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the nothing was happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'd be like send out charles or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that sir kill a lot yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this just [ __ ] massive clearly like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely god to your engineering world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> created </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> coming back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just getting reminded of all like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these old television shows i used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch as a kid now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember gladiators was that was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of that's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very old that's very very that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 90. that sounds really familiar what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically like very much inspired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole like kind of sporty-esque like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really intense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> physical sport yeah it's it's it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like instead of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like instead of like uh what what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what are like the shows that like four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guys and stuff is based around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wipeout wipe out so instead of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going against an obstacle course you'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have an obstacle course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but then you'd be competing against a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gladiator which was like this kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really fit muscular person and it that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would have there would be this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> competitive element where you'd have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> beat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like beat this person like this yeah on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on this obstacle course or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you'd have to just like literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fight them yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the final turtle basically you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get to the end he's just standing there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i the best way i can describe it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically something very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like wipeouts with uh with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wrestling basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyway so it's like so it's like real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> time like you're fighting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like or not fighting but like with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> glasses there's like one i think there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one event in it where like you both had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those like long poles with like cushions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the platform yeah i remember that i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i know that sure is old because then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i think when i was watching that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like very early 2000s everyone's wearing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like latex and spandex and i'm like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm pretty sure all that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taken from takeshi's castle right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what's the other one the japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one's called like uh i think it was it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called like um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ultimate banzuki or something oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think well like literally they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will do so this is this show is so fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should watch clips on youtube it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] cool so what they would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do is right is that they would have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone either they would be a generic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing or they'd have an expert so they'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bring on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 expert pogo people and they would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> build like a [ __ ] impossible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pogo obstacle course right and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would have to do it and like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would do is insane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it was always it wasn't just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> general people it's like no they get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> professionals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there'd be people who like they'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to be um they'd bring people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are professionals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like handstands yeah and i'd have to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a whole course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> handstand walking around like going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> upstairs going on wobble yeah i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely seen it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really [ __ ] cool you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch this just type it in i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have to oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my goodness i think it's cool something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the stuff they'd have to do was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crazy like they had that um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know that mario party game where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to like there's like seven things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stacked like have a hammer and hit it oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they did a game where two people had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do that i need to like get it they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hit them all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out right but obviously when they hit it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah they would like tip the thing over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was really cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's based off like a traditional </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese like toy yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what's like the best concept of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like like a like reality tv program that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like physical like game show challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anything like ninja warrior </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the original the japanese original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sasuke yeah yeah that's really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's this really old uh reality tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show that channel 4 made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't remember the name because it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a one-off series right but i always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought the concept was genius because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what they did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this was this was way back when when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big brother was like a massive thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the twist was they took they took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these group of people right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that uh weren't exactly the brightest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brightest bunch of people but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to be on a reality tv show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would basically they basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convinced them that they were going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right oh i think i remember this so what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so what happens is they they literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they literally like take them astronaut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> training right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and make them go through all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> training but also feed them like a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of fake information right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they had they had this real mock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spaceship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and they taught them that you know we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we we're using new technology where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't require rockets it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an airplane where like slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> circles up to the earth's atmosphere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these guys would believe it right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they thought they thought they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being trained in russia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the name of the show i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember i'm gonna have to look it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a genius show um and like at any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if like at any point one of them could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have found out right because they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um the t the producers said you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be trained in russia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not gonna be in england and what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened is they just took them on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plane and just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> circled round and just landed in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> landed in like a abandoned airfield in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surrey or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they were just like in the middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> england they were thinking they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they actually took some of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh have you ever been on like one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those fake roller coaster rides </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where where where it's like it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the 4d ones yeah like the 4d ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where where you know you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you just you just kind of like have this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spaceship that just kind of turns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out it's cool yeah it's called space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cadets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it aired in 2005 on channel 4. yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah channel 4 normally does all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really bizarre </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really unique game shows yeah okay if if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you got like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you got some time you want to kill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's honestly it was such a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept and it was a one-off as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one off season um it was just hilarious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was [ __ ] hilarious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> highly recommend it yeah the first thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that comes up when you google it is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> controversies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's been quite controversial i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so but i want to watch that now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that sounds really funny yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was like this did the uk has some really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unique game shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically there's a game show in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i think it was literally called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hunted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would have like i think six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or ten pairs something around that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically what they would do is they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right you have like one day and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're gonna start trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like track you if you're a fugitive all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so like any of your if you use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you use your phone if you do anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you make calls you go to places like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll find you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so some people were really good at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and some people were terrible at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like yeah and then they had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> survive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two weeks yeah two weeks later two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> location to get like a plane to like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> escape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right and uh yeah what one one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> team did win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds really fun it was really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cool it was really it was really popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the first season and the second season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i think was a bit [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't do too well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel that's a concept like at first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would be like wow that's cool but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then i feel it get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> old quite fast yeah because there's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much there's only so much you can do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once you know the formula and once you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know the secrets like just something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> logistics behind that must have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i wonder how much of that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> faked though as well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you surely can't have access to all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the police forces like yeah credibility </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because it's just a waste of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> police time and services right that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a lot of government </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hold on wait we gotta find the fake one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i wonder but in a concept really cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was that on channel four as well that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was on channel four as well channel four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes some good like one-off reality i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> surprised i've never heard of any of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah channel 4 makes really good tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shows in general yeah like some of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite are definitely like some of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> darren brown specials i don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> famous darren brown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is outside of the uk right now i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> probably not so much i've never heard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> darren brown oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the [ __ ] this man did was crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my so his favorite thing that he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ever done so dan brown is a magician </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> from the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's he's he's a magician that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> himself but he's more like a mental </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magician mentalist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not even like it's [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about the word mentalist this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> makes this makes it sound fake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this man is just one of a kind yeah yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> man he's like he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's a showman he says like everything i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do is like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's like not so much that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fake but like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is like magic involved he doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> claim to be have special powers or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that he just claims to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand psychology </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and plays on that right yeah so there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this one tv show that he did and it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally my favorite and it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> big brain this whole thing so i i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spoil the end of it so i'll warn you i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna do that but i'll spoil it for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's still cool either way if you watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it so what happens is this tv show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starts and you're following this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perspective this one woman and i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so basically what happens is that um so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the show is is that he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically he knows which horse is going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to win in these horse races </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so the exact name of the special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is called the system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so the way he markets it is that he has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can 100 predict which horse is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> going to win in a horse race </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so it's like this this middle-aged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> woman and you know we follow her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he calls her up he's like listen bet on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this horse go now so she goes and she </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bets on it and the cameras are following </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she bets on it she wins right it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he rings her up again he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now put all of your money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on this horse now then like then a week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> later yeah and she puts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she puts all the money on it she wins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again right it's like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how is he doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is legit like whole like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a fully legitimate yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a public gambling that anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can battle right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a real horse yeah he gives him the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money doesn't he he gives them a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> thousand pounds right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i can't remember it's been a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while but i i do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i don't think he gives him any money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> does he know well so anyway </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she wins and it happens again and he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like all right now bet again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the money on this horse she does it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again and she wins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and i think it's one more time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like all right now this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> final one bet all of your money on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she wins and you're like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is going on yeah he's literally guessing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he reveals right and as the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode ends that like he's literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a tournament bracket of like every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> single race there's nine horses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so every single race he's literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> found nine people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and told them to bet on the different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> horses he's literally gone through and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> done like a giant like hundreds of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> races so it's like a pyramid so like at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the beginning he started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like thousands of thousands of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> contestants and he said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know um i i you know he didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reveal who his identity was he was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anonymous tip and so you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of like a certain amount people won </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they got eliminated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he gave him a refund and then he went up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the next bracket and then he kept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he basically kept enough of a group of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people to make sure there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> at least one point and it's so simple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so cool but when you're following </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this story and her perspective it seems </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like like literal magic yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because all he was trying the message he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was trying to say was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't forget about perspective just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you are winning doesn't mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like doesn't mean like there's a magical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> system or something like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's what to do with probability </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds right up my alley dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's literally a [ __ ] junior yeah his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shows are amazing and like he did one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he's done so many questions like i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my favorite ones is like the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he actually he actually fakes a zombie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apocalypse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right oh that sounds familiar yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> might have seen that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so basically he takes us he takes this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one guy right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so how he gets people on the special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that people apply to be on his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> specials right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but he doesn't tell anyone that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they know they he doesn't tell anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that they've succeeded right so </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> then you get kicked off and basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> each step it just gets worse and worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and worse i don't know i might be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this this is how i remember yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then what's wrong with us one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch people do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] like this i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's entertaining actually i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the flashback to another darren brown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay he did another special as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is great where the audience get to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> choose whether something bad happened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy or something good happened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so they would follow a guy in his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> daily life he obviously said yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and literally the audience every single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time chose bad things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like one of them was like almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like his family gets christmas presents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> early </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or he gets [ __ ] kidnapped and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> literally got kidnapped because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audience wanted to see him get kidnapped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're [ __ ] up we are [ __ ] up do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know what the most [ __ ] up thing about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that special was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it so it the the special basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ends right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with you know the audience shows a bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing happening like he got kidnapped or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i think as they were trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kidnap him um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he got into a car crash now the car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crashed the car crash was staged the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> audience didn't know this right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the car crash was stopped and so the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> audience seemed hit by a car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it's they just like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> unplanned thing darren brown just walks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you're just you're just left </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing like the audience kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] like what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the audience members going like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> uh excuse me you're not being funny but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this like it's not our fault yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hey no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't remember exactly what she says </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but she's like excuse me this ain't this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't funny </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like can you tell us what's going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like why would you make him go through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's it's like the lack of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> self-awareness and self-irony that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally came on a tv show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he kept voting for bad things to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen and then something bad thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> happened that wasn't scripted but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it wasn't scripted suddenly it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a serious matter right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah it was like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting because it was basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just like you as the audience does not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> care about who is on screen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right you just want to see bad things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen you know these are people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really good because you know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> staged well because this is what you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> think right you think it's all fake or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like or you don't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was it was a message about like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anonymity within like crowds i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the word i'm looking for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the hive mind yeah like the hive </SPEAKER_02>
