<SPEAKER_03> - You have officially two weeks left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to get dripped out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's time to drip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get your Apari merch right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> using that link in the
description down below. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you wanna get dripped
out like us, the boys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get your official
Trash Taste/Apari merch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now is the time to do, 'cause
you got two weeks left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at them, look
at them, stand up boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stand up, stand up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're actually color
coordinates this week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at that, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do I look boys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] We have the bright
ones, we have the dark ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually liked, I
don't wanna take it off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You Trash Taste or Trash
Taste after dark, you decide. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Look how fucking cute this design is guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that too, and that too.
- [Garnt] It's so adorable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The embroidery is super high quality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, the cat sleeping
is such so adorable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember when I first saw
this, I needed to get this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also Apari did such a great job, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it looks like our sets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it actually does.
- It's crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - One for one, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Last time, we had a print design, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this time we went for embroidery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we want this merch to last. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It costs a little bit more
than our previous merch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we want this merch to
be around when you are 90. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So your grandma who is
90 there can stand by. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then seriously, the
merch is super high quality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it will last. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So when you get it, you get it for life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You become one of the boys for life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unfortunately, the first
thousand special postcards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have sold out but you will still get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a personalized message on your postcard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you purchase one of these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But again, you only have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> two weeks left ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Two weeks.
- [Garnt] Two weeks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So go down to the link
in that description below </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and grab them while they last </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because until 2022, these will be around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But after that, it's all gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You better end 2021 on a high. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Back to the episode.

<SPEAKER_04> Bubbling. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> - Vigor special. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Vigor special. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone's been waiting for it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the Figure Special version two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why we're
cracking open a cold one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's fucking go.
- 'Cause it's finally here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A year in the making. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had to wait more than a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we had to wait
until Akihabara opened up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people getting vaccinated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the country letting
us finally do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not even a global pandemic can stop us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from wasting our money on anime figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, cheers boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cheers to a successful launch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cheers, cheers, cheers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How's it feel to be in
presence of a winner? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause that's gonna be me today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I'm here for the content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't wait to show you some
of the stuff that I bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, stop being a good sportsman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for one second and talk trash, alright? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or no, that's how you lose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Haven't you learn from the first version? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there are three videos on
our own respective channels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we went to Akihabara
and spent $30,333 each, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a total of $10,000 between
the Trash Taste budget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is where the Clickbait comes from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then I go like, "We can
stretch this out to $10,000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we can put it on the video title." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And we have various
challenges at those stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we hopefully completed
and we'll talk about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on this episode of the podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But we have no idea
what each other bought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't know how many challenges
we've completed and yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> today is the day where we gonna find out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have an idea about
what the other boys did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you wanna find out
now before you watch this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then please go watch all of our videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or you can watch this first and then go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and watch the videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of like watching
the "Avengers: Endgame" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then watching "Ironman." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Either way, either
watch all of them now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or watch all them after. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would say watch all of them
before, but that's just mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they're all up right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're all down in the
description, so check them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I guess-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also on our main channels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not our second channels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, on our main channels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So basically, we're gonna
just kind of, I guess, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> run through the products, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where as also, overarching challenges. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey, do you have them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> All of the challenges
that aren't for the store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that for after the store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] They are onscreen right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not gonna read them all out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] We have 16 of them there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have 16 on them but I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what some of the notable
ones that we remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are like stuff like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> buying a figure closest
to the price of 420 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also 69 as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course. Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember much
of the other challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't either, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's going to be
interesting if we are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by coincidence it's figurine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember that in the first door, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I completely forgot we
had overarching challenges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was only in the second store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I started to figure out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, we all tried to
go for the $69 one, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we all tried
for the 69 and 420, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a lot harder than I thought it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so how did you boys
feel going into this challenge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to last year's challenge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, my challenge is
that I go to each store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were way easier than
last year, which is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think I have a
better chance this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really up to you guys, really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Garnt there got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the harder ones this year, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just kept getting
fucked this year, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is why I was like, you know what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna go for the concert.
- First time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> First time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's how I felt last year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this guy got an easy
road again for most part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for the most part I think.
- [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had hard challenges. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to find a figure from
an anime Jerry I had watched. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> D'you hard that is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I had more luck finding
the needle in the haystack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what do you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had this whole store full of anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Jerry hadn't seen a single one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was interesting though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we went to four
stores again this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Two of them were ones that
we've been to previously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was Astop and Army Army. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we had two brand new ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which was Lashinbang and Mandarake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think the new stores </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> were definitely a challenge
because definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't used to it.
- Yeah, because one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it added some spice into the mix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we didn't know what to expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so especially ending on Mandarake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so much risk came
into what was in Mandarake, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I hadn't been to
Akihabara for about a good year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I literally had no ideas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what would be in any
of these stores, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Mandarake is truly like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the needle in the Haystack store, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like you go in... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the Don Quijote of fucking figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've found the coolest
stuff in Mandarake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've also gonne find a
lot of stuff in Mandarake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's either all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I'm glad we had some variations to us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Absolutely.
- [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was a store that sold everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some stores, they didn't sell anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And some stores had a lot of
lewd stuff, so that's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, I was kind
of nervous, kind of wasn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was weird because this time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't thinking about decorating
as much as I was winning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I don't care
about decorating the office, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck that, it's all about winning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - By the way, if you're
brand new to Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the figures that you see on the backseat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are the stuff that we got last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we only had a budget of $500 last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it got us all these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We was at six times the budget, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven times the budget, six times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Six top of the budget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I almost believe that the saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of constraints make the what, the what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What did you say Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, I had sex, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man. This man is the oldest one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I tried to not say that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and instead I said, six times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I almost having no limitations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> well, there was limitations, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The money was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> $3,000 is a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's more than one
person will ever spend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I felt like having no limitation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nearly on what you could
spend almost made it harder, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you felt like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can buy literally anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this before, it was
like you see a $500 figure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a lot of, "I can't buy that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] That was my budget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly right, you can't buy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So it almost made it more interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now, you look for them at like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most expensive figure in the store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like a sizeable
chunk in my budget, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm not gonna be dead in
the water, even if I buy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, let's just say we didn't find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a $3,300 figure that we just signed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was some stuff in Mandarake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, in Mandarake yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was definitely like one figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have gone our entire budget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for the most part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it definitely felt like a big difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from last year to this year, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, last year, like it's a difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between like being a student </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and having a disposable income. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it felt like, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just thinking about some
of the fucking figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had spent money on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I remember last year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember going to a store like Astop, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was looking at figures and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't buy that, I can't
buy that, I can't buy that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now this time going
into Astop, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what can I buy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Let me just buy it all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even if it's expensive-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I'll take your entire store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was like, I'll take
everything from here to here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like a dent in my buzzer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trash Tastes season one
versus Trash Taste season two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the peasants versus the kings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's next it's like who can buy out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all of these stuff first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I actually like got to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we got to Mandarake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had trouble finishing my budget, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mandarake had some
really, really cool shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the really, really cool
shit was too expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then some of the mid-range stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't even make up the budget I had left </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because originally-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like no in-between. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, originally I thought
we had $3,000 expense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then only halfway through
that I realize, oh no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire budget was $10,000. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So technically, it's $3,233. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to make up $300 more, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I didn't think I had in Mandarake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, yeah, it was
overall very interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's very tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was a long day as well, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was definitely
a long day for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was great, it was great fun though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really enjoyed it.
- I really enjoyed it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it exhausting having to
run around stores for hours, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's not nothing I haven't
done before in season one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, I definitely felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot more comfortable filming this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than I did in season one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you seemed like you're
kind of digging it more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I remember when we
were all filming our intros, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to get away from a Garnt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was actually being too loud. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt is `really like Morgs now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, what's up guys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's me, Gigguk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm going to spent
24 hours in Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's gotten too good, he
should be upgraded to movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The flash back to season one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Occupant Special and Garnt's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "How do I sushi without a script?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember when we
were still filming season one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you boys had finished for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a good 10 minutes filming your intros. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I don't think I'd
even started filming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm like, "Cindy,
am I looking good?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jumps of in the hood and kind like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "What is anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Anime is some..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like Garnt, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just talk Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The glow up, man, it was great to see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We all did a much better job, actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we also have a
confident (mumbling) experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How hope that came across in the videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hopefully they look better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they sound better and the energy is there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well then most of the
time I did get distracted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was so focused on doing the things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I forgot to actually talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the camera all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just so intent on focusing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on finding these god-damn figures, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I didn't think to present very well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would like to hear, even
though they're too long, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would like to hear all of
the overarching challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I forgot about them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it'd be good for the viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to know what challenges to keep in mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that might come up when
you start reviewing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So these are the ones
that were separate-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] So tell us how much points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get from them as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so one point to whoever spends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the closest to $3,333.33
which is the budget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One point, to whoever buys the
most expensive single figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The one with the cheapest
figure however, loses one point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Figuring from the lowest
rated Mal Series gets one point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most figurines bought
overall gets one point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Most spent on one series gets one point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most spent on a non-figure gets one point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most spent in one store gets one point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's lots of room to wiggle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As we said earlier,
whoever spends the closest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to $69 on a single figure and
whoever spends closest to $420 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a single figure get one point each. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're counting that as
6,900 Yen or 442, 000. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah 442,000 Yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Figurine from the highest
rated Mal series however, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loses a point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the normie point you lose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If anyone bought a hentai figure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a point because, God forbid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going against
You Tube monetization. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I totally forgot we had that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I totally forgot to have that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've just remembered what I bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Me too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's just say someone
got a point for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One point to the most figures bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from an anime original movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, any like Shinkai movie, Hosna movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Minus one point for every
Funko Pop, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Minus one point for every
duplicate character anyone buys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and minus two points </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for every exact duplicate
figure anyone buys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we made that like stakes
high because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we might, say for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt and I might buy an Astolfo figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We will loose a point but does-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's a massive Astolfo fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course, but there's lots
of Astolfo figures, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With from different makers,
so if it's the exact same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which I don't think will happen, honestly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the massive budget we
had, then it's two points lost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the final one,
is if you fail to spend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at least a minimum of 50,000
Yen at a store or $500, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll lose a point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that was the one we were all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of paying attention to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I use that as
like a good way to gauge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the rest of my budget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was to encourage us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not to hoard all our money for one store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and if it didn't make it clear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the how we are converting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna be saying
everything in dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's just basically
taking the Yen price </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and dividing by 100. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that 1 Yen equals $1. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not exactly right, but, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's as close as we can get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the closest you can think of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess we should start
with the first store then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the first door was Lashinbang, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what we wanted to
go to last year as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but unfortunately we couldn't
get approval one time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This year, since we knew-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We plan ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, okay, huge
shout out to our Geeks +, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for actually sorting this out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Last year, Mail-in sorted it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like five days or something
before we were gonna film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This time, they had a bit more time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but everything went smoothly and-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like three weeks or something this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We learned our lesson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unlike most of the stores, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the stores we went to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got to have free reign over them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without our customers
which was fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Lashinbang was great especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we got to go in
before the store even open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was two whole floors to ourselves, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like going to
Legoland without anyone there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like amazing
- Yeah, it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking awesome, I loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The younger means dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that you've lived
out the dream finally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've lived this dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a natural dream, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this is the shit you
wake up as a kid being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have infinite budget
to spend in this store, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I can buy anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you have to buy a figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we chose for your
model store's, Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you guys remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what your challenges were for this store? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember.
- So, we each got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two challenges for this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I got fucked immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, we actually knew what challenges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were in Trash Tastes can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Do we have Trash Taste can? Is he... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry, will you... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kept calling him Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kept calling him Trash Taste as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trash box, trash boxes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we actually knew the
challenges this time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we didn't know them last time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we picked some easy challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and some harder challenges that
would be harder to complete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just killed trash box (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God, hillside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I started off with some
of the hardest challenges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What were your challenges Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My challenge was one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find an anime figure or find a figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from a game that Connor has played. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I play little games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, normally, this would be easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're talking about Archi Harper, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous for selling anime figures
and maybe Jay RPG figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, a lot of Japanese IP. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mostly games that Connor
has not so well identified. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - In every store, there's
multiple games that I had played. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you've gotten this at
any store, you've been fired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you pay attention (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was a lot of turn-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was a lot of turn-based RPGs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of story-based games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I went through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my second chance challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was find the most expensive
figure in the store and buy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah that's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If these boys found the
more expensive figure, then-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then I don't get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Easy, that's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And when we go to your challenges Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - My two challenges were fairly easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So my first one was buy a Jojo figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and make the same pose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I mean, you know, Jojo
figures are everywhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when she wants,
so that was an easy given. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The second one, I had to kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> use my thinking cap a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, I had to buy a figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that can beat Goku and I have
to not only buy the figure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have to convince these two boys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that this character can beat Goku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm the audience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I figured it out though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I figured it out.
I won't be easily impressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In fact, I might even be
argumentative, (mumbling). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. t's almost like I'm on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My two challenges were
buy a non anime figure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was very difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is tough in Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was 'cause a lot of the games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> either had anime or animations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I knew that you
guys would be dick heads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that if I bought
something that wasn't anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but had some animation,
you'd give me shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there were shorts that
I thought didn't have animes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that apparently are getting animes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought (mumbles). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the other one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was just pick a figure blindfolded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh wow. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'll just spin around in one section. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that was not tough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just, it could end up very badly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] It did end up great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It did not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It didn', we will see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, we will see them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, how many figures did
you guys buy in Lashinbang? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I bought... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Three, three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. Same here, three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We started things off, like for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Lashinbang had so many
good figures, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It had a lot of high-quality figures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and aside from Mandarake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it actually had the most expensive figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I could find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which fucks me over, obviously.(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, on that note then go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is the most expensive
figure you purchased? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll go. We'll go.
We'll go for that last. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we don't know any of the figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that each other have bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I got glimpses of one
or two, but I overall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what you guys purchased, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I hope that you guys
don't know what I boght. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not gonna lie, 'cause Lashinbang </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so early in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was still late in
the waking up process. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't remember half the shit I bought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> at Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - For I, I bought three,
so it was really easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, at Lashinbang, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I spent all of my time trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to complete my challenges, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I like, I didn't even
consider the overall challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I even forgot that we
had overall challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was just trying to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used up all of my time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completing every all my challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember the
store was like opening up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to general public and I was rushing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get my figures onto like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You rushing man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course not funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Malin laughed though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course Malin would laugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember Joey looking
at me and he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh Gigguk, you haven't
got your figures yet?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "No,
I'm paying for them now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I can play my
challenges in like 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, mine were pretty easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the rest of the 50
minutes, I was just perusing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because both of them had
me looking around a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the second challenge,
which I did second, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which was after perusing
around to try and find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was trying to find a figure from a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Connor has played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, why don't you tell the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> while introducing the figure? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, which one do you think it is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well, I'll tell the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the figure is not
actually that big, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I had the most
expensive figure challenge, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd try to go on a budget at this point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was the beginning of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and so I look around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I look around at what figures
are available on Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I look around,there's Final Fantasy, nope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor is definitely
not play Final Fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It does it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Have you
played Final Fantasy VII? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> No, you haven't yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't finished it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I wouldn't count that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, the remake? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the original. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've played the
original Final Fantasy VII. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got like 10 hours in and I quit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Eight years ago? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually don't believe you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How have you never
mentioned this before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I didn't finish it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you've played it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've played it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know the basic concept of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why we never talked about this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I didn't really
like it that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, so you've owned a PS one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no it's on steam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you've played it in your adult life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I was like 18. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I used to go on like
steam cells all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was literally the first
figure I saw and I-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the first figure I saw. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if you bought that
out of enlightened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't beat it, I didn't beat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you played it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I played it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't say you needed to beat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, true, (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like mostly I looked
around on the second floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I didn't notice that
there were Arknight figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the second floor until people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had told you about it.
- Oh really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I don't know, 'cause-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> had such little time
that I spent so much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to buy the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just like lost all my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I didn't see any Arknight figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went downstairs because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> basically all of the second floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like expensive gaming figures, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which are just like basically
fate and find a fancy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I didn't know that you played. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't played Fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know you haven't played Fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go downstairs and
I don't really see much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's again, it's mostly anime figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I see a shelf
and it's all persona. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was thinking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was say to myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been trying to convince Connor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to play Persona for two fucking years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it has led up to this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was pissed that Conner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you were a good friend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would have taken my recommendation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and started playing Persona 5, but no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - One time I played Persona in your house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does that count? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno if that counts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just saw Garnt be like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (shouting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, we did, we
were very intoxicated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's why... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only time I
remember you guys, I mean-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, wait, what can you even do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Persona 5 for 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, what happened was is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was watching Sidney
go around some like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It looked like a digital
maze or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - A Mentos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no it was one of the Dungeons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All the way to dungeons, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I was like, give me the control. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll do it, a loss. And
then I got lost too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it didn't really help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I get 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So technically, I have played Persona. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't played it
much, but yeah, (mumbles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then the third one
I saw was a Mega Man one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've kind of never
talked about Mega Man before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you ever heard him
talk about Mega Man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've talked about Mega Man on the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't think he was like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's never mentioned it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I saw Mega Man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like Mega Man seems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a Connor game, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I could see Connor
playing Mega Man format. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is a platform, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a shooting platform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like she used to speed run Cuphead, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't know if... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you want a Nintendo, what
is your game console history? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause this made me question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what your game console history was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you haven't played Final Fantacy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't own a PS one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did a Nintendo 64-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the Nintendo 64. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My parents took it away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they thought games were evil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I managed to convince
them to get me a PS one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I broke it, then I got a PS two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I got a game cube and a week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> then the next box and now PC. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of the mainline consoles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I didn't think Connor
would be old enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have a Super Nintendo or Nintendo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like where else you play megabyte </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apart from the old school concerts, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So have you played Mega Man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I didn't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not like fully, I've played it at like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like friends house, for like a few, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I've never like committed
to sit down and be (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is a very good like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would say, no, I haven't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You asked me, I'm like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I got the figure now,
and I'm just like Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a Mega Man figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't even tell that story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be like no, I haven't played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I wouldn't (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I remember Connor was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm an X-Box kid." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Okay, X-Box game Kibera." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll stretch it out and
say, maybe he had a X 64. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then Sydney came into Claude Shannon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just like gone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how can you forget literally
the most successful franchise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the fucking world? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what you talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How can you forget the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's literally right
in front of your face? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally the most successful
franchise in the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a tiny figure, 'cause I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a figuritive figure, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the anime or lady? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 220 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know I got this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Not forgetting that whoever
gets the least expensive figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> loses the points. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I might have just fucked myself over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by owning a point and then losing a point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise I would've got
something more expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe you should keep track of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that might very
much be a contender. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's okay for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I know you've played Pokemon, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've talked about it several times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and even if we'd hadn't talked about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could bring this to
like 90% of anime fans </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or just people in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> They probably would have played Pokemon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Those were like Cyberpunk, Overwatch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a bunch of other actual things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was there Cyberpunk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was Cyberpunk, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was that the one on the
first floor or second floor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Second floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of the games were
actually on the second floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Also, I mean, Connor
found a bunch of Apex figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at Army Army. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw at Army Army at Apex figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Congratulations on completing
your first challenge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What a buildup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanted to tell
you the entire story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, well I'm gonna
speed run my first one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, I got the points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Does it have no story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I walk in, I turn the corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first thing I see is a Jojo figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Conner] Who is in there 'cause I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, young Joseph. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Young Joseph. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a lottery figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a lottery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a prize lottery
figure of Joseph Joseph. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a nice figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me see that, let me see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ooh, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was going to say, I also
bought Jojo figures from here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was hoping you didn't
get the same character as me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I hope not, otherewise,
we're going to lose a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who knows Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I did that, all
good. Here goes Joseph. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are we unboxing these stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually want to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, we can make them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me unbox this peek at you figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Careful now. That's
a lot of (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - These are a pain in the
ass, one trip from the bulk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So now you gotta be a
for like five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But at the same time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> since we brought on that whole thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll open the box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Since we got on the topic Persona 5, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll show you my Persona 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't not get this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I for one, I mean, Perona 5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is my favorite full time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] We should crack this open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should we crack this one open? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. How much was this one though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was... Let me see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So here's the question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Would you have considered
buying this figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if this was last year? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause this was like 82 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, so the Joseph one is 8,250. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a $82. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And this Persona one is $200. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay, it's still the one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's still $100, it's really big box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for what doesn't look like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it should be this big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But this is the Persona 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The animation Persona 1 , </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was technically an anime figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Crack it open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's have a look at this figure box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's check it out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the difference between Persona 5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the animation figures and-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that main character,
his name is Amamiya Ren. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where as in the game he had no name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where as in the game,
he's whatever name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's main character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's main character Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, he's Joe Cocoon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We live in a society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry to any audio listeners this week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Plastic game a sepal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why did you get the most
plastic thing on earth Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How many turtles are
gonna die for this figure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you're gonna have to like help us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in not being Ashley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is gonne be the big difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between last year and this year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that now we have a hopers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh shit, (mumbles) start
tearing that apart, the glasses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Malin] You guys wanna keep the boxes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not my glasses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we wanna keep the boxes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh. Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a clean Joseph. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's clean as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So was this the pose
that you did outside? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I did I did
the standard Joseph post. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just said do a Jojo pose of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do your Jojo pose, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought he said do the same Jojo pose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, I don't
think Joey would do did pose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I did this pose like every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we booked to the store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it on camera? Is it on camera? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess Joey... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you sure you wanna
talk about specifics? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not gonna come to
bite you in the ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And those specifics
will bite me I the ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're being nice Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would just watch
your back if I were you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, so this one's got
like a full, like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh shit, 'cause this ones
go like a full chaser. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joseph is very top heavy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's kind of like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where you like you ooh, he's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me have a look
at this Jojo everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey sets up this Persona
One and this is back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, this is quite the nice figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder why it's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, the thing with Jojo figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I've learned, as basically
a Jojo figure expert, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this fucking point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Jojo figures are weirdly
expensive sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've bought some, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so there's a certain line of Jojo figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think of that impressive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The visually they're not
that appealing, I'd say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And some of the most
expensive Jojo figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you all see, 'cause
actually bought some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the pucks off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's weird and I don't really get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I guess it's strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But this one, normally
when they're like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The ones that move for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like triple the price. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you've got like
the shit of ocean of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it moved, it'd be $200. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, hi I'm Generic
main character right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there you go. There's Amamiya Ren. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - My brain isn't working. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are we keeping all the figure or... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bruh, that cost $80. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Conner] Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There we go. There we go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so top heavy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's built like a brick shit ass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he's Jospeph mother fucking joster dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got to say he's-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Conner] He's holding glasses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's stand is very, very big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to the figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the circumference of the stand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a very big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who did you first
romance in Persona 5 Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I've ever
talked to you about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously the best girl, Makoto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think I'm a play say, Futaba? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that shit out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally, okay, and I did second, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but Futaba is literally the
worst girl in any Persona game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I say this, and like
people try to crucify me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - People who say they
like Futaba in Persona 5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are the same people who
would go to make cafes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally the same type of person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's why I called you out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm trying to figure out
where the chair goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Futaba is the type of girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who would say pagas out loud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like why would I want that in my life? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't understand these
jokes, but it's funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should play a Persona
5 and you'll understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you would know,
if you played Persona 5. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you want-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The chairs in front of him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One of my challenges or generic figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which one do you wanna do first? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - None of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - None of them, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're all pretty alright. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'll pretty all right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I'll do the Jolene
first one first then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, Jolene, nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But look at the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? It's $200 for Jolene? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Why didn't you buy a
$200 figure of Jolene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't wanna spend
much money in the store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I wanted to figure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I needed one that would
put me over my budget... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Over the 500 minimum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, this is a Sasa as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're usually like rather expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So these are... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Sasa super action statues. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Conner] That's the one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can use the-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These ones are always so expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't think they look as good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the other Jojo figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I don't think they do either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I woun't lie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that Jonathan one is
cooler than this Jolene one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I can take you
out, but it doesn't--- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a bit of a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what it looks
like. I'm not going edit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is opened and it's $200. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what this would cost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What makes them that much price? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the hype of part six. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The hype of part six. I'm
not entirely sure of part six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I reckon it is-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you said that there were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of expensive Jojo figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - These are the expensive ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That figure line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the SASA's very expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The movable figure lines for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are quite expensive, but Jojo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe a figure expert could
tell me why out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's more difficult
to design figures that move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It can be, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's also a lot of like
movable parts as well I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel like with movable figures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like the static one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> static ones actually look better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Generally, I've always said this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I prefer static figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do too, I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna think about posing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I despise the little pieces
that you have with it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can't put anywhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where do I put them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just thought with the SASAs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't like the joints </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having this light expose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you look like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks like an Angelo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, whatever pose you have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you put with the movable figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's never going to be
as cool as one like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like a static pose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe this one's cool because Jolene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it comes with like her extended hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That's kinda cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't seen that before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So perhaps this is quite a unique one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she has extended fingers
here, finger close the photo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I suppose $200 though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's going down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's big spend, it's the same as this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I remember I
thought like when I first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> walked into the store, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was doing like my most
expensive figure challenge, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought the most expensive figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was gonna going to be around $200. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that's what I
could find them first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So knowing that that's $200, I think... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what's what's your
most expensive figure? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll get to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's cock teasing us as always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Sure You Tube need a clickbait, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this is the second
figure that I bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this is from one of my
favorite artists, Yomu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yomu, nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Yomu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you didn't know,
Yomu did Miru Tights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he has done the art for another anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's coming out this season, I believe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is a Gun Buddy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We shouldn't have that
on the screen for too long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> We get the Montessori. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't see the copy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe send to that Mood On. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Conner] Open it up guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well I'm gonna keep
it as static as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So Mood On has an easy time censoring it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We get it. It's a very hot figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So let's see this out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I didn't actually know that
his characters had figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I saw this-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never seen that either actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause like I didn't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you count this as a hentai figure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really count
this as a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, Yomu is a hentai artist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If it's not from an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's inspired by like
a hentai artist, I'd say-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he has made... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he's made an anime,
Miru Tights was an anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Miru Tights is anime, and
I think is Ganbare Doukighan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I think that's either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's the second
one where it like focuses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on office girl workers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think this is just-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It only has these
fetishes, put straight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I respect it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I'm saying is he has amazing art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stop talking to us
Garnt, show us the figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm trying to, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is going to be the first
of many lewd figures 'cause... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You had Sydney as a camera woman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unfortunately having
Sydney as a camera woman, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd sometimes just wonder off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'd look behind me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she just wasn't there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she'd just be like
filming this lewd figure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Sydney, I
feel so sorry for Alan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he's got to like---" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's gonna see your-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's gonna send some most of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's very nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nut cherry is like
nicer than the figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This chair's nicer than
the one I have at home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude I want this sofa, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put her on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll give it to you.
That's pretty fucking hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I like that, I like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's hot, that's hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This next to the pingeon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the funniest thing I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The lewadity of man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How lewd is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, that's not too bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The original artist definitely (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I say like, he is a fucking god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to drawing
thighs, and tights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sounds like you're moving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like a stone henge asked thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on the tail when you move that around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly this, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right nice, nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh wait, you're not gonna
show the most expensive? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, are you gonna show that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you want me to show it now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or we can go through all the ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you have Jerry, by the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have two more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So one that completed the
challenge and one extra one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll show you the one extra one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I think, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously I have to represent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the greatest animated movie anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta kinda figure from a Akira. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This I think was the most expensive thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, what was that
Conner? What was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you don't like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's fine. It's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tissue also kit, (mumbles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] You sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I'm pretty sure
I saw Connor's life flash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before his eyes when Joey
took that figure out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you pay for this (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This one, I paid a $2,275 for this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I didn't say how
much I paid for the Yomu figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I paid... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I paid, what is this? $120 for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's not bad at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is pretty-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I paid $120 for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That looks like a $300 figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, that's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I got a good deal on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I haven't actually
seen the inside of this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but oh, it's one of these, right, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the old-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like an action figure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like an old school action figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay. that's cool though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Once a six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I saw it, 'cause
like, you know, I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This was at the point
where I had already bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Joseph one and the
one that can beat Goku, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'll show after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was having a good time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, this is the start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the first one, I'll
peruse find something cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I found this and I couldn't not get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I love it Akira. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was going to
buy some Akira figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I kind of
realized Joey's definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bought an Akira figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I completely forgot about
the whole like duplicate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I forgot as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's worth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I remember
you're the only person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who bought an Akira figure last challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No, no, no it was me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that was Garnt. Oh, that was Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I just assumed it was Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Where's the fucketh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, this is the condo one, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, was it you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bought this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is extravagant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It kind of looks like
a Kendall, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does look a little like a Kendall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is like an Akira Kendall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is an Akira Kendall right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks clean though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That does look clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Let me pull it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't you hand it off to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they can assemble it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure, they can assemble it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They can assemble this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, what is your next one Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just fucking chuck that on Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean you don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You bought it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's native creatives
collection illustrated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by he don't need to talk it though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why does that name sound familiar? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, Gi, 'cause it's a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So do you know what it looks like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you have a look at it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No Garnt, because my challenge, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was to open a figure, I so
choose a figure blindfolded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the one that
you were blindfolded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this is the one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the one I chose blindfolded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which aisle did you go into like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well clearly he went to the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Our mailing instructor, I think... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Or maybe we both chose to go hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, look inside for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I see? Can I see? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me see, let me see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, turn it round slowly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so move on has an easy
time censoring this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Jesus Christ Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If this is on the line,
that is definitely over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The whole thing is on show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, that's a
full display right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, I didn't choose
to get this figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Can I see that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need a closer inspection. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh shit. On censor it looks weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Or so it's under the desk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That looks so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you do you know
what's weird about topper? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what's weird
about seeing hentai figures? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It comes with an optional moaning face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - An eye here. Let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you know what was
worried about hentai figures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the fact that the
fucking coochie is on sensor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not pixelated as fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, oh yeah,
that's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So how much detail was there on there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Way too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] This is a Jenner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't buy this for you guys to... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Guys, give it back to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What a bottle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, wait, this, you can take this off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that removal? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. It looks removable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, luckily there's a desk, so close. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a nice angle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know what this hand is doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, sorry sorry, sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry, it goes on the desk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't tell me hat's how that works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I don't know
if that's how that was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - On the picture is on the desk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry for the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> If you're on the Patreon, enjoy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're on You Tube, sorry
that this is all blurred, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm wondering what this
looks like on You Tube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it gonna be blurred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it just gonna be the black box? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the black box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or is it gonna be like
the white glowy thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Mood on choose carefully. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the white bars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm taking this off now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was $200 for all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you spent two, $200 for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Two $200 figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I had to make sure
I reached the 500 minimum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was there nothing he just wanted to buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> out of like your own volition? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so focused on the challenges </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I had one that I struggled with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which we'll discuss next time after we-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Money will spent, I say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can this one home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll take that one home, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt was your most expensive figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you purchased. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so what was the most
expensive figure that you guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should tell us.
- You bring yours out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then if it happens
to be more than the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we found, then you get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to go out and say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I didn't get the
most expensive figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So what was the most expensive
figure that you guys saw? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you saying that the Amelia one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was the most expensive
one that you bought? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was $700,right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's was $700, it's not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I found a more expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually took a photo
of it, just for proof. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get out your figure in the meantime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes I will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, that's not a figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where are we gonna display that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Malin] Wait, you
have to go through here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So obviously, I had the
most expensive figure store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to tell the story of this one as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so my first instinct was of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go to the hentai section, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Sydney aside, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes the most expensive
figures are the hentai ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They are pricing as
we've just established. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, as we've just established. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I saw some for like $150, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at first, I was like, oh,
that's pretty expensive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> $200, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now we're getting into the territory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 250, all right. 300, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I went into the fate section. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where dreams die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because of course I did
where dreams are made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where dreams are made
by Romans go to die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And holy shit, I found
so many good figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like some of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, as you're about to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with this one I've bought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like at which point do
we not call it a figure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and does it become a statue? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bring it on out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I see it in the corner of my eye, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's pretty fucking ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck Garnt,
where are we gonna put that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm gonna kind of-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you even see me anymore on camera? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're over here, hi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I found-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've disappeared from the middle camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I found a few fate figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you could
even see me right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I gone hang you gone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over the monolith slab in front of you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I found this for
500 and something bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - $550. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - $550, and I was just
like, there's no way... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Either take it off the table, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or open it Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can one of you guys open it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Someone's gonna need... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna need help
cracking that boy open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is literally I really
like a fancy action boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so cool though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that is pretty cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's actually like made of like felt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so I found that
and I'm just like, yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have found the most
expensive figure in the store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a figure I want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not a figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause that looks fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a statue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That looks amazing, and
I'm like, I want this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I turn the corner and I see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this Emilia figure for $700
and I'm just like fuck my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't buy a $550 figure
and a $730 figure at once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason I almost ran out of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because I was just sitting there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with both figures next to each other, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, do I go for the win? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do I go for the point?
Or do I go for my heart? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Always the point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I looked at the immediate figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna make the
same mistake as Subaru. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna go, fuck the media, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going go for the thing
that's right in front of me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I chose the fate figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't regret a damn thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is actually the coolest
thing I've ever seen though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you also wouldn't
have got the point anyway, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you went to the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I found one... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> See, I think you should
have looked a little hotter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the hentai section </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I found this one and it's a $935. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of, look at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a Hayachine from a son of Avicii, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is actually a game I've played, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like a Witch Go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on this very-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That doesn't look like it's $900. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's from a very famous hentai game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's $935, here's the photo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, instead I-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You went for your heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went for my heart and I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I respect that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm just like, so guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like if it's like a little
too big for the studio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what are we doing for the figures? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What are we doing if it's
like too big for the studio? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there's like a
place like behind the toilet-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like there's plenty
of room in the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there's plenty room in the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if it's too big for the studio? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No nonesense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then it's just like useless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if you see
how big the studio is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We can get a little pedestal
behind the back camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys are fake
fans. You guys aren't-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Malin mumbling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it looks cool. Is that enough-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, Joey, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while they're still
assembling this absolute unit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do you wanna get out your next thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My second challenge was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get a figure that could beat Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, now I want you to
think open-mindedly here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna think very
close minded here though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Surely, what is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is one of the
few Lashinbang figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that didn't come in a box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just came by itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've just bought Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no, I have not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought super sane Goku black actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He bought black Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought super sane Goku black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because canonically, he does kill Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but so is half of
the cast in Dragon Ball Z. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wouldn't you say
that half of the cost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Dragon Ball Z can beat Goku? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He technically... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He literally fought Goku and killed him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That means he beat Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, Goku is fighting Goku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So drag... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Welcome to Dragon Ball Super buddy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So without having
watch Dragon Ball Super, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know they go to like multiple universes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm gonna guess that this comes from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the multiple universities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Super same black Goku,
goes to the other universe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure you answer
yourself can be yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not. This is the same black. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's Goku, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's still the
same black Goku shoot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was the line again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't shoot, he isn't black. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But he is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know if you get a character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that can beat Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's literally character that kills Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that not a character
that can beat Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So would you say the Majin Buu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a character that can beat Goku? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because he literally kills Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but Goku comes back
and then beats Majin Buu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you maybe considered that Goku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe isn't all that strong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you saying? You can't say that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The mother fucking dies like six times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think a guy who dies
six times in his own show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is considered so that strong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - (mumbles) So much and coming back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how does that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. But can he beat Goku now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the latest episode of
Dragon Ball Super, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because otherwise, half of the characters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anatomy can beat like child
Goku when he was a kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because someone can
beat him at some point-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We probably should
have been more specific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the challenges in that case, huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, Connor, what'd
you think about this Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What'd you think about this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally searched up characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have killed Goku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was the first one that came up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I literally saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfectly the exact same
form as well of when he... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the hand that took
Goku's life right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's shit, but it's all right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can have for that fucking point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If honestly... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of my kindness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, if this wasn't gonna pass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was about to fucking quit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where he did it, was that the only thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can think of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was there like no other possibilities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, the problem is
all the other characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in dragon ball that have
killed Goku canonically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't exist in Lashingbang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all Dragon Ball Super
characters right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you were going to
pick like a Jojo character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you would pick like, like who? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like go and experience Requiem
or something like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then that'd be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a Dragon fan out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has an argument against that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rowan Kisha bay could be... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's say that all of that is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> See, all of that is your own opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because you guys love Jojo
more than Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But this is canonical fact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dragon fans, what do you think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have the final say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna give him the point now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you have the final say
in the comments section. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If you say no to this then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you should quit
being a Dragon Ball fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But bring on the face statue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bring the monolith. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy crap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The structural integrity
of this seems questionable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That looks amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is actually one
of the coolest things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit. I regret nothing. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate that It's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at that, look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like a statue
you'd win at an award. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, that's that's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what? I'mma say it. Fuck Amelia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck Emilia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck the hands off Emilia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck the hands off Emillia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every painting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And how do we put this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know guys, we'll find a way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, where do we put this-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like perfect diamond by
little area behind the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on, come on, come on guys come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This doesn't deserve to go in the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It'd be great to look
at while I'm pissing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This looks even better in-person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than it even in pictures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get this out of here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Get this out of my sight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're keeping them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The fuck, it's literally
blocking my camera Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me look at it for just abit longer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's taking up like a
quarter of the camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a six figure guys, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not even a figure at
this point. It's a statute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a statute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the final figure from Lashingbang. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, what was your challenge? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll tell you what my challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll tell you the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was to buy a non-animefigure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And surprisingly very difficult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, if I bought
something like Overwatch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd be like, oh no,
there's Overwatch animations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't count. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's all this nonsense and shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys would fucking be mean about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I found a Terminator
figure and I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that'd be great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It turns out there's a Terminator
Coming out or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything I found (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I found some Star Wars figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, oh fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like they trying to
make this difficult for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're trying to attack me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So close your eyes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speaks off the microphone) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Truly the best figure I've ever purchased. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That doesn't have an anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does not have an anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it definitely doesn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Check this shit out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - $200, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where's that Fantastic Beast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that is Fantastic Beast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, I didn't
even know this sold this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you sell this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gala Grindelwald. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who's is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That doesn't sound
like a real character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Malin] It's Johnny Depp. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Johnny Depp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] It's Johnny Depp? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's meant to be Johnny Depp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - $200, is the only thing I could find, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and after I purchased it in the video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found a figure that
would have met the criteria </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like $1. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember what it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was something, I was pissed off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I buried it in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This fucking movie sucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't even seen Fantastic this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't even seen it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh look shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Malin] I guess... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why does it smell so bad? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess Connor, you can
keep that one for yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course you want Grindelwald on the set. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Who wouldn't want Grindelwald,
Kellogg Grindelwald. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What does he have Okie Jasu here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's he gonna look
he's like the fucking... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He looks like he's mid transformation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into Edward Scissorhands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So can someone explain
fantastic beast to me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a spinoff of the
Harry Potter series, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure, it's the same universe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it doesn't mention Hogwarts
or any of its characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Malin] It's the time before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hadn't seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I enjoyed the first movie along </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was excited for the second movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Did you like
Gerald Grindelwald and-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it was shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And the second movie was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was so bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was really annoyed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I really liked the first one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm pissed off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is he only in the second one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He appears it like a little
bit in the first round, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like only like it's a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lot of slots. The plots are fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck off Garnt. It's complicated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never known what it's
got to do with Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just he's the main bad guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just in the same universe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's in the same university,
has written by J K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can see, oh wow, his joints move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you can make him walk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He can get on his knees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He can get on his knees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what Connor, at
least it's not a Funko pop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't lose a point-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have to tell us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> On face, on face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You spent $200 on the Persona figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's buying these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Johnny Depp is buying them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cut them in business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I wanna know is yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who is buying Fantastic Beast figures? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get this out of here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure there are like
Harry Potter or Tacos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out there right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, definitely got this out of my... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Malin] Dumbledore's hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't say dumbledore's hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did my challenge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's in the movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was everything I
bought in Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, same, how many did you buy, three? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bought three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I just spent three as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I spent $578 in Lashinbang.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I spent 500, 8000, no, $589. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I spent $572. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, we were all really close. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Holy crap, this is Astop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll never mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - My bad. It looks like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just spoiled myself last time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I spent $674. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. The next store is Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this is the one that
we went to last time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was a fan favorite dare I say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's quite visually appealing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really cool, raeally
interesting store, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tons of figures and you
really do have to look. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I hope you guys spent a lot of money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or bought a lot of figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know I bought a lot of figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think I bought
like in terms of pure number, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's either Astop or Army Army </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought the most figures actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually didn't buy a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> First of all, what were your challenges? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so my two challenges were... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine was one, to buy a female figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and two, to buy a lewd
figure, which is great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's pretty easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I could get two figures in one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I guess I'll start off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My figure first, I believe this is it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I actually... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This was the first time that I
actually tried to be tactical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about what I bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For once in your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Lashinbang, once again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we had add Reyes like last year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this time we had like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you for the cloth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This time we had the faith
figure way, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It didn't matter. It didn't
matter about the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just followed my heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, so this was the
lewd figure that I bought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So we don't get ready to sensor this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm not sure... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember how allude it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it's hentai loot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it is definitely lewd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, and it is that girl from... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's from... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it's a boring girlfriend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Saekano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Saekano, that's the one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, It's that girl from Saekano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you want me to point
this towards the camera? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The reason... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of panty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The reasons there's a lot of panty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and from one angle it's safe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] The other is not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I mean she's not putting on thighs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but she is putting on her socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so the reason I bought this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because he was a female figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's was a lewd figure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was very, very close to 420. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna reveal how much this was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I know You
Tube bought some other ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah we'll reveal those at the end, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I will say it is close to 420. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's around-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn, 420 for that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did he go into the mahogany wood? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's going on here? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That kind of stuff is pretty expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That kind of stuff is pretty expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm gonna show why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I was surprised
that this one costs this much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, because-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like weirdly popular
in Japan for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I decided to-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I decided to go for it
because I couldn't... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Looking back, I couldn't find many figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were close to the 420 mark. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I like, I saw this one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, this one's close ish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so let's just go for this one
and see where it takes us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, which ones you were on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So mines were, the first one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was get a fist of the North Star Finger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is perfect because
this is the North Star </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like one of my favorite
Manga series of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are so lucky to
get this one in Astop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you would have found... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Any other store I
would have been fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're like, it's maybe like Astop, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and maybe Manderake, Lanshinbang, and-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lashingbang and Army Army I would never. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Army Army no way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we chose this one because we knew, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could be completed if
the right circumstances </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were met. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like because it's
such an old series, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's rare to find any figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just rare in general
to find anything physical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and all-star related. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I go one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're in shock.
- Did you actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not only that, I got a two
for ladys and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I got a two for one for this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got two for one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got two for one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I not only got my boy Ken, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also got that all as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As a combo set, look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. How much were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - These? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These were, if I remember correctly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it wasn't actually that
expensive this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These were I think $148. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Together for the two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah it's actually not bad at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually I think... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this was actually
the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this was $25. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] That's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, for a twofer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, these are like kind of... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean the one in box for-one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was a two for one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So you start winding up like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's pretty sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah boys. The
boys are back in town. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll just show the one that I got. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, go for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got a pretty cool
looking Joetra figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Oh, okay.
- [Joey] Oh, nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - From like the '90s OVA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey and Garnt] Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd never really seen that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the dangly bits actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've never seen a figure... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] It looks '90s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That looks vintage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I went for it 'cause I
wanted more Jojo figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think I didn't
get enough last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted more on the sat and I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is really fucking cool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it must've been
modeled after the old '90s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when that came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like Jojo doesn't
use a fucking scoff thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in the new one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so glad I didn't
get any Jojo figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause otherwise I'd be losing points </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left and right, right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad you didn't get Joseph-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why does it look more like Lupin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm supposed to pick it was sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was not that much as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if I remember correctly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The problem with Astop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you can't actually
see which ones they were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to remember it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember this one was quite cheap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like 2000, 4000, no more than that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What else you've got? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So after I got... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> After I've completed as
many challenges as I could. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I basically just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this was a complete,
one of my challenges </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was that many of my fingers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is get tired from
shutting in protocol easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did what any guy would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just start collecting wifers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very admirable, I respect that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got a kid now from
a re zero season two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got her school uniform one, which is-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the kid is cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll do, she's so cute. What the fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Garnt, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course I got to choose a refigure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I couldn't actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> find many teaser. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't actually find many teaser. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Does this count as a Funko Pop? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanted to buy one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> rent a girlfriend figure because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't actually find many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I couldn't find many reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't find many of Cheesery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't know if there was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if not enough had been made,
these were pretty cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were about in the $10 range. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I can tell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, I just wanted to pump, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pump the figure numbers up with some girls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that hadn't been on the shelf yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I bought two other
ones that want a challenge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the first one I got was
meets off on communal knowledge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure, I didn't see that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And because one of the challenges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is get a figure that is from
an anime movie Original, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's one point for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was actually the most expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was $258. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it get the most anime figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from the movie Original? What was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No, just one, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about we have that challenge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was the most part I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should double-check, I'm
pretty sure it get the most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think there's one from
an anime Original movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah wait, it wasn't get one from-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was two movie
challenges, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, most figures bought
from an anime Original movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well I figured, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was gonna be kind of
difficult to find figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of anime Original movie,
because they are quite rare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, the fact that this is $258 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> says that this is pretty rare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is this so expensive? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I personally have
never seen a (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even know that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we're doing anime original figures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I will pick out my other one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got a pro figure. Oh nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ooh, nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This one, I got a pretty decent price. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This one was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought it was quite expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw two, one was pretty
expensive and one was-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually have both these Androids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from a primary actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They're really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much is this one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, this one was $59. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's not too bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like anime original
figures are hard to find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they're normally like pretty expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Alright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What did you get Conner? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I also got another Jojo figure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because this one was sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many Jojo figures did you find? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That one is good though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually saw that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just lost the point, so did you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How did you get a DM or Jonathan? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. Oh wait. No, that's Jonathan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay, I thank God. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got confused. I thought
that was Joseph for a second. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But he's like collecting
the entire Jojo costs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So eventually he's gonna get the Joseph. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's we got Jonathan and Dio together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just, I've never seen this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That is really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] That is really nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never seen this anywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love the light lightening
effects on the figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I love the light glow it's so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything about this
figure sake is 150 bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but again, I've never
seen this figure before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I love Jojo and
everyone knows I love Jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I got it from the collection
and it's a beautiful boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a beautiful, beautiful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Beautiful boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, this is gonna open the ninja </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it's a bit more finicky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's nice, I wouldn't say-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You clearly know that
Tucky is supposed to be here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's supposed to be-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get on 500 total-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 500 total on-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Photo now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That doesn't look worth $250. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The other one I bought was the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I tried to get as close to $69 with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was one of the challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it is from one of my
favorite games, Akami. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (shouting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love Akami, so cute. There's
a stand for this as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] We'll come to you in the end. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll tell you at the end when we... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it should be the same, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> For everyone try to buy it--- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have one more. I'll
have one more figure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which doesn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll go five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you wanna go first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's all my ones except
for my last challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I got a Sebastian Mikaela's pointy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was like the closest to 69. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we'll reveal
that at the end, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pouring tea. I got a
bunch of other ones too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God. Its tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's going through like every part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's actually gonna lose points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for getting all the same right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Across the road rolling one. . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought this was too good not to get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It looked sick on the shelf. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Where does his hands go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] To the back, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh, I gues like that yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks pretty cool Actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It would look really cute on
the shelf to have a road... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like Connor is
just rebuilding his set </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from homeless. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's actually figured it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I had it hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you guys don't want
to have them on the set, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll gladly take care of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, well, that's just so sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, oh, it's so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Pretty simple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] It's really
nice. Oh, there he goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look, I stay up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe he wants to ride
it. He wants to ride. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I got that. I got how many
more fees do you have gone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have one more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What she say to me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Keep going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know the deal-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't know if you buy duplicates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you lose points, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know. But only one point, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, he's got three deals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's got three deals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the same character. So
it's any one duplicate, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it should work in even numbers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it goes like 2, 4, 6, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you buy one more-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Factorial? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, so if you
buy one more deal figure-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I bought sick figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they were sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There was sick nasty figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this one is like a big chunky boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Finds a Jojo figure.
That's a sick figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a sick vigor.
That's a chunky Deo, Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That looks like it's from the '90s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of these have looked like that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That face is definitely '90s. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember this scene from the '90s over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's why I went for it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you don't often
see the older OVA figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I feel it feel like they've
got a nicer build quality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in some ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like, it was
Jojo wasn't mainstream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When the '90s OVA came out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (shouting) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so big. I just
couldn't help myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Big boy knocked over another big boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a chunky boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just as a note, our knives, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all of these are Ashley's knives. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knife, Kennesaw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't know why you
own all of these knives. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a not a knife,
that's a crew nader. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that's the Deo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's pretty fucking sleek. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's really like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's a really, really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's a really cool
figure, which level degree? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate these stands. Which one is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do we know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Just give it a base. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's his stand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a Jojo reference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt, what's your final
figure befor I show my final one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, gentlemen,
as Joey has just shown, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've heard of Goku black. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You did not get that-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, let me introduce you to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] You did not. You
did not get that figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you didn't get that figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me introduce you to black Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was hoping one of you
would have bought this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Does it matter? Tell
me how much you it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How much was this? Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Those were $60. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was 60 bucks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 60 bucks steel wool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What went wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Who made this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I think someone
at the factory fucked up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clearly forgot to like paint it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who's trying to sell unfinished figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like somebody in the
factory was like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we got the model down, perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now we've just got to apply paint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there's like alriht,
it's going up tomorrow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the detail is really, really good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but he's just like, he's just sunburn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Today is sunburn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> By sunburn, you mean he
like ran into the sun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like he's a chard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is, that actually
looks really cool though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does, it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this like a character
in Dragon Ball fighters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that hasn't been released yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a secret fighter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the secret fighter
we've been waiting for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Final boss it's like a dark link. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. I just saw that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, I just need to buy this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just so I can say what the fuck happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, to be fair,
that's actually really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really cool, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, hold on do I lose a point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because we both got to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess so-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Great thanks, awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> After all that convincing I tried to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just lose the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> All right so my second challenge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at Astop was to get a figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from an anime that I have a researched on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got Goku black, right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They both have character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Malin] Parallel Universe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it's not, that is the same character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's not the same character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This is actually the Goku
that Goku black kills. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's the same
character. They both lose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what happens when
you fight Goku (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You turn into black Goku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all lost a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We literally all lost a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually think canonically-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (shouting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cannonically different characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Actally check this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, check this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's just regular Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just painted black. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If he was like a Ruskin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I go like the view-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think if you asked the viewers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would say Goku is a Goku black-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that I'm right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you know I'm right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all lose a point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually what do you think? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all lose a point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Malin] I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, what do you mean you guess, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that there's no carrots. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Not the same Garrison's
name. It's Goku snack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it's black Goku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought super sane Goku black. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no. It's Goku </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has another fucking
name. He has another name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Show me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a different character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally a different character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you fam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thankyou Dragon Ball
Super for being stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We should ask Twitter a
poll. I think a picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll say that it's the same character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, because you know,
if the viewers watch this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they would say-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But viewers don't know shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> If we ask them Dragonball fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would, agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Super sane Goku black.
Totally different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, my second challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at Astop was to get a figure from an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that I have recently watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what did we count as recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He said three months, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Which means that it has to
be either from this season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or at least last season, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could have watched
an old anime, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you forget there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very, very, very popular anime this season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has actually come out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I did actually watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't watch it this season, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched it quite a while ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That doesn't count. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't count. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't count. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Excuse me, you go into mal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look up anime of this season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure Demon
Slayer, McGahn, Russia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> actually comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Watch it within the past three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you buy-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Infact I rewatched it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you haven't, have you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I have no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No you have not. Fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> For more reason how you rewatched it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I thought it was a good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, you have not watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You have not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. You guys said, look on Mel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if it's from this season
or last season, then accounts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You must have watched it
within the past three months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not what it said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you watched within
the past three months? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What have you watched
in the past three months? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously. That's why I picked this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's from this season, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys said it needed to be
from at least three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We said three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It came out within
the past three months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It came out within the past three months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry. I saw it earlier, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it came out in the last three months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We literally picked
that challenge beforehand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we knew it would
fuck you over if you got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you got you somehow. Got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm say if I get the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> challenge, Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're going to
take the L on this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You clearly took the L
in the most expensive one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You literally said that came out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> within the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This came out within
the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We said, we never said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what is the exact
wording of the challenge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Malin] Figure from anime
that you've recently watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Recently watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I'm an animator you've recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I might as well not to have eyes either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I clearly didn't watch anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the past three months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys knew that, obviously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So obviously you've
made the fucking rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not helpful full. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not my fault anime's
been fucked this year, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I know what anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you watched recently, Beaten the Ditch., </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You rewatched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No the movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You rewatched Riding The Ditch, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That didn't come out
in the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It literally doesn't say come out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the past three months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It said recently, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Within the past three months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not recent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you rewatched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you watched... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so hold on. What
was this supposed to be? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it said Watson
in the last three months, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they, you guys brought
on the bull shit rule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it needed to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it needed to have come out
in the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what you said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, you needed to have watched it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. I have video proof. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You said it needed to have come out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the last three months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you provide that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you provide video proof-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's live right now is this episode-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't see the video proof right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I guess we'll have to wait for the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But this came out in
the last three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ashley, how many contentious
points do we have now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We have the Joest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We have the Goku black thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think most of the
points of contention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we might need to wait off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, we might need to wait off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to let the audience decide
some of these points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we can do like the
forfeit later than this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know our audience? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're gonna do everything
they can to fuck us over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're not going to give us the point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It might as well be zero points. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look, audience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We're gonna make a poll and Reddit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we gonna ask you-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the he worst I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally the worst
idea I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the last place
I'd go to to do a poll. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Totally gorgeous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw about a million-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw about 17 views (mumbles.) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't even have to take
it out of the box, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We know what he looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you don't wanna see? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm good, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know what it looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just whip of the knife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out the norm potently though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much did you guys spend at Astop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you won't actually believe this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause this was completely coincidental. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally spent 500 exact. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Look, $500 exact. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I spent... Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I spent $572. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, and how much did you spend Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just get my Jojo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He doesn't have a standard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, you're like goes
on the side of a table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually see the box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It says noodle stopper figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That means you put it
on, wait for it to boil. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I spent a total of $620. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, damn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before we move on from Astop though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna hear the story about
what the fuck you went through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Astop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I lie. I forgot a figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, nevermind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's my coolest and most expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want to carry on
with that thing though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, go show your figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show you figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Close your eyes boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna unbox it fully before I show you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's the most
coolest figure on earth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the one that we all saw last year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it that last year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it from that one
series? I haven't seen yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Perhaps a certain... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have no idea what the
fuck you talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know serious, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're going to be... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw him pick this out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I saw you pick that out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just have spoiled this Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I'm just gonna... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna open my eyes,
'cause I know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is one of the dumbest
and yet coolest figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the most epic figure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fuckung tired, I can't get it open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, Darn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really dragging this whole corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Drag my nuts. All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right can I (mumbles). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In three, two, one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck. That's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Where did you find this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't see this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't see that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was there last year as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was $300. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd say worth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, this is so sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We were in which box would that fit in? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> How did they display that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was literally like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the box it comes in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love this scene and hunter, hunter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just, when I saw it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I knew I had the spare budget, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't say no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only reason why I
didn't buy this last year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is because it was over our budget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually wish I bought it... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I ctually wish I bought
more and they stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were more like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more cool figures that I wanted to buy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't know how
much I would be spending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the next ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But looking back, I wish I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There was so many figures
that I wish I'd bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> They would like some black lagoon figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and some cat figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. The gowns figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really wish I bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But I mean, like
Astop's a cool store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So is Lashinbang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was so many cool
figures and Lashingbang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're at the same building as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey careful. This was $160. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's pretty sturdy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's that the most expensive figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no. This is the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is $300. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the flimsiest plastic
thing I have ever bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm watching it's I
imagine it's just that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because of how pretty rare it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] I've never seen that before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I've never seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know where you even buy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or when you get it from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It must've been available quite a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could be a collective item. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just the coolest
thing I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it. I love this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (shouting) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This has a different
center of gravity totally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very top heavy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Kind of feeling how dumb it would look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in real life if you showed Darn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what he was going, super sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, that was my art. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> This is my whole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You got a lot of these stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, you mostly-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - All of it was this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mostly it was Jojo figures, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mostly it's three deals in a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For Jojo figures, a black
ball lock potluck and a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Pretty good thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can it beat black Goku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All of these can be black Goku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's still my favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's your favorite?
When we have this, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, Joey. How dare you Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing is I sold this on last year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just can't believe this one's a real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ironically looks epic as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't get over how cool that little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So we found a meme recently,
which is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbles) with the caption, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, you can see his
Dick just half chopped off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the edge of
his arm on the screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was Astop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was an at Astop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Moving on, I need the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So before we move on to Army Army though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey, what was this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this guy buying curator figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've heard about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So when I was lining up at Astop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was a dude in front of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's in my video as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there was a dude in
front of me in like a full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on businesses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a proper Japanese salary man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I overheard and I thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I doubted myself for a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I overheard the words
Kirito and 600,000 Yen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is $6,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - $6,000. And I was like,
excuse me back copy rigt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you get a glimpse? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I leaned in closer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think he ordered it in bulk at Astop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think there was just too many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I found out as I was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He left and as I was checking out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I talked to the dude, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy before me, what did he buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't mind me asking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And he said, oh, he bought
$6,000 worth of curatory fees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, oh my
God, they actually exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> These types of waves exists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So he literally went into the store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and said, I'll take your entire stack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll take your entire
stalk off the curato figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who is buying $6,000
worth of curato figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he was probably like
in his maybe mid 30s, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just buying like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think he bought like
13 or 14 Kyoto figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like so many that he
didn't even like bother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bringing them up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think he just gave them the paper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and said just send it to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dropped his money and then just left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this like an investment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this curator reseller? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the only explanation
I have for this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's a big fan you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, boys what
challenges did you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at Armyarmy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So for Army aArmy, we
have three challenges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just want to make it a little spicy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we did wanna make-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And spend a lot of money there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This was probably going to
be the longest segment yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we bought a lot of cigars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My one were fairly varied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My one was get a figure that's American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy a Wall Scroll and
by an Incestuous series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and shout, "I love
incest," while holding it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Now for the incestuous one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna have to finish that here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't have enough
time to actually grab it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and shout it because literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment I picked it up-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sounds really convenient to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The literally the moment I picked it up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the staff came over and just took it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, this one, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Took it out of my hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't even tell him I like incest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How dare you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, wait, no, I
have to say I like incest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like stage hazards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's no one's fault, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you should have done it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll be happy to take half
a point for this honestly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I'd-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd be lucky to get off of this show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd like to at least get half of one' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I did buy... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I did finish half the challenge, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I did actually buy an incestuous figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just literally didn't
have the time to get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we're nice to you,
you're saying you'll be nice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to us at some point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have been nice to you
guys, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I go to his bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fine, you can have half the point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the figure then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The figure-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd shout it out on the
podcast so I can judge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ladies and gentlemen that I shout out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Air longa sensei just forgot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (clapping) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everybody, round of applause. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (clapping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, done and Joey Well done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm proud of you. Proud of you, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We go to prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the only one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like there has
to be an Orima figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Please let there be an Orima. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> This the first time I ever in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prayed for an Orima
figure, couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what else is incest? What else is incest? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, I lost the incest man right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I ran up to God. I said,
bro, if you scratch my back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll scratch yours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's an incest show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I just gave him some
philosophical bul shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's I made up on the spot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even though I saw about
10 or Maga sensei figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it so many? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. I dunno, it's
popular enough I guess, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess replaces lemon Sal with... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, there you go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I found myself a sucky read figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's actually not too bad.
To be honest with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not exactly a fan of air Monga sensei, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this is actually a pretty solid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you'd have the FBI
knocking If you said you were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, God should
be used to that by now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This one was $211. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - $211 for an (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know where... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have like your Eagles.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like incest Eagle vision. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So this was the only one I could find. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For once, I'm okay
North seeing the figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like a child's play mat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck is that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll bring it out, I'll bring it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's supposed to
symbolize soggy reas like bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What happens in this anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why is it children's starve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because she is a hentai artist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's a yeah... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> She's the and the Airman Sensei </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the brother I believe is
an Airman good author, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He is an author. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do I remember more
of ever among, since. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Brochures, punted, he got
like the cause bed, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is that? She's not a hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically this figure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this series is like the series from hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the series from hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, what the fuck </SPEAKER_05>

to be allowed to say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm really not allowed to say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's some kind of light
liability on (mumbles). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this goes, where does this go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically the series
should burn in hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why I named it up so much. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> How do I put this in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. There we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Honestly, honestly, I'm
happy with this vigor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I got this premise and it's
a goal she's going to huge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Huh? I would like to have one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, well what do you think
when I, as the milk match, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> better than wherever the this is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't even finished it.
This isn't even a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So, so Joey, so Joe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this one is still got to pay
for it and take it off the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> queen, the queen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. So Joey, when you are
asking for incest anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> he could have also caught this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh yeah. Because yeah, because she does, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> does she does do weird stuff
with a song. Yeah, she does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> She does watch. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So she gets in like a slime
bottoms on the premise of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The premise of the show is a
son gets easy collide with his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mom. And this is the
same era Monga sensei. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, they're not related by blood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. They're fully related
by blood came out of her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Like he came out, he, he
got birthed from her vagina. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He came out of the womb and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She raised him and she, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she turned him into a degenerate
under, there are some very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very, like, I'll drink to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are some very sexy scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's talking about episode two.
I'm talking about episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So in episode two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think let's just say that's
the episode that made me drop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the show in episode two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I believe they fight a
slime monster. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the slime monster has acid or slime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which corrodes everything
except the body, the body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it melts, it melts the
clothes off and guests, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guests who gets that
slime all over her body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And guess who is on her body
when the slime goes on her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> body? Yes, it is her son. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the sun is slime. Where does that go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't actually remember
the scene. I don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe it just goes and
gets rid of her clothes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He has like, foster plenty of slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I hope not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the one episode
that made me drop the shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise amazing artwork. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of my favorite autos.
She has amazing artwork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And they probably got
one efficient for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I love, I have a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I think I told her, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I said I have a couple
of bunny goal figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Ah, baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wonder, I really hope so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Nope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh too thick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. Well that's a. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Figure. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought you would like this one. I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that would have taught
me about that slides. But. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now that you've told me
about this line, clearly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shard is already taken by something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So on. It was the first
figure that you bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then I spent a lot
of money here, so yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do the challenges first. Perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bloody hell. That's a long receipt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You bet it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I had one challenge which
was to buy something from a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movie that Jerry buy something
from the animated that Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has watched in 2021, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is a little easier
than watched by when you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like I've seen zero
this year. Unbelievably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This wasn't too difficult as
last minute before we had to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> leave the store, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I remembered that Joey in
length had spoken about watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the even galleon movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I bought, I just bought neighbor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nice. What you're going to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You're going to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not the right type from the right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I know it has the movie on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It isn't it isn't though. No, it isn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It isn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not even close. You
had so many aver options. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, actually that's you know what it is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not even like cannon, even Gilliam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's even going, this is
evangelical on in train form. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's even going what the? </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> Joe, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's still even galleon.
What are you on about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cannot, I should get the point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. That's ah, that's proper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They also bought an even
galleon gone. So you both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lose a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes we do. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I got, I got, I got a
point and then lost it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you didn't even get a point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You lost it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't even you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If we're not going to count
my recent enemy. Well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're not counting this waver. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a shink stone. This
is that's a train train. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a literal literal transformer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's cute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You literally could have
picked so many even galleon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures. I can pick the one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a train either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - None of either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I get no point and can't gets
a point or can't lose a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I got no point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, wait, wait what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You both lose a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I lose one point and
you lose two points. Why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I lose two points? No, no, actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you lose a point and God doesn't
or it's both of you lose a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you don't get why I get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I also then lose that
point and got loses one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> He doesn't get a point and
he also loses the point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm happy. I'm content
with making gone loser point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will give you the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you can, if you can say that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get the point for the
Kevin's on the iPhone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the exact same day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he gave you the half a point for the. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause the exact same
vein. No it's no, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember watching
shin Cutty on in 2021. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Boston about watching shin Kelly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> on it's about getting one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - From. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to remember that being
in four point. Oh, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Figure series. It literally
says it on the book. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least I to no corner. Why
did you choose that figure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was so many evil figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There because all of them
look so boring. What about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The BNA? One that you
said you were going to buy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I found out that
because we literally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did a video this year on the Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I went to my calendar
and we actually filmed that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in like December. Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So can't lose this one
point and I get nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So I lost the point I gained. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now we both know you
both lose a point a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And then I get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Forget you don't get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I only lose the point if I get the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause you'd have to admit that
it's an Eva for me to lose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the point to begin with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So what I'm saying is if you would. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That means it's either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd lose no points or you lose two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> points. No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's either I lose no
points or can't gets a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't get any point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't get any points. I just don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lose a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I get a point
losing the point. If you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you admit that you lose a point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you're admitting this isn't even gallium. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This isn't, this isn't okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what? You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather, I'd rather not
admit that that's Neven galleon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then admit that we got
the same figure. So well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll tell you what. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So Gordon doesn't lose any
points and you don't lose any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> points. How's that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're exactly where we started. So. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So both of you have zero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This isn't even gallium.
It literally says it on the. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Box. I did not watch Evangelian
with a Shinkansen reboot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what you, Jerry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched the English dub
where they had this in it. I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, look over there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We lead the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you remember that
scene in full point? Oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when they bust out the evening
mean, you can't say, look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we literally in Ava three when
I plus one got introduced to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Avon, Galyon, infinity, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but even in the infinite possibilities, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think that was one of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Them. This is one of the
infinite possibilities. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think even infinity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can take account of whatever the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that is. I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that why you acting
so smug smuggling? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm acting so smart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because I know that's not evangelic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That clearly says shin Cardi
on, on the side of the bag. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can read it's even. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Galleon. What the is. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> - From even galleon, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I'll bring it. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> This is habitually. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are you buying figures?
They don't fit in the shelf. </SPEAKER_05>

toilet shrine with all the. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - I got the full box set. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't not buy this.
This is absolutely amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, did you buy the same thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Alright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey, Joey, what did you buy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Exactly. I bought wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the buildable action figure
among us five to collect five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Alright. So one of my, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my challenges was of
course to get a plushy and I had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plenty options to find, I
love character plus shoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I then hidden right in the corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey and right in the corner was the. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. You might lose a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what worth it
for the humongous, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what though? You know though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't want to stop there.
Cause the plushy, Mora, Magus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the plush. He needed a friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. The mushy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know the challenge was just
to buy one character plushy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I felt like, you know, you can't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't play among us with
just one, just one person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay? Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The character needs a friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Steve let's go boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Steve. We're signing our
own smash bros right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. Well I'm listen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Smash when I couldn't knock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was too perfect. What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So these are like buildable, I guess like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like lucky bought boxes for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we get the boxes
off the table? Luckily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> none of these are the
red as we read them all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So does it count? Is
it the same character? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. Does it count? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause none of them are really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's open them up and find out
who is from the same series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> None of these are red though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He's from the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Series, but you've bought
how many series from Joe Jones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Only one set of duplicates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But that was only one set. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? Because he was deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So, so you, so if I'm county, this is one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you guys, you got the among the sky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's literally a character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got, I got the red among us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They're not different than Fred. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a light on this. The
purple, the green, the black, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the white and the Gregg. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'll all the same
catalog. Look ledgers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> different costumes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hello. W when you're voting
for someone to get off, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do it's the same. It's
a different costume. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the same character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. We've already established. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We both lose a point and I
get a point. Cause it's Ava. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We've established that. We
both don't lose a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, he has not bought
a red among us carrots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So you can see box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You vote someone after you
go through your mother's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> character, you say red is SaaS corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the name? It's red. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Red. He's a crook. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a red crewmate it's a fresh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. And that's a, crewmate Fred. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a red crew mate. But at
the same time as a green car, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Logi Joey's probably bought
like 15 duplicates because. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm county. This is one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it came in one box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, if you open them all up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how many characters are there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Five you have, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You have five duplicates
because this is one. All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well you can either take the
five minus points or you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> take the one minus points here that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It does not work like that. It does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're even trying to argue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am going to argue
this till the day I die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a red among us character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will happily take the L I agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there was a red Amanda's
character, I'd be like, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we got the same guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally tried, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I literally like
predicted maybe one of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe one of these guys wore
by and among us character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So I was like, so I was like, ah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I actually had to pick
one that I thought the guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't actually buy. So I picked red. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there's no real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It sucks that you both got the crew mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it doesn't matter. Now you
both have support in the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There isn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A point off of them birth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think your most? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This under the contention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Contention. Ashley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't this the stupidest honor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your honor. I object. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't. You will look
like clouds on the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Emergency meeting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Just see meeting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I would like to talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You really can't believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is what you're trying to argue for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You both lose one point. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no doubt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually bought a B stars figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I wanted to take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it away from corner just in
case it as well. Hell yeah, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Not now. Like in my, in my personal life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't tell me that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, oh, that's
the one I've always walked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I pre-ordered this before he came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I was looking around
and I'm just like, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got all my points. Let's try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's try to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you know it anyway. It
didn't matter in the house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such a nice figure as well. It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you even watch the
stars this year though? Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Season two. I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. So. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You take one point off of them. Ashley. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is on the contention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We, we we're, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we're having points on the
contention this year, the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Take it off with them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's under contention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is not under, under what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The court of the clowns.
What the you want to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The court. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of the law, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the court court of among
the quarter of the sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But if we're going far by among us laws, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the majority wins, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's by majority, majority vote. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So therefore therefore you would have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you're posting agreement, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't just both keep
making up rules and then say we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have the majority it's literally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We did an emergency meeting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We voted and we voted
that your opinion was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you're in the same game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same figure and the same
characters. So they both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Colorblind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The same character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is not none of these
look like this character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They literally look the exact same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They're literally the
same character. I call it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How can like six of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Them go around at the
same time costumes gone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because why? Because they're
all the same character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The different characters, Jonah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll live. That is looks pretty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The point of the thing is that
you can change color because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there is no distinction between
them because they are the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And what if, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what if this guy's name is Gary
and this guy's name is Greg. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not, oh, how do we know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you, have you looked into. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Among us at all? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Any names? They're all the same character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So every fat, so all
among us characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just clones of each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I like to hear opinions among his fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyone who's knows anything
about among us little, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think can back us up that a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these are all different characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We literally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can. We bring up the. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Developers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We're going to find out who's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - One. All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bring out the what else is in my box? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What else am I going? I'm
just going to keep rolling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. So the other challenge I
had was to buy a wall scroll. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So I just bought a even
need to see it. No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. No one cares. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one has, ah, I mean like
my challenges were too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, one of them was this
and one of them was that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's both of my challenges. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause the next challenge was to a squat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Anytime I saw zero figure and
I really regret not going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the gym because my God
that burnt the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not even joking. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause now that I've moved
into a house with stairs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just going up to my bedroom
hurts. So I'm just like, I just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> after that, I just bought
figures that I liked, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I want it to get that as county figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want it to get that so bad
just because I never seen her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fully, fully, fully, fully represent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Boy, I have a red candy at home, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Hell yeah. I mean is still
making fully Coley figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this new? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think this is from the
second hand on the second one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The second answer, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes. Literally says 1990. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's when it came out. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's that nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Ashley, can you get me the lamp? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was just something that I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Going to buy. So I kind of
saw me reaching out for this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was too cool. Not to get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want it to get this full
myself for the longest time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I got a majority. It's not a failure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I thought it looked
cool in the studio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a Majora's mosque
painted light up statue. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney actually went back to
army army and bought this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> two days after. It's pretty sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It is not really good. That
looks, that would look amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh yeah. Good idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A bunch of from anime movies
just to win this prize. Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ton of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 5,000 Of them that I get that dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's old Jubilee too. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. I
didn't think of Jubilee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the challenge
of animate only movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, oh man,
how many hosts soda on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, because I was just like Cinco figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, pre-med, that's
a that's anatomy only Kira. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jerry's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Going to buy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it was the most animated figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I thought I got mistaken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was the most expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I bought six from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ghibli. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If you go, you've got
that point at that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But do you have a majority of
Moss lamp? I don't think so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I have a. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe this is sick though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you can actually put food
in it and it will like chomp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it and spit it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you need that for? I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Know. I just thought
it was, it was cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no face figure that
can chomp and spit you out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I guess my car fire from hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's cute. Calcify Monday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My next pickup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. You can see, you can hear, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can hear it nappy cheering
because is it all killer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the only thing that gets
Navy excited. It's all stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. It's okay to alter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The. Is this, what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so we have the best looking fate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You wrote for a character and you are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately it was
from fate To alter those, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best character from
falling asleep. This, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like in terms of
like her ranking in terms of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gameplay, it's like, it's not the best, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in terms of design, holy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This is one of my favorite
designs. And I agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you bought this, you
would've got a point, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't own her. I
tried, tried rolling for her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did not get her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, that's what we'll find
out about that lady that was in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Monterey. I was in Mandara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And that's, and that's
why, you know, if you can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if sometimes you roll for a
Gacha and you don't get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so sometimes you go out
your way and you own them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physically. And that's, that's what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So my biggest challenge at army
army was to get a figure of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a character that is American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. Now I had to
double check here, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It didn't say anime character.
It just said character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? Because admittedly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there isn't a whole lot of
American anime characters, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> A few that guy from
Yu-Gi-Oh there's a few, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but definitely not famous
enough to make a figure out of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. But luckily I checked
with the staff and I said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, it doesn't necessarily
have to be enemy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't say needs to be animated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So as long as it's an American
and you guys have no problems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it being an American,
then I thought it was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I got probably one of the
most American people ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> LeBron James. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - LeBron, James. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - American, you can't argue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give you that. I'll give you that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give you that two represents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We have a LeBron James speaker
in the studio applause later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, if LeBron James can
appear in space, sham, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he can appear on trash tastes. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Clean anime character. He was in space. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But I thought, I, cause like I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Said, like movable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can make him dunk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You can make him do the finger
thing as well. It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I love this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty cool. I'm going
to take him out actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you have any more figures? Kona? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. A few. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Four, four walls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you want to? I think
I only have one more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? I think I only have one more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't have a few more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but do you want to take some more out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thanks. Awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Awesome. You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what guys? I was
this close to buying one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I was this close. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, at least the reason I
asked what your price was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like, at least
let me be mine cheaper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was cheaper. So
you overpaid by 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's all right. I'm
going to take one of these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. Two points off, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause we're already at 2.2
points off. You want to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - See it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good man. I'm good guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We can have one in both show.
We'll have one in each corner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So one of my challenges
is to buy a male character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this was it. Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That one? You couldn't
go for any other male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a reason why I chose
because I also bought something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> else to go along with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you bought the motor bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you bought the motorbike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm so glad you bought that
because I saw it and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know because it's not
going to give me any points or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything, but oh, there's altar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okta, Alta dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God down. Oh, it is easily the
best looking fake character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sad now that I don't
own her, this, this is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is making me sad. I
now know that you don't own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So this is the bike
and yeah, it's a big box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I bought this because I,
while I was going to buy this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> cause it was $600. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought at the
time I'm I'm, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was very confident the time
that it was the most expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure. I don't know if you
guys bought another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still, you know, from
all the stores so far, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it is. I think so far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the reason why I bought the
other figure was to try and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> secure the challenge of
spending the most on one series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. How much, how much was this bike? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> $600. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. It's like a whole mix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a foreign operation. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at that. This is not
a podcast episode anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is just an unboxing episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how we've just made a
glorified on boxing episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know audio liens are going
to be so confused if you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you've come this far. Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yo, I can only get so rank dark. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy. That's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it moves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That is so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope you can yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry, Canada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope, I hope you can put Canada on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> God. That looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Again. That's not that,
that supersedes a figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's, that's just a statue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I really hope you can
get him to sit on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the main reason I wanted to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was because I was near </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> certain that yeah, it did indeed or. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - War. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, that's impressive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But look at my boy, little more clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at that physique.
That perfect physique. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at that. Look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I wonder why it doesn't
really stand up very well. I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Think even in the movie it
kind of leans when it stands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, I think it needs
to stand on the side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And the set though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought that would look sick
behind us having, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a one to six scale of the bike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just thought you can't say no to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what battle is?
Just merely it looks amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Worth wasting two points
for so yeah. I agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what? I ain't even mad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I lost two points. Cause we got that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We got that in the set. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't this sick. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. You move away for LeBron. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> James say he's like, hi it me, LeBron. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I got home. I got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got on my show. Contently
figure because of course I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know if they
started making them already, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but apparently they did. Oh nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would have preferred Roxy. A gray rat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes. Her name is gray rat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some light iron mouse copyrights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly you look at
that. Look at the design. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't believe I am mouse copied from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe we showed you
10 say ripped off iron man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe you mouse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. This is the last
member of V show Joe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Apparently it is gray, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I mean, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we show good tenancy
is far and beyond the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Easter I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I just, I just wanted, I
just wanted some presentation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Some representative
for the ISA guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I started watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Has it actually. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. This looks so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I finished season one the
other day when I talked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this. It's awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I love it. It's such a good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Show. Sorry boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was pretty distracted, but it move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so cool. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the noise and mace. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, he needs the gun with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, he does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a gun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he's the big off gun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without we don't need the gun right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> now. It's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Common leave. We bought
the exact same figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We post last two points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I I'm not, I, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The bike, I'm not even mad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even mad. Cause he got the bike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I committed. I committed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jerry that's all right. I'm
taking, they got the Tinder, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right? Pout down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Look at that. Look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's it's it's the small details, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the small details. It's
all about the simple thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. Sharp. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Your, figure it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Huh? Show it off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm stop taking nine years
to inbox it. I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Corner. I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rip it. Open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rip and tear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought you didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do that with your
figures. He's got Google. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> He's got Google maps on
the bike. Yo let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Google maps, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yo, that we're thinking ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do the detail is insane. Yeah know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is like model car level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the light turns as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Does the light turn on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno. I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not bad. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Very clean. Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have to actually build it. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We probably can't do it now. We got that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The mind comes on. I'll
just show the camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Show. The camera just comes
with a bunch of different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> customizations to the back so we can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Build that on streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you want to take this away?
I'll just leave this on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still have one more figure by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's the biggest one I have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I said that one. That one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right there. Do you want
to, we don't have to unbox it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've done boxes. Just put
the box on the thing, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know you are a
Hudson name. Yuku fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What can I say? I like anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've gotten to the point
where the figures we've bought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We buy are so big that it's
actually blocking us. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm not going to unbox this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but this is the Memorial dress, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Hudson and MICU motion for wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For the anniversary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it a memorial? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Malin] For every Nico Nico Chokaigi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - For every Nico Nico
Chokaigi there's a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Nico comes with a new dress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's the box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That one is also the one
that is closest to 420 for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, we'll-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Funny enough, one of
the things I have left </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the closest to for 420 for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Okay. All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know what the fuck this is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It to happened to be so close to 420. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've got two bikes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can put the other
one, kind of on this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do not know what this is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is mega zone in two, three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm guessing it's like a super obscure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably a super old meka. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Will I get destroyed for
calling this a transformer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it kind of looks
like a transformer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm guessing this
is some very OG show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a Garlin like a different character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> from a different show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fancy right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm guessing it's rare or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's $420. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think just looking at
the font of the show name, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks like an old show.
- Where did you find this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - In like the Mac section of ArmiArmi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like that's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I guess, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna be here all
day opening for you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, we'll just take
that off stream now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my closest. I have one more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How many do you have left? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna go first? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. So, oh you go first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause this one's a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My last challenge was
something from anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the boys haven't watched. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And what better than an
anime that isn't even out yet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause there's no possible way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you could have watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was running around the store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought there's a few option. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's been announced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Announced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you haven't watched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We haven't watched it. No one's seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nobody's seen it except
for the people working on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I thought perfect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know me and Jerry like Akina. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't play it anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't get the chin one though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, I went for the more expensive one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but this one was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you liked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I liked Shane more than Army. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, why is the four-star? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, she is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's literally the first unit you get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> She's just kind of repeat though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's literally the default unit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't even know how to open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Her final is E2 is like OPS shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry if you don't play Arknigts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, well, so this is the
main character from Arknights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm guessing she'll be
in the anime as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think she'll be the
main goal in the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so nice though. 'Cause I have... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I seen the Ninroids of Armia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't like the Androids, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I really liked the Ninroid for Amia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like a full figure into that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually might go and buy this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's actually so nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's one thing Arknights
does absolutely amazingly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's character design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there is no better game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can do better character design. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And the day is so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I've been looking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been eyeing up some Arknight figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that haven't been released yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the Freight one that's coming out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks amazing as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's coming out next year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember it being super P. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> She's still over here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] She's still OP. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's that's the Auckland. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, so cool. I love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Omira so cute, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Well that's that was 150 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Nice. Ah, I thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's completely a challenge
and it's a pretty good figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what was your challenge to get? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah, we haven't seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We haven't seen, I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Haven't yet scenes in the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the PV counter to the
advertisements count. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've watched dune. I saw
the trailer a good movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I see the advertisements
on the train all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there you go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought was a cool thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No complaints. That's a
nice We're at a point for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. So I've got one more figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And of course, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean he has like a really
good selection of hinted lewd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figures, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yes. So I wanted to get a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I figure, I found the weirdest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hentai figure I've ever seen. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bet. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, so on the front it looks
like a normal hint I figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. But the figure is just a nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna have to blow that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally just, this is like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like the way they
get sucked into a wall in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wall. You only get half the figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just the ass whole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How are we going to display? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's amazing. But we could show it God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> How much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God. It comes with, it comes with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it comes with an art book. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The, the history of Ooh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Luckily I have these emojis.
Things are covering me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but Alexa know it's it's
actually quite wholesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. See this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe not. I'm going to,
I'm going to have to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to have to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - All of that box for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - For that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. This article is
actually quite wholesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like some, there's like
some nice artwork in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the point of the whole book. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's the artwork
done by the same guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe who designed this figure
or design this character that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the figure is based off of. I
mean the cover is like, wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we can't show that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The back of the book. I
guess I was fine, but yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the front is wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Ganz. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Ava. Whoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How much was that? Ava again gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's getting gasoline in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Totally shill. Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Ava. It's getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Filled up here. I've
got room on my place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't, I don't know
which one do you ever is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I bought is so cool. Or maybe
don't hold it like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's getting filled up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro. That's pretty sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's actually so sick. All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Enough about the Ava. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Say you say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I love this. Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would you want that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just dumb. Wait, is
there like a wall attachment? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can tell. I think he can
put it on like your phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Now that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Before, before I decide how good it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was, I believe $130. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I would, I would, I would,
I happily would buy that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it was over 150, I'd have been like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is one of the best things
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How much did you spend in Miami total? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I spent an army army $1,017 gone. How. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Much did you spend? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - $10201. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I spend a total of $1,580. Holy crap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> At Amie Amie. Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy. Well, mostly it was on that right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was like $800 on a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah. And you lost two points for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it was worth it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I was thinking the bike
is probably going to be the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> most visibly, like striking
on the other thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because none of this can
fit on the desk or there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You can fit this thing
called we can't show that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny. This catalog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, well that's Amie Amie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's go to the next store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But last and certainly not
least is the final store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monarchy. It was brand new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we tried to go
to monarchy last year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just didn't have enough time to again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this year we finally got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is an absolute smorgasbord
of just random August </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> smorgasbord of random in there. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really excited to go to
monarchy. Cause like we always, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we go to Akihabara or
anywhere a monarchy is we always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotta hit up that store because
it's literally a lottery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you never know what you can find. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can find some of the coolest
and then sometimes you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the you go there and you
find some of the dumbest. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like, how did you
guys feel going into Monda? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Rocky? Do you feel like
you had enough budget? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had more than enough budget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> In fact I had to make sure I
got as close to 3, 3, 3, 3 as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> possible in monarchy,
which is like impossible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have like 500 bucks left. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh really? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had like nothing left. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had like 500 bucks just
to meet the criteria. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You did spend a ton. It, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to go to actually take stuff out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was able to spend $500 at Andrae. Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. I still want to get
quite a lot of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's go. What was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we had one challenge for Mondo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mine was to buy a
figure from a show that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mine was to buy a fate figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that God hasn't pulled for or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have in FGM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Joe's got mine was to
ask the store clerk for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recommendation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. I'm just gonna
lose a point right away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have? I'm not going to lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I totally forgot that we were
doing duplicate characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was only duplicate figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's extra extra. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We've learned the hard way
about duplicate characters out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> How many points have you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I lost two points now to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because he has full deals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Now he bought three yet at a stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Does the Don this is Don
Jonathan one count. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean it's it's it's like a duo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Dio is there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> XEO is clearly there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like the spirit of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the total of two points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause my Dio buying obsession
because you'll love the deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason I actually bought
this one was because I wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get as close as possible to the number. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this was one of them
that I chose. Again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I totally forgot about the, the duplicate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the duplicate thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I ended up buying this, but I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot to keep track
of, but I also got very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> very close to the 3,333. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nice. All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So my one was that I had to
buy a FGO character that God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have on FGO. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been way too long
since I played or myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So tell me your thought thought
process and this cause like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole process was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew all of the basic
characters that you get at FGR but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ones that are just like can't rotate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So those were obviously out
of the window, I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right. I talked about
it with NABI, my camera man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's like an FGO expert and
we basically made it. Yeah, we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we, we basically like did a
hypothesis on what might he not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you were really
lucky getting NABI as a camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> man. Cause if Connor got
here, yeah, he would've been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he would've just had to
pick the fake character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had the choice because
I wanted to get as close to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 3, 3, 3, 3 as possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had the choice to either
buy a shitload off Phaeton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Androids and just hope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just hope that you don't
have one of them. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or I just go big and go hard
on one figure to get as close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as possible. I hope you
went big and went hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I went big and went
home. What did you get? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have, I have a backup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I bought two fate ones. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So the first one I bought
because I'm not too confident. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? Do you have Easter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I got spicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you have Archer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So you have the character age tall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say you have a Ishtar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's different though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very different. It's very
different, but that's okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's okay. You can think about
that because I have enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you have gray? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Go hell. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Because this was
the big gamble for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I was like, I, I
found great in the corner, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like the back corner. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What is he? What is he? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The gray is like the, like a green repo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Clashes it, zip Zipline with him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's the same now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. I did not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No way. Wait it's grave
released on us Faygo service. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I, yeah, the event came out recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So I mean, I wouldn't
have pulled for granny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So I saw this and I looked
at NABI and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a recent characters.
And he was like, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, he hasn't been
playing that heavily recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there might be a chance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was so scared because
this cost $160. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, I have
to go like all balls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> move rain on this. Can we
get this out of the box? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Can let's get this out of the box? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause this is actually
a really nice feature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, assassin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. But that's my great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> great is not even from
the mainline fate. Syria, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is from the man? No,
I don't want to know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the point, the point at
a point onto me, baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. Add a pole out a 0.1 for Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He deserves. Although, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> although he had like the
biggest cheat sheet all time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we might imagine having NABI
as a sheet sheet for that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for that challenge, what
would you have done? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you've got that challenge going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bought a saber figure or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do your own Sabre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually, don't not
the main light safe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I really, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. The only good character
for fate is Alexander. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The great Alexander,
the character, some fat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like his style. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's why also I was like
a Rin face or I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anytime there's a red face
for sale. I know you like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's okay. That's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you don't need to get, I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Want, I don't want us to get into fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Buy another Dio figure. Go ahead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Go ahead. Go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ahead, Georgia figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. Not Dios though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't show us one of yours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So first thing I bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was a Nico Robyn one. This was the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was the recommended
one from the store clerk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have recommended a little more expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did tell him, I did
tell them, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> price prices is an issue.
And he was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you asked the store
clerk for a recommendation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> What does he recommend? He
goes, do you like one piece? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, okay, you're doing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're doing your job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like water. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, I guess you're
just doing your job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You literally picked the least
like inoffensive franchise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You could go for like, you
know, post time, skip Robin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. At least it's skip Robin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know, you know about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know that this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is post I'm going to read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The funny thing is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so this was like one of the
first figures I got at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> store. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So obviously with, with
a random guy asking him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking him for a recommendation, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it as a store
clerk. You don't wanna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't want to go crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't want to seem
too weird. You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't want to seem too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to wait for a wine
recommendation. He, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't, if he offers
you the most expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's not going to go for like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fancy. He's going to
go for like a medium one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So afterwards at the end, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I had to like buy another figure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his station was actually next to the hint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I figure section of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm sure Sydney was
frothing at the mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And when he saw us, when he
saw that, when he saw that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hence I figures we're an option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that Sydney was like
choosing, hence I figure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was just like, oh, those were options. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could have picked one of those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, why didn't you tell me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cindy went from literally the. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you ask a staff
recommendation, he's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The one with absolutely
gargantuan and a vagina. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're going to be like, ah, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I will say out of all
the one piece figures he did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he did like pick the
most cultured one he possibly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> could. That is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Robin is probably the most voluptuous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It's just a normal
looking one piece for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It doesn't look
like anything exceptional. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to like getting like
one of the male characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if it was like a standard Zuora
with like songy character, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then it would have been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lately. I like McDonald's toy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did I go to McDonald's every
day we got these for happy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> meal. I'll be, I'll be like, mom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're getting McDonald's once again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right here. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a big site. Look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already seen green, like
Lord Elma, Louise case falls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I believe is the spinoff. Oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds pretty sweet. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very cool. Visually appealing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty happy with it.
It's God doesn't have it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's another saber face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's another yet another
savory face. Get this plastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just have to rip the plastic. I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I will say I am glad that you
didn't buy a saber figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, because I bought a save it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really wait corner.
You bought a fate figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, hold on a second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The phone does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys lose a point
because he has the hold up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hold up a second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We can't show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh actually you okay. Actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I didn't know this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but apparently he'd
definitely did pick a culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> De what the she was G string. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, now we all know who my
favorite one-piece character is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. All right, Robin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I see you. I don't
remember that in the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Hold on a second question
time you bought a saber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have the big saving.
You bought a Russian bond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does that count? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What what'd you think? Kona. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You bought a saber of the
or something. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the exact same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They broke off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just gonna break it
off. Where did this come. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - From? Kind of what have you done? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What have you done to your fate figure? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I already actually just broke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God. I think you lose
a point just for that to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it doesn't matter
because you both bought sabers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So you lose a point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I take a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why don't you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't think he
was going to buy a Sable? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You didn't think you didn't
think I was going to buy a fate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what, that's why I was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why? When I got the,
like by a fate character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that God doesn't have,
I was sweating my off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I'm like, I'm definitely
going to lose a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause he's probably bought
all the fake characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Wait, do I put this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do I Mount this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just on that right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you want to figure this
out for me, that'd be great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Please give me the style.
So actually, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I have watched fate as much
as they meme that. I hate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just hate it. Cause gone talks about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a stand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a long thing.
Maybe it's in the bulk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So something I don't know. Well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's, that's a good saver thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This broke off one of the things
I don't know why it's very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> flexible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh it's oh, it's the little end here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I mean, I mean, if
you weren't careful with it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you definitely
want to careful with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's another point. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm losing so many points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kind of like Connor's gaining
points and then just losing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> them just as quickly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you take a point off Garland corner? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's actually a good fate for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's a really nice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that is a very nice savored figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Got I'll give, I'll give
you that one corner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll give you. There's only Nothing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but fade here looking at its
current streamlined radius. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He's taught. Great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And save us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, I woke up on a podcast
where people bought fate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fate figures and none of them
were bought by me. What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much do you think this cost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This one? Yeah, 200. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's thing. That's about 200 right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wow. Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Good. For 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Not bad at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So yeah, like I said,
I mean on the whole fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I like phase zero a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a 40. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like unlimited blade
works and I like Phase Zero </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - She watched heaven's field as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You here, you've learned boom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've literally ruined fate for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually can't watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What else did you guys buy? Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - One more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know what you've got
lecture. I saw you ask for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So one thing that I think
is underrepresented on trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes is Mecca. And I got. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - A $400 mic transformer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whoa, we can, we can, we'll go Eva. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've only got 11 Galyon,
but we didn't, we, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we never got any like Gundam
Gundam or it is a building one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think so. I, I really hope not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it a building one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm buy a building. We'll open it up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll go. We're gonna,
we're gonna find out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like perfectly flat. Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no way it would fit in that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I've seen it.
I've signed this like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen it. I've seen the gun plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And normally like if it's a
building one, the back has, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should lose the bag. I
just assume all Gundam ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, the gun flaws if this is because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I really wanted a
Gundam that wasn't a gun flaw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was impossible to find. And I have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't actually seen
Gundam Hathaway yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but Allen will not shut up about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Alex Allen is my editor
and he's just like gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And the biggest Gundam
simply know he's like gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you do anything, just
watch gun Gundam Hathaway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because actually no it is or no. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wow. Look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So Allen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hope I've made you proud by
buying a Gundam and actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really nice. Apparently
Gundam Hathaway transformer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - According to the BBC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? You were at the BBC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the best I can't, I can't pause. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It might as well be at gunpoint.
Look, look, this, this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like a pre-bill gun plot. This is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is baby's first guns be the guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can build it off camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So Alan just told me to tell
people to watch gun and mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've I've heard very good
things. I've actually like legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've heard so many good
things about Dunham Hathaway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, we finally have
a Mecca apart from you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've heard of the foot,
but have you heard of the hand? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it Choto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you buy one more? Actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I bought crazy diamond too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what? I respect that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I like you buy off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - God. I actually do early board too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But they were like to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bank, there were like
two high quality figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I go for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - High quality. What are you saying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> God? What are you in singer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all right, Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm here to help you with
that Jojo collection. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is this, is this, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, this is my. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most expensive figure I bought. I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Saw this figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Head shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How much did this cost?
Would you like to know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know how much it
costs to vastly overpay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did vastly have a pay
for it, but that's all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because this is going to
be, that's not the point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The point is can go on the. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least this can go
on the shelf I paid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> How much did you pay for
it? I paid $990 for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I better win the
most expensive figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would like to remind people,
this is a valued at $370. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did they get town?
Did you pay $990 for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, but this was the
only way I was going to make, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do with my budget. So yeah, I got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know what is mad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I really like pitch up in horse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're right. You're right Joey, but who? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's the real winner here?
I think it's monarchy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I love monitor. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I go there often Christmas present to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mommy. A hundred percent profit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 300%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Profit off of me. I hope you're happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I let Sydney choose a
figure. So of course, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's going to be a big mistake. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I don't know if I can show this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do I want to give this one out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I thought it was
the, the ORC porn one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. You scared me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There should be a for the. Am I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Supposed to put this on? Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this was $275. Am I allowed
to like break this open? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I don't think we can
show it. Wouldn't buying hints. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I figures there are so many hints. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I figures that come in
boxes that are just blank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They don't contain a picture at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's kind of a gamble to
see what kind of figure you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm about to find out now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. No, that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney straight away. Recognize the us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unagi figure I'm going to keep this. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's in the plastic. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's really nice though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - For sure. The patrons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, I think patrons
deserve the quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is awesome. He's my
favorite hand-tight artist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is actually a
pretty good figure. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a really nice figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is your Teddy bear
being bondaged I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is into some. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? Is this a replaceable? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What, what is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can you choose the thickness
that she's going to be here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude. This is next level hints. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I figures man. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here's my, here's my. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hold it up for the main, I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't get me wrong. It looks amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not a thousand dollars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A minute. It's not a thousand dollars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very rare. I've never seen it before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never seen it before. I'm guessing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why it called Surmont. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean it's sick and it can
go on the shelf. Thank God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not too big. It's not too big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The base of as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It can go on the shelf. Okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of, some of my, all
of Martin go on the shelf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Needs some. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just need some like black tape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can do like a canonically censored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Canonically sensor snapped off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it happened when I
took it out of the bag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all right. We can, we can bond it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine if you paid 990. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember it saying that
this was a broken in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> One part was broken in one pot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. That must be
like, that's an easy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that must be like super rare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's an easy fix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What else you get? What else you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't tell me you got one as well. God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just remembered. I
just bought some other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a narrative. Teddy bear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, a car Kashi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Teddy, Teddy, Beth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, he's my favorite character dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Some, some stuff I bought
just to pat out the number, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to get as close to a question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How much did you guys do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like small scale adjustments
to get to the difficult theory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about Miranda? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Rocky is that some price tags
had tax on it and some price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tags. Didn't right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So trying to calculate if the
price you were getting was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like with tax without
tax was like insane. See, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I just completely coincidentally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I was going to have
to do that when I bought my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three figures. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when I calculated
everything, I literally couldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was that it was that
close. I really, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually like completely coincidentally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got insanely close to three 30 Tuesday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I hope as closer than. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's your cheapest figure, by the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gone the peak because I've
caught even cheaper one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually 100 yen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, you just lost the point then you've. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lost another point. Lost
a point to gain a point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That you would've lost them before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so confident that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would get the exact amount that I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. He hasn't what, what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what was I bought for a
hundred yen? So was 200. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, but what was that bought for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What challenge? Nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, it was so that he
could get as close to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't add a point yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's it's whether he close
to the number enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The roll man. Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here you go. You can have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is going in the background corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that what you bought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - By a figure from a show
that you all watched? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that was a challenge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nice. Ah, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well I like it because
you've bought you've you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completed. You've completed this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the code gas journey and you've
now found a mate for C2 when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> she bought last. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Perfect. So I can open this up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's have a look at. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I ain't even mad with this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I see nothing but
jobs here. That is a dub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So give me a point back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that everything you bought? Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's everything. I
only bought three things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like the thing about
Mondo Horace one was a thousand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dollars to use my budget now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's true. I think the biggest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest difference between
this figure special and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last figure special is that I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like struggling to find
things to like fit the budget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we had set because like
we could have in most of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doors we could have bought
like the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And a lot of the times we did
buy the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there within reason. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh, that looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a nice, straight up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mean with the nice jobs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just a dub and
you've all seen code kiosk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. We love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Love it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That all right. I have one more thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. But Connor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think me and you are going
to need to swap because I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I'm, I'm going to need, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to need the table for this Cano. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we swap for a second?
Let's just put it there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also. I want both of your
reactions at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. So I've got one more surprise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a bit, it's a bit out of the box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Literally you're
telling me I could see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's the size of my girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was struggling to like
fill up my budget. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And monarchy had a lot of cool figures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but nothing that really like, not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not nothing that really
likes, you know, spoke to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno. I was thinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you've got another fate figure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to kill my way away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't don't guess what this is. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So should we close our eyes?
I'm going to close my eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I swear to God gone.
If it's another fate one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is this what it feels like
to be a small child during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm hearing a lot of struggling. Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So before you open your
eyes, I just want, I just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want to put a bit
of backstory to this. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I better be quick. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we like to on America
a lot as you, as you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trash tastes Potter, trash
days is on American culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I thought instead of
on American culture for once, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why not embrace it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hell. What was that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> What was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> steel brick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I thought we can embrace
American culture together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for trash tastes. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you boys can open your eyes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> What the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> God, what the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this is an air soft gun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I did not know that
airsoft guns look like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a steel brick.
Do you want to feel this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> What the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. If police come, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're going to arrest us
that are we going to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tomorrow? Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So for obvious reasons, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not going to get out of the
box because this looks wait, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was only 300 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, this is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is making me wonder what
the airsoft community is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan, because this is, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if a zombie apocalypse happens,
I know who I'm going to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, this is the closest
thing I've oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, this is not going out of the box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just in case anyone ever
thinks that this is anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> button, airsoft gun, but
YouTube, this is an airsoft gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that we might have to
blow her for you probably have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to blow her freaking patrons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here you go. Enjoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Enjoy that. And so, yeah,
this is so yeah, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Americans love gun. So let's
just buy a gun Americans more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do think how realistic could
you have send them all? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in Neanderthal, America
loved guns, love gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You bought this gun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You didn't realize the
whole point of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What's the five figures for
the background of our set. No, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to buy to see your reaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was the whole
point of the feet of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> challenge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to get a good reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where do we put actually, where
do we put, we can put this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do we get rid of this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Without someone calling the police, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we can figure that out later.
Let's figure that out later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Hello. We've had a time skip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No. If you, if you have notice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I lost all my hair
from thinking so hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So we are recorded the previous
recording for so long that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we actually ran out of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we couldn't record the
outro. And we thought, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we, we thought about
having some continuity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then Joey got his haircut. So
we were just like, I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't quite think about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not a team player here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, I guess we wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the last thing we
wanted to do was to tally up all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the points right? Of all of the
challenges that we would do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also do a forfeit
as well, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because we recorded for so long. I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the recording's
like three hours long now or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a very long episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we've had to think about it
and we thought that it would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> be better if we tallied up
the points on stream and we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not just going to do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There are a few points
that are under contention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like for example-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Still angry two weeks later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the character that Joey bought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can he beat Goku? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it even Goku in the first place? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many characters in a Mogus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - They are the fucking same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure you guys will agree
with me live on the 21st. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we did this live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what we're gonna do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is we're gonna do something similar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to what we did for our
Trash Tastes awards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're gonna have a bunch of categories, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of them, which we
argued on this podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and some of them are
entirely new categories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like who'd you guys think
bought the best figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and who'd you guys think
bought the worst figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Other things that we can think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are going to contribute
to the final score </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for what we have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we will be doing
our forfeit slive on stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Slive on stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Slive on stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I guess like as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll also be able to like show you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that we couldn't really
like delve upon too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Otherwise, this would have
been like a five-hour episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So any things we missed
during this episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll be able to see it live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you're watching
this episode right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much further in the future, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you could probably check it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the After Dark channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we would upload all of our streams, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which is down in the description below. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So subscribe to that channel as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, so the stream is going

<SPEAKER_03> - At 7:00 PM, JST. Is that
right? That's right. all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That looks like he's
facing a deposition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did not hit her. I did not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just trying my best to
retain all the information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that we agreed on because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we just like started turning
on the cameras and talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we didn't agree on anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you're developing
Alzheimer's mid-sentence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 21st is the day that we
agreed to do the 21st. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It did sound a little
Christopher Walken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As live-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually on the 21st, find out who won, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's gonna eat the punishment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes, eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because of course spoiler in our body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We actually don't even
know yet by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's gonna involve a food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not gonna be
a pleasant experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course Joey don't wanna eat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The scores that we got
from our individual shops </SPEAKER_05>
