<SPEAKER_01> - Boys ready? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was born ready. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were you though?
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can we leave that in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Came out the womb, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mom, I'm ready to talk
about Anime tiddies-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I'm fucking ready. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ready to get this bread, gamers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I am Monkey Brain, and here
today I have two galaxy brains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, you are correct on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If anything is to go by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except when it comes to chess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which when this comes out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only thing I'm
competent at apparently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can say it, that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything else I'm just
rubbing sticks together, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just goldfish brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah man, I just can't fathom
anything else in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what can I do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm useless, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shout out to everyone who
defended me for my monkey brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Today I want to talk about, fellas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a thought last night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, wow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got my life together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all know that's a lie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one just thinks that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got my life more
together than before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was wondering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had a drastic life
change from moving to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's not because of
anything to do with Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's purely because of I think the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that someone's holding me accountable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Before, if I fucked up a sponsor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was on me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> But now there's someone else involved. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was wondering, 'cause I'll explain mine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but did you, you know when
you guys moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know, maybe when
you joined the agency? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did your life change that much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you have a lifestyle change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or was it just the same shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the biggest
change for me has been, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> actually, this podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where we have a specific
day we come in and film, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having something on my schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has just completely changed
my entire weekly schedule, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I have one day
that's always booked off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I have to plan around
that instead of being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, maybe I'll feel like
working on something today, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I'll just feel like
playing Ghost of Tsushima. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's nothing worse I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> than it being a Monday morning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fresh start to a new week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, alright, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's see what I have to do this week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And you look on your calender,
it's just nothing this week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, what do I do? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> How do I do things now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially after quarantine! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just wake up and you don't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know what day of the week it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and weekends don't feel like weekends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weekdays are just other
days, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, most people wake up being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a Friday, it's the end of the week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wake up, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is morning.
(rooster crowing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A YouTuber's everyday is the same day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When everyone started working from home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, yes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is such a refreshing
change to my lifestyle! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we're just like yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, welcome to the YouTuber lifestyle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's fun when
everyone's doing it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's in the same boat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then when everyone's doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> their normal life and working, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how I felt though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when we, as you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we started to be like, alright, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every week, this day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this time, we're gonna
come to the studio-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like (sighs quickly), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is how normal people feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This is quite liberating,
I kind of like it-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I drink coffee with other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's great, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I worked at the BBC, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I worked there for like two years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like close to three years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I did not enjoy it after a while. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But after moving to YouTube
and being freelance, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just going by my own schedule, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I kind of missed the office environment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because about a year after doing YouTube, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I kind of realized, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if I don't actively go out
and seek social interaction, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it just doesn't happen now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It doesn't happen, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That took me like three or
four years to realize that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, do I have no friends? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless they, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drag me out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's just weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kind of, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of got that same thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I never had a business, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a corporate experience, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like working in an office or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's extra exciting for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it is liberating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've always been,
even during school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always been one of
those kids where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't study on my own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I had to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you were one of those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I couldn't go home and
just sit in my room by myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean 'one of those'? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When they'd always be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you all want to study together? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, I was always like yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now I'm exactly the
same as Connor actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I know that if I go
home and I'm in my own room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm not gonna want to study. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause no one's judging me
for just being like, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could just play some games? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when I'm around my friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to talk to my friends? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, same here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> When there was always
a group study session, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we'd have, in university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember we'd always have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the first hour was nice and productive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> We'd start going over problems, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then people would get bored, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we'd just talk about-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want to watch this YouTube video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's always what would happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I was a model asian son, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so I genuinely just like, hey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you want to go to the library </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and do some study this session? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't believe you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then we'd put our
headphones in and just study, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because if there's people around me-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And we all met up, and we all studied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do you think I'm so galaxy brained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you the real MVP, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which wasn't my lecturer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but my actual real lecturer was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shout out to those Indian YouTube lectures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were always uploaded. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Khan Academy re uploads? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what's that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like if you did maths
or anything engineering, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was always this channel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember, it might
have been Khan Academy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It was something like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where they would just upload the lectures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are shorter and way more informative. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, huh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of like Cliffnotes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow they explained
it better in 10 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than the two hour lecture you went too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'd go to a lecture,
you'd sit there for an hour, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you wouldn't take any of this in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then when you're revising, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you search up, hey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> X topic, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do I use, how do I do
second order integrate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inte, I can't even fucking say-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Integers.
- Integers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And there'd just be always this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was always in Indian
guy doing the lectures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They just know maths, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They get it, they get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They get it, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I never had anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just went to the traditional route. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you did anything
maths or engineering, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> at some point an Indian man on
the internet would save you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, that's just how it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that's just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I don't know why-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that maybe like only a UK thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was like Americans
too would use these things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's an engineering thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Must be an engineering thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I never did engineering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or the sciences. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I never had anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I had Indian lecturers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at school who were teaching me stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were usually the best lecturers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's so many in engineering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I didn't have any, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I had a YouTube channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could just fucking go onto, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like, yes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> solve all of my problems
for me please, thank you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't have to go to classes ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt so op when I went to university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was in English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the internet is useful to the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like, Welsh internet
isn't really a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So anytime I'd want to
cheat, I just couldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I couldn't google any of this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So I didn't know what I was looking up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But yeah, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God, my lifestyle in
university was so unhealthy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Were you guys really
unhealthy at university? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there any uni student
who lives a healthy life? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was one guy in my year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like the
peak form of everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He wouldn't drink, he
went gym every single day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He always was the best at his work-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like he had fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what clubs was he part of? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I remember people who
were part of the rowing club, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or some kind of sports club, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would have always the
peak optimal lifestyle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there was everyone else who was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, did-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but they would usually be the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they would be
walking down the campus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and people would know that
they're part of their club, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone would just be
like, look at this wanker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause they wear their, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I'm in this club. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone look at me, I'm in this club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at this wanker
wearing a polo shirt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He can afford a polo shirt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Get out of here, fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like because I went
straight into YouTube from uni. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you got the uni lifestyle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kind of just didn't change anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> except for, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I even had an approach
to YouTube making in uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was procrastinating my videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way I was doing with my lectures, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I would not do anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then one day I would
just do everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I would be like, wow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what a healthy-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was the opposite, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because I started YouTube
when I started uni. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I kind of lived like a double life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but usually it's supposed
to be the opposite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like you should
focus on your studies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right, and keep maintaining that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and you know, live the
model life as a uni student, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then YouTube just
because it's a hobby, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can just procrastinate
and do whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now for me, it was the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, alright, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> upload videos every day at this time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Get it edited, get it done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh shit, I have an assignment in two days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone who was seeing
good growth does that though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I knew that I should
have put engineering first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I put YouTube first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know how you managed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do daily uploads while
also going to university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and still pass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's play? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, let's play as we'll talk man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's some of the easiest
content that I've ever made. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like, also, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like compared to videos now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't call my old
videos good editing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there was barely any editing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was lots of of cuts, lots of zoom in's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the easiest fucking editing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Put some background music in, boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got a video, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, my computer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I really struggled
with that because obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the upload speed in Australia
is fucking horrendous, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As is internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The download was fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We had like 20 down, which is not bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not bad, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But do you know what our upload speed was? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like zero point one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty close. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like point three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So uploading a 500 mg video file, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like nothing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Would take me like eight hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So what I would have to do
is I would go to my classes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd come back, I would work on a video, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I would edit it until the night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I would upload
it and then go to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and by the time I got up in the morning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> usually it was almost
finished, or it was done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it would just be public by that point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would do that
everyday for three years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and unsurprisingly, it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was like a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I decided to move to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my computer just exploded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it physically, I was sitting there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was editing a Nekopara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episode that I was doing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then one day it just went, boom! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's Nekopara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's Nekopara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just exploded, like
the CPU just exploded, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the smoke coming up and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this house is gonna go down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This house is gonna catch on fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get out, mom.
- Like, get out! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is how the bush fire starts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is how house fires start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, so we got rid of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I opened up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I opened up the computer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and my CPU was just gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just disintegrated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It must have been constantly on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You must have never turned it off-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Constantly on, it was constantly on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, the computer was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nah, can't do it anymore man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, did you live at home
when you were at university? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, that must've been
such a different experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because I never got the experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of living in a dorm, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like, having roommates? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I moved out at 18. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd just turned 18, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've pretty much lived alone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or not with my parents since then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I moved out after uni. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sounds like a fun idea
until it's really not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> After about two months of living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with other people that you realize, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> man, I really hate people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, 'cause you don't get
a say in who you're put with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> At least British university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you get put with
people who you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was put with the rugby team, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And they were destroying
everything constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember one time I
had a pan specifically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for putting oven pizzas on, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was like, can I borrow it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> he's 7'10, built like a brick shit house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like a one pound tray Lidl, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Anyway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I go in the kitchen at night
to go and get a beverage, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I see my pizza tray, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's just a carcass
of a whole chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> A whole chicken was
cooked on my pizza tray, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he just left it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, there's no way
I can get this shit off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was charred on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, it's not even
worth saving the tray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, you didn't borrow it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you just liberated it from me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Just destroyed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just took it from
me and destroyed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, my mom's gonna be furious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at that one pound tray she bought me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Furious! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do I explain this to mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I hear stories of you
people living in dorms-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, it was disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always one person who was the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> disgusting person you could ever imagine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you would be made
to believe by your mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you were a fucking slob
when you go to university. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you need to wash your dishes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you need to do this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but then you'd meet that one guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't know how he's
functioned his entire life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He would just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had this one guy in our dorm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who would just take everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Take all the utilities,
and any the spare plate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knives, and forks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he just would leave it in his room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just wouldn't wash it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We would often get times where
we were just looking for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, I would be looking for my plates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and knives, and forks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had to ask him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one time I remember looking for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was a wine glass or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he found it in his underwear drawer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just keep the damn wine glass,
I don't want it anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> God, how does that even end
up in that underwear drawer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, I have so many horrible
stories from that period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And some of the shit they
used to do to each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't even hazing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just them being dicks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember they didn't like this one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in my dorm because he was kind of pompous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He was from South England, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he had a very posh accent, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was very, very like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, you're too poor to talk to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, immediately sounds like a wanker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he was an asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he would unironically
call people peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I call people-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that where you got it from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's where I got it from, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because I thought it was so funny </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that he called people peasants, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and he used to think that I was laughing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the people he was laughing at, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I used to find it so funny
that we're in the year 2000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's using the word
peasant as an insult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he would call these rugby
players, to their face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, peasants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's not big, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they knew they shouldn't punch him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So what they would do, multiple times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was piss on all of his stuff
in the middle of the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And leave it outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So they pissed in all
of his kitchen stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so he went to go
and cook the next day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was like, where are my pans gone? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, look outside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> The peasants have taken them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I told them they shouldn't do it, but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, what can I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I did not stop them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys, you shouldn't be doing that-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was that guy in university who was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like, not hated and not in their group, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was just, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they liked me enough where they would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> tell me the shit they were doing-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they wouldn't fuck with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they wouldn't fuck with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> They would always meet
in my bedroom for talks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So they would piss on all of his stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it got completely ruined, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they bullied the shit out of this kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was awful, it was so mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't blame them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah but, okay-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If a dude came up to me
and was like, hello peasant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd fucking give him a hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be like, let's see how
these peasant hands feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> motherfucker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were so crazy, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't believe the shit they'd do-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I hear stories like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I hear it from
people like you guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and just friends at uni who
used to live in the uni dorms, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like, why did
you sign up for this shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It sounds horrible? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like, when you're
moving into university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a party everyday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you realize that people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just dickheads most of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just had a flashback to a
horrible thing that happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Go on, go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it was Halloween, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we had a little rivalry
with the bungalow next door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> We were in bungalows by the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And, uh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you had a rivalry
with another bungalow, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was full of dudes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what would you do to get back at them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what would you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just send a message, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whatever you're thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not as disgusting as what they did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just tell us what you did.
- Yeah, what did you do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was Halloween, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was outside having
a can of lager, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I was watching them do it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, I'm not
going to be involved in this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm gonna watch this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of them decided it
would be a good idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to take a shit through their mailbox. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they did that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they retaliated
by getting that shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting it in a Halloween pumpkin, sorry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and throwing the pumpkin at
one of my friends windows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just exploded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It was so disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So then they thought, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this is all in the same night by the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is, and again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just watching all this unfold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, this is amazing entertainment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can just imagine you with
your beer in hand being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this is better than any
anime I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause they would ask you, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you reckon I should do this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, that's a great idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Looks great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Go for it, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fantastic idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then they're like, watch this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then one of the rugby guys was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna smash their door in as a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, that's an amazing joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so they smashed his door down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front door to their bungalow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> They smashed it down as a
joke, just destroying their? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just destroy property. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, wasn't even theirs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the university
obviously found out the next day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like, who did this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, I have no idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And they got in so much shit for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Does it have to do with
the poop on the window? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, why is there a
pumpkin and shit involved? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like literally monkeys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just showing shit all over the place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just flinging shit at each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically, these guys
were all in the rugby squad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the biggest rivalry in Wales, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and rugby is the big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Imagine, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know which state is the biggest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> American football state, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but imagine the biggest meatheads </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in America just in the same place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, we kind of have that
in Sydney as well with rugby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Disgusting shit is gonna happen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I guess because I was just, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they liked me enough,
it wasn't hell for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, they would still
use my shit all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was really annoying-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were you in the really cheap dorms? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I was in the ones
that cost 70 bucks a month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay.
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had what would have been
a psychiatric prisoner room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, it's the bare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They gave us a mattress
and I wish they didn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I immediately, when I got there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I pick up my mattress
and it's bright yellow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the bottom of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember getting
homesick the first day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, mom, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> This is disgusting, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was literally a tiny
room with a shit stained bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they'd obviously never changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was obviously, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> university dorms are basically
just remodeled prison cells. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I think I'd rather go to jail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Plus shitty internet connections. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I'd rather go
to jail at that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the bed that they gave us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember thinking, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably gonna be a single bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know there was a size
smaller than a single bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, there is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear, because it was way
smaller than a single bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd sleep like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anything else and my feet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm like a fairly tall guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not even that tall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm six foot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My feet would always be off the bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how small my bed was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like three pillows
stitched together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry, there's your mattress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I'm glad I never experienced that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just bite the bullet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just take the two hour travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> between my uni and my house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'd just be like, I'm in
the comfort of my own home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I learned some important life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lessons at university though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I learned, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you just gotta say fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone else and put yourself first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I learned that afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Uni people would just fucking take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> advantage of you if you're like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, definitely.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there was only one bus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that made it to the campus on time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it was an half an hour bus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's only one bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And this line would be fucking
huge to get on this bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> so if you were late, it was just whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I got to the point
where I was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to be so late for my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lecture if I wait in this line. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I would literally just, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when people were getting on the bus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just walk to the
front of the line and get on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Push in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would literally just
act as if I was on the bus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just walk up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, bus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then everyone would
look at me like, the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like, sacrilegious in England. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - British, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is like a cardinal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I would never do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I thought because they're all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of university students, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, fuck you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's survival of the fittest, bitches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We used to do that in high school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you guys have middle school
and high school separated? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no.
We don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all seventh graders
to 12th graders altogether, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so it's the same in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time the school finishes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there'd always be lines for different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bus routes that would go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, same-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And of course all the fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seventh graders and eighth
graders are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna get on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just start fucking running up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the 12th graders and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 11th graders would just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the way, bitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They'd fucking push these
kids out of the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And they couldn't do anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was the most
liberating thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Finally, when I got to the 11th grade, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have power now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Learn the hierarchy, bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Step down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, do you have any horror university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stories then that weren't dorms? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anything at all that was
fucked up, or anything funny? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean other than the friend I had, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, other than one of my
friends being a drug dealer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like not really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I don't really have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to go into detail on that obviously. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's up to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just see so much shit in university. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your story about throwing
the poop at the bungalow? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't have anything that crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't--
- No, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was really common for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd see-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was really common did you say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What fucking universities did you go to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just walking around
campus and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know I could ever see
shit in a location like this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you see vomit
and shit where they're, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you're fascinated how it got there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand the vomit, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we had a whole bunch of pubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and restaurants within the campus, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's obviously you
get a little bit crazy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> as you do as uni student, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you throw up a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm just like, why is there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like, poop on this sidewalk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, now that you
guys are mentioning it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm remembering so much poop that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have just blocked out of my memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, this is bigger than an animal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not an animal, it's
clearly not an animal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, this is a human poop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I know a human poop when I see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they are an animal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even like a
kangaroo or a big animal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this clearly came out of a human. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it must have been
pretty bad at my university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because they had a row of
port-a-potties that would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pop up on Friday though Sunday
at where all the clubs were. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So clearly people must
have been shitting enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and pissing that they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we gotta sort this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're pooping everywhere! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just keep remembering there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so much poop where there shouldn't be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is probably out
most amazing podcast-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's this one time when
I came home from a night out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was in the common room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just smelt like
someone had died there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It smelt like an animal had died. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it was a dog or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Started looking around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> searching for where this
smell is coming from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm playing a game of Where's Wally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just with the smell, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm searching everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was around Christmas time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so I searched behind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was, I searched
behind the Christmas tree, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was coming
from the Christmas tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I look behind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's just this turd sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there should be presents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my first thought is surely
this can't be a turd, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, like you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not like a dog turd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a full on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's clearly a human turd, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's not like
rabbit poop or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a big, full on turd. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> My first thought is surely
there's no way this is a turd? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is in your house? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh?
- In your house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in my dorms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my dorms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it wasn't a house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we lived in a shared
dormitory of 200 people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so we had a common area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I get this fucking stick, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I start poking it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just thinking maybe it's something
else other than the turd. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it's like a toy, a fake turd-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - A big chocolate bar! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the stick just sinks in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, this is a fucking turd. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, I am smelling shit right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How did this get here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was in the common room! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it was pretty late
but people come here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people come in the
common room pretty often, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just like, I was just thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there must be a story behind this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How did this turd appear here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you find out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never found out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, that's such
a wasted opportunity-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - All I remember was
coming in the next day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the morning, and it
was just magically gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel sorry for the person who had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to clean that turd up, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, I just hear shit like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but don't you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, you get some fucking stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're never gonna forget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I like hearing it from other people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna go through
the fucking trauma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of experiencing a lovely
Christmas morning with a turd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need that in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He wasn't affected. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, I'm gonna go back to my room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm out, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a fun story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is why people on
the comments were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why does Connor have so many stories? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I just say yes to the dumbest shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if this goes horribly wrong, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least I get a banger of a
story out of this, probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like yes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll do that thing that's
probably very questionable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go there, let's do this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm gonna get a
banger of a story out of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just forget a lot of stuff sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I got through my life-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I get flashbacks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes we're talking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking of poop, I remember that story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, 'cause going back to
lifestyle in university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I had the most unhealthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lifestyle you could possibly imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh yeah, 100%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A human body shouldn't be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to do that many all-nighters, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and somehow I had a diet that just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> consisted of mostly Red Bull. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many Red Bull's
would you drink a day? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And coffee? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would drink at least
three cans of Red Bull a day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like two cups of coffee. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, same.
- That sounds about right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But on some all nighters
when I had an assignment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was never ever done until the night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I had to put in my assignment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause who the fuck actually
does assignments weeks before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember one night I had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was 10 cans of Red Bull. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your heart rate must have been insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, it was insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't do this, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do not do this! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a cautionary tale. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the deadline was at 8AM,
and I finished it at 7AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember thinking, yes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can finally submit it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I submitted it and
I lay down in my bed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I could not stop shaking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember that was the exact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moment that I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man, I need to sort my fucking life out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like, I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, because I ate like shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was drinking like 10, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not 10 Red Bull's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like at least three
Monster Energy's a day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on top of coffee, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and then also eating Domino's
Pizza two times a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I kinda had a similar story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I wasn't living
in the dorms, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I would just sleep over in the
room that I was working on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I had a programming
assignment I had to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was, of course, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a teamwork job, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that never goes well in uni. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's always that one fucker </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> who never appears to any
of the fucking assignments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just me and a friend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were just waiting
for this third person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're like, where the fuck is he? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like the best at programming here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We can't do it just with the two of us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course, the dude never showed up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was just like, great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, the thing's due in like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what, three hours? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like five in the morning right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's just order Domino's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we just fucking called up the Domino's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We order fucking seven
pizzas or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're just like, hey everybody, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're at the uni right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just come to this room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ordered like seven Domino's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just come in here and we'll eat Domino's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the next morning I
remember the professor came in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just like seven
empty boxes of pizza's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just eight of us all
sprawled out on the ground, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just with pizza hangovers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the best story I have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously not as
interesting as a poop story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but, uh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where's the poop? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not invested in this story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did someone shit themselves at least? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we definitely all
smelt like shit the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's about it, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure I have way more
stories that I can think of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but none of them are
coming to me right away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just forget a lot of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, I didn't realize that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I got super chubby
during university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know Garnt is like, Connor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you never looked chubby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Connor swears to me that he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chubby when I first met him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just have completely
blanked out this memory of him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mood man, put this image on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two years ago or whatever? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I look back at old photos I have of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this boys face is round. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I never thought I was chubby, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't think you
were at the time, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think because it was
just the way I'm built? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't look that chubby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I remember a year ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like, I saw an image. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Someone had taken a photo of
me and it was from the side, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I just saw my stomach
hanging over a little bit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> When did that happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you start realizing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh shit, I'm chubby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm actually chubby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I had such shit diet
and lifestyle choices in uni, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was so fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when you first met me,
I was fucking emaciated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you were so skinny-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everybody always says that
I was so fucking skinny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You were so skinny! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To put it in comparison, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> all throughout high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't really grown in
height since high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm hovering around 180 centimeters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A little under six foot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> In high school, I think I
never broke 60 kilograms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you now then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am 75 now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I gained a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chunked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chunked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You look healthy though! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you look healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's 'cause I went to America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just going ham, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I didn't realize that, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metabolism is a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I realized that during university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously I'd been going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> taking advantage of my body way too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then pretty much last
year I just went ham on myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and cut out everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cut out energy drinks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> went gym five days a week
and lost 10 kilograms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I remember back then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know if I had a bigger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tolerance in alcohol or caffeine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was always, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was drinking equally much of both, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and equally destroying my body with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> as much shit as I was eating as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was probably
eating in food alone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, 3000 calories? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably consuming 2000
calories at least in alcohol. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's not even the Monster Energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> drinks that were probably
like 1000 calories, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plus all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was going ham on my body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're 19, you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bro, I don't gain weight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never been fat, I'm
never gonna gain weight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I had an insane diet when I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in high school and uni as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not just the shit I was eating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but just how much of it I was eating. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, lunch, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> high school lunches for
a lot of people is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, maybe a sandwich, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or you know, or a hot dog maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to have 10 slices of bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could do that, I used to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And just devour that
before the noon hit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like, I just got to school, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm feeling a little bit hungry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll just eat, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three sandwiches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was still skinny as shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and people were like, how? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I'm jealous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How violent are your shits? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that's the only way
you're getting rid of it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's that asian blood, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I've consistently, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been about the same
weight my entire adult life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm jealous, I'm so jealous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think my body just, when I eat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I start gaining weight, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my body just shuts off and it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want any food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'm just never hungry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's never been a big deal for me-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a fucking super power, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I'm okay with it now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I went from dangerously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> skinny to just normal weight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously people who have
stuck around on my channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and have seen me in that
emaciated state are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey's gotten really fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just went back to normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all that happened, I'm not fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all know YouTube
comments like to nit pick, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With university life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you guys feel the same where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, my parents always told me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, when you go to university, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's when you grow up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that what they said? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's where you're
treated as an adult, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With responsibility and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But anyone who's still in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such a warped experience
of what adult life is like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I guess university is kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the ramp to being an adult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way I saw it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There was people there who
left university who I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should not be living alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You cannot take care of yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there was other
people who I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I guess-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like if you can't
take care of yourself at uni, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're really gonna have a hard time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> taking care of yourself after uni as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, we've definitely met those people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Half the people I lived
with were incapable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of them was, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a serial gambler and lost all his money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - One of my friends was the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One time, he won 10K. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 10K, for a uni student, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a casino, which is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's basically a
millionaire at that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're basically a fucking millionaire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone was like, no fucking way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you won that much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He lost it within two weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Two weeks! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he was so addicted to gambling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I asked him, how could
you spend that much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You could have paid off your
student loans and everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember him just saying, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it just didn't mean anything to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like a guy
in the house next to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that got pooped in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> as you gentlemen know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs quickly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, as we all know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he was basically like a neo-Nazi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he would always come over and bring, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, two forty year old women, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was having
threesome's with them both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he would exclusively
refer to them as sugar tits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did he time travel from the 50's? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he was like, and
I remember one time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause my friends-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Come here, sugar tits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, he was literally like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> My friend was telling me, he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> He was mixing chemicals in his room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell the fucking university people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, what do you mean he's
mixing chemicals in his room? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're really doing a good
job selling on Wales as being, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, this-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where'd you go again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want to name the university </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in case they get really mad at me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bristol university represents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sydney Uni. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can find out what
university I went too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not that hard,
it's somewhere out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was always that guy who was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when someone
would talk about a fight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they were like, well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I had my Glock then it would be over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Come again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just those guys who are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, I know how to use a gun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a gun would fix that, always. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He talks about guns too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He brought up Mein Kampf an
uncomfortable amount of times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My favorite piece of literature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember one time he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> his excuse for not doing an
assignment was 'cause he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> too in-depth into reading
about Nazi history, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how interesting it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's always a double edged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sword when they're telling you that-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a red flag.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, are you interested in it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or like, interested in it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, are you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This sounds like an episode
of Peep Show or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It is, it was! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I luckily never had to deal
with him, but my friend did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Apparently one time he, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> my friend, who was telling me all this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had borrowed something from
the neo-Nazi character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was in his room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and his room was locked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so this guy didn't want
to wait 30 minutes to do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he just took all the bolts off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his door with a screwdriver set, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just removed the door and went in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and never gave him his door back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the stuff? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> For like two weeks before the
university came and fixed it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the dude had no door, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and he had a gaming PC and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the dude just had no door, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the front door to this
bungalow was always left open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's taking, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like utensils? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then there's taking a door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He took the door, like all the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck, the door handle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the hinges, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just took it off and just
removed the door to the side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a caveman with a stone entrance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like, oonga boonga, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I need my keys, or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whatever it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This dude was insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was the kind of guy who, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you were around him for five minutes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were like, I don't want
to be around you anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You've said too many uncomfortable
things in five minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And when he brought his two 40 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year old women girlfriends around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they're disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Get them out of my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - His sugar tits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's so gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, 20, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clearing my dishes, like
what the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So how did you transition from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> university life to your working, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube schedule, adult life? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The real adult life, or
whatever we want to call it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I think for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd finished university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I broke it to my parents that
I didn't want to do a Masters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You clearly didn't want to do a Bachelors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I passed it with a good
grade, so it's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I go to London a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why not fucking move to London on a whim? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I moved to Japan on a whim,
moved to London on a whim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Went there and just, that
was kind of it really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because when you met
Sydney for the first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had you already decided that
you were going to London? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah I knew pretty much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> About half way through my last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> year of university I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like Wales anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really, really like London, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so I'm gonna move to London, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and even though the prices were insane, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I managed to find a roommate
to help me split the costs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just kind of went into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was really weird,
'cause it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, just doing the same shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just in a different city, I guess? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but no one teaches
you about that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You just gotta do it and
just hope for the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to pay taxes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do I figure that out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, I need to figure this out-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to check the mailbox? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Ew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just so many things
you have to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and hope that you're doing right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, what was it for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause obviously you
did a way bigger leap? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a gap year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gap year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A gap year between from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in between actually starting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between graduating from uni and actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starting my job at the BBC, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was when I kind of went, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was when I went all out on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I just completely stopped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So the period before I completely stopped, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I spent a lot of time on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I had basically
nothing else to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you still not making any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> money during that time as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I wasn't making any money-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh wow.
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just because I
had nothing else do to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was really enjoying it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was about
the time Podtaku started, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of new things were happening-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, so you were pretty
heavily invested at that time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I was pretty
heavily invested in that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember, this was
such a weird year for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I would spend my
time all over the world, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just in different places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I lived in China for a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Um, for reasons I don't
really wanna get into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I was there for a bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I was in Thailand for a bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and most of the time I was
just working on YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and by the end, I wanted something stable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted a job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought I wanted a
job at the BBC, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it was good for the first year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> About the first year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a good experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a nice break from university, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just doing YouTube for a while, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause what I didn't realize is how hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> university life is compared
to having a real job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you guys don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the stress and shit you go through in uni </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is like 10 times as much as anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll go through in a normal job-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've got drama on top of having to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 assignments all at one time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your exams, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's like, if
I fail one assignment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I am stuck here for the rest of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like I've been stressed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but never as stressed as I
was at university sometimes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause they always, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if it was
the same for you guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but in my university they always put all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the deadlines at the same fucking time-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Same time, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it was always two months of, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm having a great time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing League of Legends 12 hours a day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got nothing to do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> November hits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have eight fucking assignments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two exams coming up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and four exams on top of
that two exams that you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, holy shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> holy fuck-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just constantly shitting in your pants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like, I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm never gonna get out, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I still had my really unhealthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> lifestyle I had in university
in my job at the BBC. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so let me explain to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my sleep schedule for the BBC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I want to get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> This is one I really wanted to talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because my sleep schedule was disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, at the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of my friends were online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and a lot of them, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were in north America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which the best time to
talk to them was either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, probably really late for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So you just get used to
staying up super, super late. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that was fine when I was in university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was easy to
do all nighters anyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when I was working at the BBC, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a nine to five job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'd need to get up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I lived five minutes
away from my workplace, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a good thing,
because if I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my sleep schedule would be
even worse than it already was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I would stay up until
about 4AM everyday, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seems pretty normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I would wake up at eight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would have four hours of sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do my nine to five-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's all that monk preparation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do my nine to five
with four hours of sleep, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be fucking dead for the entire day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then go back home, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and around five, six o clock-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Do the same shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have a two hour nap and then
that was my sleep schedule. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never had one long sleep,
it was always intermittent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I would have a maximum of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, three to four hours at a time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every night, just spaced out by, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, eight hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was my sleep schedule for four years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think being friends with Americans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because of how the time zone's work, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like five hours ahead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You end up, like you're talking to them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you're having a good time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can talk for an hour extra. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it'd constantly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, the hour extra adds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And before you know it the sun's rising, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you have a bad sleep schedule? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was the similar thing because, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as you said, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of my YouTuber friends
were in North America, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or not in Australia essentially, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I always had to adjust
to their time zones, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was usually like three or 4AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at least I didn't
have to get up at 8AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get up at maybe like 2PM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I got up before noon,
that was weird for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, this isn't right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can feel the morning sun! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt the morning sun
before I went to bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if you guys did this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I would, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just slowly deteriorate my
sleep schedule till it got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the point where I
was going to bed at six, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 7AM, and then I would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, wake up at 4PM. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whatever, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would do the thing where
I would completely fuck it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I'm like, I'm gonna fix it today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I fix it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I immediately start
just chipping away at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It offsets by an hour, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then an hour turns into two hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then two hours
turns into three hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you'll have that one night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm sure you've had it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason you stayed up until 8AM. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're like, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's not coming back from this-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And for some reason when
you stay up until 8AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's easier to keep on that sleep schedule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than keep on a healthy schedule, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I physically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I remember last year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was so hard for me to try and fix this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would try and stay up, I would fail, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I would try to wake up early, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and I would fail. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was just in this loop for like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember two months of just
tryna fucking fix this thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I could not do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when I did, I
had to fly to America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then come back, and
it's immediately fucked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like I couldn't win. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know this sounds so stupid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, just wake up early, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Connor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, lol, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> he XD, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just wake up early, just do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like for some reason
when you're a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have no responsibilities, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's impossible to fix this shit-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just put an alarm on your phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs mockingly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It takes so much willpower
to fix your sleep schedule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really difficult
when you don't have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> any responsibilities or
a schedule to stick by, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or people relying on you,
apart from your viewers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This year's probably the
first year that I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost everyday I've gotten
up at a normal human time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
when I first moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were still waking up pretty late. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was first living here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at my previous place before
Aki moved in with me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was getting up at, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe 12, 1PM? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a reasonable time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I went bed at like 5AM last
night, so I got my sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think being on this time zone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like, American's are always
asleep when I wanna do shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I just go to bed and
then they're all awake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like I don't feel
any pressure to stay up here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no reason, unless I'm out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I remember you talked before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about how you would record videos at 2AM? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'd record, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I woke up at six? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna do anything when I wake up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 6PM, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd wake up at 6PM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in Wales, right before I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I was kind of like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was pretty depressed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, I just
wanted to move to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just stuck in this shitty
bedroom that I didn't like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was my brother's bedroom,
it wasn't even mine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't the attic room? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> At least there'd be more space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hated this room, I hated being in Wales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry, parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love you, but I hate Wales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They know I hate living in Wales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I hated it so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had no friends really, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so I would just stay up until, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> nine, 10AM? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I would go
to bed, wake up at 6PM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I couldn't do anything as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause everything was closed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was just a perpetual cycle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything opens and then
closes while you're asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally everything would
open and close while I sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I wanted to eat anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I couldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to preemptively go to the shop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to buy things that I
think I would want later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to eat for dinner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a similar problem
like that in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think it's because
I was relying too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on the convenience of the
24 hour convenience store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the convenience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I would get up at, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I'd stay up
until maybe like 3AM? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'd be like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a bit hungry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everywhere else in the world,
you're pretty much fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to look in your fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you can do delivery, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's no, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In my case, I would get out of the house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally walk 20 meters to the 7-Eleven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that was across the road from my house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just grab something, and come back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course I'm gonna stay up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's no time
limit with food especially, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or anything like that, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Recording at 2AM though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, 4AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 2AM, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 4AM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How do your neighbors find it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck 'em, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Dude, I would be in bed at like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what was it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This is when my sleep
schedule wasn't too bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 4AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I would hear fucking Peppa Pig </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking blasting through my wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's (muffled singing). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, muffled? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's 4AM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I didn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> They were assholes to me, so I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I'm gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should have just blasted
Peppa Pig back at them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - DMX through the wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, Peppa Pig version? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a similar experience to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first house I lived in in London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause if you live in London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna live in a shared house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just the way it is in London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So we had paper thin walls, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I lived next to this couple who just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, would not stop having sex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Good on them, good on them-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Good on them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it wasn't like the discreet sex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, they were loud, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wasn't even sexy loud. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The girl just sounded like a dying dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's kind of like the kind
of noise I had to live with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think they did that
because they got annoyed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at me recording podcasts and videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're like, I'll show him! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They would choose to have sex </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right whenever I start recording. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, coincidentally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I'd start recording a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd just hear these
fucking moans on the wall, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would have to wait a good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes it was an hour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what couple constantly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has sex for an hour every time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I swear they were taking the piss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were they filming a porno? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How slowly was the
guy going, fucking hell? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think they were just having </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouting contests because they were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> annoyed at me recording
videos and podcasts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So some episodes of Podtaku
you can kind of hear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We had to blank out my
audio because there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just moans in the background. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Release the uncensored footage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the moment they just look, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just putting
their ear to the wall, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the moment they hear 'warning', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just like, alright, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go, right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, put your pants out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Put your pants down, let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honey, start moaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Honey, honey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't even the videos
that I was loudest for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I would record voiceover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was full on battle cries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it would literally be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can shout loud! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It would be like full on battle
cries in my fucking house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at like 1AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was the only time
that I was awake and ready. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anywhere else in the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd think a murder was happening-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they would! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, they didn't give a fuck in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we live in South London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's South London, what can you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I did not like my neighbors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were assholes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And the one time they
stole my package as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so fuck 'em. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck you for stealing my package. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only experience
I've ever had of living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or having neighbors to worry
about is here in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's never been anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I had that really one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> recently, that one really
passive aggressive woman-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, below you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She gave you a note? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She gave me like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not the one time either, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like the third or
fourth letter she sent me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you explain the whole story? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm interested, 'cause I
don't know the timeline. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even remember
when the first one was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But basically I came home once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's in
other countries as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at least in Japan, in apartments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a mailbox
downstairs on the first floor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they also have a little
mail entry thing on the door? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's a normal thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But basically I came home and
I was about to open the door, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I saw a piece of paper sticking out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> must be a flyer or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Missed a package. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, missed a package or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I open it, and it's this really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was really creepy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like to nobody, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it was clearly typed out,
and it was just in English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I read it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this sounds Google translated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I read it, and it's the woman, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a guy or a woman downstairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know who it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you first move
to an apartment in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's customary to go to
every room that's adjacent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll tell my story about that after-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So the two rooms to the
left and right of you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the person below and
above you, if there are any, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and go and basically say, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hey, I just moved in here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, if you ever need anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm in this room kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The two people to the sides of me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fucking great, I love both my neighbors. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> The woman at the top? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Super nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Barely talk to her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the woman at the bottom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She didn't even come to the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I rung the doorbell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I clearly heard her
running up to the door! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To look? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To look in the peephole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should have put your
thumb on the peephole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I guarantee, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment that she looked
at the peephole and gaijin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> she was like, oh hell no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not going out there,
are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So immediately I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have that kind of neighbor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well, whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I immediately knew. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It didn't say in this letter, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it didn't say-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Who it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who it was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She must have not thought this through, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because in the letter she said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I always hear you guys stomping around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm like, well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> clearly you live below me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not even hiding it now! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your stomping is so loud in the night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'm getting insomnia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, sorry? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you must hate me then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my previous place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was up till fucking 4AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm living a normal
fucking life in this place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, and she kept sending me it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What am I gonna do with this woman? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So the moment she sent this recent letter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a couple of weeks ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna fucking show this woman, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm getting fucking annoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because she threatened to, like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Burn down her apartment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I unscrewed the hinges in her door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I broke down her door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And threw poop at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I shat in her mailbox. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, honestly would have got her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna show this woman. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clearly by writing, by typing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not even handwriting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> By typing out a clearly Google
translated letter to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she obviously thinks, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, these fucking dumb arse
foreigners don't know anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And there's this mentality of
xenophobic Japanese people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> usually very senile, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who think that they can get their way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because they're a senile Japanese person, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we're just a dumb foreigner
who doesn't know the rules. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just like, alright. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll show them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So I wrote a handwritten
letter, in Japanese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the most Keigo as fuck, like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Businessman Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the most polite Japanese
that you could ever see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I might as well have written
a fucking invitation letter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a resume-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To the King. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To the King, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I wrote it down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I basically said I'm
sorry but we gotta do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I work sometimes late at night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're not trying to
be noisy or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I basically said at
the bottom, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than you taking it to the housing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> company and try and threaten me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe we should talk face to face? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is basically the most passive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aggressive way of saying come at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking meet me outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, come at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been to your
house, you don't stomp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No, we don't! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You walk like pretty normal-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was really rude as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She wrote down being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your footsteps sound like you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dropping an iron ball onto the ground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw the Google translated letter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was just like, fuck you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like we're fucking neanderthals, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just stomping around
in our apartments, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Me, me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking monkeying around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tik Tok dance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I sent that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I went down, I put it in her letterbox. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Surprise, surprise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> she hasn't complained since. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She never took it to the housing company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I guarantee the
moment she read that letter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> she was like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He ain't a gaijin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He's a nihonji. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just slam dunked a
senile with some Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, I fucking got that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to do it to her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I introduced myself
to the neighbors as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the one to the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm on the end, which is great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause where I film is also on
the end that is just nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Like window? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I can be loud during the day and whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So the neighbors to the
right of me weren't in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so we went to go
to the neighbors below, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and, Mailin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember this story, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When we went to say hi
to the neighbors below? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you went with him, didn't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you weren't there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You weren't there, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I went to say hi to them below, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and so I was with someone from Geeks Plus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the housing agent person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and they pressed the ringer-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Doorbell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The doorbell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] The ringer! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The thing that goes brr. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They pressed it and, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they start speaking in Japanese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they start having a conversation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and slowly I see the two
Japanese women with me looking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> slowly more and more displeased
at what's being said. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if I remember correctly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what was roughly translated was like, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my husband doesn't let me talk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to foreigners without him there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the housing company
woman was like, I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They're just old, or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Great, what a warm welcome to Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My husband won't let
me talk to foreigners? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like Mike Wazowski at the door, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, what are they saying? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What's being said? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are they gonna
do, shit in my mailbox? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hear they shit through
mailbox with pumpkins? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - These dirty foreigners. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's gonna break my
door down apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd laugh if they were just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> actually talking the maddest shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> The translator was just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> she just doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like when you
see those interpreters that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like, don't tell the joke? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't be surprised, I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> could understand Japanese
at the level I can now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I would have picked it up-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, I wish death upon him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The translators like,
she's feeling unwell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was probably something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was probably
something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bump into my other
neighbors all the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're pretty chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They always say hi to me, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my neighbors next
to me are this really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> old couple who used to live in LA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so their English is actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Aki isn't the most
proficient in Japanese, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they obviously know that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and so every time they meet on the stairs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was really weird because, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was walking to my local supermarket </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and my neighbor walked past, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was really weird
because I was expecting, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, like a very
traditional Japanese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, ah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Konnichiwa, kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But instead-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yo, whattup? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What up, mate? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, instead she was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you going? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> A really weirdly Australian
British accent as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, I thought
you said you lived in LA? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That doesn't sound very Los Angeles like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, oh hi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I was fully expecting
to do the whole bow thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But she was just like, 'sup? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some old people are
really fucking nice here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they love speaking to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then other times, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just want you dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess that's just old people
everywhere with foreigners, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> right, though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's not only Japanese-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think Japan takes it
to a whole other level, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It seems like one extreme or the other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard for me to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I'm White, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and grew up in a white place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I don't know-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, in England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody talks to each other
or acknowledges each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Generally, talking is frowned upon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - In capacity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember, actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first time I went to America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was in New York, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this was my very first
experience in America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'd pretty much
only been in England, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and basically Europe, and Thailand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I remember I was standing
in the lift of my hotel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this American, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was one other person in the lift, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she asked me, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how are you doing today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You having a good day? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And me, as a British person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking freeze up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know how to act! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, are you picking a fight with me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck's going here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you want from me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Are you trying to sell something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because in England you
don't talk to each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone stands there in awkward silence </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and doesn't acknowledge each other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we go about our day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had the same thing
in Canada, on a bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was 17 maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was on a bus, and the guy said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, great weather, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not doing the accent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great weather today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just ignored him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I didn't think
he was talking to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not much of a talker, hey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I did, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how Elle stares
at Light in The Thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you talking to me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually did exactly the same thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because she talks over to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the first thing I did was check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if there was someone behind me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in the UK it's just not a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't talk to people in public. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, uh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you want? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you want money? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you begging? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just like a deer in headlights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just don't know what to do! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know better now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I had the craziest fucking Elevator, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even know if I'm allowed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to fucking talk about this one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can cut it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We can cut it if it's too extreme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's not the extreme situation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's what the guy said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he's got a shit in a pumpkin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, so it was my first time in LA ever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was Anime Expo, obviously, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause why else would you go to LA? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was in the hotel, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Aki was there-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have elevator stories from LA now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just flashing-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always LA, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always LA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> my Japanese side is always like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you're just in the
elevator by yourself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you can just be rowdy, and have fun, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and talk to your friends
and everybody, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But the moment someone
you don't know comes in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta behave, you gotta quiet down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because you don't want to
inconvenience them, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've told you guys this story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it was me, Aki, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like a few other people we knew. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we were going down in the elevator, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously just chatting it up, whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Elevator stops halfway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Door opens, and this Black guy walks in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't know him, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So immediately I was like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone's, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming into the elevator-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's stop clowning around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's stop clowning around, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't want to inconvenience him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He walks in really quietly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Door closes, starts going down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he just goes, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everybody shuts up when
the N word walks in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know whether
to say sorry or like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause if I said sorry
then we would mean that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I couldn't say anything! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even be like, ahh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was just like, eyes darting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just being like, what
am I supposed to say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like what are you
supposed to say to that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in that situation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America's fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm taking the escalator from now on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never felt more
complimented in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than when I went into an elevator in LA, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there was a bunch of women. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> There must have been five or six of them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were all mid 40's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what they were doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were just saying something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they asked me a question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just responded, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then when they heard
my voice they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> oh damn! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where are you from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm from the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, what do you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I'm a voice actor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I am in danger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was so flattered, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that gave me the confidence
boost I needed that day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm ready for this panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you were in America
with the British accents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - With any accent that's not American. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think because I
have a deep voice as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the perfect-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I get that all the time too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, every time I go to
a Starbucks or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I order something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I went to a
Starbucks once in Vegas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I said, I don't remember
when I fucking ordered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, can I get a mocha frappuccino, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the girl's like, say that again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, and I
thought she didn't hear me! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, can I
get a mocha frappuccino? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's like, your accent's so nice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna have to hear that one more time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I would die inside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's people fucking staring at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want a fucking mocha frappuccino. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just give it to me please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So now every time I go to a
Starbucks I'm so afraid of that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so I just-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't order the mocha frappuccino. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I just do my best to
do an American accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they never fucking question me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Americano please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can I get a latte, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, which one do you want? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you ever play up your
accent more in the US? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Um. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking turn that
shit on like a hundred. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, sometimes I do if I
want to get out of a situation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just start fucking talking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, bogan Australian sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it gets to the
point where they clearly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't understand what the fuck I'm saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, (inaudible yelling). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm out, I'm out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you ever go that, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you ever turn up your British accent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Um, I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I go like full fucking Downton
Abbey in America sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause they fucking eat it up, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if I really want
them to be nice to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the waiter, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if I want good service, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like, thank you so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's amazing, wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wow, thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> This food is delicious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You did a great job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they're just like, oo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I must sound like such
a fucking asshole though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fun, it's fun man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People are so nice to me-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Use it to your advantage, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess so, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I remember that
Americans would ask me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do you guys see American accents the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we see British accents? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not at all, not at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, as in attractive? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember one time I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way I explained it to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, if there's an
American on public transport, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone knows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone knows and they
know you're American-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're usually the loudest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They know, they hate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we're so, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> everything we consume
obviously is American media. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We consume so much American stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we're so desensitized
to American media, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and obviously to American's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a, oo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a flavor of British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hogwarts is interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very international. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's also because we've been to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> America so often now for conventions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember back
in high school, or-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think even general British people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't impressed by American's accents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I remember back in university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever someone had an American accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> they would definitely stand out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe less so now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think there's more American's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> coming over to England to study to here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we had that one American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exchange student in our high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and everybody fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> keep talking, keep talking! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe things have changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> At least in my university,
no one gave a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I definitely, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, we're all used to them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think Garnt and I are definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> used to it because we
live with an American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm definitely used to it now-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But before then, it was definitely, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I do think it was more exotic before I-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember American
accents sounding so harsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you could clearly hear the hard R. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, what is Aki saying? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Aki canceled? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The hard R in every
word that has an R in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Not just the single word, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> every word that has an R in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because we don't pronounce
the R's in all of our words, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So when we hear the R, like the rrr sound, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ew, ew, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ew, ew. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh God, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Stop, please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hearing Americans say British </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> swear words is the most disgusting thing-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we've said this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We talked about cunt
in a previous podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but hearing sometimes
Sydney would say wanker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, I hate that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's some British words that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> should never be said by an American. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Wanker, bellend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even want to hear
an American say bellend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bellend, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, we don't even
say that in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, and we have a bunch of British ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys have Australian ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The first time I heard
an American say wanker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, speaking of wanker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking this guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one that I hear sometimes Americans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> say that I'm like please don't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, twart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, it's twat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't say it, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Have you ever had any, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, because you
both have American GF's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you had any weird things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, cultural difference
that you've stumbled across, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're like, why do you do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I didn't have it with Aki, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but as I mentioned earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> my first couple of YouTube
friends were Americans, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And before then I didn't really
have international friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> All of my friends were
just Aussies, basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when you speak a lot of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially Australian slang, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is pretty much a different
language in and of itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In your head, you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah, this is just a
universal word that you use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember saying a bunch of slang </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my American YouTuber friends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't know if you guys say arvo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's Australian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's definitely Australian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's too uncivilized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's peasant's language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Un-ironically peasant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so we say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, instead of
five in the afternoon, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> we say five in the arvo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just cutting out stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't need to be cut out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it's? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Afternoon is too long of a word! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- Just say arvo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's two syllables? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's got more than four letters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so I said like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously my American friends were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what time is it in Australia right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like three in the arvo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're like, three in the arvo? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What's an arvo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't say arvo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, three in the afternoon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you understand? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> In the afternoon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you understand? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you understand? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you YouTuber? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's been really funny seeing how, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, when I first joined the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the British accent was praised, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and now it's just memed to shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like everyone's like chews-day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Chews-day innit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You-chube, You-chube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Watah, watah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's 'cause I think
American's only thought that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, the Southern, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, (inaudible) English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The posh Southern accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they realized that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 90% of the UK sounds disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It actually does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad's from Liverpool
and when I go to go there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I hate this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They speak a different
language over there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The more Northern, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna insult the
fucking North now because-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the North, but
some of the accents I hate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some, the more further North you go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the more I'm like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Up into Scotland. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Up to Scotland. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The more I'm like, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know we're speaking the same language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but for some reason I cannot understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what we're saying even though we're both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently speaking English right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember we were
watching a TV show with Aki, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and there was dudes from Yorkshire? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And me and you were having no
problem understanding them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and Aki was like, is there subtitles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't understand what they're saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I showed her
Monty Python's Holy Grail, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she was like, I need
to put subtitles on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I legitimately can't
understand what this-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's good accents though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's 'cause it's an old
movie and the audio is bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, it's got nothing to do with the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can hear it fine! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But one thing I will
never fucking understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure a lot of Americans
will understand this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you say to an American
what is the sexiest accent? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, what is an accent that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want people to whisper into your ear? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason, Australian
accent is always the top. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like what
the fuck are you on about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Australian accents are fucking disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Australian's on bottom three for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you're only
thinking Australian accent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're thinking
of Chris Hemsworth, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course everyone wants Chris Hemsworth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to whisper into their ear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But Chris Hemsworth is the
point 001% of Australians. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - As is every British actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I saw an article that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was the top three are Australian, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> British, and Irish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Scottish is pretty good too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Scottish is pretty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I understand Scottish and Irish? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's kind of cute as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like Scottish and Irish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Scottish and irish are really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really nice, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I hear the majority
of British accents, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and the Australian accent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I grew up in the North, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was surrounded by those accents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's why I get
mocked when I go back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, you're not from here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You definitely don't sound
like the area that you're from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I don't know if that
evolved over the time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you go back to my
very first YouTube video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I sound like someone from
the area that I grew up in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, when I first met you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you had quite a heavy Welsh accent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I wasn't even Welsh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was more Northern, but, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the Welsh accent
sounds like this, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They talk like this and I
never sounded like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but everyone in my
village talked like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you definitely didn't
sound like you do now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I sounded more just like
general Northern English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I've lost my accent quite a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People say, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When I look back at old
video's I'm like, ew. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so strong-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think because you
really iron out your, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you enunciate a lot more? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think it's
just the YouTuber accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where you have to stop mumbling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and start paying attention
to what you're saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because people from all different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> races are gonna be listening to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the word 'literally'? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> In Australia we say litrally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's how we say it-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I can't say litrally anymore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to say literally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And my dad gave me so much shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for it the last time I was home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He was like, what the fuck did you say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You sound like a fucking American, mate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, say litrally
like a true Aussie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, alright. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you for your patriotism, dad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got accused on one of the comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, Connor isn't from Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm from where Connor is,
no one speaks like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it just didn't cross their mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that your accent can evolve. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think there was a study that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> done in Antarctica where they sent, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when the scientists go? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they wanted to see, from
all the European scientists, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what would happen to their accents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over the three month period, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and normally they would
all, for some reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pick up one persons accent the most, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they would generally
start to talk the way did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think that's how it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You can quickly change
your accent if you're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> surrounded by people who sound the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think that's why I've lost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my accent a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I have spent, just from what I do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've spent more time
with the non Aussies-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I spent a lot of time in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And spent a ton of time in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a ton of time around Americans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's words I pick up from, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, British English
and American English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It kind of just becomes
a conglomerate of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of different
languages and accents, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just kind of a mixture
of internet language as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> another one that I'm into so often-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure if I moved back to England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my accent would morph slowly back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> into more of a British accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have noticed that, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I go back to Australia and I talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my high school friends or whatever? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just immediately kick into Australian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I met Rubber Ninja, Ross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, he's an Aussie right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he's been living
in America for so long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that his natural accent
is just American now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember the first
time I met him at AX, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment he heard my accent he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oi yeah, mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just fucking, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He just completely changed to an Aussie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could talk like this the entire time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I reckon more people would be into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that happened to me
when I went back to Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely regained
some of my older accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I didn't like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like my old accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I prefer this one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like the way I speak clearly, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] More concisely, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's more of a voice acting accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's more generalized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it allows me to say words easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before I struggled with words. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So then I'm curious how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like since you guys have
moved to Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, about your lifestyle changes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's 'cause doing YouTube here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel is completely different to doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube anywhere else in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if it's 'cause we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> an agency here that keeps up in check? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm my own worst enemy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if I can be lazy, I will be lazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So having an agency has
really helped me, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just stay responsible, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I don't want to let them down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not that I was letting
myself down anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I doubly don't want to fuck up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Mailin will kill me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also having Japanese
class two times a week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I have to be there by nine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I have to be awake
at 7:30 to get there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which you did this morning by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, which I did this morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which you do every
morning before we record-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do it every morning
before we record the podcast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I basically have no choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but to maintain a healthy lifestyle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Before Coronavirus shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was going gym five times a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so hyped for that
and now I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't want to go to a gym </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and fucking have to run
in a mask or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just not working. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you can't even do it outside anymore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because its like 35 fucking degrees, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and 80% humidity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I've been working out recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, it's just shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not doing a good job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just feels bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you'd be making such good progress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you'd have to
take out two months off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go back to the gym, and you're-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was getting so many gains, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> My arms were getting beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we're all going
to the gym together, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was just, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just sad now that that's the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But overall, other than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's, I don't know what exactly it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's just the different
time zone that's forced me to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't talk to Americans
as much as I used to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to take care of myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I eat better here just because
there's more healthy options. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole thing where you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are people so thin in Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just because the healthier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> food is more readily available, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you walk a shit ton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You really have to search
for crap food here, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't, but there's-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like go to the combini, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and half the shit in there
will make you fat as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like whereas
in the UK it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to pay a lot and
find the healthy food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's equally distributed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like you can
have extremely healthy food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and right next to it is the bad stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not a question of can I get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's do I want to get the healthy food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not like in America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a McDonald's is readily available </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes down the road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to fucking look up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to go deep on Yelp
to find a vegan restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's the TLDR </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of why I think people are thin in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Walk a fuck ton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's way healthier foods, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way more readily available. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a lifestyle
thing where people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're surrounded by people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who have a much healthier lifestyle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of goads you into having </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a more healthy lifestyle as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because everyone else around
you is not eating like shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and not sitting indoors all day, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like when I order a Domino's Pizza, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then Joey's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a salad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, chill out-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You mean last night? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Smashed a Matsuya last night? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, Matsuya's my
favorite place on Earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Connor, do you want to explain Matsuya? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's three beef bowls-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's the big three, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The big three of beef bowls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just general meat and rice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fast food chains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's Matsuya, Yoshinoya, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and, oh my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the third one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Uh, Sukiya? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sukiya, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sukiya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone on the vlog
channels will be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go to Yoshinoya! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't go to Yoshinoya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me tell you why Matsuya's
the best, straight up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> First of all, in Yoshinoya, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to speak to people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to tell the person what you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I like it when the machine takes my order, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I give the man the ticket, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I don't say anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I just get my meal, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I love that, first of all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's an English option as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not that like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything should have an English option. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not here for that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying that
it's nice that I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have to worry when I'm eating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause sometimes in
Japan you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want to order without
having to shit myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan makes it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of places in Japan make it very easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to not have human interaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I appreciate so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which, as a British person? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fan-fucking-tastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What I hate though, also
as a British person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any restaurant in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they don't have a button
that calls the waiter to you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to call them yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so in England the etiquette is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you try to be as quiet as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You look for eye contact, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You look for, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> excuse me, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even the hand, the hand's a risky move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, even the hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're kind of making
a scene there in British. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a lot of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you want the bill? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, ah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's as much as you do
to get a waiter's attention. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> In Japan, you gotta shout out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You gotta shout at the top of your lungs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (shouting in foreign language) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, Korean's are laughing
their ass off right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, ha, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these peasant's don't know how to shout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the worst part is, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and Garnt will go, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll go full volume, like
(shouting in foreign language), </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then silence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Joe will go (whispering
in foreign language), </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they'll just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (muttering) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're coming over at the speed of light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't get that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last week we went to
an Izakaya afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like after we finished recording. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And because it's the Izakaya
that doesn't have the button, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so Connor and Garnt were
just like (groans loudly), </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> with this shit again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like self fulfilling
prophecy the moment you sit down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I know it's okay to shout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> publicly to get their attention, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but my body has been crafted over 20-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's conditioned, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To never, ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ever make any public disturbance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, it's the same
in Australia as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the first couple
of years I lived here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, I never did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always just kind of did this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of eye contact, like nodding scene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they just don't want to make eye contact. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> They do everything to avoid eye contact, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so doing that's impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So every time I have to shout out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I die a little inside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think my life expectancy
goes down by a few months </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I (speaking
in foreign language). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And especially if it fails. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughs quickly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then have you ever had the pity one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I've said it, like
(shouting in foreign language), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they will ignore me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but one of the customers
will have heard me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he'll go like (speaking
in foreign language), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he'll point to me and go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, he wants your attention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] No, I've never had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm white as fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, I'll help the foreigner out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll give him a dub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> But anyway, back to Matsuya, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the best place in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You basically can get a banger of a meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that fills you up to brim for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like, eight bucks maybe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Less if you want to get the cheaper ones? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like even less. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The set I go for? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like you get this, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This grilled ginger pork and rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You get a tater salad, you got a ton-jiro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like miso soup
with extra shit in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's amazing, I fucking love that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so clean-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you can get a regular
beef ball with all of that for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, 600 yen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, for nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want to go ham, you can get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's less than 10 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can double that bitch up as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for an additional two bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like a whole pig? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's amazing, I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time I come in they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shit, Connor's coming in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get the whole pig carcass out, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'll max everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, I want meat and rice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm there, it's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And in Yoshinoya you get these
pathetic little ball sizes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, what am I gonna do-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I like Sukiya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, Yoshinoya and Sukiya are good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think Matsuya's the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's because you don't
order what they specialize in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get the side menu shit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because in terms of actual beef balls, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, udons, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I reckon Sukiya and Yoshinoya
have it better than Matsuya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man.
- Just saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna make a fucking Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fast food tier list here, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be down for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should do a video of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the, you can go Sukiya, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can go to Yoshinoya,
I'll go to Matsuya, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll be like, this is what you get-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just argue which one's the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we'll take each other to each chain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we'll be like,
this is what we're getting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the best one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [All] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember this one time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to this very
local place with Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause this is when we were
staying outside of Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, not outside of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was a bit more in the countryside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So we went in this, we were craving ramen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we were looking for
a local ramen place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we go to this place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously neither of
us can speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or read it too well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so we go to this place and the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> menu is handwritten in Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hell, I love that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've learnt the Kanji, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the numbers, I'm like (inaudible) brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But we have to kind of try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to figure out what everything is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we go, we pick something that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, looks reasonable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because we were looking at the price, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the price was about 1300 yen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is about 13 bucks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forgetting that in Japan, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen is cheap in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's super, super cheap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were ordering something that was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like, 13 bucks when it should have cost-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should be, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven, 800 yen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, when it should be
about seven or 800 yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we forgot that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember we ordered it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the waiter just looks at us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think he was asking are you sure? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, are you sure you want this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You want this one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Two of them, for both of you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should have known that that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just want ramen, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We want it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So he goes back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he says something to the chef, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the chef's eyes just goes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was just like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you serious, you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They get both their keys
out and unlock the safe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Crack the neck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what comes out is they
bring us this extra large ramen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then with it was just
this extra large beef ball. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he brings out one of them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> puts it in front of me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I just think, I've
made a massive mistake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I look at Sydney. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sydney's just staring at this ball, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's coming, that's coming! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sydney's like, we ordered two of those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One each. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause it would be impossible
for one of us to finish this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let alone two of us
finishing both of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And so he brings it over to Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know what the etiquette </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is if you don't finish your food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we fucking tried to
devour as much as we can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't even get through half of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we feel so fucking bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're getting the bill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was the most shameful bill of all time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaking in foreign language). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like, are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you sure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay bitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We didn't even make
a fucking dent in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I have never experienced
that because I would rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> behead myself that leave
food in a Japanese place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why I'm so scared of it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like one time, in Matsuya funnily enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I accidentally ordered two
of the double L sized sets? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Way too much food for one person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's near 4000 calories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it is a mountain of rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know how I actually did this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I should have realized by how much I paid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it came, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wasn't even that hungry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I forced this inside of me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was, when I got home I threw up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But in the restaurant I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> if you can imagine a dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally like if his esophagus was full, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was literally like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like drinking the miso
soup to push it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, give me more water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to push this shit down with water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It was horrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I was gonna die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They must have been looking at me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, at me crying at a Matsuya, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like why is he still eating it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just the most
British thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Would rather throw up
from eating too much food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than feel the shame of
leaving food on the plate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I would rather
throw up in an alleyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> than order way too much, clearly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then have to give them it back, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and be like, throw it away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was it very unhealthy and
extremely questionable? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but sometimes you have
to make a decision in life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I got the respect
from those Matsuya-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I say (speaking
in foreign language), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking meant that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm walking out like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> My bowls stacked on top of each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd never eaten that much food in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you the one
place I don't feel shameful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for leaving food on the plate though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's whenever I go to America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And just witness the food
sizes there for everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had that in fucking Chicago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was at Con+Alt+Delete. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure it's no surprise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Americans that their
food portions are-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had that in Chicago when I ordered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deep dish pizza for the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and because we'd never ordered it, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and most of us never ordered it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just the same as a regular pizza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Seven of us there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, we'll get five deep dish pizzas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I crazy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Does it taste terrible? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It tastes good, but-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes great for the first slice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but one slice is
like eating a whole pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's literally just a whole pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just stacked on top of one slice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had the kind of deep ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not like there where it looks like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, we had the fucking deep dish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically a basin
for the sauce, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a pizza lasagna, that's what is it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But at that point it's like the whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best part of the pizza
is the synergy between-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The synergy? (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The synergy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, the way the bread, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cheese and the sauce
is the perfect amount? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You get the best bite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If there was one too
many of those elements-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a fucking pizza
theologist right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm telling you, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If there's too much sauce,
you got to drink the pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the saucy pizza's though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the extra sauce pizza's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I will admit that deep dish was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could you put a straw
in it and drink it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That shouldn't happen,
that shouldn't be possible-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it goes in layers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize why so many Americans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called pizza's pies until
I had a deep dish pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a fucking pie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a pizza pie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that where it came from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was definitely eating a pie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was shaped like a pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A pizza flavored pie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty much, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I remember as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I went to Texas for the first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we went to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't remember what the
Italian restaurant was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was a big Italian restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And portion sizes in America-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Olive Garden?
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Portion sizes in America
are already big, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in Texas it's hold my
beer levels on fucking food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So we went to this Italian restaurant, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was Misty's birthday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we went to an Italian restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were getting all this food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> normally when you go in an
Italian restaurant anywhere, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right, it's like you order
one bowl of pasta each, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever you want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe share it around or whatever, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In this Italian restaurant it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one dish of pasta can feed an
Ethiopian family for a year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, it is insane, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's too much pasta. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we thought that
was already ridiculous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, we couldn't even finish that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then we wanted to order a cake, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we saw, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they sell tiramisu here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Misty's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want a tiramisu! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And normally when you order cake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at a restaurant it's
like one slice, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, they brought out
the whole fucking cake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It was legitimately this big! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This big and this deep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like 20 bucks.
- What the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was just like, I
think we ordered wrong? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only one tiramisu on the menu, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so it must mean this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just ordering a cake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just like the only option </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of anything is a crate of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I just want a bit of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, maybe it's a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it's like a really fancy tiramisu, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right, because of the price? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I wasn't expecting
fucking grandma to bust </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the fucking
restaurant just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here you go! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes when I'm with
Americans in America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that place is way too expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You get ripped off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, bro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got enough to feed my whole family. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In my head I'm like, mate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't get ripped off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You been to France, bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You get one string of pasta and sauce, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they charge you $20 for that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you like six snails for 20 euros? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> In Europe, you don't
get that for that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's rare, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, LA was super expensive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I always got a shit
ton of food so I was fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember having to learn the hard way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you just never order appetizers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you go to an American restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there's been-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a meal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because why would
you call it appetizers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's as big as the main course? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In every other part of the world, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you order appetizer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have a three course meal sometimes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, if you're feeling frisky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In America you order
one thing off the menu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and that one thing can feed
a fucking family for a week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One thing I could never
fucking believe was the concept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of bottomless fries at
a fast food restaurant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bottomless everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bottomless everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Already, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> free refills was like a whoa concept, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because in Australia there's no fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant that gives you free refills-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, same in all of Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, it's free refills
and bottomless fries? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what does bottomless fries mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just realized the
episode is like British </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Australian people discover America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's up with all of this stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was so used to ordering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a large drink at a cinema, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right, like in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could actually finish it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A large drink in a fucking
American cinema's like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> might as well have just give
you four liters of coke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just blew my mind,
I have another thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I found out in the cinema's in America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can refill your
popcorn in some of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is this allowed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why did I buy the large then
if I can just refill it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's a concept I can
never understand, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You go to any restaurant, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Usually it's free refills, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a drink machine there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's small, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> medium, and large sized cups? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, why would you not just
get the small and refill it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why would you not just get a small cup? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the I asked Aki, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people are just too lazy
to get up to get a refill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm just like, are you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like 20 cents extra, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you really that lazy
that you'll just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I'll pay a little bit
extra so I can sit for longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All Americans are watching this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you agree with the
points that we're making? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you frustrated that we don't-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I've heard
from another American, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've heard from multiple Americans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't get buttered popcorn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think it tastes good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't eat while
I go to the cinemas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I have to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I maybe get like packet
of candy or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I never get popcorn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need popcorn when I go to the cinema, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or I don't want to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm the guy who never actively
goes out and buys popcorn, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but when someone offers it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me just chow down this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah!
- Oh dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my head it's like it's not the cinema </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> experience unless I get popcorn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's probably because they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conditioned me to think that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you watch a movie at home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and do you have to popcorn
when you're having it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So why do you have to
have it in the cinemas? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I'm going
there, it's an experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to have the popcorn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I don't need it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe I've just been
conditioned from Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because popcorn in Australian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> cinemas was stupidly expensive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And as a high school student it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't afford-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In high school I couldn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think 'cause maybe my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> never ever wanted to buy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you'd almost be
paying a fucking mortgage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to get the popcorn and drink set. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like 10 pounds in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> nearly like, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 14 dollars? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was something like
that in Australia as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is way more
than in America, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a large popcorn in
Australian cinemas usually cost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than the actual ticket
to go watch the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it did in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just go down to
the fucking supermarket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> below and just sneak shit in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so much cheaper-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, it just
doesn't taste as good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When you bring your own shit in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just tastes kind of flat, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry, we peasants won't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You peasants wouldn't get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a wealthy 1800's
Victorian lord of the land, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I must say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But no, in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> did you ever go to an American cinema? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I did-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where they would have, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I went to a cinema in Wisconsin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and they would just have
these butter machines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you could just basically-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you could press it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so confused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Press, pour as much butter
as you can on the popcorn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In Vegas, we had one that had butter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also lard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, ew-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lard?
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like pure fat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mailin, is this a thing in your country? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they put-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Mailin] I've never seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was in Vegas, in another state. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you just
want to put lard on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it makes it extra greasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Americans, is this true? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Mailin] No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, it is!
- Is this true? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Mailin] In Vegas? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw it in another state too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think it's common
because I only saw it very, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very rarely? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it was some kind of lardy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> fatty substance that was
sitting next to the butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, is butter
not fat enough for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you need extra fat and
extra grease on your popcorn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, I remember I picked it up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, ew, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> my hands are oily? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My hands shouldn't
be oily, it's popcorn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like touching the
back of an oven, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like the deep fried oil shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I ruined my whole popcorn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I put that shit on 'cause
everyone was doing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was like, alright, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it must taste good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's fucking horrible as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't put that shit on your lap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because then the grease starts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to seep through the bottom of the bucket-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't put that much on, luckily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Mailin] (inaudible) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Double it like this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - While we're ranting
about American things? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> American cheese sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're gonna lose all our subs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, what is American spray-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ew! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is American spray cheese? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something that I don't
understand about America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's the spray cheese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that American's apparently love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always thought the spray cheese shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like shit
you'd see in the movies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I went to Walmart
for the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I saw it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, it can't be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're always like, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it tastes amazing on Cheez-its. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what they always say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, no, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it should never be in a can. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Or when they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember I was at a thing
at someone's house in America, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like, do
you want a grilled cheese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd love a grilled cheese! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they gave it to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, you put
the plastic shit on it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You put the cheese singles, didn't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that's the cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, that's not cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Look on the back, it's 4% cheese maximum! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guarantee it, that's not cheese! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just because it says cheese flavoring, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't mean it's cheese! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I went to the
supermarket and there was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like, a kilogram of cheddar
for $2 or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have proper cheese, why not use it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Put it on your nachos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's too, I'm too lazy to cut it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think they told me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, get a knife? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you mean too lazy to cut it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Buy utensils. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I literally would cut that shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I would grab the block out of the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just peel the wrapper, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just cut it like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a normal human being. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are you making this difficult? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> America explain, explain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I asked one of my American </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> friends when I saw it at the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what do you put this on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what does this thing-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Burgers, burgers is
the only thing that I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, I'll let you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, what is this-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It didn't even touch my burger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not gonna touch my burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want it but
I'll take it on a burger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I won't even take it on a burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but a Denny's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all of those-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never get any cheesy at Denny's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or McDonald's in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't give a shit on burgers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Burgers is fine, I'm used to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I was like, what do
you put this spray cheese on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we don't put it on anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we just go like this
and put it in our mouth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, you are an absolute monkey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is what, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know we get a lot of
comments that were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why does Connor think Americans
are like another species? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because you are! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so many things, to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that as a British person
I'm just so baffled by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when American's explain it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just so many things
where I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna offend so many
people with this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - America is another plant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I love American's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's just general life
stuff that's just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time I go to America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, this is another planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't relate to these people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a side note, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's also so many fucking
things I love about America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, of course-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There definitely are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not gonna be like I'm
never gonna go back to America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course I love America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I've never met
friendlier people than in America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I love the UK, it's my home, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but damn, are people
fucking depressed there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, I get the best
elevator experience in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No exactly! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You feel so fucking happy and
right talking to Americans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe they're onto something here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we clown on their food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but damn, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some places, they give you
some fucking amazing food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh dude, I'll clown on their food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if someone was like, you
want a philly cheesesteak? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna go, hell yeah I
want a philly cheesesteak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You want to go Chick-fil-A? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course I do! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, Five Guys?
Of course I do-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Five Guys, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking love Five Guys.
- We all love Five Guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Destroying my body has
never felt so fucking good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> until I discovered Five Guys, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The best way to experience
Five Guys is at 3AM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're absolutely hammered from the booze, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, I need
something in my stomach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, Five Guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go to Five Guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get the greasiest fucking burger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and while you're eating it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like constant-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the Cajun fries, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the Cajun fries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cajun fries as well,
it's the Cajun fries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also the burger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just the combination of those two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is the best fucking thing in the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I've never experienced life and death </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the same time while eating something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How to experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every bite I take I'm like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> God, I'm so glad I'm alive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But then the moment it
goes down my esophagus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to die right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy shit! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I really want to do a
road trip around the US, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it seems like there's
so many diverse cultures, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and cool shit they get up too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I go to a new state, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always try to go to a fast food chain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's specific to that state. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because it's so different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know you guys don't like In-N-Out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I fucking love In-N-Out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not that I don't like it in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think it's a bit overrated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never had In-N-Out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a bit over hyped, but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just, like it's good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not something
to froth over, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I fucking love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever I go to LA,
and if Evan picks me up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Evan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's go In-N-Out right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to go In-N-Out right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what's a really
good burger chain in Texas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They have this burger
chain called Whataburger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I've heard about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, they have it
in California as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (inaudible) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it was originally in Texas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Whataburger is fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the spicy sauce that
they have is so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like I feel like I'm dying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but every single day I feel so happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with the food I've eaten in America? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then I guess that would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wear off if I lived there everyday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so, yeah.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel so happy in the US, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the food's amazing,
everyone's so kind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The hotels are so spacious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude, in London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you pay like $200 for a closet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you're lucky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're lucky, you might
have your own toilet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The hotel game in
England is just weak, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the shittest thing on Earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the business
hotels here, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, would you
like a bed and a hallway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> $200 dollars please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you want a semi-competent
hotel in London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta pay like 300 pounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or maybe 200 pounds if you
get lucky and find a good one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> every single hotel I've been too, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except I've never been to a motel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I don't fuck with those, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause that's where people die in films. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had an amazing hotel experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's where fugitives hide out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, every single thing
that's bad happens near a motel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so I've just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my brain has been taught
don't go to a motel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Calling a motel a
hotel is the equivalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of calling McDonald's a restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, (groans quickly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I was gonna
get a motel for my first AX, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the reviews were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone was shot outside my room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was cockroaches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Two stars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, two stars? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How many people had to
die for it to be one star? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, that was what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only reason why it's a two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> star is because I didn't die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cockroaches didn't eat
me alive in my sleep, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I just feel like parts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of LA just feel like another world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a war zone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially some of downtown LA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember the first morning
I woke up in a hotel in LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was one of those alarm
clocks where the radio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starts to play the
moment the sun comes up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And all I heard was, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> its a lovely morning here in Los Angeles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Three people got shot last night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have a good day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird.
- Just like, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird because when you listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the radio you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoa, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> GTA was super accurate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like whoa, this sounds exactly like GTA </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I listen to the radio in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> After he said 'have a good day', </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just waiting for the title </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> screen music to just start playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember my first day in LA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The first time I went to
LA was for Anime Expo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember we were staying in
this Air BnB in downtown LA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember the first day we went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to get a taxi to the convention center, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me and Sydney were just
waiting for our Uber outside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then this homeless guy just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> tries to start talking about this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tries to start talking to us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know what it
is about homeless guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not just in LA, but just in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They speak another language. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you can't understand
what they're saying-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - They speak in tongues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this what English sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to non English speaking people? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the kind of
language that they speak. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (mumbling) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sorry, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're going off somewhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And so he walks off about
five meters past us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whips his dick out,
and just starts peeing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is going on here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - America.
- What is happening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I kind of had a similar experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time I went to New York, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and (laughs quickly), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I was just walking down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was Fourth Street or somewhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one of the big Manhattan roads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just walking around being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, cool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like every gangster movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, this scenery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then this woman just
taps me on the soldier, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, yes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can I help you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did you know that Jesus
reincarnated in Korea in the 1940's? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, go on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love it when those people talk to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I just let her talk,
and she was just going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like I didn't even know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because she sounded so sophisticated, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but the shit that was coming
out of her mouth was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, you've done a lot of drugs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was just really enthralled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, wow, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is this like a normal occurrence here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd never get bored here if this happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, I had
something like that in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like four months ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was walking, I had my headphones on, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was going to the gym. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I clearly looked like I was
gonna go exercise, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was dressed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I heard someone
saying hello, hello! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my brain clicked and I'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no one would say hello normally? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> There's these three
seventy year old women. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they're like, are you English? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you English? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's up, what can I do for you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they start showing me papers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like poorly
translated English that's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, some monk died or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like, let's go pray, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's go pray. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, I'm going gym? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta go get my gains! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're like, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Come to the park near us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come to the park, we'll go and pray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll go and pray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They were really nice about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like, bro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no, I said I'm going to the gym. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me go to the gym. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're like, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, we must play now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We must pray now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they were like,
what do you do for work? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do voice acting shit, I do YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go pray. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go pray, let's go pray. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they just kept
asking me weird questions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and every single time I'd say anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's go pray, let's go pray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, no-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's how cults start. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they're like four foot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like get away from me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Knock them over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back off, peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to the gym, I
won't hear any of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I have the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was something about
a war lord or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he died for
Mount Fuji and some shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We live nowhere near Mount Fuji? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I was so confused. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, why do you want me to pray? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone will be praying in this park. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, everyone
will be praying there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We will help you pray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who's everybody? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was so confused it was Japan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just never experienced
anything like this in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People don't approach you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I experienced shit
like that in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or Shibuya, late at night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was right outside my house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was really worried that
they knew where I lived. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was literally right outside my door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, where do you live? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Show us where you live? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They kept asking me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> As the one foreigner in the area as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just instantly recognizable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause there's no
foreigners where I live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they were like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where do you live, where do you live? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm thinking my
house is right behind me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, over there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I'm over there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Over there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they kept asking me to pray! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, leave me alone! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I kept walking away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they kept following me to the fucking gym. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went in the gym and
they finally left me alone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they obviously couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> get in 'cause you need a card. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if they just
whipped out the gym card-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, let's pray! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As you're doing it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's pray, let's pray-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll pray if you spot me, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am genuinely creeped out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I was worried that
when I went in the gym </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they were gonna stay
there until I was done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, why me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it 'cause I'm White? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, leave me alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because you're
finally the minority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What did I do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Leave me alone, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was way creepier than any LA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty creepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The LA stuff's pretty creepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just 'cause I'm so, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as someone from England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and basically, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> all of Europe and also Asia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's pretty safe to walk around here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Anywhere you try, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you need to go home
or walk to a new bar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just walk there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In America, if you go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can be at the nicest bar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and one block away you
can get shot or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you just take a wrong turn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, I was so scared walking
in San Francisco at 1AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm texting my friends being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can have my stuff, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Take my YouTube channel, it's all over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's the password. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's 1AM in San Fran, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, and I remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was AX two years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where we had a hotel suite
and we also had an Air BnB, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was only like five minutes
walk away from each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your Air BnB was so scary! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was, wasn't it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a fucking great Air BnB. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like the chillest Air BnB. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had a fucking pool
table and everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it just seemed in the dodgiest area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was where the homeless
guy thing happened with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we were gonna go to your
Air BnB for a house party, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you gave me the coordinates. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just down the road. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we just start walking,
and then it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's telling me to turn
into this alleyway? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was like, nah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt's just fucking with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just gets darker, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and darker, and darker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember I invited John, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Super Eyepatch Wolf, to the party as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I gave him the general area, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was having trouble finding it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember trying
to run out to get him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go come to the party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was down the road, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so all he saw was some guy coming out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this dark alleyway shouting John, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> John, John! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And he just fucking turns round, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just walks around the corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I can't imagine
what he was thinking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm out of here, I'm out of here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Na, na. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Not today, not today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was where we had the homeless guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I pushed over a homeless guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that sounds terrible-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah, you
fought a homeless guy! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't fight him, I
just pushed him over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This sounds terrible, by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor's just going around
pushing over homeless people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was like 3AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was walking to the
hotel from the Air BnB, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was already sketchy
as fuck, this area-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there was a woman crying
on the floor in a corner, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this guy with no
shirt on, just shorts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like, tattoos all over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like five foot, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like four foot ten. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, he was small as fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was malnourished, he had no teeth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was just screaming at this girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like, threatening her in the corner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, well shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to say something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in my awkward British self, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, hey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um, could you stop doing that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I think she doesn't
like it is what I said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, who the
fuck you think you are man? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who the fuck you think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, talking to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I think he was Hispanic or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he was squaring up to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just leave her alone, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> She's clearly not wanting to talk to you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I say talk, he was
just screeching at her. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was on the floor crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so when he comes
over to me, she runs off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great, she's gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She's safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, from what I
can remember at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was little drunk, a bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he is this close to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> shouting in my face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What's gonna happen here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just gonna walk away now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so he grabs something from his pocket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what he's gonna do, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I just push him over and run away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what this guy's gonna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm scared as fuck, I don't
know what's happening-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would not have the balls to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, can you stop please? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like no one else around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and this girl was crying her eyes out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hey, hey man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Could you stop it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he got really angry at me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, fuck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I thought he was
gonna hit me or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was like, fuck it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and pushed him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I saw someone reaching
for their pocket like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd do exactly-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause didn't swing at me or anything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he was going for his pocket, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally fucking sprinted away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I ran around the corner, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, (panting), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in my hotel like (panting). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and to put this in perspective, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our Air BnB was like five minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> away from the Intercontinental, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or some very famous hotel chain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So you just don't get
something like this here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or like, in Europe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So we are just not used to this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you have to literally drive
five minutes down the road. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Not even five minutes down the road, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was a five minute walk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just because this is the shit
that can happen in between. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I learned my lesson at that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Just probably not walking around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't intervene if you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> willing to push someone over I guess? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't feel great
about pushing him over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he was way smaller than me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you never know if he was gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, just pull out a gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The guy clearly was on something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> He was out of it, like spouting nonsense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, he wasn't talking English. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, he was trying to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I don't know what he was on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Terrifying.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway, anything you want to talk about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or is that where we should end today? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not trying to
demonize homeless people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think most of them are
super chill and really nice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just had those one or two interactions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that scared the fuck out of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just want to make that out
there before people shit on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In case there are any
homeless people watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (an) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's cool with you guys, it's alright. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also any Americans as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We say all this shit about
Americans and America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we're okay with you guys, alright? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is just the culture
shock that we get-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever we visit
there for the first time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys are cool, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love you, America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're very entertaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - Something always happens. </SPEAKER_03>
