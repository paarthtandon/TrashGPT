<SPEAKER_03> i was like i was honestly like a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit salty okay i was i was a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> salty not because obviously getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> covered sucks right yeah but uh i was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> little bit salty because before i got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> covered i hardly ever went out at all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right i didn't go up because i spent all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> marathoning all like all the great anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of 2021 to make my best of anime 2021 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> video so i was just like inside just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching watching all the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching all this anime didn't go out i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> went out aside from trash chase </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> recordings i went out once and the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time i went out was with these boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was that was literally the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time i went out in the past two weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prior to me catching kobe yeah right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think i figured it out you think you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> figured it out i know why you got it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> okay okay i think the air when you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> six foot is high enough the covey was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> traveling in the six foot sphere oh i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> under the sun under the six foot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we couldn't breathe it in we couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breathe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the actual </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> scientific that we're not scientists do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not take over yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> covert is the height equalizer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we needed this yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> needed six foot or something yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i i remember i remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when obviously when i say positive i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> remember messaging these boys being like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> boys i gotta be honest you should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably be careful because uh i'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna lie the only time i've been out in </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> trash taste which i'm also with the boys </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> i kind of knew that something was coming </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> about to get ill and uh and so like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't have a fever but like my body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started to feel like a little bit groggy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit fatigued now i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've felt this before i've felt this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> before i've gotten like the flu or that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like illness where like conks me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out for a few days so i'm like honey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't be alarmed but i think i might be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old and then i went to sleep woke up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had a pretty high fever for me at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least like i remember when we did our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second vaccination i had like a fever of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 38 degrees celsius i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what that is in fahrenheit but uh on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that first day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on that it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on that first day on that first day i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> started off with a 38 degree fever so i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like okay i definitely got a fever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh once you get tested and then by the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> time night time came around that fever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had gone up to 40 degrees [ __ ] which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dangerous which is dangerous and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was like googling right i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like googling when when should i like go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the hospital why spoiler he lived </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what is that what's the boiling point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because normally i normally when i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the flu or something i go up to like 39 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like even then i'm that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty really bad that's a really bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> call so i was like it was like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember measuring myself getting to 40 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then i remember googling how high </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> does your fever need to be to consider </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the hospital and i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> googling it and they said after around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 41 degrees you should consider going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the hospital right and me you already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drenched in sweat i start sweating even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more because i'm just like what do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think what can i do there if you have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fever it's like oh here's a bed lie down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what can they what can they do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> placebo where like because you're in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> hospital you're gonna get better maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah maybe they're like oh he's an iv </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they give you like more stronger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe they give you more stronger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like all i was going to say is i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i feel like it is a bit of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> placebo but also in case your symptoms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do get majorly worse there is someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there to put you under intensive care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah yeah just in case but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely terrified of hospitals it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the only thing i'm scared of no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> same i don't really i don't know anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who goes to the hospital goes yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> some people don't mind they're like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever but i'm like i will literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> do anything not to go to the hospital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah which probably means that at some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> point i'm probably gonna come down with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something and i should probably go and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get it checked out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because i'm i'm so stupid that i'll be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like no i'd rather not because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i get ill right i just never ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> assume i should go to hospital yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just think i should just write it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you hear stories about how people die </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because i feel like a lot of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is part of i mean i i think a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is part of growing up in england as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well because i think there was there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely a difference in mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when it comes to illness especially when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i started started you know dating sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing how she handled getting ill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versus how i handled getting ill because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like if i have a high fever i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like just just take some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> paracetamol ride it out whatever just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like start putting in bed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sweat it out sweat it out you know uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like because in england if you go to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the doctor by the time you book an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> appointment and you get the chance to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> see the gp um you it's like the fever is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> already gone right the fever's already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gone you're either better or dead yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so so it's either you're bad enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to go to the hospital yeah or you just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't go to the doctor at all yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like with sydney because luckily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney had health insurance when she was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in uh when she was growing up in america </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stop breaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> showing sydney's privilege right here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah she had health insurance okay wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> health insurance but uh uh so she would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like you know if she just got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slightly old just go see the doctor just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make sure just just in case you use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that health insurance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use that health insurance because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can just go see yourself so why would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you not go see a doctor me being me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dying in bed being like i don't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney i don't need to see a doctor i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't see a doctor why would i need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see a doctor it's only like a 40 degree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fever google says i need to be 41 to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see your doctor sydney come on come on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm safe i'm saying i ain't a [ __ ] boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> ain't a [ __ ] boy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's true though in japan people like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that as well i think yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> people they're like i've got a headache </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm going to the clinic what what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> no no no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know just sleep it off i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know maybe i'm being too harsh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like but then do you find that sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like i don't know if this is a me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> thing but sometimes i'm getting sick i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like no yeah stop body stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> stop right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> don't do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> develop men i think i like have i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if this is just like me being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> stupid but i just completely ignore it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i'm like about to get sick i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we are not sick we will continue with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> our day like everything is normal that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sounds like copium to the max </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes i feel like it works though i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know it's cause i don't know if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is pure luck or it's it's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> my own stupidity like sometimes i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ill i feel like the illness coming and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then in my mind i feel like this is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a deciding point in my head i'm like am </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i going to resign myself to being ill or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> am i going to be like no i'm not ill i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to continue on i'm going to eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> healthy i'm going to do it this sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like some joe rogan-esque [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> saying right now it's not i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like for small illnesses obviously if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got some kind of horrible illness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like yeah no the flu is controlled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the government of mind power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> well you know it's like it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> placebo effect right how like this could </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> be complete like nonsense but we are not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> medical professionals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's like a tiny illness right it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a sore throat you know something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that yeah sometimes i feel like how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> much of your like mental </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mental willpower can affect it because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you hear about you know uh the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> placebo effect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> affecting how you can perform in certain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> situations yeah yeah i'm wondering like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> how much can that affect your your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> likeliness to get sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i do feel like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh okay this is going to be complete </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> speculation this is all anecdotal yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any medical professional is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely anecdotal but i do feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your mentality and your willingness to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't know accept something it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does i think i feel like it does play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like some kind of subconscious effect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right because you you hear like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you hear about stories about people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know have like a deadly illness and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they are have like the will to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fight it you know they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know some people are able to fight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through the illness and some people are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more inclined to give in you know yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so i i do feel based on zero </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> zero [ __ ] scientific proof and just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> based on total anecdotal evidence that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is some kind of effect that your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mentality has towards illnesses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes sometimes not every time you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> it's pretty [ __ ] high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's to me to me it was manageable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until like i remember like sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting at my pc uh on the first day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the symptoms started you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started rolling in obviously at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time i didn't get any of the test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> results so i had no it could have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a cold for all i knew and i was i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember sitting down at the computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to work and it was just i as the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> day went on i was like no body don't do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> this don't know you're not ill you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what come on buddy you can power through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> this and i remember it was around like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five o'clock where i was like staring at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the script and i was like trying to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] done and i just like it just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no words would come out because i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just too tired i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i'm actually [ __ ] ill let's let </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me take some [ __ ] medicine let me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take my temperature again and let me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like do do the [ __ ] just imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're sitting at your computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Applause] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> illness is just a perception man it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> perception it's same with like i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know like painkillers and stuff like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that i have friends who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will you know they'll take a painkiller </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment they even get a slight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> headache yeah but i'm always like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> bored because then they i s the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people like this is completely anecdotal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're just like oh yeah well i i it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't work as well anymore because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> take it too often and i'm like well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's scary yeah i'm just not gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take it unless unless i'm really really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in pain and then i'll be like alright </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> fine because then what happens if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know get like say like a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive headache or you know worse still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like where it's like oh god if you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have pain medicine you're just you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] you might think yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might pass out whatever i always worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about stuff like that yeah yeah i mean i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think the only scary thing for me uh was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'd never gotten covered before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like normally when i get an illness i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been ill enough times to know how my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> body deals with it right you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay i'm gonna be out for x amount of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> days i need to do this like i've got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this down to a science right you know i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i you know i wake up with you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um like what's what's the what's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> throat itis uh tom slice or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know which has happened a few times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like okay i'm gonna be calming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out for two days i'm not gonna be able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to speak for like three four days and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then afterwards i'll be completely fine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right but when i tested positive i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like [ __ ] i've never i've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> done this before so this is all new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> territory for me man like how's my body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna react with i've got asthma is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna play an effect i'm just like i it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't like this i didn't have a bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time it was more of just like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unknown that uh that scared me the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was something completely new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that i had never experienced before so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had no prior knowledge about how i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should best deal with it or how my body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was going to deal with it luckily it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fine second thing that i kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> myself over was the uh everyone's saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you might lose your sense of taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like you know what i i think uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i'd rather go to hospital than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lose my sense of taste honestly what do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you mean with the bread take you surely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> do i think a lot of people argue that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think you have any taste buds to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you you know like the first thing that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> did when i tested positive was obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i needed to inform male 1 to like inform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> geeks plus and everything in the office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that i tested positive and the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing she messages me about is oh uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've heard that uh covered might like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change your taste buds so maybe you'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be able to taste bread now i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] you melon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> were you did you were you hungry at all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did you have an appetite when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like exactly the same okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like here's the thing i hate about being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] ill right is that it's like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't lose my sense of taste but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like effect to your taste that you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with any illness which just for some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason everything just tastes [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything just tastes bland man i get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> super hungry when i get sick yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember like so weird that's because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember when you got ill like the few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weeks before when you got like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tonsillitis yeah you just ate a [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to me like i i can't eat at all i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean when i'm ill i just i just don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> assuming my stomach is okay and like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have any other illness i'll just eat a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> lot i don't know why for me when i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sick like just the smell of food is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that one time food poisoning i got food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> poisoning this one time and then the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> next day while i was still dying i got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so hungry i felt like mcdonald's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i ordered like a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mcdonald's and i ate all of it yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weirdly i felt a lot better i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why i feel like i'm the only person on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> earth who binged mcdonald's and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt better yeah yeah because usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing that gives you food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning yeah that's exactly right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think mcdonald's after having food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> poisoning it's a bold choice it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really weird you're like really doubling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> down it was okay actually the one time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> do regret doing this one time i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really sick again i think with food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> poisoning the next day i know everyone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna laugh i decided to get indian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> curry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was actually a mistake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why would you do that i was really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> craving like butter curry i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i i crave a lot of good food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when i'm ill as well but i'm like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i've had it enough times that you regret </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it immediately yeah you take the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> bite that was the only time i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> regretted it other times i've gotten it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i feel better i don't know if it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like in my mind i'm like yeah this maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> my body's like oh [ __ ] we got another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem to deal with let's deal with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that and then everything just gets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> better yeah i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's low [ __ ] really your brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works one step at a time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know it's all it's all weird i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like i no one really understands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their body we're all just guessing we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all just doing we're like we're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're like uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plague doctors trying to figure out our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing with our own weird rituals i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we all just have a thing that we feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> comfortable with and somehow it works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've sorted it we've done we've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ill enough times to know kind of how our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> body reacts to certain things and to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deal with certain things everyone bodies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is different yeah i'll sit there and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like laugh at all these plague doctors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the 18th century and then i'll just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like i'm gonna will power my disease </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> away and so i'm like it's only really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have we changed at all i don't think so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i think we've just gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> smarter wow you know i'll fix my sore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> stomach mcdonald's dude exactly that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> what i'm saying wait but like before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> covert like how often did you guys get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sick like per year once a year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> food poisonings i feel like food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> poisoning to me seems to get food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> poisoning a lot food poisoning to me i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> don't count us getting like sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that is illness that is illness hit me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up because it's like it's like uh if if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i poisoned god you wouldn't be like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> god god got sick you're like god was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> poisoned right it's a different kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vibe it's just sickness you know what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's not like you treat it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got food poisoning yeah you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] you're [ __ ] just deal with it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know what food poisoning is yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's not like someone slipped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> cyanide into your mouth no i know i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like it's like it's not caused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> by like a natural cause of like sickness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or a bacteria or virus it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> something went wrong no it is it is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it is i know i know but it's not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got it by accident or something you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know what i mean like you stumble across </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it it's like something had to go wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for it to be there no i think it's by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accident right yeah no no no no you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't know something's wrong with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> food unless you try it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i know right that's what i'm saying like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't count that as like the natural </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quota of getting sick because like let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> say you undercooked chicken and there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> salmonella in it that's just like that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] you're done yeah but that's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fault of the person who cooked the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chick under cookie chicken that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fault of the salmonella that's where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cook the chicken which is the disease </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that comes right right yeah but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you would ever come across </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> naturally right that's not something you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would normally come across like let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> say what do you mean by come across like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just like on the street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> something like carried like gaunt is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like carrying like a normal i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a cold or whatever right it's different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> category in my mind i don't know well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like not every raw piece of chicken has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> salmonella </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is a chance that if you have a raw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of chicken and it's not cooked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then the salmonella or the batter so we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have steps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in the same way that if you uh if you go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> outside and someone has covered or the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> flu or something and you stand next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> them and they cough and then you inhale </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a chance particles then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have the chance of getting it it's right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my mind i should put it differently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because food poisoning is normally just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> due to the lack of like somebody [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right you mean lack of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lack of like under cooking yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> undercooking and stuff like that or bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad stuff not all the time though just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes they'll just be like a road </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like e coli and [ __ ] yeah that's that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's a big [ __ ] up sometimes it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a matter of like oh you know there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a piece of food there and just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know unfortunately just a rogue you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disease or virus just happened to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] stumble upon oh i mean you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> inhale it's different though right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because then we are you saying that food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning is more preventable yeah way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> more preventable well that's why you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> be like your restaurant can be shut down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you keep giving people food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah it's the majority of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like food poisoning is due to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> somebody [ __ ] up in the in the chain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of pro like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so basically the the most time to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ill is uh when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone has [ __ ] up and given you food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> poisoning yeah or you [ __ ] up and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> giving yourself mainly me i look at it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like ah [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mentality now it's not an illness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know it's just different in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know about you i count food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> poisoning as an illness i do count food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boys but then again i've gotten i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get sick often but i think i've only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever gotten food poisoning maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> twice in my life i didn't get it much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> till i came to japan i've had it many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> times in japan weirdly really yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> four i've never gotten food poisoning in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japan yeah i've never gotten food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poisoning in japan i've got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the worst food poisoning i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotten was in china um and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes in thailand as well i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i got really bad food poisoning in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the philippines yeah i think you know um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but i think food poisoning in southeast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asia is just like part of the experience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i never knew you could get food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> poisoning from a mango but i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely got it from a mango like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] [ __ ] me up dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i swear to god every time sydney has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oysters she gets like [ __ ] food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poisoning and every [ __ ] time she's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe this time i won't maybe this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time maybe like i hear like you hear you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that every now and then there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like there's those foods that's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah food poisoning central right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oysters being one of them yeah that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> poor storage i've never gotten it from </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> no everywhere really yeah i had it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the us australia everywhere and i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> never gotten it that's a gamble in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uk really yeah it's very much a gambling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> uk and i think a lot of places in the us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> as well because it depends how well they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> store it or how fresh it is human error </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> scene this is why it's why don't you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> count the same in my head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if somebody sneezes at me in public i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that can't be helped you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever but if somebody if somebody </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> forgot to [ __ ] freeze a piece of fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then served it to me someone [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and made me sick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how is someone sneezing on you not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> human error well no you like let's say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're in a plane right someone four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> suits behind you sneezes whatever they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't they didn't react quick enough i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like that's not that's they can't i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can't possibly react i could i couldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then go to like court and be like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> person sneezed on the plane behind me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and didn't cover up their face you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like it's not you can't hold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone accountable whereas like let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say somebody just didn't store a piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of fish properly that's like negligence </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on their part and then they served it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i get that that's the why i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> treat it the same but i don't treat it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same either but it's still an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> illness yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> regardless </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like because it's like not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a way to i i don't that's like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you count cancer as an illness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then you don't get cancer from eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but what i'm saying is it's you treat it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely differently but it's still an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> illness right yeah but like that's true </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can just get right that's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different because that's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that that most the time lung cancer yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah what if like you you smoke enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's on you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and then in that case i wouldn't build </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> illness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know stuff like that it's like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only raises your chances right where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like if somebody just gives you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flat out a completely like [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of fish or meat that's been stored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in properly you're gonna get sick 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right whereas like you there are people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have been chained smoking from my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> age 10 to 100 who don't get it right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's complete luck on that part but with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the with the with the storage food and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all that that's like all right somebody </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up you know what i mean that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> categorically someone just [ __ ] up and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they gave it to you and poisoned you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what it is it's different to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting an illness it's totally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doctors in the comments are cracking up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right now i have this conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i actually want to know what people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think about this i feel like i'm not the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only one who thinks this way towards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like food poisoning this is not a weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thing i mean i i just i it's just you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting ill i'll just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> say like if you ask me how often do i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> get ill i wouldn't count that because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's got nothing to do with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> an illness no it's not you're literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sick if if i were to just like make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> myself vomit would you say like i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gotten an illness no well then why would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> food poisoning count towards that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's a literal disease well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's got nothing no comment to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how often you get ill that's how often </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you eat bad [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's entirely different i mean it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all depends on your environment right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously if you know if if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in an environment where a lot of you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know where like a lot of people are ill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're going through a wave of illness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're more likely to get ill in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way if you live in an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> environment where people are you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where people are less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> careful with their food preparation then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're more likely to get ill you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's right that is the thing if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to southeast asia or you know a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of places where the food standards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't as high no like it's true it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> true it's true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm i'm i'm not i'm not throwing shade </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just saying facts here okay guys i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saying faxing you know you go to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] street vendor on the street </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like how was how is this me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prepared where did this me come from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't [ __ ] know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you from the back of my truck yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly right exactly you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it's it's all it's it's all risk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all risk at the end of the day you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you can eat raw chicken in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's still and apparently here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's more safer because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh because you know food standards here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan are higher i don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true that is how not true it is but at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same time you're still taking a risk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what if your stomach's just weak well no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean if the restaurant just gives me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like poorly stored sausage i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's their fault you know that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not that's why because the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing i learned from when i was in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> philippines is that like yeah the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standards are a lot lower than normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but people don't get sick because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just naturally have more of like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> resistant stomach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right from living there always yeah i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> say that's true actually not with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> everything though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not with everything not with everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but with a lot of things that visitors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to those countries would immediately get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> sick oh yeah i wouldn't say of a weak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> stomach i normally don't really have any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> problem with like gross foods or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something that's a little off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i mean there are times where i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> eaten something and then i've gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really sick and i was like why did i eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that well what what do you what do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> count as food poisoning then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like okay you okay you you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to like you go to a country give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> me an example like throw things at me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'll be like food poisoning or not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> okay you go you go to a country right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you taste something that your body has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never like tasted before it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> totally new cuisine and your body's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh that's not food poisoning i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't like this and then you get like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] for like five days no that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not food poisoning [ __ ] isn't the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> poisoning yeah yeah if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it comes back up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's food poisoning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so to me it's like you need to have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know your body is literally you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physically reacting in some way where it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gives you like a fever or a headache or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> vomiting you know where i never get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normal i never get anything like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from eating food but when i when i do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eat like i can normally remember what it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was that gave me it because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i very much felt rough immediately after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eating yeah because i count food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> poisoning as i am conked out yeah in bed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've got a fever because that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally like a bacterial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> infection </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i think if it makes you feel a little </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> queasy and it gives you the [ __ ] no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not that's just you do have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> weak stomach for that yeah but i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're if you're throwing up you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you have a fever yeah you you have food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning that's what i would yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> then like i wouldn't in my mind if that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happens to me let's say i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you get that once a year oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lately it's been more it's been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what two three [ __ ] i've only had that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like a few times in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i order a lot of food right i never cook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> myself so yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know i think it happens a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> lot more also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i'm saying i think it's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's just you no it's not it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not the one cooking i think you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a weak stomach no no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's happened where it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just been me who gets sick from the food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like other people have gotten sick or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with me right right so maybe they have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> weak stomachs too no that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that is not a good defense your honor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why did you give people a cold like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's got wicked stomachs in it somebody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> started it they didn't get good but you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> call it no no no that's not how it works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i out of the last three times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i got food poisoning two times it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sausage and i can distinctly remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> eating the sausage and being like hmm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> really pink really really pink and i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think it's okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i'll eat it and then i regretted it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i learned that and the other bag was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the other one was from a a bag of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flaming hot cheetos that it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> four months off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well well that again sounds like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's mine right but when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay let's say i i'm an idiot and i eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a four-month-old bag of flamin hot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cheetos right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to me if i start throwing up that in no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way in my mind is in the same category </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as like let's say i got a i got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tonsillitis or something because this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this is me being a [ __ ] idiot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then i immediately got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> consequences for it right the only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference is like let's say i got to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurant is that i didn't cook it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somebody's still [ __ ] up right let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say the sausage was awful like so in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> head it's not in the same category as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting like a an infection from just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know where the [ __ ] i got it from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because it's like somebody [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> up with the flaming hot cheetos i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> up i'm massively [ __ ] up yeah all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right here's the thing okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you go to a convention all right all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right you go to a convention yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> party for like every like every day at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the convention you get confluent yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone gets [ __ ] conflict yeah a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of people get [ __ ] up of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does that does that count as the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing because you know like you're going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a place where you know that you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably going to get infected with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something along the way because there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people in a single area and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're putting yourself in a position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where your immune system is going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weaker because you're naturally doing a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of [ __ ] does that count as this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> illness which category to the future </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah where which does corn flu count as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone getting sick like normal sick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting normal sick yeah normal that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not that's not food poisoning i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like food poisoning it is in its own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> complete like category closer to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> self-poisoning to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know how do you understand why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think that way or you just don't get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at all i understand why you think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because i understand i just don't agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's not like i'm going to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> con and i'm going around licking floors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'm licking you know what i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i am just i i know that you're at a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> higher risk because you're around a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of people yeah people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> some people who aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you shake a hand or you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like oh i don't know i better like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sanitizer sometimes you know like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hand is getting sick yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and because we're taking photos we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> getting close people yeah people want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know people yeah i understand that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just like a big risk sometimes i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> get conflict sometimes i don't but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's that's again like it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like me almost squishing like six </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> months of interacting into one weekend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so to me it makes sense right that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would there was a very high chance you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> could get a six yeah yeah but again like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not the same with food poisoning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because again somebody had to [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i wonder if i'm like the only i can't be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only person who sees it this way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there must be a lot of people i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're the first in my head you're the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> first person how many people have you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> discussed this with right this is not a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> normal thing to discuss yeah it's not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal thing to discuss because i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in for most people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> food poisoning is an illness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there's like no question about it if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> asked me connor what's up why can't you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come in the trip's recording there i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> might be like i've been poisoned i'd be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like no i got sick i gotta say but then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my head i would have this this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> category that i would label it just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens to now we have to talk about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'm explaining it and i didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realize that people didn't see it this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> way so the next time you get food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning and you say oh sorry guys i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sick i'm allowed to call you out on that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or yeah you can be like who [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll be like i'll be like did you eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> another [ __ ] bag of flavored hot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cheetos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the restaurant this time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who's the culprit here's the thing right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i get sick from a restaurant and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only know me it's like oh oh connor are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you let's say you don't know like let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say this restaurant is poisoned like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hundred other people then you would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start being like what the [ __ ] is going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on why is this restaurant still opening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only difference is that you only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear my side right but obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally a restaurant wouldn't be doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that but still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not crazy this is just it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> perception you know we have i sound like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> alex [ __ ] jokes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with the water you're just hearing one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side of the story it's like no i don't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> agree that food poisoning is very hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to argue without sounding [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i agree with that food poisoning is in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the different category than let's say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the flu or tonsillitis but i would say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that there are a lot of illnesses that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exist that can exist in different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> categories from the flu and food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> poisoning and a lot of things but at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> end of the day some in my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all illnesses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but in my head i don't treat them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same way like like like there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> millions of different illnesses with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> million those millions of different ways </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to prevent it uh to stop yourself from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> getting ill or all this kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] in mind that this is not like some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of hard scientific definition i put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head this is just like a mentality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i have towards thinking don't worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't come to trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's always so many comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> being like i'm gonna post some holes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through conor's thoughts and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah because i didn't really think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that much about it anyways it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> talking out of his arms she's got a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> rough rough uh estimation i just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> see the benefit in labeling food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning as a different thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like that's more of like copium on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your end to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not ill i'm not ill why why not just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say their own illnesses i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because again this isn't something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i ever discussed with people right not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that comes out in the open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> often obviously now i'm having to talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it for a million plus people but </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> or something or every six months or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> there for like four hours get a test </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> wait get another test and get results </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff and then the whole time i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just surrounded by like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very very ill people and it was always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like really scary it's like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eight-year-old and didn't like keep </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> of a hospital is just like oh it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's hard to explain that there was yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was also like it smells of illness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah literally you know like like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> said when when you're ill and when i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> ill things just smell and taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different you know yeah of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> naturally and it it [ __ ] sucks but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you go to a hospital for some </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> it's just like man everything just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> smells stale you know yeah </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_00> levels of clean like it's sterilized is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a good word yeah so it's it's sterile </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> shoving in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever but like it smells like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chlorine how often do you guys go to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dentist i try to like twice a year just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just is like a checkup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> did you like put it in your cause like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british culture we we don't go to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dentist like a lot and i only really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started going uh actually like we i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would normally only go to the dentist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> before when i'd go to like asia and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like because like dentists were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> actually like really much cheaper i am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> am before the all the british tooth uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jokes in the comments now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do do you have like a schedule of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh it's been like three months or six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> months i was like where are you yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they say i think they say when you're an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> adult you should go at least two or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three times a year as for like a checkup </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right i don't [ __ ] know well like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know because the good thing with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dentist is that like even if you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have like the cavity or you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hurting anywhere like they'll at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like [ __ ] clean your teeth yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> though i wasn't drilled so loud oh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> water like pressure thing right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah in japan in japan it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horrible no like to me i think the worst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling is like getting a filling and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know just like have you got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a feeling before i've gotten one before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> right and i don't know that like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experience as a kid just scarred me for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life right because just like i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know what it is about just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like just hearing the drill and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like not being able to see what they are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doing to your mouth and just like do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> want do you want to see do you want tv i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i don't i don't know what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> scarier right because you know it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i need to see this in 4k </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it can be arranged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no because like just i i i it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that feeling of just when they hit like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a nerve ending for just a second yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i feel that in my nightmares you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i like ever since i heard felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a kid the first time i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that put me off going to the dentist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ever again yeah um the worst the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for me is when you hear the drill sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like deep in your ear so it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds like it's in your ear yeah i hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it because it just sounds like someone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just getting into your ear like that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had like uh like a night </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mold made you know like when you go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bed you wear like one of those plastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guards yeah i've got that as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah um i haven't worn it though so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's good yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i forgot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about that i know sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad speaks english too far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know it's really it was really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> annoying to sleep with for a long time i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't sleep with it in yeah it took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it took me about a week to get used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i woke up drooling everywhere with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah yeah that's that's a normal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> experience yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i think i didn't start snoring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until i started wearing my mouth guard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh because it literally forced you to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a mouth breather when you when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah the gap between just like like push </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> my lung </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i couldn't like breathe comfortably for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> me why did you need to get it i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know my dentist was like you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really need it but it's good to just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> prevent prevent uh dennis was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to [ __ ] you over well i was like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> were like they were like yeah i do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grinding your teeth is an issue but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might be so we can get a night guard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> down if you just want to be careful and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we can out and i was like oh uh sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and then they did it and then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just really didn't like it so i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stopped using it because i grinded my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teeth as well but my doctor was like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have this guard your bottom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> teeth are really gonna disappear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like i i didn't really know about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it until uh until i started getting like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jaw problems so like i think like in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mid to late 20s i started like getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jaw problems where it felt like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like sometimes i'd wake up and something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will like feel off or like slightly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dislocated or yeah it's hot yeah like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i never i i didn't know that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was an issue until i started getting the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> issue and then uh i went to my dentist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like uh yeah you grind your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> teeth a [ __ ] ton and uh you need to wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a mouth guard because uh your your bite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to get like more and more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> deformed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm going to schedule an appointment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because i forgot to reply to that email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> right they put like all that that gunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in you yeah like the putty thing right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it was so confusing figuring out </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> and he was really calm yeah he's holding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on to his thumb like this and his i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could see that holding on to his thumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like his thumb was falling off his thumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had been cut off and he was holding on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all like in his hand he was holding onto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> his thumb what and he was like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calm and they were talking to him being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like are you ready mr jones to go to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like yeah it's all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't mind waiting a little bit it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really strange because i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize what he was doing at first until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like saw the bag of ice with it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then he had a band-aid going around like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this and his hand was like like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right like and he had like bandage going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> around oh i just i just wanted him to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like are you ready mr jones if you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> thumbs up haha </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really weird i i've you know i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like tv shows in the uk like like just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> farmers who like had their arm like cut </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because like if there's one finger you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't want to leave you don't want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't want to do right you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want to freak out you want to be calm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's true i feel like the more you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> panic the the worse it is for everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so you're like calm down but i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's easier said than done yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean obviously like we've never i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never been in that situation so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hard to like imagine how you'd react in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that situation because you've kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never been in that situation yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> weird really because when i've been in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> situations where i i feel like i have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> calm myself down afterwards i'm like is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what you know you see people like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> freaking out yeah are they like trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to calm themselves down or like what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going through their head it's just what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> do you mean like when when i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's say like uh if i'm bleeding really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> badly which has happened a few times or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something and i have hemophilia and my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my whole focus when i when it's happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember distinctly is like i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally just focusing on not freaking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> out that's all i did yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm like i'm like trying to keep it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> together yeah i just think like i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that what everyone does i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's no way to get into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone else's mind right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i wonder like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when some has anything ever happened to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you where you're like really scared and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like freaking out probably not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i've never had anything like life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> threatening or anything like that so i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't know myself how i would react </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if if i know how i react with a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situations it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah calm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's like trying to force yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know how to i don't know how the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the human mind is really [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like i'm like i i'm the kind of guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who in stressful situations just say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing like i don't know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay this is going off tangent now but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i don't i don't physically react </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when like someone tries to try to jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scare me a lot of the times right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> remember i remember like every time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a jump scare or anytime sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like tries to like prank jump scare me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i like she goes ah like that or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something when i come out the shower or </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> called the ambulance before right or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know because i didn't know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] the procedure was right so the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> head i was like oh god what the [ __ ] am </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i gonna say am i gonna stutter you know </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_00> it was surprisingly calming but then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was for me i'm calm in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> moment but then when it's all over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when it all comes out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me i panic like post when everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just kind of sinks in to be like holy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] that [ __ ] happened and yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> went through all this [ __ ] and it's only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after the event has transpired that it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually starts to sink in and i start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to feel the gravity of everything that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> happened yeah yeah at least to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um i do have a question though because i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> you have when you have a fever when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> have a really bad fever and you start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dreaming really weird [ __ ] because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought it was just a saying i thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just a term of phrase right until </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i started dating sydney who gets like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> such some of like the most [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weirdest fever dreams i've ever heard in </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> like going psycho </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can we get a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> definition of where the dream comes from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so so when you have like when you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> try to rest you your body tries to rest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right or at least some people's body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tries to rest um and and then you go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep and you're like sweating you start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a really bad fever you know as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your body tries to fight off this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> illness and then some people or i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying some people because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience i've seen it happen to is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with sydney and she'll just wake up </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> she was like oh it was just a few and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's believable actually that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that wasn't a fever dream that was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> an episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because like i've never had like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single fever dream at all or like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually i've really ever dreamed the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the problem is no no it's it's no dream </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> whereas like i don't remember 99 of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dreams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's [ __ ] up because it's like i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i remember some mornings i wake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up and i'm like i remember having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really good dream and then as i am </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> it's so weird because it it literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fades away right as i'm trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but all i remember is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i had a good dream yeah but if he told </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> me to recite it i'd be like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't remember i like because to me i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think i feel like i've just rarely ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dreamed i i don't know because like if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a dream oh you do dream everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dreams i'm i'm sure i do i'm sure i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure i'm sure i do you're not a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> reptile like you do dream anyway i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> joey um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dream sleepers can experience when they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have a fever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sure i've had a fever drinking so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure yeah but they happen similar to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other dreams that can happen during any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stage of sleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it just seems like her dreams when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she has a fever is just like the wildest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ones you know it's so strange i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember my dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very i very rarely remember them yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like once every month yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't remember really yeah i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can only remember like two nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but but but like if i have a dream i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i remember the fact that i had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dream but like most but most nights i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wake up and i'm just like i there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was just a void in my head there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was nothing there was nothing i dreamt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing can you can you feel the sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of time passing when you're aware that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you're dreaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah have you ever have you ever had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lucid dream no i really want to though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> those are the funnest ones i've only had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> once i've only had it a few times i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think i've had situations where what i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to happen in the dream during it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did happen but i feel like it's a battle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know this is so hard to remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this stuff this is what scientists have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been trying to like [ __ ] figure out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like hundreds of years yeah i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know do you have you ever had a dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like been so vivid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's kind of like just stuck with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you for like years and you can still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recite it because i don't remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> most of my dreams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i have one nightmare i had when i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> little that i think is the reason why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm afraid of heights now right uh so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know how they say like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't die in your dream right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you've never experienced it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before i think that that's bs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> well actually i thought it was bs2 until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i had time i pretty sure i'd die in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of my dreams </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> sure i've respawned in my dream i'm near </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> certain i've respawned in my dream the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only nightmare i've had that i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still vividly remember is i it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really short dream but i was like flying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then for some reason i just stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just i just picked a young joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> flying yeah i'm just like flying my room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like that yeah uh and then i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stopped i remember i stopped and our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> house was like uh it was like two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stories and we had like this spiral </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> staircase that went down to like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basement floor yeah and i remember i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just stopped and i looked down at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spiral staircase and i just dropped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like head first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i vividly remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> my face got about this close to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ground and then okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> right and just [ __ ] myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> right and i think from that point on i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got afraid of heights huh because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> vividly remember the feeling of falling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was horrible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you your brain made a traumatic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> experience for you yeah that's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strange like like to me like the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> traumatic dream that i've had that has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck with me for years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was i remember i remember this one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i was living this dream right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i would wake up in my bed in my room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i was living at the time and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just go about my day right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it would just be a normal day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then something would happen that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just be like out the ordinary like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would see like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would see like a twin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> followed by another twin like i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> noticed a glitch in the matrix or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something and then as soon as i saw that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would like the dream reset and i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wake up again i would and i would think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that i was in the real world and i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go about my day and then i will notice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another glitch in the in reality it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's [ __ ] nightmare fuel because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i literally i literally repeat this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cycle and every time i would get more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more paranoid that i didn't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was in the dream world or if i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually awake i was like i was like is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this a dream of because like i would go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about my day and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember the exact moment i woke up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was about the tenth time when i like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like went through an entire day thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i'm awake i'm awake and i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to the toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was uh i was um getting ready for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bed and i looked at the mirror and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my reflection turned like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turned away and like i [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> freaked out and then i woke up for real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like for real real wow and i think an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> arias to film no no no no no no it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like a cool film i woke up for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real real and i was [ __ ] myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i didn't i didn't believe the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fact that i was actually awake right it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it it literally [ __ ] with my mind for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an entire few days because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i went about those few days being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where's the glitch where's when's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna happen when's it gonna come out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're twins yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how my mind created such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] up situation that it literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] up my mind in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe maybe i'm still in the dream maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i'm just trash tasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're when you're dreaming right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you able so like you mentioned that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you like flying right yeah when i'm in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dreams and i like let's say i do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that i know is is impossible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> are you aware that you're like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's impossible and that you're dreaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because i often always get i'm aware </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's impossible but i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i i think because like lucid dreaming is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like you're aware that you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what you're doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so you take full advantage of that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> thought lucid dreaming was where you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then controlled said dream yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i can't control cedric to me i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm in a dream a lot of the time okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so i can't control my dream when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm in when i'm in lucid dreaming state </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's more of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's more of like it's more like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you realize that you're in gta with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cheats on you know that's that's how i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> imagine it right because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there have been times where i'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] dreaming all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right let me let am i dreaming let me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try flying okay oh i'm flying now yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> brilliant i'm [ __ ] dreaming this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing that sounds like you have cheat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> signs yeah i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because i don't have dreams often when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do i yeah at some point in the dream i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> figure out this is a dream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right like something will happen that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my brain chose to make happen but i also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> am aware that that is not possible and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that i'm now aware that i'm in a dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it doesn't change how i behave like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i know that i'm in a dream but i still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go on the dream this is so strange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's wrong with our brains </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i had this dream recently i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember the fall of it i told i told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the dream on stream it was something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like um i i i was in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situation where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd been falsely accused of stealing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game cartridge yeah and then i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then arrested for it and i was like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not getting arrested for this i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't i didn't steal it i refuse and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then i then i like killed one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> cops and like ran away because he was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to arrest me over the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game cartridge that i had nothing to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then it turned out into this like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> massive shootout and stuff now then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow kept uh getting away and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eventually i got caught and then i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to prison and then i understood i was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a dream at this point so then somehow i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magically then got a phone it's like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easy car i had this phone in prison that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was then using to then play games and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff and like have a normal life in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prison yeah and i don't know why then my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> charger broke and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember this happened and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] when my charges broke and then i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just skipped and i had a charger and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just skipped the point where my brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had to like think hard enough to come up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the reason why i needed the charger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i have the charger yeah this is great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is i don't understand why this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happens though but did you realize it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a dream or yeah about halfway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the dream i understood it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dream yeah but i did but you did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't take advantage of it you're just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like because i was about to say like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> love how in the dream you still got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arrested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this is incorrect actually i didn't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the charger i got really this is where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reset so i went to the roof of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> prison because i couldn't i couldn't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a charger so i thought what's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] point if i can't play games yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i jumped off the roof of the prison and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then i reset in the prison </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i died i died and then i just in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember there was a jump </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i remember i died and then i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> appeared back in the prison again with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the charged iphone with a new charger or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> something it's like the worst version of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> edge of tomorrow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> terrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just don't know why this was happening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why i understood it was a dream why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't i have some control over it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're all [ __ ] dreams i always have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least you remember like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because to me like a lot of night like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say for example like last night right to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me it's like okay i'm falling asleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> falling asleep falling asleep one second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> later oh it's 7 a.m yeah like there's i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel no perception of time no okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when you wake up can you feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time without looking at the clock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes but not accurately i feel like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty [ __ ] good at it now i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know what happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it depends on how good my sleep cycle is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at that time um sometimes like now it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit [ __ ] up because uh kovit just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made me want to sleep all the time so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like okay now now i can't tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my body's constantly tired but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before then i would be like you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know sometimes you wake up and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be 15 minutes before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alarm goes yeah i mean you look at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time every time you look at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like i'm i'm a [ __ ] genius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason why i asked do you know that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is because i was like in like if i asked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you no dreams right do you do you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was a flow of time in your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> dreams </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> see this is weird i know how much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is passing in the dream in the real </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> world isn't this weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how strange is that that's that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> against inception rules though because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we all know we all know time passes slow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in the dream world so because i'll wake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> up right after a dream or whatever and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it'd be like 5 00 a.m and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd be like i like that dream i'm also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna go back to bed yeah and then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when i'm in the dream how much time is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> passing because when i wake up the exact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> amount of time that i thought had passed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the dream had passed in real life is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this so strange i think that's just your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subconscious might be like like counting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time maybe yeah it's almost like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> alternate reality do you have a level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you need to [ __ ] [ __ ] the match </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i am vr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we all had vr in our minds in our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> most strangest episodes we've ever done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which this is a weirdest topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you ever like have a really fun dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you get actively pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you like wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god i remember this i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of like the funnest lucid dreams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i've had and then [ __ ] sydney wakes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up i was like god god let's cuddle and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like [ __ ] off sydney i'm flying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right now i'm flying sydney i was on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode 24 and i was the botanist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the worst one for me is like when i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> having a good dream because i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> remember most my good dreams right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but it's like i remember i wake up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm just like man i don't remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> what i just dreamed but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe if i go back to sleep i'll dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so i go back to sleep and i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dream it again i was like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gone forever like like to me to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there's a point right because to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've i've had it before where i've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like really really fun dreams and i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you half wake up but before your mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fully wakes up you're like go back to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sleep and then sometimes i've been able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to like reinsert myself into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> matrix right god i'm getting in the air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm going in i'm going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so i know sometimes like i wake up i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if i go to if i go to sleep now if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i go to sleep right now i can go i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> jack back in and then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get so sad when i like try to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will myself to sleep because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you try to will yourself to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time it doesn't [ __ ] work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right but sometimes like i just like try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like will myself to sleep and five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> minute passes i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm awake now [ __ ] my life this is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the real world i think i used to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do that but i don't ever try that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore i think sometimes i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever just get on with it i'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll just stream it again tomorrow night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a theme to most your dreams or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your dreams because they say that your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dreams are normally like reoccurring-ish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> sort of like they're similar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no events ah no not really for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i just die in a lot of my dreams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know what that says about me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah uh maybe some dream expert but even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you know how people are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dreamologists yeah the dreams uh they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your dream if whatever you do in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> dream there's a there's a real meaning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to it in real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe i don't know like if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> stressed out then you're dreaming about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your teeth falling out and stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that something like that right where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they think that every single thing that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can dream of has a real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> counterpart emotion that you're feeling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right there is to some extent but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like it's definitely too complex for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> us yeah way too common science yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like really high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> high concept dreams sometimes um like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like like i thought i told you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the the the dream i just had but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes i just dream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i wake up and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a really cool [ __ ] film idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a really cool film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically right you know it's uh i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so weird something i i like i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know how my mind works because sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like damn i dreamed that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was such a cool [ __ ] idea what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how the [ __ ] did my mind come up with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that concept what language do you dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it as as as because all three of us can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speak two languages right yeah like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what language do you usually draw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> english uh english for me is that i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rarely like dreamed in time unless i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless it's when i'm like living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thailand and i'm like using it more um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> more often that's so weird like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember like 90 of my dreams are in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i don't know why what language do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you think in though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> depends that's that's probably why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's probably why right because like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't normally think inside but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's been points where i've lived in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thailand and then my thoughts start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting like jumbled up and i start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start thinking in a different language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well which is like it's it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how do you describe thinking in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> different language as someone who only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> speaks one language it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how to like properly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> describe it thinking about how you think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is also weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now i'm like i'm like i don't talk to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> myself when i think i don't think so but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i do talk to myself and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not sure some people can't though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people like physically can't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> out no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now that you're telling me that i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking to myself while i'm thinking now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm doing it but i'm pretty sure i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do it i think i should do things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't i just don't think i just think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd talk to myself in my head out loud </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if i talk yeah because i remember i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember reading about you know deaf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people thinking in sign language and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that just like that blows my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mind you know it just i can't even like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> come close to conceptualizing it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know but i know i know it happens i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people do it but like you know it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so weird it's so weird to me this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode is sponsored by expressvpn when </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> internet without expressvpn is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to the bathroom and not closing </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> service provider knows every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> website you visit and what's worse is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they sell this information to ad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> companies and tech giants who use your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> data to target you is that why this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> melts in my area well the good thing is </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> normal for you to be aware you're in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dream no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't know that that's not normal are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you always aware yeah like most of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> time i'd say like 80 of the time i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm in a dream oh my god are you serious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're that kid at school that aces the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> test without studying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why was this decision because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not because he knows he's in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dream yeah but he can't control it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't control it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like that's like getting the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> becoming a lucid dreamer without having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fun part of being a lucid dreamer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's weird because like i can i'm aware </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm in a dream and i know that i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can want things i know i feel that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> want the thing in the dream yeah but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't always happen like i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how that have you ever like had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> superpower when you're like in a dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah many times define superpower but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then i die normally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> too much power to handle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for one minute literally like in your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own mind you're playing on hard mode i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't realize it was that possible with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all these superpowers i guess i'll die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm trying to think because like yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> always know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some like i said always some i'd say 80 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the time i'm i'm i feel that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> halfway through or some period in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dream i know that i'm dreaming because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> things don't add up in my head when i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the dream yeah even it's weeks i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i'm conscious in the dream so i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know what's happening and i know that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some things don't add up yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> aware that i have the knowledge from my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normal human life right and i can i have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that instead dream so like if somebody </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] teleports behind me at some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> point after that happens x amount of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> times or something i'm aware then that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this is now not possible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah when i die </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i just poisoned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> his recent mechanics that happens so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much in your dream what is this no no it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't happen often but when it has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> happened like if i die but i'm still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dreaming yeah i immediately know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that now i'm in a dream yeah because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> died because she died yeah and also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> gender you can't reset really you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what's weird as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know if this is a strange thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when i'm in danger yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> normally a good way that i know because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm rarely in life am i ever in danger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like weird situations right so being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in danger is like not a normal emotion i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean so when i end up coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> across it in the dream like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> somebody's chasing me that's normally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a one really weird way that i get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like in tune with the fact that i'm in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dream i yeah cause like i also like very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rarely dream for one but even more of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is for me to get nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i see all of mine like nearly nightmares </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i wanna say like again eighty percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> probably in the bad things how do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sleep at night i don't mind okay this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing right when something bad's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> happening to me in a dream i cause again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i know it's a dream i feel these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> emotions towards it but then i also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because again i'm aware it's a dream i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> have this weird sense of like oh i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> should see what could happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because i don't feel like it has any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> improvements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on my actual emotions i'm aware that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't is this strange is this normal i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i feel like if you have nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that often yeah and uh that's the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't wake up from a nightmare being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like like in the movies well oh that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why i always found that [ __ ] so dumb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because we're going for a nightmare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bad happens to me what no i wake up from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a nightmare i'm like oh shut my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no i wake up and like oh if it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really bad nightmares which i've had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> every now and then like yeah i wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in an actual sweat i've had like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entire life in every single aspect like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ruined in dreams before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like waking up like that's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm feeling better now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because i because when i wake up i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much better because i'm like oh goodness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no go because i i've had i've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nightmares where something was like bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> has happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you wake up and you just have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this instant sigh of relief where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like yeah oh my god thank [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought my life was like ruined yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's going it's great it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] great i'm coffee in this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not in jail my mom like i i'm i'm i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find like so many charging cables </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i've had like a dream where i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like literally had to tell my mom i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about to go to jail </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like seeing her cry and break down i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> crazy it's just like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wake up and i'm just like why does my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mind do this to me like that was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most heartbreaking feeling i've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is telling my mom i'm about to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to jail and i remember her [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crying and breaking down god me feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a like a vegetable like the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] human in the world i wake up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've never loved my life more than i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have now i've never felt more fulfilled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've never had that so you so people in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> your world have like really depth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> emotion emotional ability yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah see that's weird because in mine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like i'm the only person who is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> aware of like how emotions work and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone else seems to be like robotic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like an npc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of yeah like because when i the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> depth isn't there so like even when my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> parents are in the dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the reason again it's another weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing the thing that gives it away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing that normally makes me not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> enough world building yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is another thing where it wakes me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like where i feel like i become again in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tune into the dream that i know it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dream is when people aren't acting the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way i i my brain knows they are but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird right because my brain is the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making this yeah so why does my brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make the people like this but then in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dream my brain also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like i'm playing checkers against </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself and i'm like fantastic move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> connor you figured out the plan you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what i mean it's like what is happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in my brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> even when you sleep you try to beat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're literally creating a you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally creating a game for you to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beat while you sleep like what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happening the absolute stage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like makes so much sense because i swear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every one of my dreams is like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> easter guy to me right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i literally get transported into my own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] story in my own [ __ ] world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there's depth in the world building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there there's like some high concept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] dreams that i remember like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters in my dream actually act like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters in real life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finally i can self-insult which is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like sometimes when i wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone's like done like i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one time i had a dream where sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> murdered my family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and i remember waking up i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> waking up just as like i like found her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't wait i woke up and i turned to her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with such [ __ ] anger and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you [ __ ] i can't believe you just did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that to my mom and dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how dare you you better have a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was about we were about to go to trial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i will see you in court </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like at the time like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emotions felt so the emotions felt so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real to me that i i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes when i woke when i wake up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the dream isn't resolved i still have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like those emotions fresh in my body </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i fresh my mind like it's like hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to like sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get rid of it it's like it's like those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stereotypical like you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> girlfriend dreams about the boyfriend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cheating the girlfriend's dream wakes up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soon that's the boyfriend it's like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i've never understood that but now i do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never spoken about my dreams in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depth it's the first time i'm thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh yeah maybe my dreams are weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i'm the weirder i i thought i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't remember much of my dreams but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that now that i'm thinking about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i do just remember a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i don't dream often but when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> do dream it's like an event for me you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's it's it's it's literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching a film it's great it's great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this one's going into the mirror bank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also sometimes i have dreams that i at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> least i can only remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are very brief dreams like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 30 seconds of a dream that i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember and i've woken up yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> latest one i remember i was cooking me i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't remember why yeah i didn't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was in that street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i just woke up and i was probably the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> thing that gave me food poisoning i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember i was cooking meat and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> food in your dreams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's another thing i don't think i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ever get sick in my dreams from all the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ones i've remembered i don't think i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ever gotten ill in a dream i don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i've ever well i mean you're you've gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one step above and you just straight up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> dying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i never die from like it's never like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> dream of me on the bed and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's yeah it's like i'm always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting stabbed getting thrown getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> shot like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean in your dream you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you should be in like your peak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> performance like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your peak formula i think it'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty sad if your imagination is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like now you're you're a frail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] you're a frail [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in your dreams now you can't fly how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> many times would you like to die </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've had dreams that other people have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been sick in them and i've been around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like the whole dream has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around this person who's progressively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> getting more ill yeah and that was those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> dreams are really depressing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because even though again i'm aware i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a dream i can't do anything to help </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them i feel like but i don't and i still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel sad because seeing this dream sad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> version that i've made up that i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting more dead is really saddening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is so strange this is really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bizarre i i think one of this is why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> inception was so good i think one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdest i think one of the weirdest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dreams i had which actually would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a cool concept is i remember i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> remember one time i like i i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one time i woke up and i for some reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just i knew i was like the second </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming of christ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i i'm like i knew i knew i was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chosen one i knew i was the messiah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right i knew i was the messiah but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is right so so i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called the sigma male grant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so the problem is right the problem is i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> knew i was the messiah yeah but for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life of me i could not prove it to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> world right so so like so like i would </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> miracle all i'm hearing is the the dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> god wasn't actually about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you becoming a god it was that you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> furious with the current state of magic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> catching up to real life because it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was me thinking if there was an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actual messiah that got born into our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how would they go about proving it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what would like what would they be taken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> visas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was that was just like it is very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard in the modern era yeah special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> effects yeah now that you say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's going to make a [ __ ] jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> literally take that concept so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember jesus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just like that's a really cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> concept i'm i'm glad my that was a cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> copy right there right now yeah yeah now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've said it someone someone can go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> write a story but i don't [ __ ] know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you guys ever had sleep paralysis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yes one time one time yes i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally seen sleep paralysis demons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have you yes i have okay i've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never gotten to the demon part but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had because i didn't believe in sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> paralysis until i got it and it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] weird because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for those to explain what sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paralysis is basically you're awake but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> your body's asleep yeah essentially so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> your mind's awake but your body yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like i believe when you go to sleep your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> body like excretes like cremate uh your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind is called a chemical okay your mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is a chemical that paralyzes your body </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while you're sleeping i believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so it's like some hunter hunter [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and and so what sleep paralysis is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that that chemical is still in your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> body so you can't like move but your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mind is still awake yeah it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sound right is that is that right ashley </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can you can you can you google it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so basically uh it's basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's it's you're conscious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you are not able to move yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so i i've only had it once in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> life and i thought this was nonsense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before yeah and it was like i i was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was on joey's couch yeah really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your sister was there your sister would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come and i remember it was weird because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were speaking about me and i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to get up yeah say hello but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was face down on joey's couch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying my best to wake up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was fully aware i couldn't open my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eyes but i was fully awake and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't move my arms or legs yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it didn't feel that like i was paralyzed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it felt that like even though i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> willing my body to wake up like my arms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and my legs like my whole body wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> listening yeah i'll see your eyes were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closed because when i had sleep palaces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> my eyes were open oh my eyes were closed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and i i could feel i was well aware that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was awake and i was aware of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that was going on around me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i couldn't like it just took a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moment and i felt like there was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> battle when i was like telling myself to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wake up it like wasn't doing it like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pulling a chainsaw cord you know yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah she's like i could feel that i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to get through and it wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening i didn't understand why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> eventually i woke up for me it was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] because like i remember i clearly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just remember opening my eyes looking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around i was like five in the morning i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saw the clock you know you could you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> could you were looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your eyes were moving around i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally i was darting my eyes around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like why can i not talk or hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anything or move my body yeah oh sorry i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't hear anything i couldn't hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anything either i couldn't hear anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i tried to like open my mouth to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something and my mouth just wouldn't see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is one of those things where i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's definitely the mind like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is like a like a [ __ ] a glitch yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what what what the [ __ ] else do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it is the demons but like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why i think when he's like it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chemical i'm like i don't know there so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to me it just sounds like a a neuron </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] up in your head that's like really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like you hear that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's just like restarting like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like trying to figure out so what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened did you go back to sleep after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your sleep players no no i woke up after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like 15-10 minutes yeah oh i went back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to sleep oh i because this was like i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had a full sleep and i was waking up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i and i woke up and i just couldn't move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my arms or legs for a little bit it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't like i was trying to move in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't moving like i couldn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like figure out how to move it right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really strange i don't understand how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this worked so i remember the one time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> got sleep paralysis and i literally saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> her sleep paralysis </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what did it look like okay so i i called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it a sleep paralysis demon it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looked like a ghost so what happened is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like uh so i was sleeping on my bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like i like i remember like not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waking up immediately but yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember just like opening up my eyes a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bit and seeing like this kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ghostly figure i was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that immediate like immediately i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like punch my eyes open and like i see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this female figure like kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like praying above me or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no but it was literally like this this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh this like looked like a nun or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that was just like praying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like above me and i start like freaking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out because i'm just like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there is a literal ghost floating above </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me right now right right how old are you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was around 24 okay yeah so it was i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't young i was uh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around 24. and i remember i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i said i'm like i remember my mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> going into fight or flight mode just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just like i was i started panicking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because obviously if you see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] ghosts floating above you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start [ __ ] panicking so i like try to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start like moving my [ __ ] body to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like do something and i remember my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> body just would not move and it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was [ __ ] it was a terrifying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> experience right strange yeah it was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a terrifying [ __ ] experience and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember it took me about like 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes 10 to 15 minutes of me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screaming at my body it's like just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ah gone move move you're gonna die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna die you're gonna die now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds like a dream it could it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't a dream because like it felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no because like it felt like a dream and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not like a dream at the same time right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was obviously in my room but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after about 10-15 minutes i actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finally was just like able to will my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> body to like just like sit up yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember i immediately sat up i looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up and i could see like the the figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like literally fading away as i sat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like super super like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surreal so that's that's why i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh that was at the [ __ ] sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> paralysis even that everyone [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memes about you mean that thing actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exists what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's so weird oh that was like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> persona [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it was just my stance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know man you just lost your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> standing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> another question when you dream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you see like visually see your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surroundings this exact same way because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't like i mean like when i'm okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm seeing this right now right i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing like the the real world in like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't it's it's like way fuzzier when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see my dreams like i let's say i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a table there yeah but i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like give you the detail of it like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i know what everything is around me yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i know everything's around me but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> can't like visually see everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's happening really strange do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have this as well no mine's mine's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] rtx on 4k </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 60 fps why is it like a fisheye lens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's that's why like for me that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like for me sometimes it's like so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard for me to tell the difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between when i'm dreaming and when i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> awake because my dreams are so vivid and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know like i said they have a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of depth to them that sometimes i wake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes i immediately know that i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just woken up and sometimes it takes me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> few moments to realize okay i'm i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> actually awake now this is the real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world i'm not i'm not in the dream world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore i think for me things that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuzzy is things that don't exist in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> reality huh so it's like like if it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a table for instance then it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i can clearly see that it's a table but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's like a [ __ ] fairy then i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be then then it'll probably look fuzzy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well you know when you're you're trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to remember a moment that happened yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you have a picture of it in your head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't have it like in 4k rtx the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you saw it right it's not this kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of fuzzy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you remember where everything was you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you you know what i mean yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way that you recall things that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened it's kind of like that the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i see stuff in dreams it's like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> see it perfectly like if i'm focusing on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this table yeah i know god's there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for example but i can't like see gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> does that make sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i know i'm aware that are there in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dream i don't see them unless i'm then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paying attention to them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because then your brain has to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> render out right it's rendering </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because because you know it's there but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like your brain's just like i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want to render us out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know that god's there i just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> want to render it now you're going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> upgrade your brain's graphics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now right i don't need to see that joe's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the corner of my eye yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's in the corner of my heart but when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm trying to remember the whole picture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my head when i'm in the dream it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rendering right right it's like a 1060 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's going on my draw distance is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lowest possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like when i'm walking up to the building </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it starts to come in a frame it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's a load of [ __ ] a weird [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dream what a weird [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like that though where like i the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> dream doesn't exist unless i'm focusing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on it in the dream so have you ever had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a dream that's taken place in somewhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're like very familiar with or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like somewhere like you know all of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dreams are in places that i've been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in real life right see most of most of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time my dreams are in new places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i'm not aware of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what it is i think my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> capable of coming up with new locations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what i think it is i think it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stitching together things that i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> passing right yeah yeah yeah and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like i can i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> visualize a lot of things but i i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know what's happening and i have an idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really strange a lot of my dreams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are in my house they take place in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> house that's strange i never have dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like all sorts of [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in my house that shouldn't work which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> house like the house that i'm currently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when your house start right i'm sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not credit sequence </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shot to door joey opens up hey guys you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> know like where do you just wake the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dream it's like game start you just wait </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you just like it starts in a weird ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> location and you're like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is going on no it's always it's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mid-conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i never remember the story i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh wait what oh oh i guess we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> here now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i guess i already remember my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dreams when i realized i'm in a dream so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i never remember how i get there yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i did so i don't see like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> playstation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like oh i'm in the game i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like oh dreamcast starts brilliant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's almost weird because i feel i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when i'm dreaming i'm watching like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a video and at some point in the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll know that's me does that make sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's a series of events unfolding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i'm not necessarily constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in that brain of the person experiencing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it this is so strange right this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird even even stranger question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever dreamed in third person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah okay okay that to me is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weirdest [ __ ] dream because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like for some reason in my dream it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> makes sense that i'm seeing myself in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> third person yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like for example like even though i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> never experienced that in my life yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that prison one yeah it was weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just gonna start to be strange i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had i remember shooting the guns right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right but then i also remember watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> after shooting the guns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it flicks between first and third </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> place and i i and and the weird thing is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that i then was able to feel the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> emotions of both yeah when doing the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dream act and then when watching me do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the dream act yeah this is so this is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strange i've never spoken about it i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never spoken about this before you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking now that you're making me think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about this i'm realizing how weird this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds to say out loud like this must </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sound so bizarre i don't know if anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> else is i don't think a dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation is going to be normal i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never had a conversation just about my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dreams before with anyone but like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best way i can describe how it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like is like you know when you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in playing halo right yeah and there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that theater mode where just any point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just unclip from the keyboard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like just but i'm not choosing where the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> camera goes but i'm seeing it from a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> perspective and i don't understand who's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or what it is sometimes yeah sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes i have like amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cinematography </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and i don't know i don't know how like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if only the youtube videos could match </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah right like i don't know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know how it happens but sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i sometimes i'm in first person and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i like i go to like a new a new like an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> area or something and i have this this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> area </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a new area on the map or something and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like my dream switches to like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> establishing shot of this like new this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> new landscape and i'm in i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm just like i don't know and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember thinking in the dream damn that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> looks cool as [ __ ] and then i load back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into my character or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so i i don't know how to describe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your dream has cut scenes is that what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this man's journey literally has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cutscenes and when it's over he goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> back into first person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] it's it's so it's i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why like i think sometimes i dream in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games you dream sound like a kojima game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah sometimes i dream in games and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes i dream in movies which is why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it never makes sense to me how i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can possibly dream in third person and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like at the time it makes sense because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you never see yourself in third </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person my third person do you mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a movie like from a movie camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standpoint or are we talking like gta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like behind yourself sometimes both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really yeah yeah yeah so yeah i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's weird really because again i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i'm in this situation and i fully </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand that it's a dream but i never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> ever like think that like this is wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah because i'm in the moment and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's what my mind is making up so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> always feels natural </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when i'm in this dream like for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> reason i'm just [ __ ] remember this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now like talk to you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every time i'm in an interrogation room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm never like po it's never pov </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> interrogation room it's always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> interrogation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always side view like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] jcs criminal investigations or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something it's so it's so weird i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know why i mean like i do every anytime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have a conversation in an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> interrogation room i'm always in third </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> person i don't know why but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it always feels like i'm in control </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what i'm saying i'm sure that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> purely because we've just like consumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> media that where they portray those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> things like that right so yeah yeah i'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> be interested to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if another person who has never seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like an interrogation scene in a movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> how they would because i've never been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in an interrogation in my life so that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of makes sense i i've also found </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that if i'm highly anxious about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something when going to bed there's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a 90 chance my dream is going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about that oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's only ever happened a few times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's only ever happened with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> homework and exams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i was playing that uh pogo stock game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> recently yeah and um did it give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> nightmares and i yeah i had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nightmares that i was stuck in this game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that i couldn't stop playing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game because i couldn't beat it because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was making i played it for like eight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hours and i made no progress </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i went to bed all i could feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was me playing the game in the dream and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then i was playing it and i was like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't get out it's horrible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that was nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a horrible night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's a scarier nightmare than uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you dying yeah the worst part was i knew </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was in a nightmare and i was getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more annoyed because like why am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasting time where i could be actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing this but instead i'm in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nightmare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuck in a cycle playing in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you ever have like moments where your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dream is so intense that you don't feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you've slept at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i wake up more tired yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never had that yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes because you go on such an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emotional journey in this dream or at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> least i do that i wake up just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exhausted so what do you do then just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get another eight hours huh i i don't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i get up but like i get up but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my sometimes i just like feel like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't slept at all just because i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i was awake in my dreams so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't really sleep at all i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's it's really weird yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst nightmares i've had is i go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep obviously tired and i'm probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not in like a right state of mind yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before i go to bed hence the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have the nightmare and then i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that nightmare i wake up in that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cold sweat like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] you're so tired after that but i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't want to go back to bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because i know if i close my eyes right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now it's just going to be like to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> continued like it's just going to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have a fun dream you can never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> get back into the dream yeah when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have a nightmare nightmares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have a nightmare you go back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sleep you re-enter the nightmare i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like probably stress and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right like it's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> behind the tree like like freddie's like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> really don't think i said generally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is going to sound terrible i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> screams </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> while i've sleep talked right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um you don't i've never heard you sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk i've heard you snore very heavily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know if you're screaming or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> snoring or if it was crisp and snoring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like not that loud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really did was did you ever like sleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk during when you did your sabbath on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you slept on stream is there like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> muted the mic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> damn just in case i was fighting that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dragon that could only be defeated by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> racism yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i i only asked because aki has recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started sleep talking like a lot yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm like kind of concerned because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh sh by sleep talk she randomly shouts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out phrases that just don't make sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you think about it in a sequential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manner like i remember she's like cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ugg is the kind of person who like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally head touches the pillow three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seconds later she's snoring right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> instantly like that which i'm so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jealous of but then now it's gotten to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the point where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three seconds after the head hits the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> pillow start snoring five seconds later </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she says a random thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like i thought the first time she </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did it i thought she was joking right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it happened in the span of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 10 seconds so i just started laughing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think i remember her like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like all right good night goes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sleep starts snoring and then she just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> legs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like maybe maybe she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then and then and then i started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> laughing and i was like come on sweetie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you doing but she continues to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snore and i was like wait are you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you serious and then she goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> butt fries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so i had to shake her awake i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like are you are you [ __ ] with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she wakes up and she's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what time is it i was like it's been 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seconds what are you on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in her head it's like an hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> has passed or something yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weird again like whenever i sleep i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always know how much time has passed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i don't understand how yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sydney has a lot of nightmares um when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she sleeps and like i can i i know when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she's going through a nightmare because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she's she's just in panic mode like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can tell when she's running away from a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] monster because she's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know because like i know when </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> barely knew him so i was like we never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really like whenever i saw him it was </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> he woke up and i was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he always pissed on your games yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> based on my ps2 collection my my wii </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably i don't know what it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did you ever get the point where like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's something happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like in like um in the real world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like you hear a sound or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like you need to go through the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> toilet and it gets like integrated into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your dream for like a good while uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if maybe but i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't remember it like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most annoying thing for me is is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i need to go to the toilet in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dream because i don't immediately wake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> up yeah when i go to the toilet i want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to need to go to the toilet but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> luckily they're luckily my brain has a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> disconnect between my body and my brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because there has been several times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right where i've really really needed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's been several times where i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really really needed to piss and like in </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> acknowledge the fact that i really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really need to piss right so yeah i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had several like five minute pisses in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my dreams and the and the feeling of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> piss just won't go away because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously i'm only pissing in my dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and not in real life so i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm like urinating and i'm like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get so frustrated in my dream because no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matter how much i urinate the feeling of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> needing needing to urinate never goes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> away that's really weird yeah if i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something if i if i piss myself in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dream i'm pissing myself from yeah i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like that's that's how i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciating happening i almost [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> myself doing that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> how can you replicate the feeling of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> pissing so accurately in the dream yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without without actually pissing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's i can't replicate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feelings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know that it's not accurate in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah when i get when i get punched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in a dream it doesn't feel like a real </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> so in my dream i'm on the toilet and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can feel that my butt is warm right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a heated toilet seat yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so in my head i'm like oh but warm i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a toilet this is reality i'm actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to take a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh and so in my dream i i almost i </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> nothing was coming out and it wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like a constipation type of thing it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like literally like i know i need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] but nothing's coming out right and </SPEAKER_00>
