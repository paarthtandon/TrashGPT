<SPEAKER_03> - What kind of wave form </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we making today?
(electric guitar sound) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's make a penis wave form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, this is like "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- No, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't just say
something is like something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just say everything
is like "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like human now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what makes me laugh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the meme?
I don't get the meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know.
- What's the punchline? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like poo poo stinky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like an anti-joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, this says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says a lot about society, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when I have to explain an anti-joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just want to say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want to see the
context of this fucking meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is no context. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like Peter Griffin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like leaning over in black and white. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And his like, "This says
a lot about society." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This does say a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That has become a meme.
- That has become a meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why it's become a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'll be bored of it by
the time this episode airs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, there are some
anti-jokes that I get, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there are some that are just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this isn't even bass boosted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How can you find it funny? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give it a day and
you'll be laughing, I bet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welcome society to another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> episode of "Trash Taste."
- For fucks sake Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It says a lot when they have to open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> a "Trash Taste" episode like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It says a lot.
- It does say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think it says enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am society member number one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with two more members of society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello.
- Hello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello.
- Hello, hello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what says a lot about society? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The fact that we don't
watch anime anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, see, now you're
laughing at the joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> See, now you're laughing at the joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just laughing at how
shit the fucking segway was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you just like
speed run, titular title. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I think so.
I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, for once we gotten a
pretty interesting discussion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> before we started turning on
the cameras and we were like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're like, "Wait."
- ... "Wait." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Sh, save it for the episode." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we should turn on the cameras </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before we start- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, true.
- ...talking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But instead we're talking about society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe we had a conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and didn't try to monetize it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right?
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't talk
unless the camera is on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a professional podcaster. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was basically ranting how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't watch anime nowadays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you guys know that anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not a revelation.
- [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I think that a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it just because like
I've fallen out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not that.
It's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I find so much anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just so goddamn boring now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just find, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even about it being boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just redundant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel like it really
says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> See, he laughed, see liked the meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, why does it say a
lot about society, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to hear your explanation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just, he was going
to say, he was going to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it says a lot about anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was going to say, "It
really says a lot about anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then the moment I said,
"It really says a lot." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just like, it was like, it was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like the
100% unintentional pun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I support this, okay, go on, go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It really says a lot about anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when all it takes is for
me to read a synopsis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I could probably
tell you with 90% accuracy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what the first three
episodes of that anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is going to be about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> an arty farty general type of
way, like in a detailed way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I would like to preface, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> since we have to preface every argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, there's always
like one or two shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are good.
- [Joey] Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that are entertaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Of course.
- No, all anime sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like there is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much like mediocre stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is so uninspired, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just rehashing of
what we've seen before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Just kind of jumping off
successful characters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and premises we've had before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was talking to Joe earlier, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's so many characters now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like I've watched so many anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I get the power fantasy ones, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand that the point is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they went to be all powerful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they can't fuck up.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, is that always that fun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, is it always like, great? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like sometimes I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you have like a flaw or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like something that
makes you a little human. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that, I'm not like bored
out of my mind watching you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, Saitama is bold, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That's flawed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a flawed.
- That's a flaw in itself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can relate, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that I think the reason
why power fantasies are just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they make the most like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Perfect main characters," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because it, if they had flaws, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would completely go against </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the point of it being a power fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, why would I want to self insert </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself into this all powerful character, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if this character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is supposed to be
the better version of me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also makes mistakes, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the same time it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, that's fine, if
you're self inserting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not every person who
watches shows like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wants to self insert." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just want to watch a
character that is completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> independent from them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go through this adventure
or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm like the
spokesperson for like that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on, go on go on.
- ...that kind of anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I completely recognize that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem with anime nowadays is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one, there is so much of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And number two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it is what I just
call "Cold Disposable Shows." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just not even like a show anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's just content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just something you consume, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, that's how I view
a lot of Isekai, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The reason I watch a lot of Isekai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because it's exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to remember most of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I get the same kind of experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the same region as
what I see people watching, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Trash TV shows" for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like trash reality shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know what
you're getting with say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Kitchen Nightmares" or "Hell's Kitchen," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or, something along those lines, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just a repeatable format. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gordon Ramsey comes to a restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and surprise, surprise
the restaurant sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's why I also don't
watch shows like that, either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They're the exact same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a massive market. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In some senses, but
then it also feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially Isekai is just like, so inbred. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like they don't
take from anything else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- They just keep fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Incest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They just keep having in with these shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is incentious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where is the incest card? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like these shows
when I'm watching them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it just feels like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the shows aren't trying to
take from anything interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're all just taking
from the successful show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in their own category. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I kind of feel like
I'm just losing my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching these shows where like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no one even tries to do anything
even remotely different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the issue of like anime
that is inspired by anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Isekai as a genre, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is basically just like a self sucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like circle where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it ouroboros where-
- [Joey] Yeah, ouroboros. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - ...it's like the fucking
snake eating itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is an ouroboros. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why, again, like
it just feels derivative. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You watch a show that
is supposedly brand new. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I just read through
the synopsis and I go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I've seen
this show about 10 times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm glad that you say that, sorry Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just because I feel like
if I was just saying that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like some people might argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a language difference going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I can't fully understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the nuance of these characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, every time I go
to a bookstore, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm trying to find something new, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I go over to the Light Novel section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I always want
to say like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's popular.
- [Garnt] What's popping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's popping, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I'm just curious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe there's like a
change or something, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go over and I see all these new titles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never heard of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just look at the title
and I look at the covers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How is this title and cover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any different to the one next to it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it doesn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just look like
spinoffs of each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Just from the feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and even going through the synopsis, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this book right here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was inspired by the
book sitting next to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and vice versa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a reskin of the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, every time, I do like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the "What Will I Be Watching," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is where, you know, I
go to the next season, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Biggest lie of the century. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but nowadays the reason why
I still continue that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not because I actually sit through, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch all the anime I talk about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it so that I can hopefully
find that one show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would actually be non derivative, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and somewhat interesting for
me to actually go and watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why I feel
like the Isekai genre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right now especially, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, the show that I'm
like been bigging up so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is "Mushoku Tensei". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the Isekai that basically started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole Isekai Light
Novel trend in terms of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the one series that,
from what I can see has like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the one progenitor
for all the tropes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or a lot of the tropes that you've seen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like watching the anime adaptation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is airing right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a really fucking good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not saying it's a
good show for an Isekai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a really good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a great fucking fantasy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, I've started
watching "Mushoku Tensei". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like halfway through the first season, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's season two right now, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's season two right now, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I started watching the first season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just because Garnt and a bunch
of other people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this is the one that started it all." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Bet, I'll check it out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I completely agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can see where all of
the origins of what made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the Isekai genre was so great came from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, as you said, it's just a good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like with so many Isekai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so many of these
disposable anime nowadays, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the first episode airs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the anime is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You know how it is, you know how it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't need to explain shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't need to like build up
the world or the characters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, this character
archetype, you know, this world." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember watching the first
episode of "Mushoku Tensei". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they spent like a whole episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're building up this character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he dies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he's a baby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he like wakes up in this world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's just like figuring out the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though in every other Isekai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dies, Isekai, it's like five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It really says a lot when
I've watched some Isekai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It really says a lot of Isekai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It really says a lot
about Isekai society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I start up a show, just
the generic Isekai show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wanting to see what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think I'm watching episode one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it feels like I'm
halfway through the season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just because they just
assume you already know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these tropes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you not going to try and make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unique or interesting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or explain anything about the world? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you just assume that
everyone who watches the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> already has seen the show
in some of the forms? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because sometimes you
also watch an anime as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you can tell that the
people behind this like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put a lot of effort into this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that extra tinge, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that extra sparkle that, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can say when an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just like clearly thrown together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, from "Mushoku Tensei" for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know with a lot
of anime that they speak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where the character speak
a different language, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they just don't even bother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they translate it back into Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though the characters are not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technically speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, in "Mushoku Tensei", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they didn't just make up one language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They made up two separate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fantasy made up languages for this show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is used in the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've never seen that
with any other anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially not any other
Isekai fantasy anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the characters are actually speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like the fantasy characters
in their own language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just a made up Isekai language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or made up fantasy language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then different species
have different languages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, they literally have just
made up two separate languages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the shit that not
like everyone will appreciate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this is one big indicator that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the people producing these
show really gives a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shit like Welsh or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like Icelandic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they made this shit up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you want "Vinland Saga", right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so, do you
remember that scene where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't Askeladd, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was Thorfinn talking
to some French people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with also English people there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and Thorfinn is also from Scandinavian, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever the Scandinavian languages is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they were all speaking
Japanese to each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was really boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really hated it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were all speaking Japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> telling each other how
they can't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what each other are saying.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even though they were
all speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is "Vinland Saga",
fucking amazing, amazing anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but the little things like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just like immersion breaking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it really does make a difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's what I would argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the greatest
fantasy stories out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is what made it so in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like, could you imagine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you will watching
fucking Lord of the rings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And just Elven, wasn't
just spoken at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, every character
is speaking to the Elvens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that one could be
such immersion breaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it would also just completely
ruin the world building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, even like Netflix dramas, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They'll sometimes have
like four or five language, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> different casts and
everything all on site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's like something
that I always get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I appreciate a fuck ton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in anime it just feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that never ever happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it's happened a few times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember which ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I Know it has, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it has just never rarely happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it just sucks this well, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel the main reason why a lot of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just opt to not do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just because they think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, the audience isn't
going to be fucked." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in an ideal world they
would like to do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much anime being made now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there are so much being made
under like a big time crunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That is true as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wonder with the whole anime thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it like a natural thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If me as an anime fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who's watched anime for a very long time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get bored of anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it a natural occurrence? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or is it that I'm being picky? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you say you're
growing out of anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think am growing out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dare I say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, this says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does say a lot about society, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One thing that says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like a lot of anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of anime do this is kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disguise of like, "We're not for kids," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you watch it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you watch the character
dialogue and how they talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like only a
teenager would think like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is how people talk to each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is not like a real conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's where like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate to use a Western example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like "Castlevania," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the script in "Castlevania"
was so goddamn good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The character interactions
in "Castlevania" was so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I wanted to know more
about these characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time they spoke, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even the ones I didn't like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I agree.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every character when
they spoke about anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was anime fucking delight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in anime it's always just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got to serve the plot if it doesn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all about tits or funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, like me being a peep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like I was saying earlier as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> another thing I really dislike, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Lelouch is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime's favorite character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it really fucking shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like there's so many characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like Lelouch, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like fail to see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what made Lelouch so good, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like diet Lelouch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lelouch is good to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did make Lelouch good then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - One, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> First of all, you get lured in with this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God, he's a genius," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- That he's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He's sick, bro.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's strong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you realize he's a psychopath, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that he's scared as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like anyone else in this world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the thing that I find that a lot of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, even like Light, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Light in Death Note. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Light makes mistakes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Light worries, Light panics,
Light freaks out, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like with a lot of these
power fantasy shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they try and make a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like resembles or takes from that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I find that most of
the time it's so boring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's absolutely no
other character trait to them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe the one thing they're sad about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the Saitama thing where like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I'm so strong, it's boring."
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But even then the way
that One Punch Man does it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is really tasteful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know how to describe how. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because the show
doesn't take itself seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, Saitama does it in a way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's kind of like really
fun and really playful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't really take itself too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But anytime I watched
these power fantasy shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like my brain is rotting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm watching it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather watch Big Ed have
like some mental breakdown, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on 90 Day Fiance.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I don't know how to put it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I feel like animate
treats me like I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I hate that.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of anime shows
do check the audience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're stupid.
- Yeah, I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe because a lot of them are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jojo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> assumes I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then doesn't give a
fuck and carries on any way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Jojo doesn't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking stupid.
But I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I was
telling these boys earlier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've recently had
to start watching anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or like two 2 times
speed or 1.5 times speed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because 1 time speed is so boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is like fucking insane to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't watch it at
that point for enjoyment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just to consume, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just for like my seasonal videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I do have to watch everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember it got to a point
like two, three years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you look at the seasonal
chart and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If I watched everything on this chart, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally be watching
two seasons worth of anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to keep up with
every show being aired." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sorry to go on.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just impossible to actually consume, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or watch everything coming out now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why a lot of it's just
disposable shit, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I was about to say, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's I guess like one
of the biggest criticisms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get about like Joey doesn't watch anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, yeah, because I can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's so much shit out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So much of it is so derivative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I would dead ass rather go back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and watch shows that I didn't get to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all those years ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or shows that came out before
I was even born, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd much rather spend the time on that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is in fact less of a
selection all those years ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than there is every single year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like new shows coming out, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, like I'm
limited with my time, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to spend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking you know, 20
hours of the day watching- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - ... anime bunch of
shit that I'm not going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to remember next week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's so fucking
mediocre, and redundant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You always do like Isekais. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You do the anime, the
seasonal anime videos, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - And like, I'm going to watch them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm watching, I watch them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I feel like after
I've watched them now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll always like talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a show or two that sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll never hear you
ever mentioned ever again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's up with that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I talk about shows
that have potential, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And a lot of them might not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might not say pan out and some of them do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They might fizzle out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they might fizzle out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I do like my
end of year videos as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, these are the shows
that I actually stuck with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, there are some good
shows that air every season, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then there are some shows
that I feel are just the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and are best consumed via anime, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There are some shows that
have interesting concepts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I call like Manga
recommendation shows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is I watched like
the first two episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, this is really interesting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like an average adaptation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, what happens is I just
go off and read the Manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need to watch the anime anymore." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have a much better experience
reading the Manga, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That does happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you just watch a
show and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can get this exact same
experience, just reading Manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you do.
And then you're like, great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The seasonal anime did its job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as a Manga recommendation channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like something about reading Manga, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is way more palatable
for shitty shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think when these
characters are so boring, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can just speed run through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> their boring ass dialogue, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like way more enjoyable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I think it's
because there are more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like places or more factors in anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that leave for a larger room for error. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the only thing you
have to really worry about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a Manga is the dialogue
and the artwork and the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But whereas with anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have things like voice
acting to worry about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have things like
sequencing to worry about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you have things, animation
and fucking music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like there's all these
other factors that could make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that show look and feel way more mediocre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the core of the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which is why like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I rarely read Manga that
hasn't been released yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I do feel even now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm reading more Manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that if there's a good anime adaptation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just untouched.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a good anime
adaptation of a good Manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking untouched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd rather experience the
anime first time hand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why when these
anime do get released, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I see one or two episodes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all I need some see to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, this is going to
be a mediocre adaptation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just going to read the Manga." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many shows right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I feel like you
can just read the Manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you'll be completely fine with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they're all just like
those one or two gems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every season, or like most seasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, this is a banger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm glad anime exists because
of these fucking shows." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like "Attack on Titan"
is one of those, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, 100%, I
love "Attack on Titan". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can not read the Manga
for "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I refuse to read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope we're not spoiling this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not to demerit anyone
who does read the Manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I just feel like
"Attack on Titan" anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best way to like
experience that story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't imagine getting like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the emotional highs I did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the story without having
watched it in the anime first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because I feel that because
of the added factors that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make an anime different from a Manga, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the animation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the voice acting the music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In the case with the "Attack on Titan," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all of those were fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it just heightened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, don't get angry about the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like those like anime only factors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only heightened an already
great story and characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, that's why I feel you just get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a better experience with the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But a lot of anime
adaptations can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> In fact, they pull it down sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is why, like, I there's
some shows where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know it's going to like
slap like "Chainsaw Man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's one show where I'm
like, I could read the Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I know it's a
fucking amazing Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't want to, go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I want to wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to wait for the anime adaptation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, but that's good though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you guys are waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because in case it sucks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a great Manga to look forward to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, it's just a win for you guys, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For me, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've already read the
Manga multiple times now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, like I'm scared that my experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could go really far down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or it could just keep getting better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'm at a gambling stage right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For you guys it's like, I
don't care what the plot is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm taking fucking taking over the Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to like anime, I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to watch more, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I really do, and I feel bad that like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like part of the
reason you don't watch more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is because it's like harder
for you to watch more now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you have to go out of your away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because everything you've
watched is on Netflix now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A big thing for me with watching stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is like being comfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't want to watch
something at my computer desk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do not want to do that.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I like to Chromecast
things as we all know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I like to Chromecast things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean, I can do with anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a lot more annoying to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, Control doesn't work in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so you've to get
through a lot of layers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and Chromecast doesn't work
with VPNs unless you have like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a whole fucking mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But there are obviously there's ways. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Netflix is a very like hassle free. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have to think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everything just works nicely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know that's so, normie
of me, I know that's normie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but like, I've been slowly starting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to feel the same way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you value your time
and mild frustration is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my house could burn down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever we'll deal with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a big problem, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be devastated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But there's something about
mild annoyances that get to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on an emotional level way
more than like devastated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you're saying that
your house burning down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is a mild inconvenience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You said your house burning down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was a mild annoyance.
- Both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If my house burnt down, we'll be fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why did it sound like
your house burning down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is the same equivalent to
like, "Oh, I ran out of milk." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a very good insurance
policy, okay, Joey, I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like something about like massive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really big annoying things happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why it's like
easier for me to deal with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but like really annoying little things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like you can't quite complain about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's not big enough to be a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Except on this podcast.
- It's just always annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, except on this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a little bit annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's why for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's one thing that
will get me frustrated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single fucking
time without question, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just dealing with
small issues in tech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It kills everything for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that annoys me more than like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not a very like, ragey angry person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that is one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that will get me pissed off every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By the way, if you haven't noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the lighting is a little bit different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because our WiFi isn't working
in this office right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, speaking of techy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You just reminded me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like having to try and fucking debug, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and deal with the WiFi
issues and this office, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which we haven't fucking figured
out what the issue is yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Has just like put me in
this like rage inducing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking coma, I swear to God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why though like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my PC set up at home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like quite complicated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a lot of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of moving things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of wires. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have like two externally
powered USB ports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are all full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have like 15 plugs taken out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this shit isn't like
a fire hazard problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you running the fucking
White House from your place? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - When one thing goes wrong,
it like fucks everything up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to deal with so many
tech issues for like streaming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or making YouTube videos or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just don't want to
deal with tech issues, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I want to relax. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It brings me back into work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This brings me back
into my engineering phase, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you turn on something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you turn on a device and
something doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you write a piece of code
and something doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't render out correctly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Great, so how do I figure
out what's going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you just have to go through everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one by one by one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because since I've been trying
to set up my new office, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and do like a proper streaming
set up and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that, I'm just like, "Wow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see why people complain
about cable management. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because before when I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like one computer,
two monitors, speakers done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't care about streaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't care about that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now we're like doing all
sorts of different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've got to worry about lighting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're worried about all
these different plugs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've got to worry about,
you know, the GoXLR, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all this, like, there's
so many different devices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on our desk now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And as I was setting up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I overestimated how fast
it would take to like set </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything up in a neat package, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It took me like four days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, like I set everything up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, let's like cable
manage this entire thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Spend the entire day trying to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cable manage everything, super neatly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> setting up all my devices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, they are like optimally placed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Set everything up, do
it for an entire day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I forget, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that my desk is a standing desk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've been setting it up
during the sitting position. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so what I did is, I set everything up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Great," check
my emails, stand up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything breaks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then the screen
just like turns to black, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything falls down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "oh, my God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm just like maybe
YouTube is overrated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe streaming is overrated.
- Here the thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if people don't tell you about
cable management too, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> When you, when you put
it all in like one braid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you put it all together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> When you want to change one
cable, that shit fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to take everything
apart and then find the cable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like between like the
nested, all the shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you're like, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe being neat is just not worth it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe I should be fucking messy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my idea of cable
management in my place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is just take all of the wires, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just get them off the ground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That way the Roomba doesn't
fucking suck up the wires. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can easily vacuum under there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm happy about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like I streamed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the first time
in months yesterday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For this chess stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and pretty much everything that
could go wrong did go wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I pressed the go live button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I set up my stream set up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Set everything up, tested
everything the day before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I know what it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how temperamental equipment is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I tested everything
before I went to sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything was working fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even turn the computer off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I put it into sleep mode
because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't fucking up the settings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't fucking up the settings." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the first time I'm
going live in my new office. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know something's going to go wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I hope it doesn't go wrong too bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I go live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I put on the starting screen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> starting soon screen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's going well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I switched to my camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's black. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Oh no, oh fucking no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Okay," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> turn the camera on off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, the camera we use is
a DSLR with a cam link, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which is what we use for
"Trash Taste" stream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cam link is just saying that you connect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a camera to a PC basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I try restarting the camera and OBS, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I try turning the camera
physically on and off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing seems to be working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, I think I just need
to restart the computer." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I turned the computer off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restart the computer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For some reason, the computer's
not detecting cam link. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not detecting the cable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I go under. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Keep in mind, the fucking
chat it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "What the is going on?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the worst when
it's happening with a chat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting on your ass about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look like log on, stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is under like the time crunch of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just went live, people
already waiting for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've tweeted this shit out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I go under the
table and I look out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At this point, I'm in panic mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I just take out all
of my cable management, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like just fucking explodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's just like an explosion of wires. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I have to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finding it like one strand of spaghetti, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this the fucking sea of wires </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to what this cam link wire is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I find the cam link wire take it out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plug it back in it doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Take it out, plug it
back into another slot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Okay,
well I'm out of options." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I go into my storage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get out like my old Logitech camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like fucked, having to plug this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the webcam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, at this point
10 minutes have passed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "I might not
even going to have any viewers." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Plug it in, Webcam works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go live again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then OBS has reset all of my settings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I go live, you see me on the camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't just turn on my mic anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because my mic is
plugged through my GoXLR, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which has about 10 different
mic settings on the stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like, here I am just fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when Homer Simpson is at work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go through like nuclear breakdown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just like pressing buttons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was just me, just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Guys can hear me? Can you hear me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like the most stressful shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I empathize with any streamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who goes through technical difficulty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's awful.
- I've been there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there's nothing that
kills an energy of a stream, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not just for the stream itself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for like your own energy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> quite like going through
technical difficulties. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you stream like crashes
and you like come back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you lose like half of
viewers, it's so depressing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not that you care about the numbers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just sad seeing like
you just gutted it in half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> by just accidentally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking something up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And fucking cam link
it's so temperamental. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it has to go in like a
certain USB port on my PC, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or it doesn't work.
Like that's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't even even figured
out what the issue I had is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or why the camera just stopped
working all of a sudden? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For me it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if I want to like record
something through cam link, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like I opened OBS, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I turn the camera on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and usually it'll like pop up if it works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just doesn't pop up
like 99% of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I'm like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turn it off, turn it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, now it works." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like a tech
goblin just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Should I work today? Maybe not." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, every time you turn on cam link, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God flips a coin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes it lands tails, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes it lands heads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Keep the settings or fuck it up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, time to fuck it up," beep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, apparently, even
if I keep the settings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they still flips a coin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I haven't debugs the problem is yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just have to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hope that God smiles on
me next time I stream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and nothing goes wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the thing that's annoying about
like that kind of problems </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and like tech and streaming
problems that you can't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like throw money at the
problem to make it go away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You are like, it's you're problem, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and you got to learn how to fix it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's a pain in the ass.
It's so annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've had like every goddamn
issue under the sun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's terrible.
Like, something always breaks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, especially now that we've
been doing more live action, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live action content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you just call it
live action content? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On camera, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know just content, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the live action
adaptation of content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love the live action remake of Gigguk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Netflix live action of Gigguk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Trash Taste" is just a
live action anime adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is what happens when
you watch too much anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It just fucking botch your mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like real life to me
now it's just live action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yo, I hang out with
someone on live action." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's kind of nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He goes outside and looks at the grass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, "Whoa, look at the graphics." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I went to the Colombini
live action, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, what?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Went outside, I was like,
"Yo, look at this FPS, man," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's at 144 hz, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Supermarkets are just
live action, Amazon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But no, it's like, made me realize that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just making content isn't enough anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just worrying about making
good content is enough anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you have to worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much tech things that I just
never thought about before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because before it was just
me, a mic and a script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, YouTube is very
friendly with that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can barely plugging a
fucking GPU two years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now, I have to like learn how to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> do all this like tech shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like deal with cam link. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I'm thinking about
getting a second camera, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like terrified to even like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> think of the possibilities </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of how much that's going to fuck up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my already nice setup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't use two cam links in one PC. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can, you can though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very temperamental there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, see, I'm like
scared to do that now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it's like, fuck what do I do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because like,
yeah, before it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before my entire YouTube career was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me a script and an
editing software, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me, a concept, maybe a script, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then lighting, camera, audio, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the light flickering? No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Got to change the ISO settings, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got to change the frame rate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Is the audio? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, it's peaking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is it peaking? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the settings got changed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "I just
want to make content." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why people have
production companies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't want to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like impossible to
focus on what you're doing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worrying about how all the tech works. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And by the time all the tech get sorted, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I've wasted like two hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I haven't even done anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's nothing I can monetize
because I haven't recorded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Haven't even started recording yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the one thing I think
you really gained from being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like YouTube or Twitch or any of shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is that my God, do you learn
how to like fucking adapt fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've got to learn or you're fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your MacGyver skills
go through the roof. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you have to kind of person
who panics and calm focus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when shits going wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> then a RIP. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like to say my
engineering skills have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been really useful in terms
of just problem solving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there's so many
small problem solving things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to do every time you're on a set, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're doing something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're making content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because something inevitably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes wrong and there is no manual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or playbook about what's
going to go wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But something new is going to go wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure out how to sort it out on the fly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you think they'll ever be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember seeing an article
about this on Japanese Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of Japan was thinking
about like starting like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> university courses for like YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like online content creators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think there's
definitely room for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone to be like, "Hey, I'm a guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I will come to your house and
set everything up for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tell you how to use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you pay me a lot of money." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're actually looking
for that right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone wants to help us
set up our tool Twitch sets up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in our Trash Taste office, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were trying to find a specialist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We actually can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we've had to figure it out ourselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we always get comments
about how junk our set up is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's because we made it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we don't know what
the fuck we're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's like a
decent setup for live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's not perfect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think we just want it
to be like more professional </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like impossible
to find someone who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> knowledgeable about this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And normally if they
are knowledgeable about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> broadcasting, they're not on Twitch then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't know like
an actual TV and shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like wouldn't it
be interesting with like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 10, 20 years down the road, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if YouTube just keeps
going up and up and up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe like our kids
will end up being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "So what, university degree
you going to go into son?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "I'm going to go
into YouTube and Twitch." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the way YouTube is evolving now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the quality of
content just keeps increasing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's getting harder and harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to compete with the larger creators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the barrier of entry
is just so much higher now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like even talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> an anime podcast, which
is what we started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we put in like thousands
and thousands of dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get the basic
setup in our old studio. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And now we've like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have gone as professional as we can be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after having like a surprise success </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with what we were able to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But before that it was like a
lot of money that we invested, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we didn't know if it was
going to turn into anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we were in the red
for a while, that's the truth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so, now I just think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, if you're a new content creator, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're trying to make a podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or compete with some of the content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's is already established
by a lot of larger creators, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so much you have to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's so much you have to worry about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's getting harder and harder to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not only distinguish
yourself but make content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which for the average viewer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they feel is like of a high
enough production level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's about like doing
what's in your means, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I've had friends who are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I want to do this
thing and this thing," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "Yeah, well that's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, you don't have the
ability to do that right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, like scale it down." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Mr. Beast was counting to $100,000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he could do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure Mr. Beast had some
grand visions of giving away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like $20 billion or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to start where you can. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think a lot of people as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they want to be on a higher level, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you just need to work your way up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially if you're solo, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I would argue
that in the case with YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not always like TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or it's not that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because you have TV quality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going to make you
successful because I feel there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still plenty of room,
especially on YouTube for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Less lower quality content" that is still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just as enjoyed as the
higher quality shit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some of those popular
content on YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> without a doubt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is people just screen recording Minecraft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It speaks volumes about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it says a lot about society </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're just playing a game, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's still going to be king. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think no matter how insane it gets, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like people at the end of the
day are going to want to watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> people fuck around and
playing video games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there's just
something fun about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I like it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, I know people always say like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why do they always talk about
being a YouTuber and stuff?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, fuck man, it's almost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, it's
almost like, it's our job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's tough because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I also want to talk
about other things too, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> man, like 99% of my day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is me doing content creation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's do guys talk about
when they go to the pub? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They talk about the
hard day at the office. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Their work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> This is exactly what we're doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You guys have aneurysm when
you try like to sort out stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> setups and stuff?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do.
- I do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel you bro.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do that. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, Trash Taste Studio tour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Back to the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Going back to what you're talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how you're just bored
of the anime archetype, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the anime character archetype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's like the last character
you would say from like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any medium that you were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fuck with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not an archetype.
- I fuck with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Squid Games", right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For real? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was actually, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every character from "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, every character is
like flawed from "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they're all pretty flawed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I would argue, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what made this
show so great, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yes, because everyone sucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I enjoyed about "Squid Game" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to like every other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say death game is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of other death games is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, a lot of the death games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just run on complete archetypes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this person's the asshole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person's the good guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We did have the
asshole and the good guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we did, we did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you would have bare minimum, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but the thing is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least I think why "Squid Game" worked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that they gave more time to develop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> part of their characteristics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than them just being the archetype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right?
- True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There were entire
episodes of "Squid Game" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that didn't have any like death
game shit involved at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just, the characters,
getting to know each other, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knowing about the whole light backstory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of some of the characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> One of my favorite episodes
of "Squid Game" is when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if there's
going to be spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like halfway
through when you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they all decide to quit "Squid Game" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they all go back to the society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the second episode actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally second episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like second episode, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Spoilers for the second episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when they all decide, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to massive vote to quit
and go back to society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they realize how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they go back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It really says a lot about society, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they decide to go back
into the "Squid Game"s, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after how much they realize that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much they life fucking sucks, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that episode is great because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you not only get to know
about all the characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and their backstories and
their relations to one at all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it also just like
puts into a situation of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, this world must really suck to them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they have to resort
to going back," right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that was great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't a perfect show by any means. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, definitely not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I find a lot of
things wrong with it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I understand why it's so popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's very engaging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's got a pretty good premise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the characters like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you hate some of them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which is saying more than a
lot of shows can get, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt strongly that I disliked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And a lot of shows like anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I barely feel fucking anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about these fucking character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what I would argue is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it really says
a lot about society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't fucking stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear, am not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like heard you
processing that in your mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you're just like,
"I'm not going to say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not going to say," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you said, "It really,"
and then you were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck, fuck, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear I'm not saying it on purpose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I say that a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just say that a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like, "It really,
abort, abort, abort, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> says, abort, abort, abort, a lot," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Oh, it's
too late, it's too late." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - About society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I say it so naturally
in my speech, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This meme has ruined me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What was I even saying? I don't even know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was saying like how
the characters are boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I was going to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think a character that you end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up absolutely fucking hating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a way better character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than a character you feel nothing towards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, 100%.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so many people think like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this character sucks
because I hate him." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Well, no, that
makes him a good character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you feel something
towards that character." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a ""Game of
Thrones"" and Joffrey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I found it so interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you seen like
interviews of the actor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Of Joffrey?
- I felt so sorry for him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like such a cool guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like one of the nicest guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever seen.
- He quit acting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He quit acting, right? He quit acting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did he actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he quit
acting after "Game of Thrones". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just shows like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if it was his first role, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he was definitely like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not an experienced actor, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it just surprise, surprise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a good actor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes a hateable character
even more hateable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I felt really sorry for
him hearing stories about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kids watch "Game of Thrones". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kids watch "Game of Thrones". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, surprise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like people actually thought
that he was his character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and people thought he was like an asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "What?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That blows my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How people can like
actually look at an actor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and think, "Bro, I bet Leonardo DiCaprio </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> says the N word all the time, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I saw him in "Django",
he said it, man, bro." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like the same
people who are like, "Wow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you know that Joji </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just anime shitty of
a person as Filthy Frank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "I can't believe
he's like that in real life." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's definitely not a
character at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, who just discovered "Filthy
Frank" for the first time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They try to fucking cancel him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just cause like, "Did you
know that five years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he was this Filthy Frank
character whose making fun of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like mentally, disabled people?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes, yes, internet, we
did know, thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What kind of amusing
period to be on internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long ago was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it felt like yesterday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's about a year or two
ago and this is very funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, times change, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and definitely something
like "Filthy Frank." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Filthy Frank," transitioned to Joji. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Filthy Frank." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm fucking I'm lisping like crazy, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've completely forgot my point, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Filthy Frank." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, you've just like,
Derren Browned my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am sorry.
- Fucking hacked my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll stop, I'll stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now that I look back at it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it really is an interesting
period that "Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was living in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because for one, my God,
that shit would not fly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's a good reason why he quit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is strange how rapidly it changes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also remember as well at the peak of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joji's career as Filthy Frank, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how there was so many
kids that thought that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was just him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was, that he was
so good at keeping up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because he was so good at just acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the character and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any normal person who'd
watched "Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> would know that, of course
that was an over-exaggeration. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I remember at a time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joji just didn't exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't he like make a video
about him coming out as Joji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he actually
deleted that or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He made a vlog as George Miller. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> his real name as like himself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how he said that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he absolutely hated his fan base. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess the weird thing is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is tough to talk about is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess when you are hired
to play like Joffrey, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The actor didn't make this character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The actor didn't make this story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think that it's kind of difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk about with "Filthy Frank" is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, he chose to make this character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is entirely his thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how does that play an effect into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much of the character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> do you excuse, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really give a shit about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's interesting seeing
how other people talk about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how much they think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this is appalling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is him doing it, " </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he does have control
over the character, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He makes the creative decisions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I do wonder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much valid criticism
you can give him that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> from that position, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's the same criticism
you'd give to any writer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anyone who writes a
script or a character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Why not just cancel George RR Martin? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why not cancel Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for some of the stuff he scripts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and some of the characters he writes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of the things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Quentin Tarantino says
the N word all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's like we're
in the YouTube era, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the rules
have like kind of changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why though?
They shouldn't change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know why, I agree with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's because YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just seem more personable than say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone like Quentin Tarantino. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not saying that's how I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think it's worth discussing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think a lot of the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who try to cancel other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are, you know, a younger generation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's going to take a
learning experience of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when this younger generation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are now in their teenage years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When they grow up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five, 10 years in the future, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and realize some of the
shit they're saying now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are things that can get them canceled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're an adult,
they realize, "Oh, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe society just
changes as time goes on." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's socially acceptable changes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, maybe we
should give some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes when things happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 years, five years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guarantee you go back 10 years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like any Newgrounds comments, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you see the amount of
people throwing the R word, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the F word and the N
word around in comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it means nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because back then on the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just a general understanding that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> none of that meant anything
because it was the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, you look at it now and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wrote any kind of
comment or tweet like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's insta canceled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Two points, two points, two points. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> First of all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why do you think that some
people would then try and cancel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone like "Filthy Frank", right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's a YouTuber and playing a character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do you think they were
trying to cancel it him? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But not say someone else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's just like playing a character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's because now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the younger generation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who don't know about
"Filthy Frank", right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They only know George as Joji, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was this innocent guy
who just makes music, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, it's to them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Filthy Frank" is like
his dark past, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It really is, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's his dark past. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, " Wow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe he
changed identities online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to try and hide the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he did some dark shit in the past." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That has a fucking villain
backstory, you know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it does, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like his evil upbringing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like that's how some
people perceived it though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which just made it so funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think to a lot of
these people who try to cancel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Georgie as "Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> thought that he changed his name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to hide the "Filthy Frank" era. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone who grew up with "Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knows that, "No, that's not the case." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He just didn't want to keep
making content like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It didn't make him any money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of the changing
landscape of YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And he just wanted to focus on music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll save my other question for later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But next question then
following up on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Question to you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Question to you guys, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so, if we had a "Filthy Frank" now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that came out now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you think it would be any different? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Totally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think it would never be a thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure you've seen enough
"Filthy Frank" videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to know that 90% of the shit
he made would not fly today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, but like, why is it that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we look back at that fondly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we look back at these
videos and then we have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because we lived through them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true, true.
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we know that it wasn't serious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We knew that it was a caricature. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't over-exaggeration. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always wonder as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to play a character, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you get to do this stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wonder though like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how much are you allowed to do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As said character? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where does it stop? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you're like,
"Okay, this is too much." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it all depends on the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what's acceptable at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember, back when
our parents growing up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was cool to look up to rock
stars who trashed hotel rooms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> did fucking drugs until, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were more cocaine
than bloods, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was what was cool at the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was what was acceptable at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just imagined </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a TikToK of someone being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I worked at the hotel that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Who stayed at and it was
like really fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They've trashed the room
and everything. And like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you shouldn't support them." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I can just envision it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Who is canceled
for being rock stars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the thing though.
I understand time has changed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, like we joke about that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it might honestly be the case. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what's would happen nowadays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you don't hear about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like rock bands anymore
doing shit like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel they're scared now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that the possibility of that happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The rock star of then is dead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The repercussions just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the time they could get away with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> without repercussions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was just what was
like accepted at the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not saying it's right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was rock and roll. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was rock and roll. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't know how some
of these fucking rock stars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are still alive honestly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hearing some of the fucking thing stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Keith Richards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He should have died like 50 years ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the amount of cocaine he did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's still playing with
the Rolling Stones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like actually amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he's actually like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's Dio. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's 100% Dio. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love talking about all that stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And like considering it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's just so difficult to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> get anyone to like give you
a good definitive answer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of where they think things lie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so up to interpretation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it is up to
interpretation and I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it really just depend on the person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people watching this podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who have probably watched "Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and think the shit like cringe
or like too much, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's some videos
where I look back, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was some videos where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, that's a little too far." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think part of it is
just acknowledging that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> society changes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially things that are comedic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of comedy pushes the
edges, pushes the edge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of the times in what is acceptable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that time period, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just because like, there is shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I found funny 10 years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is very cringe or like very like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Sh, uh, I don't know
about that on, chief." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bottles to Newgrounds Animation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I acknowledge
that part of that is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the times were different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not that I was a bad person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that we were bad kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the type of people
there were, inherently bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is acceptable changes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as time goes on as different issues, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different social issues get
brought up to the limelight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, well now that's say the
social issue is brought up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do no longer find this one thing funny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, that's part
of how society evolves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I still fondly remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was growing up with Newgrounds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just seeing so many
Newgrounds animations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which at the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought was like the
funniest on the planet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the first time I watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was the funniest
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I watch it now and
I'm like, "That's cute." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I can't laugh at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can reminisce about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I try to like throw my head back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and loft around it anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just completely changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with not just how I perceive
comedy, but just how society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we stop saying society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't, it's in my mind now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's such a power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how the world perceives comedy all like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the barrier for comedy, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Another thing that
I wanted to talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted your opinion on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you were mentioning about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how you could say anything you
wanted to say in the comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the people don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> did you see that they were
trying to get a law past, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have it so that you
need your like public ID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to sign up to websites. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you could be like
criminally charged if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bully people online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were trying to get that in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was a similar
law like that in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - With 2chan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> When 2chan was a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I mean, 2chan
started to become a thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it started to get really serious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that there were many
politicians that were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If you want to use 2chan
or any kind of message board </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan, you need to put
like your real identity, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and get like properly ID and
scans to avoid cyber bullying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Turn off all site
which haven't an ID card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the, I remember the
founder of 2chan, Hiroyuki, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> he went on TV campaigning against it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he was like,
"That's just censoring." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that goes completely against </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole point of sites, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 2chan and just internet
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, he was ruthless about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He basically said, "If he can't
handle it, then fuck off." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In some aspects, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes, I agree with, but in
other aspects I do see like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially nowadays with kids who- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, shit can get hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - ...have no show whatsoever, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They just think they can go ham </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on everything without thinking
of any repercussions, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's weird, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously, I can sympathize with people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> who have had some really awful experiences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with public shaming and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I imagine it's not easy to deal with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But on the other hand, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like, all right, I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But come on, anonymity
is an amazing thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it empowers a lot of people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like when you try
and take away anonymity </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it disproportionately
affects people who are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in worse positions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also I thought, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so let's say I have to make
ID to join Twitter in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bra, am just boot up that VPN, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to go to America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not signing up with my ID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even as a public figure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do not want to give
my ID to like Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do not want to do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's the thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anonymity is such how- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you not?
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you not need to
give it for verification? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, wait, you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, yeah, you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Checkmate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to, but I have to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Twitter's like checkmate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Checkmate we have your shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck, I just realized it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We know who you are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor, "I would never
give up my ID for Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would rather go to war," jokes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that tick mark though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the verification. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That tick mark dome, enticing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't wait for this
fucking Garnt enthusiasm thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Poorly aged things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally, took like five seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> As just like a general user. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get what you mean
though, I get what you mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but that's the thing
is like I was saying, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's, what's so powerful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about anonymity is that I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true anonymity is so difficult to achieve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's impossible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That that's what makes it
so powerful on the internet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's really the
only place on the planet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can really just
be completely anonymous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And do and say shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate the fact that some
people are just really appalling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to me online sometimes
for no particular reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm not going to
sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yo, people that means
nobody gets to enjoy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the freedoms of the internet." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's a lot of countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where that's like life or death. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anonymity is very important. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I would never, ever
want to take that away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And for a blue check marks, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can just imagine someone's
like talking shit to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like quote retweeting
saying something mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I be like, "What's your identity? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Show me how old you are.
Where do you live?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me contact the internet police. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, wait, that's a thing now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cyber police. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, what are you going do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Go to prison because you
fucking racialed someone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Calling on my cyber lawyer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How are you going to
define bullying like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the reason why
bullying laws have never, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever worked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How the fucking do you define bullying? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like one men's insult is
another men's like Peppy laugh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What some people may
find funny and jovial, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other people might find
like deeply offensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But half the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're super offended
by something like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's probably on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get like the whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cyber thing is like a real thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not just a simple matter of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, just, just close
your eyes or," you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just get off the internet." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Just don't look, right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, "Just don't look at it," right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's obviously not that simple. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> People's thresholds of
what they're offended by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is very different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think there
is a perfect solution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because yes, I do think people would need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like chill out online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't agree that
the right solution to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is by monitoring everyone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and kind of having to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> make it like a default thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you have to give up your ID, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any your anonymity and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They already have that shit anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do they need it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They already Know that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the government doesn't fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> already know everything about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not like they're
tracking you everyday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They know what Hentai am watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't need to put
cookies on my browser. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll straight up tell them
bro, "Leave me alone." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my philosophy behind it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like to keep
your manners in check. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If you do see someone
acting like a dick head, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of a social thing now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just say, "Oi,
stop being a dick head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stop being anime dick head, dick head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to piss quickly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my god, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this man needs to piss
every two damn seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has downed like half of the bottle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - One thing that me off
about this debate, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that they always just
piggyback off of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> really tragic events
to push their agenda of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can't have anonymity
with people dying out here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from an anonymity and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just using like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really tragic events to push your agenda. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, how are people
dying from anonymity? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like cyber bullying people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like the very famous one
with the terrace house girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I forget the name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember that that whole
started a debate as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the English football players, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people have been like
super racist towards them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that's when the
debate really started going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, yeah, this is horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like the bigger picture is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they're trying to like take away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I sound like American. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Freedom, freedom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Freedom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your already resigned so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why you just like giving it to them? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "Hey, take it, please, please." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like people are still racist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whether there are anonymous or not, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like we're not getting
to the root of the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Go to the Facebook groups. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> They literally got that
whole family tree on there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they're saying the worst shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they ain't going to change anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, "Oh cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My uncle just joined the
KKK fan club on Facebook." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not anonymous.
It's still racist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the using the
anonymous excuse to cover up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the actual root of the problem, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the root of the
problem is not this anonymous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> person saying racist shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the problem that,
that person is a racist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I wish one
of those was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking weird as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, you would just be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, dude, I'm like,
anti-vax, 5G hater." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just so that we'd have
like more interesting debates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - More interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just because I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why are you going to be sensible? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like stop agreeing with me for a change." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God forbid we have common sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God fucking damn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God fucking damn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't want it to be
in like conspiracy theory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are you not like
part of the KKK fan club? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's just invite Alex
Jones to "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just balance it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A question for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - We wouldn't be able to
contain Alex Jones, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who are we kidding? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you going to be so
damn sensible all the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, God.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess this is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> piggyback on like the discussion
we had last week about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about hearing what the other
sides has to say, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I can't remember exactly what I said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like end of the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because that's how it is
on "Trash Taste" podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do remember thinking one
thing I actually like doing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is actually, I like going to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we follow people
from the other side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we like following
people from the other side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what they're thinking or
what their argument is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, one thing I actually liked doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is I like to see what some of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say the craziest people
are thinking, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not because I want to believe them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so curious about how they
got to that point, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, one thing I like doing
is just listening to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flat-earthers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> defense what they believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Defend flat-earther, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you seen how weird the flat earth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like online presence is though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how much like
anti-Semitism there as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like weirdly, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really bizarre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did see a video of a guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was a vice documentary of a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> going to like a flat earth convention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe it was all gas, no brakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it wasn't all gas, no brakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like a proper like documentary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a guy going to flat earth convention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't even get mad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the stuff that we're talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like anyone sensible can tell you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what they're saying
is just dudu kaka. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But like at the same time I
was so fascinated being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely wonder how
you got to this point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like not even to like hate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like psychologically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just curious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What you had to input, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and what you had to be surrounded by, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in order for you to truly
believe that the earth is flat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like looking into it and
seeing like so many different, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking flat-earthers
as in different videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about flat-earthers, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, a lot of this just comes down to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a core distrust of the government, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a system." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a systematic distrust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so much of a distrust that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would rather believe
that the earth is flat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than believe what scientists say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what an organization like NASA says. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fascinating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's also hilarious that, to them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> NASA is basically just like
the fucking Illuminati. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The problem is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we've actually had real
conspiracies happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, people just have like
this weird confidence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that like it's happened before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We've proven that these
some conspiracy theories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It has happened in the past. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And so they get like
weirdly confident about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think in a sense from
some stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know.
I don't have this mindset. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Stuff like that is so far from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I have a view of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't even begin to, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't even begin to like dive in that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I can't.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even understand like how. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think this is the problem is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of people
just cannot even remotely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see where they're coming from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like with politics sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can kind of understand, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You disagree, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can somewhat
understand very readily online, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but with stuff like this , </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so in like to us,
it's so insane, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know how to begin to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, you have a point." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know how to entertainment it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, it's
not about entertaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like genuinely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, not even trying
to change your mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How the fuck did you get to this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it something that
starts from like a young age? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, yeah.
- For me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not even the point of
like me trying to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I can even say, "Yeah,
you've got a point." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> For me, all the time, it's just "Go on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm listening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm not going to like
take in anything you say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I am just listening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird because my
whole life growing up, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never met anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who's been into like really bizarre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like that well, not openly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it's kind of like weird for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've expressed my whole life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I understand now as an adult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can kind of have my own circles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I wonder why I was like
growing up and like university, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how I've never really met anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's been very hardcore into
this, at least in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know about elsewhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's maybe because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they kind of come dime a dozen, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think media just makes it so out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there was this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> massive large community that
flat-earthers or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's getting bigger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is getting bigger.
- It is getting bigger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I still don't think
it's to the point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's become noticeably bigger, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I still think at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it is still very, very tiny population </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that actually is involved in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard to say, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hard to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least to the point where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're willing to go to
a convention about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It definitely feels
like it's getting bigger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Before I remember hearing
about flat-earthers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would just laugh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that was just like an
urban legend or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you realize that people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this actually exists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They're getting larger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they have a platform
to be able to get larger on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is, you know, the internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I guess the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an entire convention exists about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing that I hate about it as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is I hate talking about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the more you talk about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the more you like give them a
strange sense of confidence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we're so sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we're so sure that we
know that the earth is round. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like the fact that we
almost keep talking about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we know, we know it
is you're dumb, you're dumb." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's just adding to the conspiracy," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's what I've been told to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That everyone's going
to tell me I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's against me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so it's this weird thing
where I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we just never gave them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any kind of credence before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we never paid any attention to them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hundreds of years ago when they said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, hundreds years, I think it was fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know, like not 1930s, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I don't know, they
didn't give fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Whatever, you're crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You have a nice day." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They wouldn't talk about it, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now, because it's so well discussed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's our world spoken about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it almost lends itself more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> confidence on more avenues, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to people who are susceptible
to stuff like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel the more we talk about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the more it just gives
that group of people power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Oh, you finally recognized us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes, we do exist." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I always
come from a place of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to understand the other side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you, do you understand? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I do kind of understand where they- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you think it comes from? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do you think it comes from? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How does the person get to like believing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in something like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, a lot of it, like I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is such a distrust of the system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where do you think it comes from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, where does the distrust
of the system come from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there's a lot of things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it could come from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A big thing is religion as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of flat-earthers you see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are very, very religious people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not to say that religion
is the core cause of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to fucking preface that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Religion, bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to preface that as someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who is religious myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's people who are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who distrust, like
distrust the government, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> distrust organizations so much that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> conspiracy theories to them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seem more palatable
than what everyone else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is telling them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they've grown up in an environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't trust what everyone
else is telling you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because everyone around them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is telling them that they're wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That only, like you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strengthens their views
and looks for more reasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for them to like believe in the system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Believe what they've come to believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sympathetic in some ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like even though,
yeah, you're right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, they don't trust in the systems, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> almost because I think in a lot of ways </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the systems have failed them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like systems that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we take for granted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we had good upbringings, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're very lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we had very ordinary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Lives," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had a good education, I suppose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're not unfortunate
enough to just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not have access to a lot of things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're told that certain organizations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or things should protect you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just to learn from these things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't, and they let you down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can understand why you'd
almost not trust these systems. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're supposed to be
put in place to help you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- So yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's tough, it's tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, which is why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like doing a show like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because especially on the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with how online discourse is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I said, last week, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people would know what they stand against, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but very few people know
what they stand for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just because
it's so much easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like prove someone else
wrong than prove yourself right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's come to a point
where I want to understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the other side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because one thing that's missing from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of online discourse
and online discussions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is people are trying to
fucking understand each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's just trying
to prove each other wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rather than having a healthy debate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think having an understanding
of the other side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the first step to
having a healthy debate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so if I can understand flat-earthers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then who the fucking on the
internet can't I understand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why I do this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If open conversations when
normalized on the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we'd all be driving flying
cars, you know, like yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But unfortunately we
are still on the ground. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It says a lot of our society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says a lot of our society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It says a lot of our society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can't even have an open conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about flat-earthers or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very dump. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But also extremely susceptible, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yes.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Any like war ever, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to convince your people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you want to fight something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you convince a whole
population of people that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, ask Hitler. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I believe this was
like really well-documented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> after world war two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, what if there's a very small, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but possible chance that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you have weapons of mass destruction? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm joking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or, they've got a bit of oil. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've got a bit of oil. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stock prices go boom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You like cars? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you like driving? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll find the video link, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt asked me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched this video
and it was by this guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was basically talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how we'll go to after world war two, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a few Jewish people who had fled, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and a few scientists who lived in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They wanted to study how
people could go along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like really bad atrocities
in like world war II, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What made your everyday
guy, like a normal dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just kind of like sign up and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, we'll we'll do this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the whole the Nazi party. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, how they just kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of the really horrible stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you could convince people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that this was the right thing to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was basically explaining how, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like certain
traits that one might have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which would make you more
susceptible to end up doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some personality traits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's stuff that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you wouldn't think correlates to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you think, "Oh, I'm
really strong-willed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But maybe you like strong leaders, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strong leaders to ask
you to do bad things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, maybe he's justified it
in a way that makes sense," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we all like to
think that we are like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, what's the word? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Impenetrable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Impenetrable, fortress of mind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that nobody can affect our opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or woo us to do something
that we would never do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think in reality,
we're a lot more fickle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It happens all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there is literally
a psychological experiment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a details that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember the exact
name of the experiments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's on Josh's Podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't exactly remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I roughly went a long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, Ashley, can you
search up the experiment? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] That's the prisoner one, yeah? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that one was bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not the prison,
that's the Stanford one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you explain it?
- Is it the electricity one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's the electricity one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's the one where. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Authority. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Basically they'll tell that there's happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it Milgram Experiment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what experiment you're talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'll turn up the electricity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because somebody tells them to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they say that it's like a good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but then they have like
a fake person screaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> while they're turning up the electricity, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and someone keeps telling
them to keep doing it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they keep doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a doctor or an authority figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is telling them to keep doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's basically like
fake "Squid Game", right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you're put into a room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why did you have to bring, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this is part of like the deepest
debate we were ever having. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And Garnt is like, "It's kind
of like a society we live in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You could've just said liar game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's better examples. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, Ashley.
- Okay, Ashley. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Ugh, I think it's
called the Milgram Experiment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Milgram's Experiment, that's it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I said, Milner, it's Milgram. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And basically the whole thing is framed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a memory exercise, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you, the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's the being
experimented on, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're told that you're going to take part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a memory exercise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're going to sit in a
room with a person next to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of you is going
to be the person learning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of you is going
to be the tester, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so what you're told is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you are given an electric shock, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you get an answer
wrong, then in theory, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you should be a better learner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because your doing like shock therapy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what you're told. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously, that's complete bullshit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this experiment's got nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do with a memory, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, one of you by chance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the learner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of you is the teacher, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the experimenter or the teacher. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in reality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to be given
the teacher, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you're the only
person who's actually being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experimented on, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so the other person who is the learner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goes in another room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have to give them
a memory quiz, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the problem is they're
going to get it wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's part of the design
of the experiments, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're shown, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're given a taste of
what the electric shock </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they're going to be
feeling feels like, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this like on the lowest level, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so as this experiment goes on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originally, they get the questions, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they get one answer wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so you have to administer
them an electric shock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they feel like pain, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you hear them feel pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't see it, but you
hear them in another room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it's just a prerecording. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then as they get more questions wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the scientist tells you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to up the voltage and
administer the shock, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they keep getting it wrong, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so the scientists keeps
telling you to up the voltage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and keep administering this
electric shock until to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like, they are fucking
screaming out in agony, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you can hear them on the
speaker screaming out in agony. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it gets to a point
when it's just silence, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just silence, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the scientists keeps telling you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just up the voltage. Up the voltage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Keep going, keep going." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like the amounts of people who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though they were totally
uncomfortable with the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they could hear someone
screaming from the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were administering
this electric shock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it still went silent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they went all the way up to the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they still administered
like the most high voltage in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their mind electric shock to this person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a big brain experiment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because we trust authority figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, it just proved that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the majority of people
will be willing to listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to a person who they view </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as an authority figure to
tell them to do something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if it's like a bad thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if it goes against
what they believe, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it's a horrible act. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a very interesting
psychological experiment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could be turned into a "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this kind of sounds like
a "Squid Game", right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally has nothing to do with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It kind of sounds like a "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The writers for season two
are like, "Write that down." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This literally has nothing
to do with "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Squid Game" season
two Milgram's experiment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This literally has nothing
to do with "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to see Milgram's experiment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and "Squid Game" season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shock game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's like actually a
shock, they actually die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> See, that's just goes to show how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many people who
say like I'm not gullible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we all are to a certain degree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel, we constantly get told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to do things that originally
go against what we believe in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or very easily persuaded by just someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if they don't have that
much of an authoritative, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibe about them to just be
like, "Oh, well, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this person who in my mind is
more authoritative about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> particular subject than I am, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is saying something." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the point, yeah,
you just trust them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the whole fact that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we have a literal audience
of people who will probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> change their mind about
something we say on the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something we say on our own channels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Animes maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I say so-and-so anime sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, there's probably a number
of people who are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, you're probably right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though I have zero authority
over that person, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know that happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's the opposite
has happened to me as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's happens to all of us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it happens to all of us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the reason why we have conflict. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> People are good at persuading people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like we're just breaking
down the most fundamental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> problem about humanity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "You are not me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've got like three deep conversations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on three episodes in a row now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is deep taste now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like deep talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Deep taste.
- Deep taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deep taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why you going to word it like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - We went from shitty to this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why you going to word it like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deep taste, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is deep in fancy font? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor And Garnt] Deep taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No wonder that sounds so gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's only gross if you make it gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you played Metal Gear Solid 1? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you played Metal Gear Solid 1? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never like caught on to this as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But remember when Snake gets a call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like a random person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't know who it is,
it's just static on screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He tells Snake to call him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just call me Deep Throat." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, how's
did I never registered that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the content? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Why did he tell him the
call him Deep Throat? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because he has a deep voice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's the reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As a kid playing I'm like,
that's a cool name, Deep Throat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the dominatrix
thing all over again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just going to be another thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hideo Kojima, do you
know what you're doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Or are you just like is your
mind is built differently? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He definitely plan that out for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Remember when he went
around to everyone to calm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Check this out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe it was a mistranslation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I came up with the best idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe it was a mistranslation who knows? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably not even a mistranslation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's probably a direct translation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because we don't call it that in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it was probably like
to a Japanese audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like, Deep Throat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like, "Wow." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Wow, that sounds cool."
- That's fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Hell yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Deep Throat.
- Deep Throat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey speaks in Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You sound like Japanese
Harry Potter, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is my favorite thing though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When they take like just
ridiculous English words, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like directly say it in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Japanese think it's the
coolest sounding thing ever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it sounds
goofy as fuck in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always also just Hideo Kojima, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That man is on one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. He's on one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Has any of you played a
"Death Stranding" yet? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- I really want to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I also really don't want to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's one of those games where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I see so many clips out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to play this just
to see this in context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like the first
trend type of game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just couldn't fucking believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that the final cuts
scene is two hours long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you have to understand, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You guys know, I don't like cut scenes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually like, I cannot play that game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can just imagine you getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to that final cut scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and the moment you press the skip button, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you miss about 5% of the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you even skip? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can just imagine
you starting the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're just like,
where's the gameplay start. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just walk in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where's the gameplay?
Where's the gameplay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That would be the angriest livestream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd have probably ever had to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would love to watch
your play "Death Stranding". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was going to say deep straining. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Deep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deep straining. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deep straining.
- Deep straining. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It didn't look very good. I don't think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dunkey enjoyed it, the
third time he played it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Third time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Third time.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and his like the most
monkey brain game after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No his not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He has more patience than me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it says a lot that
Dunkey enjoyed a game like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says a lot.
- Like he hates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says a lot about Dunkey.
- It says a lot about Dunkey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says a lot about Dunkey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he enjoys the "Death Stranding" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but he can't stand a single JRPG. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I understand though.
JRPG are mind numbing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to get into that topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've already spoken about
that like a million times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to.
JRPG is bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, he ruined it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was saying like, I love like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole thing about like Japanese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like directly translating
English names into Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the Japanese thinking it's cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Harry Potter characters
are a perfect example of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Like Dumbledore, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Really cool English name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dumbledore is not a cool man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I kind of fuck with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time I hear a Harry Potter character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said in a Japanese
pronunciation, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "How did that sound 10 times
goofier than the English name?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't think of Dumbledore now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> without thinking about the meme of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Of like the Dumbledore said calmly meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you write your name
on the Goblet of Fire? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That meme has physically
ruined those movies to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I cannot watch the "Goblet of Fire" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because all I will be doing
is waiting for that scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the moment it
gets to that scene you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> turn it off.
It's like, am satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll be like giggling away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And someone be like,
"What's wrong, Connor?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Nothing, you
wouldn't understand this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He said it so calmly.
- He said it so calmly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> In case you didn't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's this meme where like in the book </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like Stephen Fry's
narrating it going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "And Dumbledore said calmly," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it cuts to the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like someone edit it and then
it's just Dumbledore again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did you write your name
on the Goblet of Fire?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like, so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Stephen Fry] Did you put your name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into the goblet of fire, Harry? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Dumbledore] Harry,
did you write your name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> into the Goblet of Fire? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Please go and watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind of like the equivalent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a "Trash Taste" viewer saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "And then Garnt said, he prefers
bone on chicken, calmly." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Calmly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cut to the "Trash Taste" clip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was having a discussion yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've spoken a lot about
good Japanese food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can we speak about Japanese food that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking straight up sucks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Be my guest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - First of all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you think sucks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You go to the user card, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You boys are ordering, you
all like ordering, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're getting Gyoza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Gyoza is good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're getting maybe some Yakiniku, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Meat on a stick, right?
Great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yakitori, you mean?
- Yakitori, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you can get some Yakiniku, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And an Isekai, some fancy ass Isekai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you get some fried
chicken with the bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe someone orders
something and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, this is fried chicken, right?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, "Why is it tastes like bone?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's Tendons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] Cartilage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - For some reason they just
like deep fried cartilage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like the worst eating experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that shit, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, imagine greasy bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally greasy bones
is what it feels like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like your crunching a
small animals, bones with oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got insert dominance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree with you, Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put it there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Gentleman's agreement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a historical moment right there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They agree on something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't know how you like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If that's any consideration. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What happened to you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the man who would eat anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the man who will eat anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand you'll eat anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there has to be some
dishes where you got like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'll eat it. But life
is kind of whack." Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Olives. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- [Connor And Garnt] - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like fermented fish shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> chopped with fermented soybeans, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> love it can't get enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But Joe he's like, "Olives." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not like olives. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, Italians a crying, right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean like I like olive oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I like olive on pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why, what part is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it the seed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just too strong of a flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You like olive oil?
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like fucking
down a pint of olive oil </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on my spare time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you Italian? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> No, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shocker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I am wearing a lot of
references to an Italian guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but, no, am not Italian. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just came out of nowhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So Joey, he doesn't olives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll eat any kind of fermented shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but I draw the line on olives. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> One green boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey, the man who tried, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who tried like bird fetus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "I kind of fuck with it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Olive, "No, get that shit out of here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I say I don't like olives, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Green or black, both? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Green, mostly I don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Black olives I like actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Green are stronger, normally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Green is a little stronger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, and when I
say I don't like olives, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that if I get
a plate of green olives, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to eat it at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you seen that clip? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry to interrupt but, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just have this image
of Joey being that person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's shows a clip of
like a talk show or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the host goes, "Bring
out the olives," and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they bring out a jar of olives, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this woman just starts fucking losing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, it's the peaches, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's olives, it's olives. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw another one of like this woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who had like a deathly
phobia towards peaches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I didn't see that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like an Ellen
show and they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, so you'll definitely
afraid of peaches." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she says like
the scientific phobia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word for someone who's afraid of peaches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then behind them on the giant screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just a picture of a peach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And this woman just
screams out of the room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the audience is laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "This is horrible." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She literally just said
she doesn't like peaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got a clip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mary, you're let go of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [TV Host] Bring out the olives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Mary] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just imagine that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey screaming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so, finish your
point, finish your point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, my point was, when I
said I don't like a food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is very rarely a food
that I will just straight up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I said, I don't like a food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like, it wouldn't be
my first choice of eating it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if I'm at like a
house party or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like wine and cheese party
and I see some olives there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll fucking eat it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it comes with the thing, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if someone just gave
me some fucking olives, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and was like, "Eat it
now," and I'll be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why this makes me so angry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to say this, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, it's not my first choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I can live the rest of my life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not eating it and be completely fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I'd rather eat
olives than most Isekai food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've realized that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think now that I've
lived in Japan for a year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I've kind of come to like,
"Nobody likes Isekai foods." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very limited. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Williams are crying now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember when I first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I would never
get fucking bored of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And now two years in, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I have a proper meal please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it just kind of suck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because sometimes you just want to, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you want to eat healthy, but
it's impossible with Isekai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before anyone starts the think so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't go to like
Isekai every fucking day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm also like to the
point now where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could go an entire month
without eating Isekai food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like easily,
- We have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like every now and then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if I go to Isekai with
some mates, then yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll eat the food there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not going be the
greatest meal of my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the issue is right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's say you got a
British eating culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You have a meal and then
you have the drinks, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought, what was
cool about these Isekai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that there is a whole
eating culture around it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where you go to Isekai
you have a meal there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can drink
shocker at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Until I realized that
most easy kind of food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just basically snacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you're having a meal
basically just on like snacks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like a meal, meal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's still enough to fill you up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never go to an Isekai and get like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> satisfied with the meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It always feels like you just
ate like a bag of like Doritos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or something and that was
like your meal for the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's kind of what it feels like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't come out of Isekai going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I had a great meal." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You come out full. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You come out full, you
come feeling disgusting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you come out like, "Sh, I don't know." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. There's so many foods down there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just like, "This is bad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what fish it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just a toenail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's literally a toenail. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's the one thing
that Yaki always orders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck are they called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Scaped Fin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Scaped Fin is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just call them flat flops. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What are they called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The stingrays.
- Stingrays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The rays, the rays.
- Stingrays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, not stingrays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just rays.
- Rays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Flat flops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are the ones that
fly like this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - They bring this out, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks like a toenail, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Steve Owen like fucking
rolling in his grave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Steve Owen die from
a poisonous flat flop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like this fucking toenail
ass looking thing, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What does it, dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's dried stingray.
it's dried ray. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It comes out and you
have it and your like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it literally tastes like nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't taste of anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? It tastes like fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't even taste like fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It tastes like nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just chewy really hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why? Why are they storing it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's most like dried fish snacks here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some are more way
flavorful and nice though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Same with like the
shredded fish as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like the squid, "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fried squid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kind of like a "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fried squid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because you can get a
convening like 20 different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> variations of squid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Squid tastes good. I like squid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like squid.
- It's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, squid is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's another
thing that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like octopus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gooey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Takowasa? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that stuff is, oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's like it's octopus with Wasabi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You just put it in a blender. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, it's rough.
Oh, it's rough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's rough.
Oh, it's so rough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Joey of course the,
first time I came here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made me fucking eat it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's terrible.
- It's great, I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then half the menu you look at it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> am not eating this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's talk about fish semen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Have we talking about fish semen yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What's it called again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's the sperm sack.
- It's the sperm sack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shirako.
- Shirako. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every Japanese person will order Shirako </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for you to like try out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no one is going to tell you what it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you take your first bite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure that's
what I did with you too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> - I hope Santa use Manscaped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I prefer anything other
than that sperm sack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not that it's a sperm sack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> If sperm sacks tasted
good, I'd chow down on one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I got no resume. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's a Jojo fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - His just used to drinking sperm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's practically my job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing with Shirako. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the same thing with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which fish it from, by the way? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't tell you what one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who did this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is some foods I'm like, "Who? Who?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who opened this fish up, saw
like the reproductive organ, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like, "Bro, are
you going to eat that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan is a country that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, this fish is poisonous, bet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they spend
the next hundreds years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> training to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tiny little pod that
tastes like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you like sea urchin? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't like sea urchin, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, it's really strong flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair sea urchin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like one of the most like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not strong flavor.
- It's very strong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - sea urchin is one of the
most polarizing Sushi, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the Wasabi of fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like a gas attack
went off in your mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really.
- What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's literally called
the butter of the sea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's smooth as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is so strong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you actually talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think you ate sea urchin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have. I had sea urchin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you sure just didn't eat Wasabi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no.
I had a sea urchin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know you eat the
inside of the sea urchin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not the outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that the reason why I
didn't understand the sea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, auh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't understand what sea urchin was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Why is it
a paste? That's weird." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Until I went to a place
where they like crack </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that bad boy open in front
of me and scooped it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, mouth watering right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor, I can only
get so erect, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again, I had reservations against it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd had sea urchin before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't a fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a cool name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the coolest fishes
names out there in English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sea urchin.
- Sea urchin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It sounds like some Norse
god, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, oh, like salmon, I sleep, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sea urchin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like something died
to make this fish, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So, they crack it open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Again, like with Wasabi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't typically like Wasabi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's horseradish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's horseradish Wasabi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not a big fan of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I went to a place
and that gave real Wasabi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a chance." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was insanely different,
amazing, actually amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you don't like Wasabi,
try the real stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's insanely expensive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you get a chance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how it, it just came up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're not going to get the chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how it came up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just in a course and
they just brought it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like, you grind it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I don't know what am doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Asked me to grind a diamond. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They crack it open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They put it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It tastes like shit still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I wanted to like it so badly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it that you don't like about it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've given sea urchin to bunch of friends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who've come here because I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever friends come over and they say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I want to go eat some real Sushi". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you have to be open
to trying some shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're not going to get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, please, yeah.
- Thank you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You like sea urchin, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] I love sea urchin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, okay, I'll take
you to a Sushi place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you have to be open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to not just trying a
fucking California roll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you have to try like some weird shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So, are you prepared for that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I always give them sea urchin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like so far, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I think in my well with
my group of friends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been a 50/50. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Half of them, love it and the other half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> say that it's like two fishy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the problem with sea urchin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's really easy to
get bad quality sea urchin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's notoriously like one of the fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that can make you like sick and throw up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really easy to get bad quality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had bad sea urchin before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it tastes bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, if it's like really
good quality sea urchin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the fresher shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like bad oyster is really bad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but good oyster is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I love about-
- Okay, go ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you go ahead, you
can finish what you had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I love about sea
urchin is that it literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how I can describe it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it literally feels like
you are eating the sea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kind of what it
feels like to me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- The whole ocean and all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree.
- The whole of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because it's fishy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it also has like a salty texture too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a bit sweet as well.
- It's a little bit sweet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like really good sea urchin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of like downing some sea water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it tastes actually nice.
It's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never heard somebody describe it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in such unappetizing way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you could take
the essence of the sea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and put it into a food
that would be sea urchin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's weird, right?
What his saying, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, see Meilyne agrees.
- Meilyne hears me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne is a real one.
Meilyne is a real one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meilyne is just inclined
to just disagree with me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think on a professional basis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I go to like a Sushi restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the Sushi chef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is it you call the Sushi chef? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sushi chef? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Sushi chef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you master that?
Master Meilyne. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sushi chef are masters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you go to restaurants where, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you can go to the conveyor
belt ones, which are good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they are too cheap,
pretty easy with the guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or you can go to ones
where it's like a course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You sit in front of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at lunch menu, it's
only pretty cheap in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I've gone there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always when sea urchin comes up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, first of all, I
never ever waste the Sushi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if the guy's right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't dare be like, "No, I'm okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like that is like a sin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you can not look this guy in the eye </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who is been there like 20 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I'd rather like
slap his wife in the face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that refuse the Sushi, honestly, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, like the sea urchin comes out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and the thing is sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it's a really small restaurant, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they watch you eat it and they
want to hear you say like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, it's amazing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't mind because most of the time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> shit slaps and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, there's another one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a good one. Keep it coming." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He don't miss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, this is good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that macro.
(Connor grunting) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Bring up the next one. Like I'm ready." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, fuck, oh, it's sea urchin, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, well, get the water ready? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get the green tea ready? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just like put it all in
one and I'm like, "Mm-hmm." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But most places like that,
they tell you beforehand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what fish you like and
what fish you don't like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, shit going so fast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know what
they're saying half the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so, life hacks for
people coming to Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even want what's the
sea urchin name in Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I forgot.
- [Joey and Garnt] Uni. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Uni, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Uni, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Most places that
aren't conveyable Sushi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like a set course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The chef will usually, if
it's a good restaurant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll come out and tell you
what fish do you not like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they're not
going to fucking waste it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on someone who doesn't like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm wasting this man's ingredients. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So next time just say like, "No uni." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Part of me is like,
I paid for this course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm eating this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even give a
fucking if I don't like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm eating this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to show full appreciation
to this guy and his craft. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Even if I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you can, by telling them that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't know if am
going to eat this fish." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think there
was no bigger compliment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than me being like, "Boss man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest of this food was banging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you have faith in this, am eat it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I was a chef, I've
rather you just straight up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> tell me what fish you don't want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe am too British.
I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Am too British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rather than sitting
there and watching you go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I wouldn't dare pull a face, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a face. It's mild discomfort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> before the moment I put it in my mouth, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's stone-cold face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I kind of have that
with Shirako as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> As a British person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It is not an option to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't want that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Or like "I don't eat that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was in this restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We missed the fact that
Shirako was part of the course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like this like seven course meal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the sperm sack, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was a sperm sack in
the hotel we were staying at. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We missed the part that was Shirako there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they put it in front of
us to like with me and Sydney. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, "Oh,
oh no, it's this thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Sydney doesn't know what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let her eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, do I tell her? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or do I not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a loving partner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did tell her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, she's not going to eat it 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's not going to eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I thought she was like me, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought she'd be like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll still eat it because
it's Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to show respect." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she's like, "I'm
not fucking eating it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I told you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Throws the chopsticks on the ground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is after me
psyching myself up, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And, I'm just like, "Okay,
I can deep throat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a deep throat this
fucking sperm sack right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> My favorite Metal Gear Solid character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That will be a solid music
playing in this man's ear. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor singing guitar rhythm) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt just turns to Sydney goes like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Call me Deep Throat." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt breathing heavily) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like swallow it in one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Isn't it like a string? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, isn't it like a bunch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a bunch, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like swallowing a fallopian tube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically what you're swallowing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it is like a bunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I found a way to like
fucking expand my throat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I channeled all my inner Jojo
fandom at that point, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, " I'm a
deep throat this in one." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I fucking did like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. It's done. Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, you do yours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she's like, "Have it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Sydney eat it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm not going
to fucking eat it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "You want to tell the
people I'm going to eat it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm not telling the people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We're going to finish our fucking food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not going to show disrespect." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, "Do it. You can do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "No,
I'm not going to do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just like a game of chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sydney, do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sydney, eat the sperm sack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt, you eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then in the end I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fine. I'll fucking do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And on that day, I deep
throated two fish sperm sacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a two loads now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a PV bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I never want to do it again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit did not sit
right in my stomach, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But okay. Here's the question though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you the type of person who gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conceptually grossed out by food? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I don't. Just off the premise alone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I won't ever have like a
yes or no answer to eating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I never told you ever
that Shirako was sperm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's slimy.
It's too slimy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't do slimy and it's a problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's too creamy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It has this really weird after taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That is what like set my stomach up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it creamy, Garnt?
Is it creamy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's creamy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was really creamy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Shirako surprisingly, is
really, really fucking creamy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's creamy.
It's viscous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Sikhye. Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what the taste
and the texture of Shirako </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is exactly what you think it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What can I say, it's creamy,
it's slimy, it's viscous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shirako is the fancy name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fish nut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing that I have
just realized is my weakness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like anything that's slimy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really struggled with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not the first person though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Am just saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I don't know like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clearly I just haven't been raised to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> slimy things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I never had slimy things in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I did. I feel
like I've been debugged. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I don't blame anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who doesn't like things like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Okra or Natto or Shirako
anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if you didn't
grow up with that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like eating snot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it is like too close to
the consistency of snot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And semen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We get it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You deep throat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You deep throat two sperm sacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, when you go to a ryokan, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a meal, like a
set meal in Japan, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get a lot of food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to just call it
like levels, not courses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like level one through three, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always the most painful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always cold and
it's always slimy food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that counts first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why they've done this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not all of it is slimy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Some of it's slimy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been to some places where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> some guy woke up and was like,
"Every meal must have slime." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I went to one ryokan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like every meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I can't wait for the next. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I wonder what it will be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Turns out more slime stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Come on.
I can't get a win man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But like always there's at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get like four little dishes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Two of them will be cold,
jelly, slimy, guaranteed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why they're obsessed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with putting slimy stuff there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan is weirdly
obsessed with the jelly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're like a Nickelodeon kid, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, they have more slime than them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese are the ones who watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Nickelodeon Guts went
and, "It looks delicious." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They like seeing this Nickelodeon slim </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> being poured out, they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck, they're wasting so much food." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Eating it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like we do have like very
traditional Japanese foods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are either slimy or gelatinous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's a shame. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really want to give it a good go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I eat it most of the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but with much pain with great difficulty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I absolutely do not blame anyone who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't like that side of Japanese cuisine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is a tall hurdle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you weren't raised on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can confidently say
that I would not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Natto or Okra or anything
gelatinous or anything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I didn't grow up with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just because yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time you put it in your mouth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "This
shouldn't be in my mouth." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This should be up someone's nose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is like discomforting at times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like
something, am like, "No." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Something grilled, "Okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I like cold things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just cold slimy things, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the only thinks that I don't like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's worse a hot slimy
thing or a cold slimy thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hot slimy thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's hot slimy thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What is the hot slimy thing dish? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You put Natto on a microwave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just like accentuates
the fucking smell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That sounds horrible. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you imagine microwaving Natto? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You do, isn't like Natto
come in microwave packs, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it comes frozen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So you have to microwave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] What? You like frozen Natto? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey and Garnt] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Frozen Natto? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meilyne's angry because
someone bought frozen matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] Disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's why I put
it in a microwave Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] You don't microwave it, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meilyne is really angry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Meilyne is really angry at Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something has just sent Meilyne off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never heard of Meilyne
interrupted an episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor And Garnt]
That is the first time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've heard Meilyne interrupted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If she wants to interrupt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she'll hold a sign that says, "Incest," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but microwave Natto, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's where she draws the line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's where she has to step in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm a let you finish?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, fuck, I wish I liked Natto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- I wish I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's like healthy food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is extreme health. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to get it on that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing is that most
of these like gelatinous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or slimy dishes are so goddam healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they have so much good stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I wish I could eat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How'd you feel about insects then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel that's an incest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Question to you Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do you feel about incest? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Speaking of slimy things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Insects, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that water bug smelt vile. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's because it was viral. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've no qualms about eating it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'll try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you didn't try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. You didn't try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I had to I'll try it.
I'm not going to like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when Garnt had to do the forfeit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Let me
try," you didn't try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Am not going to if I don't need to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You literally just said,
"If given the opportunity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will try it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I was in a spot where you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Connor, on this course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is a the sandwich of locust." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "All right, I'm
going give it a shot." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the difference between that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone next to you
having a water bargain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Social pressure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It might be the only time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Social pressure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the reason why most
people make most mistakes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in their lives, social pressure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically it's the British in you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> who isn't capable of saying, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 100%. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And in front of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you'd rather just do
it, even though you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, God, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd rather eat my own toenail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than appear socially awkward
for more than four minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not even a question in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> There's something about table manners. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's very British, isn't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is very British. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's something about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not being rude at the table especially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like big in my mind that I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can not be rude at a table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a British thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or is that just like a sensible thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do because in my head,
like I'm not British, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I have the exact same thought of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't be rude at the dinner table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like doing things
like correctly as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Whenever I meet like
friends parents or stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll always make like quadruple sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like dinner polite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't matter what
they put on my plate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> If I'm dying, I will eat it just to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't it's a British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just common sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Say you're at a restaurant
and the waiter is rude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the waiter makes the wrong order </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something happens in
that restaurant experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is unpleasant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you say something to the waiter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
Do you call management? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It really depends on how bad it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's my least favorite thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is making a scene in a restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is the one thing you
will never catch me on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's nothing that will
make me dislike a person more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than if they have a complaint </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that I feel is like completely invalid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're getting the waiter
over to like do something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, if you're getting the waiter over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone better have shit
on your fucking dish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'd better be something
wrong with the fucking dish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I have like a limit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if there's more flies
in my soup than soup, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then yeah I'll obviously
fucking say something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You get a meal, there's
a hair on your food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just take the hair out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's what I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because in my head I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I'll call the waiter, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll say to the way that
there's a hair in my soup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fucks waiter going to do about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Be like, "Oh my bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me get it for you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As much as I want to be like okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I wouldn't lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It makes me a slightly
uncomfortable, even to think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's part of the dining experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Once you find a hair
and your soup, that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no going back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no saving the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is hair in your soup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Calling the waiter isn't
going to make the situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, POV another scenario, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You're at the dinner table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Two of you have hair in your food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Both of you tell waiter? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like that ups
the ante a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'll just look and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh my hair is a little bit longer." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just making like a joke out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also it depends on like
the restaurant, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you have these kinds of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If am at McDonald's I'll
just buy another burger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not going to ask them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes you're at a restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and the restaurant's busy as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just like, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this doesn't excuse it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But it seems it's going to be more effort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to call someone over
and complain about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Than just try and enjoy the fucking meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it's like an empty restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm the only one in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was a hair
on my soup or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like something horrible happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then maybe I might call the waiter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I know that the
waiter is more free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if it's a packed restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, stop everything you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a hair on my soup." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are some times, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pretty common mistake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The waiter get your order wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now do you say that you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they got your order wrong
or do you just eat the food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be sad that they got your order wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey and Garnt] It depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now it depends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you waited 15, 20 minutes for the food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, excuse me, I got
the wrong food, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you like at some of these
restaurants where you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there for half an hour to 45
minutes, you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I am not waiting another
fucking half an hour." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just going to eat this
food and leave a bad review </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just be done with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, that heavily depends for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, how different is
this to what I ordered? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If we're talking like $50 steak, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they bring out a $10
appetizer, that's your meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Hold up, hold up." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But if it's like a $50 steak
versus like a $45 burger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> then I'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You know want, maybe I was
in the mood for a burger." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not inherently value. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more like, do I
feel like proportionally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm getting something
that I would also enjoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's also have the same capacity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I order the steak or a burger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you bring out the soup
of the day or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "We are not the same." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have a fundamental problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because also another thing is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if are you with a group
of friends as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because sometimes it happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes someone gets
the order wrong, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you have to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wait for that guy to also get his order, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then finish his food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then like at that point
you don't enjoy the meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because everyone's sitting there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> staring you to finish your meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because everyone's already finished. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - These are all the things to consider. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just read the room and you'll know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's right to call the waiter or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The British way is 99% out of 100. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 99 out of 100 times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't call it the waiter over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You just sit down and deal with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you set the restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on fire afterwards or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Easy, just don't go
back to that restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Back when you were like single, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you could go on a date, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did you eat stuff like
wings in front of your date? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like stuff that gets like a little messy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You would like no fucks given. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- Okay, I thought so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanted to make sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I seem like a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to not eat wings in front of my date? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, you seem like you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would.
- You would eat wings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd eat wings of the
ground in front of my date. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And be like totally oblivious
to the fact that she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Wow, he looks like a toddler." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you like me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Joey is just like bibed up,
like fucking sauce all over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Joe's like, "So, what
do you do for a job?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You strike me as that guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am that kind of guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need like a fucking alignment chart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like trash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Members of "Trash Taste", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who would eat wings in front of that date? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like on far end
of the spectrum be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes, I would absolutely." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't give a fuck who you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm in the mood for wings, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I eating fucking wings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Connor orders,
wings, and doesn't eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I'm just going to enjoy the smell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - At best I would get a
tissue and hold the end of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like a hamster holder, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's trying to like get the meat off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without making like lip contact. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> breaks out the knife
and fork to eat wings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would try and do that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I would get frustrated, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'd be like tissue time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll get a tissue on
the source on the end, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and am I'll try. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile, the most common courtesy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give to my date is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give them a word of
warning before hand and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can I start eating these
wings? All right. Cheers." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I've definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had an experience where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been eating something
with a knife and fork, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I've had like a mental breakdown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Listen, I'm I can't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just going to do it with my hand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you okay with that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It might get a little messy, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm doing it fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I'm fine eating my
wings with a knife and fork. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually prefer to eat a lot of wings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with knife and fork.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How can you get in there
and get the the shit off? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like chaos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've perfected the technique. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just some anime fucking power move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I've been
eating wings all my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes I just don't like
getting my hands dirty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially with like wings
that have a lot of sauce on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have some wings with
a lot of sauce in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't get that smell off your fingers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if you like wash it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that smell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It feels sticky. If
you go to the toilet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you wash your hands with soap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you all have that like feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It reminds me of a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Little sticky fingers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That meal was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking hell, disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I get a little bit
of sauce on my face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "All right,
now the shackles are off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no holding back." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going all in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not holding back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't care how much mess
gets on my face anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I say, if the girl gets put off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> by the fact that you got
some wing sauce on your face, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she wasn't right for you to begin with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Off your Jojo fantast.
The guy gets put off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The best girl will be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I still like him, even
though he's like a animal," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Find the one that is
right for you gentlemen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what is weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I'm eating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously, I was always told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it was rude to put your
elbows on the table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it something you were told as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I was told. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wasn't told that.
- Oh my God, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe I was and I just didn't listen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're eating, like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's rude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I mean, I've just never done that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt's like, "I was born civilized." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I eat with my elbows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I would always like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I do is normally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm meeting with like
a fork or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like keep my hand
on my lap or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, in Japanese cuisine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to put your hand on the table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was told in Japan is rude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It has something to do with like old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in the day with
concealed weapon or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put your lap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I eat, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got my hand like this
and I got my hand down here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> under the table on my whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I was told that it's
rude to do that in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to have your hand like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while you eat on the table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I constantly got told by my mom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to put my hand on my table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it goes back to that whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of back in the old age where like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you had your hand under the table, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you could hide a concealed weapon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can just have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, when you're eating with someone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A modern problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not a modern problem, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why you'll see in a lot of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scenes in anime or Japanese
TV or like old movies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why the other hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they usually holding the
rice ball or holding a bowl, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> having their hand on the table </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because of that whole tradition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not really a modern problem nowadays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's like having tattoos in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like indicative
of the Yakuza, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Supposedly, even though it
didn't start with the Yakuza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It started with firefighters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, when I interviewed
the ex Yakuza member, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously, we go onto the
topic of tattoos, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the guy's
fucking covered in tatts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he told me that originally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> firefighters during the Edo
period would get tattooed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, why firefighters? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, so that
if they die in a fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's easy to identify the body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, they put it in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That took a fucking dark turn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I'm like, that
took a fucking dark turn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But then he put it into
perspective being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's also just a matter of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you having that tattoo
back in the older days, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was an honor because that just showed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> undying proof that you are doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a very dangerous job to
save other people's lives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some reason
over the course of time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the Yakuza, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like how you'd get tattooed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you enter jail and
stuff like that, as a mark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just slowly turned into
like a negative connotation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where now today, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any Japanese person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like a fucking
little tiny star tattoo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the back of their palm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is considered a Yakuza member. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's gone to the point where like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't obviously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hot springs it's like a common one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you can't even into like public pools. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't go to some
beaches if you have tattoos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - My gym like I mentioned
is Anytime Fitness, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You can't go to gym. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the only sign on the wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is an English is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dear all international members." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not even like Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dear all international members, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> please cover up any tattoos
that you might be showing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's weird because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think about it logically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just because you have a tattoo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't mean that
person is a psychopath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the Yakuza and all that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's that whole mental image of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, they're such a bad person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they put some ink in their body." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's this weird stipulation
of tattoo equals Yakuza now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is so dumb,
especially when it comes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The one I don't understand
is when that same rule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> applies to foreign here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that is kind of odd. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do realized Yakuza was
like a Japan thing only, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right, guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It say a lot about Japanese society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It say a lot about Japanese society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It say a lot about society. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The absolute state of Japanese society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt said this meme wasn't funny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yet here he is giggling
away to himself saying it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How the tables have turned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We know what this episode
is going to be called now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because we've said it
about 5 million times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The memes that aren't funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> become funnier the more
you just keep saying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Squid Game", see you just laughed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> He just laughed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's pretty funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the Yakuza guy was
saying that it's, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was just laughing at "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Yakuza guy was just saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he put into like really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I asked him like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you think about the
whole light tattoo stigma? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "Oh,
it's fucking stupid." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, because the whole
point of a Yakuza tattoo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is we put in tattoos not to show people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but to conceal it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a massive difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The people who want to show tattoos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's got nothing to
do with fucking Yakuza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yakuza isn't going to go around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking being like
check out my tatts, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, they don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And until Japanese people understand that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think the stigma's
ever going to go away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd like to think it's starting to go away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because young people now
in Japan are getting tatts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they don't give a fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think the new generation of Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are more open to the idea of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> foreigners and just, things like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very mush so.
- Yeah. It's very much so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, Japan has been
Americanized for decades now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Almost centuries now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I feel it's only just recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where they look at American
celebrities and singers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are covered in tatts and they go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they can do that,
maybe we can do that too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who the knew that maybe
just because you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a Justin Bieber tattoo, it
doesn't make you a Yakuza member. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of our exposure
to like Japanese society </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> comes from the older generation, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they have all
the power in government. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I actually have no idea
about what the youths in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are like thinking and
how much of an effect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean you walk down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shinjuku Shibuya anytime
of the day or night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And you'll see young people
covered in tatts all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Japanese people covered
in tatts all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know this is kind of off topic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember like someone told me that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when Avengers came out, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you do press tours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Apparently it was really
difficult for Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to come here because he had
a criminal record in the US. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But he's not doing it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just kind of shows that it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no room for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think other countries
are similar as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you have a criminal
record, they won't let you in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's just kind of like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Japan is definitely
the type of country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you make one mistake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You are dead to the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's shocking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It doesn't matter how much you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to try and redeem it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or try and like change your image. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're better person
and your a fixed person now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You make one mistake you're fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The one thing that is really worrying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that like a lot of the laws, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like punishments
was vividly surrounding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like creep crimes I'll say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Creep crimes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know like being a Sukebe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or being a pervert, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or being caught taking
pictures of people in places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Punishment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you seen how little you have to pay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of them are like $20 fines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> $20, what's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a Saturday night out with the boys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if they're going to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They have so many stalkers here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because they just face no repercussions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like stalking someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because unfortunately
in a lot of cases in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's not physical harm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is a result of the crime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's not even considered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't take into consideration that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can be mentally scarred for a crime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's still having
real life repercussions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they just think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, but did he touch
you? Did he stab you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did he hurt you in any way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll get over it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no, because some people
don't fucking get over it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's pretty fucking traumatizing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some young women to get creeped on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting their photos taken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most likely being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leaked on the internet
without them knowing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then for the fucking law
system to turn around and go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, you'll get over it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nearly every single Japanese woman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've spoke to had some horrible experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of someone being a pervert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nearly every Japanese woman, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and nearly pretty much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> every foreign woman as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Has had a creepy experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure Sydney has some as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aki definitely had
some and it's horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's actually like terrifying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucked up and I don't
know how to change it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even our country to change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so weird for me
hearing the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to Japan and if
you buy a phone in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there is no silent option
when you take a picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you buy a phone in Japan,
no matter what handset it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's a Japanese handsets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you cannot turn off the
sound of the shutter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when it takes a picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, my phone is that, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> My phone's on silent right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (phone beeps) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It made just like that sound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In many ways you hear
about that in isolation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you think, "" Well, that's
good, you're protecting people," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what did it take for it
to get to that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we had to then keep the shutter on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How rampant was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The fact that Japan, as far as I know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is one of the only countries
on earth that has widespread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> adoption of female only carts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Only during a certain time though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I feel completely
takes away the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of a female only cart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> If you ask me, because it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, then I just have
to avoid these times." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And am sure in other countries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that women would welcome that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For it to be done, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have to be done,
says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like me personally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't want to raise
a daughter in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would be scared to death
of like letting her go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on the train or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the other problem as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that a lot of the parents here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not that I'm trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to tell Japanese parents
how to be parents, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> considering I'm not one myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think the problem is
that a lot of the parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also just don't teach their daughters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what to do during those situations, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel like you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ask any American
parent or Western parent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if their daughter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were to get into a horrible situation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like teach them some self-defense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like trying to defend
themselves in any way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they possibly can, to make a statement, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not fucking afraid
of you. Like back off." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> In Japan though, they don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there's no repercussions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if they get caught. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, they're just like,
if I just ignore it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> then maybe it'll go away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But it doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If a guy is jacking
off to you on a train, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you punch him in the face in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then you're the one
that gets into trouble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then you're the asshole because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're the one who
initiated physical violence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, in the eyes of the police, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're the one who initiated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you can make the argument of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, it's self-defense," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the law will turn around and go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, he wasn't technically hurting you." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also do you have proof
that he was doing these acts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's sad, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is a fundamental problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like maybe they're
trying to change the law. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe they don't give
a fuck. I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But either way it's messed up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's more messed up that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again, the parents are not teaching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> needs to be more
protection for women here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Women only carts is minimum protection. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The fact that we have
to have women only carts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it shouldn't have got to that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And even then it's
not solving the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not a solution. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Pretty much every female I've
talked to has had a story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> has a story now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was a TV show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was watching and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally called
Chikan Hunters or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was literally like a show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like four undercover
cops would just go on a train. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is just real cameras
and was like GoPro footage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But of course, because it's in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, Chris Hans in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But of course in Japan, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So everything is censored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You, literally cannot see anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they're on a train with a GoPro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because of Japan they don't
like to show people on TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't see anything in this train. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They've blurred it out, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But to distinguish who the pervert is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and who the victim is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're just blue blurs and a pink blur. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And you can't see what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's absolutely shitty TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What channel is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was maybe 3 Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - TBS? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - TBS? Don't know which channel it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I only really watch like three, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't watch NHK.
NHK is boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> First of all, I was like,
this is a terrible production. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they found like four dudes doing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in like one day and
like the same like cart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They would have to get camera
footage of them doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like multiple times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to prove that it wasn't accident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they could do the whole bump </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and touch some ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they would have to like
catch them multiple times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I didn't know what they did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I assume they just gave him
like a slap on the wrist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they wouldn't show
their face or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just like, you wonder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well, clearly like this
punishment isn't effective. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if you've shamed them for doing it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would it help a little bit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's also like, is it fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to ruin someone life over that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, probably not, it's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Also there was like 20 cops </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like one dude touching a girl's ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "I think you
don't need this many cops." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think one, maybe two is enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think two cops can handle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one pervert. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think you need,
like a whole entire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The dude is not like 9
ft tall and like 500 lb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think one person can handle it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's crazy, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So they have the four undercover
detectives on this train, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then they find the guy, they come out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it was like eight more police, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> escorting this one guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like yeah, you got to arrest him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> If you want some backup,
I totally understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like how much do you need? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how much tax payer
money is going towards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> those 12 dudes arresting that one guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To some of those cops, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh finally, my first actual job." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The fine doesn't even cover </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> his walk from the train
to the train holding room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the police time wasted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't even cover the
fine they gave this dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking stupid as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure if we went through UK police, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or any UK laws or Australian laws, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure we could find another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10,000 million things to criticize about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But we're in Japan and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is what's on our mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, that was a societal
deep conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want be dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode did say
a lot about society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This one said a lot about how society </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is kind of like "Squid Game", huh? </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> We started talking about animes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That lasted what? Five minutes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I like that "Trash Taste"
is lighthearted and fun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes I do like talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> some things that are not so fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm human. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an interesting
conversation to have I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And especially when done it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need more people
to talk about society. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> - Because society is
saying a lot right now. </SPEAKER_01>
