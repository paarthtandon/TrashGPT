<SPEAKER_06> - They would do this thing at my pool, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where they would have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to learn how to kayak in the pool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like in the pool? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, they would they would
put six kayaks in the pool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just let people kayak around it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know how this happened, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but after the kayakers left, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a shit in the pool? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, they're in kayaks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> How do they get in the pool? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kids are fucking weird, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kids are weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (gentle upbeat music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am your host for today, Garnt, Grant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the fuck you wanna call me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and with me, as usual, is the boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The boys.
- The boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know it's really selfish
of you to have that name, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's really inconvenient for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm texting about you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It keeps auto correcting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It want's to keep correcting it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You know how inconvenience
that is to me, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how inconvenient it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it auto-corrects my own name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm referring to myself? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's even more inconvenient, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause when you look up Garnt
on like Wikipedia it goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my fucking Wikipedia?
- Yeah, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like fucking tin foil hat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you look up, I think it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw it on the subreddit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, when you look up Gigguk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is Gigguk's real name? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey Bazinga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bazinga, sorry.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bazinga.
- I fucking said it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've known each other for how long? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So how are you doing boys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You guys don't know this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's been like a three-week break </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> since we last recorded through
the magic of scheduling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You wouldn't have had a break at all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah, it's been three weeks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since we last had a recording.
- Yeah, I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had a three week break, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Because, well, you went
on journey across Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went on journey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> across Japan.
- A broad and a man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A broad and a man.
- A broad and a man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] A broad and a man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I also hung out with
Chris before that in Kyoto. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was like kind of
like an awkward timing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where it was like three weeks
where we couldn't record. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I don't know, it's
been a nice refresh, I'd say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Came back and... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sick of fucking seeing
you guys. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every week, Jesus man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it's 'cause I think normally, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> especially when we did
three episodes in one week, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that's what we
did to allow us to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> On the last episode I was like fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> what are we we're talking about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only so much I
can chat shit, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we're chatting shit every day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like three times a week or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's not like we're all going out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing like interesting
things every day, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like five days out of a week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just in our room like
just working on videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean we talked
about this earlier, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like how do like streamers
who stream every day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like, what do they talk about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause sometimes when we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than one recording a
week, sometimes I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the fuck
to talk about sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what's going on new with you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, the barrel is very shallow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the bottom is just there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's going on new? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, playing games? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, you're playing Apex. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, just like last week? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, cool.
- And what am I supposed to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> if like the police don't
stop me once a week, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like what am I supposed to talk about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need to commit a
crime to make a story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like running out of stories, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like if you're streamer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you've got to be talking
about the other streams, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that happened (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just gotta like watch YouTube
videos, that's about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some had this, really
funny name last stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> called, Peepee Poopoo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> That was a really fun moment. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me drag that out for 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how much
I'm allowed to talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> journeying across Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I think at this point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's probably-
- It's free promo Chris. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's probably, not even out yet, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I think the trailer
will be out by then. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So if you wanna check that out, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's a teaser, Joey won't
say everything that happened, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure.
- Just go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and watch the videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah just go watch the videos, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally came back yesterday
as of us recording this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah-
- How was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was it-
- Oh it was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hype it up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Hype it up for Chris.
- I'll hype it up. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, I'll hype it up for Chris. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Journey across Japan two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I should probably explain
what Journey Across Japan is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Journey Across Japan is a
series that Chris Broad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's been on the show a couple of times- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me guess, you go across Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We go across Japan- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna say, it
kind of speaks for itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a show we do
together on Chris' channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> where we go across
Japan, do like challenges </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and like go visit cool places in Japan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And Journey Across Japan Three, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is like the third one we just finished, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> where we went through Kyushu, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like the most
Southern island in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Awesome because I'd never
been to Kyushu, like at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And just this past week, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I went through all the
prefectures of Kyushu in one go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Speed running tourism. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah we were speed
running Kyushu, literally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like how Chris took you
around all the amazing places, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and he took me to like
the shittiest place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did he? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Didn't you go to like a
gin factory or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No 'cause, we did go to a gin factory, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was that like the highlight? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the highlight, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just got to drink really
nice gin, that was like free, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like-
- Oh that's cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, then you can just be
like, make me this cocktail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they made it, which is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is like just a power
trip that I needed in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you've already been to Kyoto, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've been once before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But he found this Welsh town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Welsh British town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an hour-
- In Kyoto? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In like an hour in the
mountains in Kyoto, drive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wow.
And it was, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah, it was pretty shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was good, but it was just kinda like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> really underwhelming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it just like home or? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weirdly, weirdly yeah.
- Did you feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> culturally appropriated in it? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this how people feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when they see white
people wearing kimonos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like this kind of cool,
but like what's going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like why?
- I also wanted you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, "Oh God, this is so shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just reminds me of home." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, yeah basically. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel bad dogging on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just kind of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was really bizarre and like
underwhelming, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But also the fish and chips
is $22, which is criminal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I'm sure like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how it feels
like for say like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone who lived in China
going to like China town, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I mean, it's kind of
different, though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it?
- There's always like markets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and restaurants, right?
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like Chinatown is
never like, this actually China. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, describe to me
this Welsh town then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So there was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, what about it made it Welsh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All the buildings looked
like they were just pulled out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a small town in Wales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just really old style, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like the places where you'd
find in like West Wales, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was just really strange, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's like, I didn't particularly- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Was like everything
written in Welsh or? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Well, one
of the pubs was called, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Pond Oak and pond means bridge in Welsh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At least they were
accurate about it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That was pretty cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are people fucking
sheep around the corner? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No I was there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a deer, bring your own sheep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just pretty sure I'm really
sarcastic about everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like this is the one
time where I can be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time to actually become
sarcastic about something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and no one can correct to me
'cause I'm fucking British. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is my culture now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome to my culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It probably wasn't as offensive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as the first time I went to
a Outback Steakhouse, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, is this
what Australia is to everyone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking boomerangs on the wall everywhere? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, just like in an Australian home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't really know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I'm pretty, I kinda
bash on every culture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I by far bash on my own culture </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> more than anything.
- Well, that's good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because if it was anything else, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if it was anything else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it'd be really bad to say right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Americans be like, "Oh really?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm pretty harsh-
- A fucking vein </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> popping out their head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty harsh on Americans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I'm more harsh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the UK-
- I feel like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just part of
British culture, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you rag on everyone equally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but you especially rag
on your own culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like for some reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when someone else rags on
your culture, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no only I get to complain
about my culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> thank you very much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the one-time
everyone becomes patriotic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like being British </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't really complain anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone fucking mocks British people now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you kinda just get used to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, yes, honey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, you made another British
meme, bottle of water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, yes, honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like self-deprecation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just part of British
culture, and British mentality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's such an amazing fall though, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, especially on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like remember like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The rise and fall of British culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because remember in like 2015, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was fucking obsessed
with British culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and now everyone's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, innit is the English form of desu." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's just 'cause,
the internet has just realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what British people actually sound like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - To be fair, I always wondered
that When I was growing up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like no one sounds
like this around me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone in the UK doesn't
sound like Harry Styles? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember growing up, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when I the world gonna realize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that people don't sound like
they do in Harry Potter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or every other like British film, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or like "Doctor Who" or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just waiting for the day
that everyone realizes that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not everyone in Australia that
looks like Chris Hemsworth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Debatable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I know like two people
and they look, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're one of them, you look close enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To Chris Hemsworth?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You get ripped, you'll
look like Chris Hemsworth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, if I get ripped I'll
look like Jason Mamoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you waiting for, Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell me what else did you
get up to then in Fukuoka, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can tease for us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I can tease, well, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Journey Across Japan, so
there's always a theme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So like the first
Journey Across Japan was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Was cycling.
- Yeah, was Chris cycling, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I was just on one part of it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But then the second Journey Across Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I was there fully for it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was called "Escape to Fuji." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So the theme of it was
we went around Mount Fuji </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like all the cool places
we can go to Mount Fuji, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because Chris had never seen
a nice view of Mount Fuji, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in his life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> So he's never taken one of
those like touristy photos. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And he kept like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently his audience
kept sending him pictures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of amazing views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Hey look, Chris,
I was here for two days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I got an amazing view of Mount Fuji" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can check it out now, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can check it
out now, it's all there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the third Journey
Across Japan is called, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "The Lost Islands," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the Kyushu area
has all these like tiny- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Jurassic park, here man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even though like the
fucking promotional artwork, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> looks like a fucking shitty movie poster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a (indistinct), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I said shitty, it looks amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, yeah so the Kyushu area, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's almost like an
archipelago of just these, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like insane amount of tiny-
- Wait, what was that word, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sorry?
- Archipelago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Someone needs to whip out a dictionary, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is that?
- An archipelago it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is like a group of islands, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is like a group of islands.
- I've never heard of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not even gonna pretend to be smart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I did not know that word, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - An archipelago is
basically like a group, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of lots of small islands-
- When did you learn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that word Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you learn it before the trip? (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I learnt it...
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is not a common word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I learnt it in school. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's in like films. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you guys know that word? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You guys knew that word? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you know that word Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - An archipelago?
- Meilyne didn't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that word either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really, you're looking for Meilyne's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to be on your side here.
- Oh, fuck of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, it's something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like the Philippines for
example is an archipelago, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just a bunch of tiny, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> tiny, tiny islands, right?
- Stop flexing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically in layman's- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking cross-pollination
all over again, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In layman's terms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lots of tiny, tiny islands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> along the coast of Kyushu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we were like, oh, that's perfect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll call it the lost islands, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> because we'll try and
go to as many of these, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like small islands. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I think we ended up going
to like three or four of them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, obviously, we
couldn't go to all of them, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there's literally
thousands of them out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But some of these islands
were fucking insane looking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Like completely off the-
- Yeah, you showed me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> some pictures. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I showed pictures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's gonna be fun, you
guys need to watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But yeah, it was just incredible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we literally did speed run Kyushu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like that week felt like a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like you did a fuck ton, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from how you were describing it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly the challenges that we like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> usually prepare with on
Journey Across Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this time around was like
kind of a back-burner, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because there's so
much shit we were doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, oh yeah,
I forgot we had to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> a challenge for this video, fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But yeah, hopefully the
trailer will be out, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> by the time this episode goes out? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - If Chris isn't lazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If not, sorry, Chris, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I probably just sent a bunch
of where's the trailer people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> over to your channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He had it coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He had it coming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I wanna know is
that how many more places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can he do Journey Across Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How many more themes can he do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like one thing I
will say about Japan is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> one of the things that
impresses me the most, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> is just how fucking varied Japan is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of like how many
places there are to travel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to explore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, 'cause
I'm used to the UK, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like if you've explored, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> a decent amount of the UK, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> then you've kind of, to me at least, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you've kind of seen it all.
- There's like one town. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> If you go to one town, you go to one city, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's kind of all the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, London to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> London kind of exists in its own bubble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> London's like unique, but like
anywhere outside of London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean fucking-
- Shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the same innit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Australia's the same thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think geographically, it's
just as large as like the US, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe close to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's just sand, so. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like 80% of it is a fucking desert. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> That's why like I barely
gone exploring in Australia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I just don't know what there is out there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then again, if Chris
hadn't like gone and done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> extensive research on places in Kyushu, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I probably would have had no fucking idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what to do right?
- I don't know how Chris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> finds these fucking places? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I don't know either.
- He comes to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> with this town in the Mountains of Kyoto. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right?
- How do you find this stuff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He literally just spends months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just researching interesting places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember on Journey Across Japan Two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was this like in the
middle of the mountains, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Gifu prefecture or Toyama, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was Toyama prefecture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which usually people don't go for tourism. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He found this like in the
middle of the fucking mountains, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there was this like field of
like 1,000 statues of people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that had just been built. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know how he found it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He literally went on to
like Google satellite, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like scanned
through the mountains, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- What the fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Until he stopped and was
like, what is this gray blob? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And like enhanced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Enhanced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then saw that
there were these statues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you look it up,
before that video went up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was no articles about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Not even Japanese media talks about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, this is like some next level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like some NASA shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want your dedication to research. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - People do strange things
with their land in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> In the UK, you just kinda ave a field, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe you put a fence on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kinda like let's call
it a day but in Japan- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only so much things you can do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in Japan they
seem to go crazy with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> They're like, what if we just made a field </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just trampoline outside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're like all right do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you look it up, there's
probably someone out there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has it, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trampoline wardo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trampoline wardo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what's so awesome about Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you can just be driving
in the middle of nowhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just see like
this weird fucking place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you don't know what mad
man came up with this idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just put like a field of statues </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's not even like
built for tourism either, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's not even known, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like if you're
lucky enough to find it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then there you go, there it is, enjoy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm hoping the next Journey Across Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is just five star hotels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and Chris is like, come
on Connor, let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's go and review five-star hotels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm down for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Journey Across Michelin
Restaurants in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not only is it a tax deductible, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's also fantastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fun, I wanna do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but please look
forward to that whenever that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he said it's coming
out end of May, maybe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, hopefully soon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like how many more places in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you want to visit personally? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I have this app actually on my phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can keep track of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's what I use to keep track </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all the prefectures I've been to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Google?
- It's called Google maps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's called Google maps.
- Well there's that as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It stalks you, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It knows exactly where you are? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like have we told the
story about the cycling, yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah okay, I mean so, I
know because I like this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that Google tells me exactly
where I was for how long? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like looking back where I was and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause when people ask me,
oh, where are you this day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, oh, let me check, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I know I've been-
- When the police ask me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where were you this day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When the Japanese police officers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are asking for my alibi,
I've got one ready. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But like it tells you exactly
where you were, for how long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And when we did the cycling special, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we all had our phone tracking on, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't shown in the video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we actually saw where we
all were throughout the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> And when the video was done,
I asked them, I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hey guys, can you export your map data, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> so that we can send it to our editor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so that he can know
where we, where we were. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that's how you see
all the cool map graphics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Meilyne made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not 100% accurate,
but it's pretty close. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's pretty close, yeah.
- It's pretty close. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So where we are generally
on that map is actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where we were.
- So we turn on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> location services, which I didn't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you could track each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like in real time.
- In real time, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it wasn't a part of like the big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't make it a big
part of the special, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> but we could actually see where we were, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> as we were cycling down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could see that Joey was
fucking kicking my ass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Connor turned off
his location sharing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when he was taking the ferry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So he just like popped out of existence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then popped in existence again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally thought he
was like lost out to sea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I just said </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was broken-
- I was like, he's dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> He's dead, he's just straight up dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So there was no signal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I asked these guys to share it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt was like, "Wait, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They keep all this information on you?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, yeah, it's awesome right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so I didn't realize that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by turning on location services, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could go through my
entire history day by day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you've turned on location services, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can probably do that right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you go to Google maps, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can go through the
history of your location services </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it will tell you the
exact location you've been, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hour by hour, every single day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like the past 10 years of your life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's scary. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's terrifying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Google's literally
stalking you at all times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you know what's sad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like when I used to live in London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I barely ever left my house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It would be like, what do I do this day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like a dot on the map
of me not leaving my house. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd be like, oh, what did I do this day? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh okay, maybe the next. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Okay, well, maybe the next, oh okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Four days in a row I
didn't leave the house. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> All right, cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I would just be America. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know, this is like
some fucking FBI shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, 'cause
sometimes I go to a place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, oh fuck where was that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I can just go on Google
and find out where I was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean it's cool like
to look back on it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it is cool.
- If you're the only one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who wants to look? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like two sides, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's cool to know that you could go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through your entire life history, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's also kind of like, I guess scary, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not scary, but like disturbing
that your entire life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can be compressed down into a file, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like analyzed, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's pretty cool.
- And exported, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And exported, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just like this the future </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that "Black Mirror" warned us about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is some (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I for one, welcome our
"Black Mirror" overlords. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I welcome technology. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I like it. It's fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
It's interactive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Interactive.
- What you mean interactive? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not stalking, it's interactive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I can see the cool side of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a bit like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, why did this
come up again? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, because you were
asking how many prefectures- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, so is there any place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you would love to visit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have an app, that shows me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the prefectures I've been to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can kind of give
points as well being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like, I visited
there, I walked there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I stayed there overnight,
I lived there, et cetera, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it like adds on the points. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I lived here, I did it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I ate it.
- I did it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I know exactly now which prefectures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I haven't been to yet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I think, I mean, I can bring it up, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I think maybe I've done, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna say like 3 1/5 maybe
3 1/4 of all the prefectures, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah, these are the ones I've done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Red ones you've been to? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Holy shit.
- So the red ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've stayed overnight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll send this image to you, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the red ones I've stayed overnight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The green ones I've
like just stopped over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> The yellow ones I've passed through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The blue ones I've like walked around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the white ones I haven't visited yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a decent amount
that I still haven't gone to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Because now I can use that
app basically to be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all right, well, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna take the weekend off somewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I can plan my next vacation and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well, I've never been to this prefecture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so let's go check that out, kind of thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wish I wasn't so fucking stupid, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just don't like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like don't really care where
I am, unless there's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, something fun to do there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, oh-
- Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't go to a fucking prefecture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if I didn't have anything
to do there, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not the type of guy who's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, I haven't been to this map here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't been to this part of the map. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to know that there's
something cool to do there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, this is my JRPG, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like 100% completion-ist side, coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like I gotta
finish all 47 prefectures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just to complete it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me it's like a catch-22, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I wanna go to new places, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna find new cool places, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I also don't have the
energy that Chris does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to just fucking scout out places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that look cool.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Not only scour, but like schedule it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> day by day meticulously.
- Yeah, yeah. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I like going
with someone who plans stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you plan it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll come along. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll crack a few jokes, here and there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I love Journey
Across Japan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a fucking vacation for me, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, so I have to be on camera </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and talk for a few hours a day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Cool.
- That is definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the benefit of hanging out with Chris. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like he just takes
care of everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, I know where we're going, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know a place, let's do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's the definition of I know a place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One time I did that for Chris, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, let me take
you to a place, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're in Kyoto, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, no, no, I
know a great coffee place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Literally outside where we were staying, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is a Blue Bottle Coffee, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like the least Kyoto thing ever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look at like an American chain, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, no it's good, it's good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's good.
- It's good, it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, it's pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is the best coffee-
- I know a place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's called Starbucks.
- Japanese coffee- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Starbucksu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can do good coffee there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do we have a clip named Japan's coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is bottom tier, because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, we do now.
- Yeah, we do now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Japan's coffee is the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Japan truly is a tea society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tea society. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We live in a tea society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - We live in a tea society. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's awful, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like dirt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I didn't know
that I cared about coffee, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> until I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've realized that
the coffee here was shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I thought living in England, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, whatever I would fucking... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought like my coffee tolerance was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll fucking take instant
coffee if I need to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like when I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've realized what shit
coffee tastes like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then I got a job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And now I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, because remember the fucking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the brainwashing that happens, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> the first time you come
to Japan, you're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I can buy a hot coffee
at a vending machine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, I'm gonna buy this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> every fucking day.
- Yeah. Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you realize
it's just all sugar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you realize it's all crap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And your like, oh Starbucks has never been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so fucking attractive to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, so yeah, as you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As you know Japan has like a
fuck ton of vending machines, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember whenever I used
to go on holiday in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd always get the coffee,
vending machine coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every single day without fail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, I will never
get bored of this, at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to go to a fucking Starbucks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or a coffee shop to get my coffee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can just go to a vending machine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I moved here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I don't know what
it is about moving here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like something switched
in my brain, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I just instantly
recognized it as like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh this tastes like crap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is processed instant coffee shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what switched my brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why is it that when
I was here as a tourist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vending machine coffee and
vending machine drinks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just like fucking five-star? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause we don't have it in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so you're like, you do like amazed by it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like a new,
weird thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Connor, I remember, was talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how every time he came here to visit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would fucking eat FamilyMart
or Nigiri every day, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you realized, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, this is not that
great actually. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've actually gone back on it now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You say that like a drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've come like full circle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've relapsed. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was very diehard sandwiches
for like a year and a half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And now I'm like, man,
I just crave rice now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck's going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean the onigiris
are fucking great dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they are.
- Onigiris are great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never been off them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- (laughs) Never been off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I realize I just sound
like a druggie right there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Depending on- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Onigiri would sober you Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many onigiris is too much? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Going back to the coffee, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For me, coffee is as much
of like a smell thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as it is a drink thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> The reason why I like
going into a coffee shop, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is 'cause I need that wall
of coffee smell to hit me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what makes me feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm ready to fucking drink caffeine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say coffee is a
fucking morning thing for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right now because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not a morning thing,
a fucking morning thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a fucking morning.
- Fucking morning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause like honestly is
your morning really started, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you don't have a coffee? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause to me, if I don't have a coffee, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like my indicator
that my morning has begun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I can begin the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I don't have the coffee, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I'm just like in
permanent, like 50% brain mode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No coffee I sleep, coffee I wake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's literally how I am. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's a placebo thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm totally the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember there was one
week where I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I might be a little too
dependent on coffee. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Let me back it up a bit, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because I was having like, two,
three cups of coffee a day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right.
- Well I have like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> four or five.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, that's probably
not that good for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My heart's probably about to explode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So let me like just go a week, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with no coffee and see how I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude, day two, I was like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was getting just insane
migraines in my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, oh, I'm really
fucking dependent on this shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to start the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just get sluggish if I stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really get too bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't get like coffee headaches? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've never gotten that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had friends who got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How it feels for me is
that you know that scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the film where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they got the gray scale filter on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how I see the world
before I have my coffee, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like I have the coffee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they instantly
turn up the saturation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is how my mornings work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I go from gray-scale to sepia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You are the fucking meme of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't talk to me until I've had my coffee. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you're literally that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, 'cause I remember
when I first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my mornings were
just like so depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I didn't have that
first good, hot coffee </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to look forward to, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because even if I'd go to my
FamilyMart to get a coffee, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was like really watered down coffee. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It wasn't, I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I've noticed the more I like grow up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it's the little things in life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that you need to look forward to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know.
- It's the little things. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is the little things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like my mornings are 20% less happy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if I don't have a coffee
to look forward to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I just feel like
my day is depressing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kind of about it really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
- But that's most days, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't really (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One time I went to an
Italian restaurant here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, I feel like
an Italian restaurant, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you can almost judge it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on how good their
espresso is with the meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It must end on an espresso. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel at least like, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, absolutely.
- And you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it was pretty good food
and I was like, not bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you found one
that has a good espresso </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I've yet to find one yet? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's one or two that if I see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the actual espresso machine
in the back, I'm like, nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know it's gonna be good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they've gone to the effort, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get this ridiculous expensive machine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just for this like one part of the meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I was eating there and
the food was pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasn't disappointed and
I thought, well fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna end my meal
off with an espresso, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it said on the menu, it said espresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was a double or a single. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I ordered the double espresso, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just brought out
essentially an Americana. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- And I said, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no, no, I ordered the espresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, "Oh no,
no, that's the espresso." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like this tall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, that's not an espresso, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if it is, I'm gonna
be having a heart attack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like a triple, double espresso. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Am I the asshole here? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are you gonna make me pay for this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not paying for this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I paid for it, but you know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't walk out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And naturally I didn't complain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I paid for it, but
that's not the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I was very disappointed- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it at least a good Americana? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, fuck.
- That day onwards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swore against ordering coffee in places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where I couldn't visibly
see an espresso machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in their establishment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like take me to the
back, take me to the back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's see what's going on, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah 'cause I'd say the best
purchase I've made in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by none is the Nespresso machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna get that soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would trade my first born
son for a Nespresso machine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly, straight up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that thing, I hug
that thing every day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I give it a morning kiss. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I could go homeless and the
one thing I'd keep with me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the Nespresso machine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd be going around on the street </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> holding the Nespresso machine,
plugging it into outlets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> when I can just to get a coffee. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, speaking of coffee machines, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found this fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, Aki is quite
obsessed with TikTok, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as most people are these days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I don't have TikTok
installed on my phone, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My only exposure to TikTok
is watching with Aki. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's this fucking thing where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know those like TikTok stories like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Amazon gadgets that
changed my life, part 71. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know those, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> They all sound the fucking same. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There was one where it was literally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> this alarm clock, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 400 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was this alarm clock that
makes you a cup of coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh we had that.
- When it went off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we had that in the
'80s in the UK for tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah, it was called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a Kettle Mate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you could set the alarm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it would pour a cup of tea for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when the alarm went off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is not a new invention TikTok, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fuck you.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So there's like a fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it looks like, maybe it's about that big. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's pretty massive! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty fucking large, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's like the cup,
the coffee mug there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there's like a proper
brewing thing on the side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you put in this like
canister of milk in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like lock it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when the alarm goes off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it just straight up just
makes you a fucking like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Nespresso machine
is literally one button. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could literally have
that next to your bed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't need like-
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, just get a
fucking Nespresso machine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and just put the fucking
thing in and, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nespresso, please just
sponsor us already, please. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the problem is
I feel like Nespresso </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is one of the best capsule machines, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but I feel like in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the only capsule machine
that is actually good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because like you could get
like the actual, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the ones that actually have to put, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the coffee grinded beans.
- The beans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But like I had one of those. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] I had one of those as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cleaning it is such a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like Nespresso is like the perfect brand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm literally just fucking
marketing for you right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It is literally the easiest
and like easiest to clean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just easy.
- Fully sponsored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For the quality you get
and for the convenience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it is the best capsule machine- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please sponsor us.
- That I have owned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I have owned a lot
of capsule machines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We bought one just for this office. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause we were like we want- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally the
first purchase that we made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we tried to get GeeXPlus
to pay for it for us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but they wouldn't allow
it, so we paid for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before we bought this table, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we bought the Nespresso machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - We had our priorities
right, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Exactly.
- Yeah, I remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when they gave us the
spreadsheet of just like, okay, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so they get it's like
GeexPlus gave us a spreadsheet </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause they said they would help us, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not decorate the office,
but furbish the office. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And we were like, okay,
tables, desk, television, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> not microphones.
- Nespresso? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] Machines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no but it was split up in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here's the list of the things we need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and here's the list of the things we want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we put Nespresso machine
in the first thing on need. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We're like no, no you
don't understand Geex, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we need this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not a want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And Meilyne was like,
"Do you really need this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this as necessary as the table?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're like, yes, without coffee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this podcast is not happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> No, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not gonna film. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I refuse to release episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like another thing about Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like coffee shops as well,
is that there are so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> independent coffee shops here in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you're ever coming to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can walk down a random
street and find like five to 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> different indie coffee shops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the problem is they
all look fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's such a coin flip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on whether it's going to
be good coffee or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like the fallacy is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the best and
poshest looking coffee shops </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been to in Japan, have
had just the shittest coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like acid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like dirt water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in like Central Tokyo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like (indistinct) and like
Kichijoji and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of really like fancy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like rustic looking coffee shops, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's like the
beans are all lined up and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've got the aesthetic down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've got the aesthetic to a T. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And then you order in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like waiting
for this cup of coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> for like 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And you're like what are they picking, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the fucking coffee beans off the plant? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's taking so long. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And what comes out is like shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Essentially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like dirt water, sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like $12 please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and it's fucking
$12 for like this one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause especially going
to America or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you order like a cup of coffee, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you just assume that
it's refillable, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's that kind of level of quality. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But in Japan you can have like
the fucking instant coffee, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> dirt water and they give it to you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> in this like the poshest little cup, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's fucking tiny, it's $12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're just there being
like, I'm even more depressed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> than I was before I ordered this coffee. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why it's sad, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's sad that like Blue
Bottle Coffee and Starbucks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like the best coffee in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is.
- It really is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like going to any foreign country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but like, you know, McDonald's
is the finest cuisine here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's literally the best. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like don't eat anything else. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it's so sad having to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the foreigners did it better than you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're fucking chains. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just like, oh, you want
some good fried chicken? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I know a place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It begins with a K. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's got my favorite
Colonel in front of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It feel like you're admitting defeat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where like the big corporations
are the best at something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But like that's what I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when I say we truly do
live in a tea society, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like they'll do green tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Tea here's amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Tea is fucking great.
- The tea here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is fucking great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The green tea is obviously, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but like the other types of
tea here, fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> But it just take you a little bit longer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to perfect the coffee, I feel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Although, I will say
there's some teas here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where they're like, yeah,
it's just like cherry flavor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, I do not
taste any tea in this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is just cherry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like sweet teas
where I can't taste the tea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, what's the point in this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just not a tea drinker, so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I love tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only drink tea when
I have afternoon tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't drink tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess Japanese tea is different, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause when I think of
tea, I think of hot tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I think
of like an Earl Gray, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a English breakfast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, yeah, I don't count green tea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like an afternoon tea, tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think afternoon tea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is probably the only good
British export that we've done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a British export that I'm proud of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there really nothing else? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like racking my brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like there has to be something else, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right?
- Well, what else is there? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stealing? I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we stole a lot of stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pillaging.
- Tuesday? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tuesday. (laughs)
- Tuesday. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tuesday, YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - A part of me dies inside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I go to like a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that does like foreign,
like European cuisine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I see fucking fish and chips there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, why are you
selling fish and chips? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The best fish and
chips though I ever had, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was this British pub, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> British Irish pub called
Hobgoblin in Shibuya. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You mean ever? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the best fish and chips- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, in Japan, in
Japan, in Japan, obviously. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, yeah.
- In Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause every other fish
and chips I've had is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they vinegar the fuck out of the fish, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's just like I'm not eating fish, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm eating solid vinegar-
- No, they should let you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put the vinegar on yourself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah but, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But there's places where
they just like do it for you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's fucked up, that's not right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like the is like inside
the fucking meat of the fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, this
does not taste like fish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It tastes like vinegar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> As much as I love vinegar,
don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's the maximum you'd
pay for fish and chips? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Abroad or in England? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's just full stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, how big are we talking? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a normal portion, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a normal port, like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when I went to this place-
- Like 15, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The most?
- That's what I mean, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They charge me $22. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm still angry about this, by the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - $22 for a fish and chips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - $22 and it was mid chip, honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It was not very good.
- Wait, was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the Welsh place? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was at the Welsh town. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh Yikes!
- I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm like
completely ruining their like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any foreign tourism they get now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but that fish and chips was abhorrent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And they increased the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welsh town reviewed by a Welsh man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm still annoyed about it, $22. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - 22 bucks is pretty ridiculous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My mom, she'd probably slap me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if she saw that I've
handed money for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like a five pound
fish and chips as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was not my chip- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it like a frozen
Iceland fish and chips, then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It wasn't good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like more batter than fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I've noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I've tried fish and chips </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> that have not been from England. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Even in England, not every
fish and chips you get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is fucking good, anyways.
- A lot of them are shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of them are really shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say 80% of fish and
chips you get in England </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is shit anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So why would I trust
it outside of England? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why you gotta go to a nice pub, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a nice fancy kind of pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that just like focuses on food a lot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'll have fish
and chips on the menu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It'll probably be fucking banging. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They might have like triple
deep fried fries, as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I wanna take
you guys to the Hobgoblin, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like a proper
barramundi fish and chips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean the best fish and
chips I've had, is in Brighton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that the one you took us to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bankers? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I believe so.
- I can't remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Probably. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably, yeah.
- Did you say you live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to a fucking ocean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's 'cause we live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> next to the fucking sea, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's like, it's good fish and chips, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the fish is just fresh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can taste that
it's fresh and it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the one you took us to in Brighton </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was easily the best fish and
chips I've ever had, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like even so like there's something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel weird whenever like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to Japan and people like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, you can try the ramen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can try the sushi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can try all these different cuisines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And someone visits me in fucking England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, yo you wanna
get some fish and chips? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Go to a local chippy, go to
a pub, and I'm just like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's where you're going wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You immediately have to get them drunk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> so that they can't like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so they don't focus on the food- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - They can't judge correctly.
- Yeah that's what I do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, let's go to
the pub right away, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> We're four beers in, you
won't care what we're eating. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like the problem is when they stay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're staying for like a week, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how many days in a
row can they drink alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before they've realized it.
- Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna blow your mind
with a Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Before they realize
that there's just not much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to our culture that we can
show off to like tourists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that visit us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's the same
problem in Australia as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, after you have a kangaroo steak, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's literally nothing else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we have fish and chips
as well, but like not as good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I think the one
thing I've realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after moving to Japan or after
moving outside of England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and living in places
like Thailand and Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff like that is that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to me in England there's not much to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apart from drink, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't drink- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that what happens
when you live in a place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or is that what happens
when you like leave it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and are aware? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I wonder, cause like do you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what there's much to do in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is there much to do in
Australia that you know of? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Other than going to the
pub and going to the beach, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's depressing, innit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least we have really
nice fucking beaches, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from where I'm from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you got that, we
don't even have nice beaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I am from- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - My beach is very nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> There's plenty of free needles
and trash and everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I tell people I grew up in
a beach town, a beach city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's Brighton.
- Brighton's shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we have pebble, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like Brighton is the tourist
beach in England, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like the worst
beach I've ever been to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just rocks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I say that as someone
who grew up in Brighton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm born and bred in Brighton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, it's just
a bunch of fucking rocks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't even go there barefooted, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And to make matters worse, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Brighton is just as expensive as London. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like what's the point
of like (indistinct)? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It wasn't always like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're like they gentrified my area! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember a time
when Brighton was cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, the way you can tell, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if this is
scientifically proven, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but as far as I'm concerned it is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you can tell the costs
of a town in the UK, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 100% just go to the pub,
see how much the beer is? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> If you see, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to any pub,
- One pint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One pint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much is like the middle
of the like price, like pint? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How much is it?
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause in Brighton, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like what, like four
pound fifty, maybe five pounds? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Four pound, five pound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like London prices. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's on the expensive end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Where I'm from, it's like two pound 20. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I talk to people though,
that are from the north, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or from Wales or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they tell me about these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> magical (indistinct).
- Magical prices? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - These magical two-
- Mythical prices. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - These magical two-pound prices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sounds like two pound 80. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - These magical two pound pints, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, what
land are you from, sir? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you sure that's beer
that you're drinking there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry, I didn't know- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Also. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry, I didn't know you
grew up in fucking Narnia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this magical land that
does not exist in England? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bullshit, it doesn't
exist, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And then like also to Americans as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> a pint is, not an American pint, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's different to American
pint, which is also, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> American pint is the biggest
scam ever, by the way. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You guys got ripped off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know why when Americans
took the pint from us, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason they made it smaller. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We talked about this on the stream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't we?
- Did we? Oh okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm pretty sure we did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a hundred milliliters less. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You're losing a lot of
beer there for no point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the one time when
Americans took something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and made it smaller.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like 430 milliliters,
I think around that America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and British pint is 568 milliliters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And yeah, you get a lot of
beer for like really cheap. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like the pint where
I grew up, it's like $4. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The pint where I grew up was $9. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's US?
- Australian. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait's that in like real money? (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - In real money? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It's nine dollar-ee-dos,
so what's that in USD? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like $7 in US?
- That's not too bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's about London prices then? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's probably
about London prices, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like growing up
in the south in England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I travel, like further north, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I see the prices, it's
just like I feel great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because no matter where I go in England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm paying either the same
amount, or less than I'm used to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is why probably Swiss people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like the most
superior people on earth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause everywhere they go
it's just like on sale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like everything is cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's why Australians
love coming to Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They feel so rich. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - What do you mean it's only $1 for water. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I mean, like remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I found that fucking Izakaya Shibuya, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where on I think Tuesdays
it's not even a happy hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like all night it's 50 yen beers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You put it like when you
go to places like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the beer sometimes doesn't taste right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really?
- I don't know if it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the psychological effect of me thinking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is too good to be true. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right, right, right.
- But I find when the beer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> is mega cheap at these places in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it tastes like water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but after 10 of
them, you don't care. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember going back to when
we came here as a tourist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, I'm gonna go to
these fucking cheap izakayas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every fucking day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna take advantage of this- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All you can drink? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God.
- Like Nomihoudai. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like all you can drink
fucking every weekend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Izakaya, let's go guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I'm just like, ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then corona was like, "No, no, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But also I just don't
wanna be in pain every week. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But now like, now
that you're living here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you just feel like there's
so many other cool bars, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and other cool places you can go to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that izakaya just feels like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I also rarely drink to
get drunk anymore, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I normally get to the
tipsy point and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, I'm done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's also like-
- I wanna be able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to function the next day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm like, I'm okay now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're too busy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, 'cause now I see Nomihoudai, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like, ah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well I could drink as much as I want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but do I need to anymore? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then there's
always the thing of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all right, I've been
drinking beer all night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do I really wanna swap to like spirits, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and am I really, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna chug beer either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna like, like myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the first
time I went to an izakaya, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like would
you like just Tampin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like just one by one or
do you want Nomihoudai? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the part where I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I'll just go Tampin tonight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Somewhere inside my head,
I was like, you've changed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How dare you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What happened to you, man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You used to be cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if you were asked Nomihoudai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not even a moment of hesitation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd be like, of course, Nomihoudai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like I had the
exact same moment as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> when I'm just like, I
remember thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whenever I move to Japan, I'm
never not going to say no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Me say no to all you
can drink beers, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I'm just like, ah
really, all you can drink? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I forget you're 30 Garnt, fuck man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I'm gonna be so
much worse than you at 30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna be like fucking
awful to hang out with- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it true that like your
entire view on everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just changes the moment you hit 30, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause that's all I've been hearing about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it true you become a
fucking boomer when you get 30? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, no.
- You just start hating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every young person.
- No because like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I've heard from so many people
who are now in their 30s, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where like, it's literally,
I don't know if it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I identify as a 30-year-old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When does the dust start forming? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know if it's
like placebo or whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or the way you just like overthink it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but so many people are like,
yeah, the moment I hit 30, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I just stopped
giving a about so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I feel 30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm the opposite, I
don't feel 30 at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly, I don't feel like
I've changed much at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You haven't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder how you can
do like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I'm struggling
to keep up sometimes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when people wanna party and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fine, I'll go to the party.
- No I'm right there as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, I'll
force myself to drink, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but half the time my heart's not in it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> My heart's not there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm still up there like
fucking 5:00 AM or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like always in bed by like three now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and Garnt will be like, "Yeah,
I stayed up until 9:00 AM </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I started just doing work at 10." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're up till three, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like 11:30 and I'm like all right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna go to bed, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Joey's napping in the karaoke place. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I'm like a 60-year-old. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just a sad life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't know like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't feel like I've changed at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm almost 31 now and I
feel like I just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm still fucking 25, 23. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean you still look 25. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're gonna be like that
fucking old anime character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the most fun to hang out with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he teaches you some cool shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he sacrifices
himself casually later on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're gonna be the old man
who like looks really small, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but the moment it takes the
shirt off he's just jacked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Netero. Basically Netero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - From what I've heard
from just other people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are just older than me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they just told me that your
30s is just basically your 20s, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with one de-buff to your body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I guess my hang-overs- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the de-buff for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess my hangovers
are slightly worse now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the only reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The only reason, like I drink
a fuck ton more wine now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's funny, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause when when I was like 18 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to like 20, 30-
- Anytime you turn 30 you go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like beer, vodka, nah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Me moment you turn 30, have a wine cooler </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's fully stocked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was exactly me when I was 30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, yes, I only drink wine now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thank you very much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Beer? Ugh! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Get that teenage shit out of here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The next step is gonna
be like wine Cognac </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I drink wine because,
one, I like the taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and two, because for some
reason the hangovers for wine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just like way more bearable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember 'cause like, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I was in my teens and like
early 20s, I was like, wine? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would get the worst hangovers on wine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> especially red wine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I swear I had like fucking
Vietnam flashbacks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from drinking red wine
at university, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thai man (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the hangovers there
were like fucking unbearable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I hit like 27, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ooh, this kind of feels warm and fuzzy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even have
those like Nam flashbacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like I didn't even
like, I didn't even drink wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just making that a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I wasn't even
interested in drinking wine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in my early 20s 'cause my dad is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking heavy wine drinker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he's always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try this nice red wine.
- He was Australian? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course, all Australian's
love their wine, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, they all love their wine, so like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's loads of wine
grown in Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah absolutely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's great wine, now, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now that I can drink wine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like, oh yeah, this
is fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But when you're like 21, 22
and you drink a glass of red, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like, oh God, like I can
not get used to this at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe we drink more wine
if we grew it in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But unfortunately the only
place they make wine in UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> are prisons, I don't really
think we have too much choice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of good wine selection. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think UK does make some wines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that wine? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that considered wine, or
is that just like grape juice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with attitude? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - As well, you just get
it from France, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So once you make your own wine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's gonna be like,
we literally have France, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like an hour, why would you.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't realize how lucky I had it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> until I moved to a
country that is not well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, they produce Sake
here, they do produce wine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's not as well known. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't know how good we had it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you can just go to
a fucking local Co-op, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or Tescos and buy great wine </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that is like triple the
price here in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it tastes-
- Yeah, wine kinda sucks here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You have to go to like
a specialist wine place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause like, if you go to
fucking FamilyMart or Seven, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like, you're just
basically picking poison </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> if you drink the cheap wine here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's basically just bottled rat poison. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I see it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's grape flavored hand sanitizer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have such first-world problems. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We just like concerned about
the quality of the wine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that we (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Listen, what happened to us, man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would say I started
drinking way more wine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of corona, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and because when you're stuck inside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta find an interest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in something right?
- You gotta make your own fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like a narrator. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "Garnt decided
to take up a new hobby, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> alcoholism" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, but like it's incredible, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's the first time
ever where I drank something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like a heavy, heavy amount, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and I wake up the next
morning, I'm like, I'm alive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that I feel like
that's a one-off, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like that's being shot, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it misses a vital organ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what, when you drink and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's happened multiple times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For me, if I just stay on wine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't mix drinks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wine hangovers are the most bearable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me it's like beer is
like always worst stomach ache- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gin for me.
- Sake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gin I don't get bad hangovers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Always the worst headaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sake, so like, hangover tier list, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hangover tier list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hangover tier list, let's go, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So right at the top, I
don't fuck with this at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Sake.
- Sake, yeah hands down, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like so-
- Wait is S tier here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the strongest?
- S tier is like the shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like the worst hang over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or should we do the opposite, like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it should be the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well, Sake is like fucking Z tier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember like when
Chris was last on this podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we went to the izakaya afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just like one shot of Sake's
enough to give me a hangover. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I'm drinking something else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but Sake has even entered my body once, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it completely contaminates my body. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like fuck you, Connor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I remember when
we went to the izakaya, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally the hour afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was on beer the entire night, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then Chris was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's get some Sake, right lads?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember having like one cup of Sake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I was just
like gone the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could see your brain
powering down, as you drank it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like. (mimics powering down) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He had the audacity to be
like, this is great Sake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't great, it was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've had good Sake that
was just slightly bearable </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this shit was awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Tasted like, just something
going off in your mouth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it was something just going stale, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and would hit your body terribly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Be ashamed of yourself, Connor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've never had
worse headaches in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after a night of just drinking Sake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sake is by far the worst. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tequila's up there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Tequila's there as well for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just above that is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the fucking spirits-
- Spirits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The really shitty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tequila's the worst one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I say tequila's the worst one, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would say tequila and Sambuca, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are like on that level, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel bad for like our Muslim fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that can't watch this, now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wouldn't know anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll take your word for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just trust us. Just trust us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like tequila and
Sambuca for me are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they're the student shots. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> They're what you get as a student because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking Sambuca? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who drinks that all night? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Fuck that, psychopaths drink Sambuca. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What even is Sambuca? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly, you don't know it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah I don't even know it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a one drink that your mate is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, let's get this drink." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you have it
and you're like (gags). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that.
- What is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a licorice.
- Yeah, it's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, is it like Jaeger? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I was about to okay, going on the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just the same level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - On the same level, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> but like going above that I
would say is Jaeger, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they're all like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all the shots
where you know you wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and you can pinpoint the exact
moment the night went wrong. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It was the exact moment someone ordered </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a round of Jaeger shots. or
a round of Sambuca shots, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> or tequila shots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right.
- And for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne fucking loves tequila and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will never understand that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I will literally never understand that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] I just like the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - What about the taste? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What about the taste? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Meilyne] No I don't like the taste. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't like the taste? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then why do you drink it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] I like how it makes me feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's other alcohol
you can use that for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a concerning sentence. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Meilyne] It makes me very, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> you know. (laughs)
- No we don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because we can't relate.
- Drunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it tastes like ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the first, I mean, look, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only time where I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tequila was kind of fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the first time you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the whole salt thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause that's like-
- Cannot the whole salt thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so unlike me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like playing a mini game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> while you're doing (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a little event, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've realized if you're like a student, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like when you start
trying all these drinks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you had some kind of
fucking quick time event to it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> drinking becomes like 10 times more fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you're a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like there was a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck in Swansea when I went to university, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> there's this one bar that would
do these drinks of Sambuca, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where they would light it on fire, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like put the like-
- Oh, gas chamber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what it's called, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not a very flattering name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's called a gas chamber,
which is a terrible name. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so they would do it for
like one pound 50, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Which is like $2.50? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't know it was
legal in the UK 'cause- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if it is,
but they served it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause the only time
I've been able to do that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is not in the UK, but it's
when we go on like fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It might be illegal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you know how the bars are in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of them are (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know how are the bars are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know how some of
the student bars are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like it's like World War III </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> in some of these bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like people throwing up everywhere. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're serving drinks to
people they shouldn't be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But yeah, they would
light the Sambuca on fire, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and put a wine glass over
to extinguish the fire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen those, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, and then they
would put the wine glass </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on the table really quickly, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you would shot the thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you have to breathe in the fumes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> from the wine glass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it would go straight to your head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah, like you know the- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've done those before, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I've had Sambuca before then, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its fucking awful.
- You know, these are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> students shots, right?
- Don't do it, don't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's terrible.
- Because even with tequila, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you lick the salt, do the
tequila and do the lime, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Some are like fucking students, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have found a way to make this
like even more messed up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because-
- Are you talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the kamikaze shot? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you call it the kamikaze
shot or the suicide shot? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah suicide or kamikaze, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what this is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so the normal- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sounds like "Jackass" stunt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is, it fucking is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the normal order you go in is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you lick the salt, you
do the tequila shot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you suck on the
lime, or the lemon, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] In that case,
it makes it bearable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, okay, how about this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How about instead of licking the salt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you snort the salt. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay, that sounds stupid. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then you drink.
- Take the shot. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You take the shot, and
instead of sucking on the lime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you just put it in your eyes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Who the fuck thought of this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I'm thinking about a new challenge, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the shit yourself
in public challenge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just shit yourself on the train, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just see how long you can last. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had a friend on my 18th birthday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who did that three times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because we were playing
darts and he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he was so fucking cocky about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was like, I'll beat you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I practice every fucking day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, your like seven shots in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not gonna fucking beat me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like. "Well, watch this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I totally understand
why people are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I don't want drinks." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> When I hear about this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like why would you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, no absolutely, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't encourage viewers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is has always been a
fucking step level beyond me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is like people
who did like vodka shots </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through their eyeball. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like, what's
wrong with people? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck is wrong with people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have a perfectly functioning mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like for me, I feel old whenever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or maybe I've always been old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause anytime I've
heard a story like that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like, who the
fuck thinks this is cool? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Do you have brain damage? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like what went wrong in your life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> to think that doing a vodka
shot in your eye was bad-ass? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, because this
is the aspect I hated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about being in university. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that like, they would be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, so you do the
vodka shot in your eye," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Then they'd be like, "Oh, 'cause
it gets you drunk quicker." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like this literally
takes five minutes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Just drink it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I'm the fucking
weirdo out of the group </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm the one who doesn't wanna shove </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a fucking vodka in my eye. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm the asshole? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, next thing you
know, there'll be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, I took some fucking ethanol, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I fucking just injected into my veins. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It was fucking rock and roll man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was metal as fuck." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> At what point do we acknowledge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that this is just stupid shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that no one should be doing?
- As someone who's done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a shoey a couple of times in there life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't really say
anything, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's probably the most
fucked up one I've done, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> I'll tell you when you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've reached the generation gap, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> It's that point, because
I remember when I thought, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah, I'll always be up for a tequila, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or Sambuca, or Jaeger bomb. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then somewhere along in life, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I reached like mid 20s and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe they're just
better ways to get drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other than doing these
shots, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, you just kinda be like, do I? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Do I wanna be drunk? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct)
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I used to think like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would look at like all
the dads at a pub, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, they're
just sitting there talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a beer in their hand? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That doesn't sound fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish for that more
than anything right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds amazing!
- Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember thinking like,
when I was in university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember thinking, I'm
never gonna be like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma still be doing shots
when I'm 50, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like that when I was like 22, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I just gave up at like 21. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like fine, I
finished with university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Time to be a fucking-
- Time to be an adult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Time to be a boring functioning adult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Terrible, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I remember recently I went to my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like some of my first wine events. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Went to a wine tasting event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's how you know, that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Privilege. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - That how you know you're making money. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That I've reached that age
when I'm just like, okay, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> how about wine tasting?
- It's like yay! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I remember taking Connor
to one as well, one time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like, so this one time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the people at this wine
event are exactly the people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you expect to be at this wine event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's in like their
fucking 40s or 50s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's like a fucking
investment banker or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Something little- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With a monocle and top hat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's basically like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the main guy running the event </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is this really old French dude </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who you could see in a
monocle and top hat, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I remember, so I was with Sydney. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And so he was, you know, it's
like a very intimate event. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> So he would go around
asking people, what they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And of course, when they go
to us, we mentioned YouTuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like obviously people
perk the fuck up, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And of course, he goes to
Sydney and ask what she does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Sydney just very tastefully says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that she does videos
about anime, and manga, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he asked her
for her YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she gives it to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then he goes, oh,
let me just search this up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've never seen the life
flash before someone's eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as fast as I've seen like
Sydney go, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't do that, don't do that." (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the best part was, so,
at this wine event, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a room full of people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They are very, very prim
and proper, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a very, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would say it is a very posh room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so we go up to have
like I think like our third </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or fourth glass of wine that we're trying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so there's this word in
French that means cheers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - We say it in English as well, though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you?
- Yeah you say it in the UK </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as well.
- Okay, so you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's that joke that the guy
makes every single fucking time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like a very
obvious joke, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he goes, "Okay, everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone say, chin, chin." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the entire room is just silent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except I just hear next
to me, Sydney go. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like It is not quiet at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She just bursts out. (giggles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And everyone just starts laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I remember just sitting there like, fuck, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm with those guys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To be fair, it is pretty funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, in the UK we go like chin, chin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, chin, chin.
- Yeah it's like drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever say that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah in the UK people
always say chin chin, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like before you down a
pint or something like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chin chin, and then you down it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never heard that before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe it's like a northerner thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, people always said that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - They say that in Italy too, don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Italy as well? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I believe so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe that's where (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah anyway.
- Cause I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the first time I heard it
was when I went to Italy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God, we didn't explain the joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you don't know, chin,
chin, sounds like, ochinchin, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> which means penis in Japanese. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> The more you know.
- So basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just saying pee-pee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, everyone say, "Pee-pee." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pee-pee.
- Dick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And Sydney of course.
- Everybody. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Penis.
- Being the mature woman, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that she is, just laughed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, the first time I heard it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking burst out laughing too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you gotta be taking the piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause we're like some
like really fancy hotel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where like there's literally
security every like 10 meters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to check whether you're in the right place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Sydney just fucking laughed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was in like some fancy hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I always feel really out of place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm just like a child. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm like-
- Yeah right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, I don't belong here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I go to like
any fancy restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't matter where it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, I shouldn't be here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- I'm in a fucking T-shirt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck it, I'm here to taste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some wine.
- It's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just wanted wine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt like every time I
go to one of those events </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or especially like a company party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never feel more self-conscious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than whenever everyone around
me is just wearing suits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meanwhile I have to bust
out this fucking wrinkly ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> collared shirt from like
the bottom of my wardrobe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's great, you can go to these events </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and then people will tell you about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how rich their parents are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really fun, it's really, really fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love it. It's great.
- Great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just so depressing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna fucking
hear about how your dad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> owns ten companies, fuck off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You guys should have gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in fucking the Giorgio suits, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> You should've just like fully committed, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like proper like, wear a monocle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and like a top hat and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think monocles
have been in fashion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> since the fucking plague. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can bring it back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bring it back.
- Yeah, bring back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll bring back the monocle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bring back the monocle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just cosplay the monopoly man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm gonna do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fake mustache and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna get gray hair so I
can become the monopoly man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> before it falls out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And drink wine.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs)
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> How the fuck did we get on this topic? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, we didn't
address the wine tier, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the hangover tier list. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> By the way I'll just do
it for you right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Gin is number one, wine is
second, beer is in the middle, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then all the other weird
spirits sit down below, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then right at the bottom is Sake. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There you go. Boom! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So then you say we did not
finish that tangent, fuck you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Onto the next one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What's the next topic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the next tangent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We on (indistinct) boys, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Evian water spray. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, let's explain that.
- Are you talking about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay (indistinct).
- Yeah, Let's explain that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, what happened?
- Meilyne is like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yesterday I get this
a very ominous message </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> from Meilyne, all right, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - When does Meilyne's
messages not ominous? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, let me- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I get this very
ominous message from Meilyne </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just saying, "Hey tomorrow,
can I try something on you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the office?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's never a good thing
when Meilyne says this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck is
going on here right now? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, "Yeah, I have
this like ultrasound thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wanna put on your face," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that.
- It's for the baby, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that what that was? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I guess so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne, do you wanna explain what it was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like an ultrasound thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] No, it's like
ultrasonic form vibration. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just putting buzzwords together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only time you hear
ultrasonic is in the Sonic game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is the only time you hear it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is literally just
a sponsorship script. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's got ultrasonic buzzword. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have it right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is an Evian facial spray. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like wet your face.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is to wet your face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just to wet
my face, where so she- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much does this cost? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How much does this cost, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That looks like a vibrator. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It does look like a vibrator. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How much does this cost? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] I don't
know, I got it for free. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - From who? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Meilyne] I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - From a sponsor.
- Who's giving out Evian- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Costco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Costco, wow.
- Costco? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even know they had
Evian water spray before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So for some reason I just
agreed to it and said, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do whatever you need to do Meilyne. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so she puts this gel on my face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and then starts rubbing
that, wait, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> First she sprays the Evian facial spray, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think is just water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally Evian in a can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She just sprayed Evian water on my face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> put a gel on it and just
did a fucking ultrasound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on my face.
- That's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And apparently we are never getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a sponsorship from Evian ever again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really just going back and forward, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all it's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally, that's all it's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How is that doing anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] You need gel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you know if I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For real? do, I though?
- You do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I actually just got
what, like a pregnancy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] No. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What do you do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like seeing if its face- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It felt like she was going to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was like fucking doing
an ultrasound on my face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna start a business
where I just put my mouth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> against your cheek and just
scream and call it a therapy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The vibrations will heal any
kind of impurities you have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so basically before we started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recording this episode, Meilyne was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm just gonna do half of Garnt's face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so that the boys can
see the magic and wonder </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the before and after. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Could not tell the difference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we're probably never
gonna get a sponsorship </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> from Evian, but it
looked the fucking same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you tell the difference in my face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from my usual camera?
- The left side of his face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was just a little bit more
moist than the other side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all it was like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what this
is supposed to do, but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't.
- Does it though, Meilyne, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or are you just led to believe it works? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's for gullible people who wanna believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a solution for everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And sometimes you just ugly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> That's how it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I gotta deal with that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> No amount of Evian water
spray will save you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from you ugliness.
- No amount of Evian shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is gonna fucking fix my
problems, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fucked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If this truly fixed your
ugliness, no one will be ugly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause everyone would just buy these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will now end world ugliness. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I tell you, It's been real
quiet since that dropped, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Evian's like, "We're to save the day." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry, Meilyne.
- We're about to put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fashion industry out of business. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone is gonna be a model </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> after we bring out water
spray to the scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's so much stuff
like that where I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure it works like 0.1%, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but how much is it like
a negligible amount </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're like, is it worth my time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How good does it have to be
where I have to sit there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and rub my face and spray Evian on it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How good are the results have to be? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There're just some
things where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get the intent as to
why this was invented. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- But it's also like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many other alternatives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that work just as well and
probably a lot cheaper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like going back to the whole like fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Amazon things you didn't
need, you needed, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That is a prime example. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That is just like a bunch of
people with way too much money </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> who are just going on to Amazon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buying all these fucking things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember those one-
- It's just sad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I mean, it's just like
they feed off the insecurities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that people have.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have those weight loss bracelets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you seen those? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably just a
bracelet that has magnets in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> or something that apparently
will make you lose weight. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And the before and after pictures
are the fucking egregious. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There'll be like the most obese person, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and then apparently because
of this one bracelet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which they probably can't
even get on their hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how exaggerated obese he is.
- It starts off as a ring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like apparently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> this magically makes you extremely hot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It doesn't address the problem with, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you go from like 500
pounds to 200 pounds, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> where's the skin gone? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly.
- Doesn't address that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It just magically sucks back in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, fuck off! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I love is when you
see the before and after pic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's so obviously not the same. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, I love those. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I love those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like someone's
so morbidly obese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that they think that because
they now have a six pack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't recognize that
it's just not the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking person.
- Yeah, the lighting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is totally off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - The belly button's totally different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there's no hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - One thing I always find funny, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is like why always in the before pic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> does like the camera man, just say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Look as depressed as you can." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a subconscious thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you're smiling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Why are you smiling? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the before pic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean in the UK
they're just depressed in birth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean it's like subconscious, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you see someone smiling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> you're fucking dumb monkey
brains thing, oh good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good thing.
- Good thing happened again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Good thing happened thing.
- Happened thing here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know, I get really sad when I know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> that clearly someone's buying this stuff, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> unlike the detox teas
that just making yourself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like shitting yourself, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of course, you're gonna lose weight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you're shitting out all the stool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you have in there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Of course, you're gonna lose weight, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's just sad that
people feel desperate enough </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they can't just like
believe the fact that it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just eat less. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes it's not that
simple though, I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's the core of it, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just eat less.
- Just eat less. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't get cyber bullied. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Just turn off the PC. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it suck 'cause- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just don't get hungry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But that's what it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> The fundamental of it is
just like eat less shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Obviously, there are
exceptions in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some of you in the comments
be like I have X... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Okay, good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But like the fundamental of it is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't buy this bullshit, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so stupid.
- It's like the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are buying into that kinda stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> usually that's all it is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like all they need is
just like a change of diet </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> or just something so fucking easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, they're just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just don't be fat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just don't be fat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Listen, listen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can vouch for the
chicken and broccoli diet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It works. It works wonders. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The chicken and broccoli diet is no joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It worked wonders for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - A simple payment of 6.99. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trade offer.
- Trade offer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You get chicken and
broccoli, you lose weight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's simple as that,
literally (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get 79.99, you get
chicken and broccoli. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Chicken and broccoli
company team up with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I will show up, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there a chicken
and broccoli company?. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There actually is on
Uber Eats around our area, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There is a (indistinct).
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually ordered it.
- No fucking way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was literally a
chicken and broccoli chain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just delivers chicken broccoli. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> This is how it works, guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not fun, but weight loss isn't fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It doesn't need to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's sad that sometimes
in self-improvement, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a big factor in whether
it's gonna succeed or not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is if you're fucking
enjoying yourself doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's unfortunate, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like for me, for
example, going to the gym </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus going to do like a sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or going to do like another activity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doing that activity is way more
fun than spending even like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could do three hours
or something of a sport </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> versus 30 minutes on a treadmill, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I choose like a
three hour sport anytime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I think
Nintendo is like giga brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they're released Ring Fit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause that is literally
the answer to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can lose weight and have fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I say that having never played it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - It is intact. It is intact. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I plan to get it, I plan to get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This has been sold out for a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The big problem that we
have been like believing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for so long with weight loss,
and this is mainly like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I know this is like fucking chemistry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally it's like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, disclaimer, none of
us are weight loss expert. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, don't Take our advice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's like, the big companies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Coke, McDonald's and all them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like, "Yeah, you
can drink as much Coke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can eat as much
McDonald's as you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All you gotta do is just exercise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> It's not the food, it's exercise." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's like, exercise
doesn't really do that much </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for weight loss. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> But what I find personally
what exercise does do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the day when I exercise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am vigilant about what I'm eating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, no, no carbs here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No sugar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me the day when I
exercise for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I just-
- You take care of yourself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I actually crave healthy foods. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if I go to the gym
for an hour, that day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that day afterwards, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man, I'm kinda just
craving a chicken breasts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like fuck this pizza, fuck
the curry or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But like when I'm just
like being a couch potato, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like sitting here
all day, you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> ah, I feel like shit, so
I kinda just feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna eat shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like going to the
gym or like just exercising </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in any way you can, it's not
so much the act of losing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like the motivation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, obviously it helps general fitness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and being healthy and it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not saying it's bad,
but like I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have definitely been like believe- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not the cream on the crop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we've also just been like told </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we were growing up,
well, if you eat 10 donuts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just burn off the calories
and then boom, no damage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not how it works.
- 10 donuts, 10 kilometers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the treadmill, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just not how it
works, though, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trade off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - You lose 10 pounds.
- You receive 10 donuts, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I receive 10 kilometers on the treadmill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It sucks 'cause it's
like at the end of the day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you could go in the gym and
distract yourself with it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but it comes to that moment
when you're sitting on the couch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or you're wondering what to eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you've gotta just have
the willpower to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (slurps) ah, chicken broccoli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fine, fine (indistinct).
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It sucks 'cause it's like not fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is all diet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I feel like whenever you do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> any kind of self-improvement activity, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not the days where you feel good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's gonna define if
you basically succeed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the days where you feel bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're able to push yourself through. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I say this being like
I've had plenty of times </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when I have failed because I felt bad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I just didn't just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not even the motivation
to push yourself through, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just didn't have the self-discipline, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I feel like self-discipline
is way more important </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> than motivation because
there are gonna be some days </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you are just not motivated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's those days where
you can push through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know plenty of people who have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not one of them, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like as well, I
found that when I was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's easy to eat really
healthy for like two weeks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not easy, but it's doable, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then it's like, all
right, what if you just go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right back to doing what you're doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, well, nothing has changed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's when the bounce back happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that's why I was
just like, what can I cut out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I can keep out like forever? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I don't drink like soft drinks ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah.
- That one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that' like cut that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the last, like, since probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the beginning of quarantine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've just made a conscious
effort to not drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any fizzy drinks or anything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just shit like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't drink either.
- Tea and water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Is tea, water, coffee is
all fucking I'm drinking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was lucky enough that
I just never craved soda </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just always grown
up on drinking water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's kind of made
me realize that, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the habits you had as a
kid, really it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so much-
- They stick with you, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they stick with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so much easier to learn a
habit once than to unlearn it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and to learn something else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like so much
of my life, you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I had a time machine, if
I could fucking (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> myself back into like a younger body, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many things I
would do to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you learn this, you learn this
habit, you learn that habit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you don't have to fucking unlearn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like have like a fucking
year of your life being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I have this habit
that I just had as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's kinda fucking me
over and I wanna try and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something else, but God damn, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this pizza feels so
fucking good right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joe laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's not even like I don't
even eat that shit anymore. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I most certainly do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I kinda like trying to bounce
it out how much I do eat. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it's not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an everyday thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate talking about this shit online, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause everyone's just a expert about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like in the comments, no doubt,
they'll be like 10 people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would be like, "I'm a nutritionist expert. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm here to tell you that
you're totally wrong." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause everyone's got their own opinion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause most people have gone through it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Experience of seeing what's
worked for them and so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's the thing, it's
what's worked for them, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that doesn't mean
it works for everybody. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As long as you do it healthy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're not starving yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you see some people are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, I lost 10 kilograms in a weekends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like that sounds
like a terrible idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What did you do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That sounds awful.
- That must have been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some painful shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shitting that F. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel like it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think one important thing is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just because something
worked for someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't necessarily mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it's gonna (indistinct) something else. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's really like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what I found is it's really
a trial, what was it like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And error. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trial and error. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Trial and error.
- Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trial by fire.
- Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You either die or you diet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You either eat this or you fucking die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You try or try dying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about just try starving yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You either lose weight or you die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I used to be like fucking
paranoid about like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well, what's in this thing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I just started
thinking like if I just eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a reasonable amount of
things and exercise, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I'll be all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that kinda worked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like carbs? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I eat a lot of carbs, but I
just eat them within reason. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> My meals are never too big. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like I eat a fair amount of food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like when I stopped
giving shit about calories </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and stuff like that
and just thinking like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is this portion stupid? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is this a whole large Domino's pizza? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Should I eat this? Probably not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So probably not gonna do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I feel like another
thing is that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe it's just me, but I think
I just enjoy food too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not like I enjoy
eating a lot of food, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> But we talked about (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We talked about enjoying
the little things in life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every now and again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And for me, like my day is like 70% worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I know I don't have a
good meal to look forward to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is why I've just
become an Uber Eats slave </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> at this point. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I every day order from it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the problem, right?
- It's terrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But especially because
like Japan is just the land </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> of fucking great food
everywhere, food's become a hobby </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> at this point.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like if I
don't have a good meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like I feel empty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just feel sad.
- I feel like my day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like, yeah, completely empty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel unfulfilled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go to sleep and I'm just like, I'm sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have nightmares. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had the worst Uber Eats
order of my life the other day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh, it was fucking tragic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, the pictures looked amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ratings were good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was a pork bowl Butadon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
And it looked very nice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this places only did pork bowls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought, great, they
specialize in this one thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking magical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I order it, you know,
it takes a little while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, not like crazy amount. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, so it gets here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's packaged amazingly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks like they've really
cared about the packaging. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Give you an oshibori. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oshibori, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A wet towel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like an actual, like thick one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, like a proper one?
- A thick one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the rolled up one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like really thick ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, damn (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting really excited for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Okay, they give their own chopsticks, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really nice chopsticks as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> So I open this bad boy up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Looks pretty good, looks pretty good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, okay, fantastic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I dig in and I'm like, oh no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, okay, this part
of the rice is kinda hard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well, maybe it's just this one section. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It happens that it clumps up, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I hit another part and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no, this part's hard too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I put it in
another part and it's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> And I go, maybe it needs a little force. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe it needs a little. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I pull it apart a little bit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I picked this up
with like the whole bowl </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I go to just pick up what I think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is a small amount of rice,
and the whole rice comes out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I picked the bowl up, the whole
bowl, like formed comes out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I, no joke, this is why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was starting to get a little angry. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I had my chopsticks like this
in my hand like a barbarian </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> stabbing it and like ripping it apart, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I couldn't rip it apart. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I shuffled the meat on top to one side </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and this is where I was like barbarian. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I literally tried to grab it with my hands </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> to see if I could separate this rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could not separate this
rice with like my full grip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it like not even cooked or what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what the fuck they did to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I gave them one stars and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally, don't give
me a brick next time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they said, sorry- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a literal brick of carbs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were like, sorry,
you didn't like it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll improve next time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, give me a refund. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't eat it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I didn't even get a fucking refund. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They ruined my whole night, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it was like 9:00 PM
and everywhere had closed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, no.
- And I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't order anything now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just gonna fucking
eat a sembe or some shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gotta resort to fucking
convenience store food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I ate a sandwich
and it was depressing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how depressing it is eating a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's depressing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so depressing
- Eating a- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A sandwich at 9 PM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A large sandwich as a dinner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something about it is so depressing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why.
- Yeah, I know. I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It is-
- A ham sandwich for dinner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is depressing.
- Bon appetit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I say, having a meal to look forward to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even mean like
a five-star gomy meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no.
- Just like a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> filling meal, even like
a nice home-cooked meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just something on a plate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> A decent thing on a plate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I tear up when I order
a meal here and it's just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember, going back to Uber Eats, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember there's this
Thai place I order from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I'm like missing
home or whatever, but like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's on the weekend? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no idea.
- It's the really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I like it.
- It's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I order from them like four times a week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, same.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - (indistinct) is funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a lot of Thai food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never get sick of pad thai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I get the
craving every now and again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I'm very picky when
it comes to Thai food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And my problem with this place is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they never fucking make it spicy enough, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of course.
- That is true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's no spice.
- Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a Thai person, and I
like every time, every time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure they fucking know me by name now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause every time I'm just
like, spicy, please spicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you put it in like the comments? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I put it in the comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, spicy please and
it's just never spicy enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I open it and I could
tell that they put a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chili flakes on it and- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just opens it, doesn't
even smell, it's like, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you can- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Take it back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can tell when someone didn't try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> with the spice, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like there's Thai chilies </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then there's like
chili flakes, and okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So like last week, this one time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like, let me
try something different. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> So I asked for it spicy again, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't type it in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I type it in Thai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Big brain. Big brain.
- Big brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, I typed it in Thai, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember opening it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember getting the same takeaway box, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opening up this package, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this thing looked
like it had been cooked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the flames of hell, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking Lucifer grilled this himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I open it and like the chili
to rice ratio was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was more Chili than rice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you like rice on your chili? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can you copy paste what you sent to him? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna see this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna try this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd never been more
happy in my life when-. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was it good? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn. Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I ordered the pad krapow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and pad krapow is normally
really, really spicy in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know it's spicy
when you have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have trouble finding the
meat through the chili, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's like you got the normal meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you got like the
red and green chili flakes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and not just chili, just like raw chilies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like (claps)
you're my brother. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Now I know you're a brother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck, this is like when we went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the Indian place near here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They do like Indian food, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I think we'd always asked
for it really spicy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very spicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was quite spicy,
but it wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, to you guys' level? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> even though I am extremely
white, I love spice </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that pretty much cripples me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah-
- 'Cause to a standard person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like myself, that shit's spicy enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- But to these like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking spawns of Satan, it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause in Japan, when
you do you tell them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> to make it like 10 or
max, they don't do it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And the first time we went
there, the first few times, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the person who was cooking,
it's always the same guy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he didn't actually make it that spicy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was kinda like, ooh, ooh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was definitely Japan standards, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was like high end for
Japan standards, I'd say. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then one time, for some reason, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know why he decided this time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> he was like, "Fine, I'm not playing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like, bet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like, "Fine, I'm
not playing anymore." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And holy fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This shit is hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I got like halfway through
this and I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm actually in like severe pain. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like this is actually brutal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt couldn't finish it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was the one week
where you had to go home early. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So we're in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Indian place.
- This man dd not play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he was not playing around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think I could see him like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the corner of my eye just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - He was watching us.
- He was like watching us. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was giggling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause we've been there so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We order the same meal every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We order like the most spicy option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we finish it.
- It's spicy but its not like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's spicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a nice tingle on your tongue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if he was like, "All
right, the pussy boy is gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma give you guys the real shit now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it was by far the
spiciest meal I've had in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I could not finish it
'cause it got to the point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was just, yeah- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My mouth got numb
about knit (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is enjoyable about that, though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't get it.
- I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because the flavors get
enhanced by just beating </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the shit out of it.
- No, I get that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to a certain extent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the level you guys have, it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like, I don't even
know what flavor is anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I feel like it
depends on the dish, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean you can go to like CoCoICHI, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so to explain, have we
talked about that before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - CoCoICHI is like a Japanese curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have it in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, and so you can go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to this curry chain in Japan and they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a spice scale from one to 10, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like 10 is the most spiciest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've had the 10
before, and so as Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for me it was actually
like really spicy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but it felt like-
- There's no flavor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It just felt like you're adding spice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for the sake of adding spice, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There are some dishes that I
feel are designed to be spicy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not like flavor
enhanced spice, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just spice for the sake of spice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me a mild curry, a mild
Japanese curry at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is as good, if not better, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than some of the spicier versions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But there are some like Thai
dishes and Indian dishes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Southeast Asian dishes where I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't have enough spice to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's missing a certain kick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a certain flavor to it.
- Yeah, I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It brings out a lot of flavors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and also just a lot of
endorphins from the pain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I get- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm constantly chasing the high. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I get the fact of like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the spice enhances the
flavor and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I've had my fair share </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Southeast Asian food
and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> which is quite spicy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm just like, oh,
this is hard to eat, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but, God damn, this
probably tastes way better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than without the spice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then there's your
guys' level of spice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - See the reason why
I got into spicy food, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> cause again, you have to bear in mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my parents thought like paprika was spicy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So when I was growing up, we
didn't really eat spicy food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when I started doing YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I started doing the like fucking
stupid pepper challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done it so many
times where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could handle the Carolina
Reaper like semi comfortably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like shit, spicy
food isn't spicy anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've just been
eating these peppers raw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> constantly for fucking YouTube challenges </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and Twitch live streams. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I got to the point
where I was like, oh God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like really good now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like having cabaneros on
stuff is like perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. See, because like-
- I love that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - When we're talking about
CoCoICHI levels of spice, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's the easiest gauge
when you're in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what level
of CoCoICHI can you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You immediately know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can now do level three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- But before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a couple of years ago,
I couldn't even do level one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was back when Joey
was wearing a diaper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's when I was wearing a diaper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's when I was a true pussy boy.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like, you need something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You need at least like a two.
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But you guys can say that
because you're used to this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you've been eating it for a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like even some
foods where there's an option </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to pick a spicy version, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't always pick the spicy version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It very much depends on the dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and whether it compliments it or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean now I can do a level
three and now I understand like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, this is actually so
much better with spice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to a certain degree. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But like I had to kind
of slowly trick my brain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into thinking that, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because if you had given me
a level three spicy CoCoICHI </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like two years ago, I
would have been like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what is this shit? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This isn't enjoyable at all. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I seek enjoyment out of my meal
and this was not enjoyable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm in severe pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But now I've like slowly
started to appreciate the pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey says getting a level three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I say that getting a level three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But for me that's-
- I'm feeling those endorphins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Love that.
- Yeah, honestly like to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> that's fucking painful,
but like it's good painful. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like now I'm finally
starting to understand. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, oh, okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> These like other friends
I knew who could eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like level seven and eight,
who I just thought were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely fucking maniacs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just like the noob anime characters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, I kinda get it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - After my training, I'm
slowly starting to get it now. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it's really weird, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because obviously you grew
up in a Thai household, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> eating spiced food all your life, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you think I would be the same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my dad loves spicy food? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know like the death
sauce that they sell here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> My dad would just put that in meals. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's god stuff.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But to me, I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> why are you putting cyanide
in a perfectly nice meal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would you poison
this meal like this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause then he would fucking
serve it up to the family. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God!
- And we would have to eat it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That reminds me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> My older brother, he was
growing Carolina Reapers and- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like wanted, he likes spicy food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But one time, this was right
before I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he gave them to my
parents and just told them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like normal peppers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my, why would you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That is truly evil. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's a true crime story (indistinct). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so what happened was is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, oh yeah,
they were saying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, Brett's been growing some peppers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's given us some. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm gonna put them in
the stir fry tonight." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, okay, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know that they were- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Carolina Reapers.
- They were Carolina Reapers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or ghost peppers, one or the other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, they're both fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're both fucking hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bear in mind, my parents do believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that paprika is spicy, I'm not joking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad watches the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He'll be like, "You're lying, Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so they made me, it's the
way they did the stir fries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They make it and they give it to me first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like they make it for my dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my mom makes for herself last. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, this is like
five minutes in between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm eating this stir fry and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm getting kinda like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, this hurts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm thinking like, oh, whoa, mum, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what peppers did you use? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's like, "Oh, this is your brother. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He grew them and gave them to us." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, did he say what
kind of peppers they were? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, "No, no, he just said he grew them." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, they got
a little kick to them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, I think I
got a bit of kick it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like (wheezing). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they put all of them
in, like seven or eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All of them.
- Oh my fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Seven or eight ghost
peppers, all of them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your brother was trying
to kill your parents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My parents didn't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> They thought they were
like the normal spicy- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, did your parents eat them? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so what happened next is that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, I warned them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, I really think,
bear in mind, I'm like, (coughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I really think that
you should like go easy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the peppers on yours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you can like kinda get
them out a little bit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think you should do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, "No, no, it's fine,
we've had it before. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> We've had these peppers before." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pictures taken before a disaster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - At that point I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Fine, let's just see what happens. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's just see what happens. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's just see how this unfolds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I'm there like literally
like that meme of that kid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> with the vein on his forehead </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> after just eating these peppers, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> trying to keep a straight face like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And my daddy he's about to eat it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He takes one spoonful and
he's like, yeah. (coughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> "Wow that's pretty. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's really spicy, huh, why?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And he just started crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought it was so funny. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And my mom thought he
was over-exaggerating. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right, right.
- So my mom is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, I'll try it too." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - And my mom starts doing
the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She starts fucking go
(coughs), after like one bite. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And they just couldn't finish it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just started drinking
milk for like 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do they expect?
- They were just dying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It was the funniest,
I don't know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, if I was your parents,
I'd take one look at you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, oh, he's probably
not making this shit up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I thought they
thought I was exaggerating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with how much spice I could deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was texting my
brother after I ate a bite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, what the
fuck are these peppers? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What peppers are these? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> What are these, habaneros, ghost peppers? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like, "Oh, Carolina Reaper." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, why would you
give them to my parents? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You know they can't eat these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Your parents, is just
(indistinct) innit? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Casually killed mum and dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your parents trusted you too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think from that point I would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I just never accepted any
peppers from my parents, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause-
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I saw them and I thought, oh God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they look like ghost peppers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some interesting shaped
peppers you got there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't look like the
store, the thin green ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They've got like the big plump,
like the shrivel light ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Satan's toe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- What's the spiciest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've had? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd probably say habanero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, other than the
fucking like death sauce </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like, you know, the- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, have you ever eaten
like a Carolina Reaper or like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a ghost pepper.
- No, why would I do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, we need to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- YouTube challenge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would I do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because it'll be fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no one would want... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> For you.
- Let's build up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> your tolerance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - For you guys it would be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> People on YouTube just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trial by fire. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Trial by fire. Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why did I teach them that phrase? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - People on YouTube when I watched it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I think I first
saw Rhett and Link do it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> back in like 2012, and
they were like. (pants) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is just discomfort. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why would I willingly
put myself into discomfort? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shit makes great content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Fuck you want me there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who doesn't love killing
themselves for content? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've eaten like monster
ramen, (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's way worse.
- How did you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> How did you know I'll do
anything for content? (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause you're a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's how YouTubers' minds work, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You got me there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I won't do it.
- You got me there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, we're gonna film it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna film it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, okay.
- All right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> next "Trash Taste" special </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The winner doesn't have
to eat a Carolina Reaper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The two losers do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, that's gonna be the hardest run </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to a W in my existence. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then if it's one of
us, we have to eat three, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you have to eat one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm eating one either way? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's say you win, me and
Garnt have to eat three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's not gonna
do anything to you guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, three will fuck me up.
- Three will. Three will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- All right. Fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'ma be high as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> On those endorphins
- The endorphins like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mess with your head, man.
- It does, it does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember like the first time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the first time I
probably had a ghost pepper </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or a Trinidad Tobago or a
Carolina Reaper, the spice high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought I'd heard about it before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I didn't realize it was
literally like getting high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you feel the after effects
for like hours afterwards, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because you feel this
like warm, tingly glow, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you just feel like
you did something nice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, ooh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's going on.
- Its when the initial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 minutes of pain is over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's pretty nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I kinda- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Meilyne looks very
unimpressed and unconvinced. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean-
- It's great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, I've had
death sauce (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> which is technically ghost pepper sauce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like it's-
- It's (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, if we're talking
like just raw peppers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've only done having habanero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think the spiciest thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like singler thing I've ever
had was back in university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it wasn't even like a ghost pepper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a ghost pepper extract.
- Oh, yeah, the extract. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the extract shit.
- Which is like, even more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't like a sauce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's concentrated ghost pepper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, it was just
like the pure extract. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'd never like, at this point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd obviously like still
grown up on spicy food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'd never had like a ghost
pepper or like a natural, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the famous hot peppers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people do YouTube challenges about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I remember we were
drinking and my mate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he had this ghost pepper extract </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that he was like daring people to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's just carrying it around, was he? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, he's that asshole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was like that guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was the guy you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You know the guy who would show people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the two girls one cup kind of videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We all had that one friend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the pain Olympics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was that friend.
- Oh, God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So of course, he had this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ghost pepper extract.
- I was that friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - (indistinct) only fan I
will go to see was recently, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I found really funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You (indistinct) go to
was like two weeks ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I Didn't know what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please don't look it up.
- Don't look it up, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is someone's cheeks being spread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's all you need to know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so he had this
ghost pepper extract, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and of course we were drinking
as you were at university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it had gotten to a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we were like tipsy enough to start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> contemplating doing stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course.
- And, of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know he's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gonna commit credit card fraud. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you know he's
an experienced friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he brings it out at
the exactly the right time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the night where
everyone's intoxicated enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to think that it's a good idea to- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- What a horrible mate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> What a fucking...
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What a horrible friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Just waiting till everyone
is just semi-stupid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> so that he starts feeding them poison. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he brings out this
extract and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo, I dare anyone to
fucking do this," right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> And I see people doing it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And they're taking like the tiniest, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the tiniest little drop, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's not even a drop, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like less than a drop, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I see people fucking dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And me being like, yo, yo- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The giga Chad that I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - These weak ass white guys
don't know their fucking spice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at all these guys, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And so I say, it gets to my turn, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, I'll show
you how man does it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like there's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Famous last words.
- You've never ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> said that out loud. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That is not a guy phrase. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, if there's one
thing I was confident over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's taking fucking splice level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think you'd
ever say, and I quote, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "Let me show you how a man does it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So how the extract
works is you have this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> tiny little spoon, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That you can like put
like one little drip on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I fill up the spoon and I just fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shove it in my mouth.
- Oh, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you do that?
- I did not know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how spicy it was, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I never knew that
I could literally feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I've been shot in
the face until I like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just the biggest instant
regret moment on my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Normally you see people taking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they take the Caroline
Reaper, they chew on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's like this delay, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, there was not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like instant. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - There was not a single delay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, my body went into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> fight or flight mode immediately. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I was fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I took it and then like
five seconds later, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear I was in the fucking
fetal position, just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ah, ah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh God, it hurts so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna try this now, this sounds fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It' okay.
- What do you what? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What are you on? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's interesting, I'd like to try that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I will say, I do not recommend it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> As someone who can handle
my spice, I literally- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was nice taking, don't worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was not a pleasant experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was always that kid who
saw "Jackass" I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because what happened is
I was out of commission </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for the entire night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course you were.
- Because it was so spicy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that it just induced my gag reflex. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was on the toilet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like in the bathroom
for like a good three hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like gagging on the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Couldn't throw up, it was just
like my gag reflex just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my body trying to throw up this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like one little drop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was nothing to throw
up, it was like a drop, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But it had induced this gag
reflex and I was on the toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for about three hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And my university mates being
the good mates that they were, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just kinda went clubbing. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And just left you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They just left you while
you were on the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What fantastic mates
you have there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a fantastic group of mates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean that's why I'm not
friends with them anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Long story short, I'm not in contact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> with any of my uni mates anymore, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not in contact with many either, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but they didn't poison me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were nice to me. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe what if it was all a ruse, Garnt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where they all agreed to
take small amounts of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just so that Garnt would
step up to the play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, let me show you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> how it's done.
- They're all like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "We wanna go clubbing but
we dont wanna take Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> How can we knock him out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's get him out of commission. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know a way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I know a way that Garnt
would fall through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's what they did Garnt, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The spice challenge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I've read that
no one has ever died </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from spice before or like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could go into shock
though, Garnt, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Meilyne, look it up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Has anyone ever died from spice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they can go into shock. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't die from the chemical itself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can die from shock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can die from the pain it induces. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Which is shock, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- you can get cardiac arrest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But its always fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically just don't
do something stupid like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could go into cardiac arrest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Doctors hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just get better arteries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ten ways to stop heart attack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't go under cardiac arrest.
- Just don't take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ghost pepper extract,
or any kind of extracts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wasn't going to, and I
think I'm still not going to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I think that's, (indistinct).
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm good.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can stop breathing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] You can stop breathing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Just manually pump
those bitches, just like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Garnt, CPR me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like my lungs stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just like that scene
from fucking "Pulp Fiction," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just passed out
and they have to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking needle and inject
it straight into my heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bam!
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's so scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- Oh, God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - My God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm just gonna take
it one step at a time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when it comes to spice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm doing a pretty good job
going up the ladder, I feel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just wondering about CPR, I just, sorry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause it just let's just talk
about (indistinct) my chest, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I feel I'm too British to do CPR. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel I'd be like, are you okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are you okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this too much? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this too much pressure? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> While I'm trying to save their life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, one, oh is that- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how to do CPR? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, so I was a lifeguard
so we had to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Yeah.
- Luckily, I always stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> those little before
they stopped breathing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you ever have to like do it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, God know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'd know which kids were gonna drown </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right before they walked in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 100%. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Why? How do you know.
- I wish I was joking. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay, I might as well just tell stories </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> about being a lifeguard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's just so fucking, so many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically whilst I was
working at McDonald's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to be a lifeguard
'cause, well, I could swim and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a good start. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was a really strong swimmer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and there was a course that
I did that took about a week. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was really weird to have to do, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I had to sacrifice
a week of school vacation. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I only had one week and I spent it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learning how to be a lifeguard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I paid like 400 bucks and
then I couldn't get a job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a year and a half
'cause they were all like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, you don't have
experience," 'cause I was like 17. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that catch-22. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right, they didn't hire me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But eventually, 'cause
it paid really well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At the time McDonald's paid
me four pounds, 10 an hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> which is this much in dollars, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the lifeguarding paid
nine pounds, 10 an hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh wow.
- Which at the time- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a minted job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause the thing was you had
to have a week of training. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You'd pay for it all- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a double shift
at McDonald's right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - On paper, it looks like an easy ass job, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because all you have to do
is sit there for 30 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you get a 20-minute break. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you sit there for 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get a 20-minute break. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was it basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you're new, they put
you on the, at least mine did, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they put me on the shifts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was a kid's birthday parties. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause my mom's swam at that pool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they never put me on the
shift with the old people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause old people don't drown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Old people know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they swim.
- They know their limits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, 'cause they all
go to the swimming club </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all the time and they're not going to, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> apart from like freak
accidents, which never happened. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like people don't
drown in pools in the UK. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The year that I became a lifeguard, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> zero people died from pools in the UK. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, that's good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So, it doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Why are you laughing Meilyne? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Until I started the job. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But like, okay, so have
you ever seen those floats </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that take up all the pool? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like on the lanes and stuff, or? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The whole pool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a big inflatable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never seen that.
- Yeah, I've seen those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've never seen these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You have seen these, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You haven't seen these? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Google it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like the picture on screen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Literally they're these
massive kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> total wipe out ass courses
that you can inflate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they take up the whole pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you fall off,
you fall in the water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's great. Dude, it's bad.
- That sounds fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I was a kid, I loved the kid who- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds like a "Trash Taste" special </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> waiting to happen, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine like a bouncy house on water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> What the fuck?
- No dude, it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - A bouncy house?
- Imagine a total wipe out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> obstacle course on water. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Dude, it's bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, when I was 12, I loved this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Can we do that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Dude, we can go.
- Yeah, I wanna. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We can probably rent out a pool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hell yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Go back to the UK, we're gonna rent one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So like you could, basically
for kids' birthday parties, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there'll be like a five or
six-year-old who'd rent it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now, problem is with
kids' birthday parties, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that not every parent thinks that kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to be taught how to swim. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think 'cause parents forget that kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to be taught how to swim. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you just take it for granted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> So what ends up happening is, obviously, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a birthday party. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Everyone invites the whole class. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Now, half the kids in the
class don't know how to swim, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but they still are invited and go anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, I'd be
sitting that on my thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I can tell immediately, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which one of these kids can't swim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, they looked like that Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that looks fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What the hell?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they'd be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next special.
- They'd be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a climbing thing and then
you have to go through pylons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> then there's a slide at the end. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Now, you could tell immediately
when you look at these kids, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which couldn't swim. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They just had a look in their eyes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> where they were like, fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never been in this before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do I do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's a big like thing of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because they're also, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> kids are like that thing
where like most kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like a built in danger
system where they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like heights, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Kids know that they're scared of heights. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Kids know that water is
like weird and scary. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then the kids that
run in it right away, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> normally like they can swim. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But so you'd be doing this
thing and there'd be kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you'd see this kid,
you can just tell, again. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You can tell he doesn't
look confident, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He's techniques poor. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Looking at the water really scared. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like toe first into the water, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So they climb on this
thing, and bear in mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it starts at the shallow end
and it goes to the deep end </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you get off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then we're talking like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like two meters deep. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no more than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like five meters deep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Five meters?
- Five meters deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the pool I worked at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty fucking deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a kids pool.
- That's like a diving pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These kids would just walk, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they'd get to the
end of this obstacle course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and you could see it that
they were like, what do I do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Everyone else is going down the slide </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they're being egged
on by their friends. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they just go down the slide
and they would just go down. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - They just sink. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - They just sunk. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They didn't come back up.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They wouldn't come back up. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Fucking hell.
- And you would wait </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like two seconds just to
like make sure (indistinct). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just to make sure they don't come back up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then you have two choices. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You can either jump in or you
can get a really long pole </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and like poke them with it and hope they. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
- Get up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, normally-
- Let's just hope </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're still alive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hello? Hello, again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - So basically, if a kid is
splashing around to be like, ah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you just give him a
pole and he'll grab it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, like grab on to it.
- Yes, they'll grab on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They'll grab onto anything, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if they don't swim and they just sink, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ah, I gotta fucking go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So then I have to go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this should happen
like three or four times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes in like one session. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking hell.
- Cause these kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are just terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Sometimes I would go and
jump in, I would get a kid. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Stop, don't go near the deep end. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then he would go and
he would go near it again. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'd blow the whistle
back, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I look away for
a second, I look back, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he's at the deep end again,
jumps in, drowns again. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I have to go in and get him. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And tell his parents off, and
his parents have a go at me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and complained to my manager saying that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not my place to tell
her what to teach her kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, it's not my place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can just let your kid drown, huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> See what happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck?
- She went full Karen mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on me, trying to get me fired. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I bollocked her in front of her- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, because you saved their kid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After I saved his kid twice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I held his hand and I was
like, come, where's your mom? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Show me where your mom is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then we went to his mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where's your mom. (claps) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what are you doing?
- What are you doing? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was like why are you
letting this kid into this pool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> without any arm bands or anything? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And she's like, oh-
- Like didn't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any floaties or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why didn't they have armbands? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what her reason was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She was like, I don't want him to feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like he's the weird one,
the one who can't swim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But he's the one who can't swim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's because he can't swim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He will fucking drown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you understand how this works? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, did you ever
teach him how to swim? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "No." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are you letting him do this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is really irresponsible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I just left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this was in front of all her friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they had like a (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she complained saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't need to do that in
front of all her friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really inappropriate of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I'm sorry, but
you saw your kid drown once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and thought, "Oh, I'll
let him keep swimming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I let him keep going." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That really me off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm still really annoyed about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's just fucking irresponsible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just sounds like bad parenting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's terrible parenting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The people who do stuff
like they would just let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> their kids do- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unless the parent was
like, "Fuck, I've been trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to get rid of him." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - The fuck!
- Sabotaged again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That insurance plan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Damn, its really expensive monthly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's a really lay abortion plan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] We have it in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do they? Wow! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that looks amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you send that
picture when you're done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get ready. Next special. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Were fucking doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doesn't this look amazing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, it was a really
good job other than that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just like kids that just
like don't know how to swim </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you can tell a moment they can't swim. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And yeah, also if you ever tried to, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes if you'd, they taught you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I never thought I'd have to use this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They teach you how to
kick someone off you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> if they're like trying to drag you down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you're trying to save someone, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't drag me, you're coming with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause some people when
they think their drowning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they panic, and what they do
is that they push you down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Cause they think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna get up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And, you know, it's not
like a selfish thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where they're like, "Fuck you." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm dying and you're
dying with me. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah literally, it's like
instincts kick in for them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they think I'm gonna
push you down to get up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so I can breath. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What was the technique? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So what you do is- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like aim for the head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
( laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> So if they're trying
to like grab on to you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and push you down, you grab
them by the arms and like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so let's say you're
equal now in the water, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> we're both on top of the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You grab them and like you
go down under the water, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kick them up and kick them off you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You push them away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you usually just grab
them by the face when you- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - What are you doing? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> When you save someone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're supposed to grab
them by the chin like this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like pull them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Holy shit! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or you can, there's some other ways, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's the easiest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that way you can kinda
just do it at your own pace. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's other ways that you can grab them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> but that's really awkward. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It depends like how big they are. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And if it's like a child, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> like sometimes grabbing them by the face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might be a bit much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck! Get over here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Get over here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just imagine you like
you're wielding children, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> grabbing in the face. (groans) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (roars) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know the worst thing, when you... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the thing that you
don't really think about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> is that you don't bring spare uniforms, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause that's really your thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you go in and you save a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's still your shift, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you just go right back to
the chair and you're soaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, some people
they take the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the first time I did it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought I have to go in right away, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I have to save that life right away. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I wouldn't take my
shoes off or anything, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but then I realized all the
people who are experienced, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would just walk down slowly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They would just take off
their shoes and socks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause they knew they had time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and they knew like it's a pool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - They know they're gonna
grab them right away. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> So they're like, "I'm not
getting my Nike Air Maxes wet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (indistinct) kid's
drowning and they kinda like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> start the timer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They sit down like this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They see them like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if they're flailing,
you got plenty of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So they would just sit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'd like walk down
really slowly like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they'd be like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Take the watch off like
this, you know, like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then they would go in to get them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just thought it was really bizarre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, why did you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't that like bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They're not gonna drown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're not gonna drown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know the average time it
takes for a human to drown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, the moment I feel worried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is if they don't come back up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> That's when you have to
like immediately go in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So that was like, that was fine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And again, this like never happened ever. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This was only with little kids,
'cause little kids are dumb. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, I make out these stories </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to be a lot more exciting than they are. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> In general, the job was extremely boring. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like it is one of the hardest jobs to do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just out of sheer insanity. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You sit there for 30 minutes at a time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just watching people swim. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then you take a 20-minute break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you'd go back to it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is like for like six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just watching people swim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And at first it's such
a weird thing to do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I'm like, yo, what do
people get a problem with me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like staring at them
while they're swimming? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I'm like, you don't
stare at people (indistinct). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> But you're gonna watch the pool, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then you're like, fuck, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is it weird that I'm looking at people, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like there's Parents watching me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> What if they think I'm
looking at their kid too much? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I'm just making sure that
they're not drowning, okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not weird, right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, according to (indistinct)- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't even thinking
about that until he said it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is the thing, these
are the thoughts you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're going insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> sitting there for six hours
thinking like, is it weird? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is it weird that I'm looking
at everyone for this long? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going insane.
- Sounds like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> an existential crisis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is my job? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I legitimately started like
going insane working there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I was like, you have to just think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so much.
- How long did you do that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - God, about just under a year </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then I moved away. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But yeah, I got that job
from doing a different job, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> which I talked about at different times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just completely different and
it was really funny as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like lifeguarding in general
it was like super boring, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but the pay was really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you have to get the qualification. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And you have to be taught a lot of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you're there to save lives. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah and the course is quite hard, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have to redo it every year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I can't be a lifeguard
now 'cause I didn't renew it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But for the one year it was fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean the pay was insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for like being 18 and (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like learning
the basic first aid skills </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is really fucking important.
- Yeah, it was really helpful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I was never taught it at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We don't get taught in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, we don't get taught, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so I don't know how to do CPR. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They come in once and they're
like, push the chest and blow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh we- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't even get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even get that.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We taught it every
year during high school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do not know how to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the fucking Heimlich maneuver only. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I need to learn that as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - We just have to learn all the basics- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I should probably learn it now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's gonna be real
awkward if I'm gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> hold on, let me just bring
up this YouTube tutorial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for a second. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got an unskippable ad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's sponsored. It's sponsored. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've got an unskippable ad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Hold on a second. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wifi. Where's the Wifi? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of aspects of the
job were fun, but not many. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to like clean as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like clean all the toilets and showers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> which was like, I mean, I
didn't know I was gonna do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Glad you spent 400
bucks to clean toilets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, you're there
and when you're wrapping up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and there's no one left in the pool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you just start cleaning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause that's what you're
supposed to do, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then sometimes I had to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause even though I
wasn't teaching the kids, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but for the kids who
are like one year old, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're learning how to swim, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there had to be someone in the
water constantly with them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And those kids just fucking
like don't let go of you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's like, no, get
off me you little shit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like WrestleMania with like babies. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, get off me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're supposed to learn how to swim. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the moment they let
go of the wall they're like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And they suddenly gained the grip strength </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of like a grown man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it was all right job, really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It just paid well, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The kids at the pool were scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just kids, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kids fucking suck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if your kid can't swim,
teach them how to swim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like when did you
guys learn how to swim? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - My mom like swims
competitively and still does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I swear God and Andrea knows. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So she still does like
triathlons and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh shit.
- And she's one of the fastest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> women in her area and she's like nearly 55 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that.
- Damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She's a beast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> She's so much more healthy than me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's so sad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> When I go back home and she
wants to like go on a bike ride, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like dying and she's
like just breezing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A causal 50K bike ride? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go.
- No, that's what she does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like 50K bike ride? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did she watch the cycling special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I raised you better? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, she's like, "Pathetic, Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> No, no, no. Really. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you saw the raw
footage, mom, you can't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, so my mom taught me,
I've always known how to swim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't remember not being able to swim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wen to like a swimming school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember like swimming
was part of my curriculum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in like school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we had like a local
like swimming pool next, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not next to our school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like really, really
close to our school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like Monday mornings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were just dedicated to
learning how to swim. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's good.
- Wow! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not a strong swimmer by any means, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I still know the basics,
I still know how to swim. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like to me it's still scary
whenever I go out and I swim </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I can't feel the bottom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fear kicks-
- There's something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so wholesome about hearing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It just sounds like a
child problem. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> When toes can't touch the floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean in the swim pool it's fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like out like out in the sea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember the first time- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, what's worst is
when I can actually feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like something underneath-
- You kick something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you kick something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's when I'm scared. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean like if, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like in a pool, completely fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a if I can't feel the bottom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the first time I realized it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we were on the beach. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was Brighton Beach's work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it wasn't exactly a
fucking thrilling beach. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember like my mates just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though, we were kinda just
like, oh yeah, let's go swim out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and swim out to where
like the fucking boys are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've never done it before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I knew how to swim. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember we got there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is the first time in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I had swam that far out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is the first time in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I got to this point
and I started kicking down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and my whole life experience had taught me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter how deep it is,
you can still stand up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so it was this
realization where we get there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and we start floating on
the water and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's the floor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Where's the ocean floor?
- This is what happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you're six foot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You take floor for granted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I never had a swimming pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I couldn't like stand up
at least on like my tiptoes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I sink down a little bit
and then I can still see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the surface of the water,
I'm still on my tip toes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can reach the surface quite easily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this was the first time
where I'd gone this far out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had the realization of, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is no edges to this pool
that I can quickly grab onto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've gotta swim literally
like all the way back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the fucking beach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the beach, like, you
know, that scene in the movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the character gets vertigo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they look down and
the ground just suddenly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like zooms out, that's exactly how I look. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's exactly what the beach looked like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I turned around and it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the beach just went, like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why you shouldn't be swimming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're getting even like 1% tired, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you should turn back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was already pretty tired. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should turn the fuck around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's how people drown. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's probably like the closest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I've come to drowning as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - People get tired and they swim out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're tired by the time they turn around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yeah, I remember turning
around and being like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've gotta fucking do this
because one of the scariest- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - My life literally depends on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - My life literally depends on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, guys, I
think I gotta turn back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't think I kind of conveyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how fucking terrified I was to my mates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they were like,
"We're just gonna keep going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if that's cool with you." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, (pants) okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna turn back now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What a great group of friends- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Those are bad mates
if they let you do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I didn't have
a good group of mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was growing up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I heard even like
a breath from my friend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounded a little too
heavy and we're swimming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, turn the fuck
around and get the fuck back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause when you get further
out, the waves get stronger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the currents come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's when it gets
really fucking scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I can't think of
anything more depressing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> than just dying on
(indistinct) beach as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> At least if I'm gonna die on a beach, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me done a good beach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) Like a nice beach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come to Wales, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We've got the finest beaches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We've got the finest beaches, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - My fondest memory as
a kid, 'cause Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> every fucking house has like a pool in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause otherwise you can't survive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the (indistinct) summer.
- Full luxury. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't survive the summer otherwise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But my fondest memory, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know if this
is like a collective memory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for everyone, like every
kid who like swam in a pool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but did you use to do this thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you would go under the water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you would
pretend to like walk under </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to feel like you were in like on the moon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the only memory I have
of being in a pool. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even though I went to swimming
school for like seven years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to learn how to like do all
these different swimming things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like all these fun
activities and whatnot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only thing I remember was
like, yeah, I'm on the moon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What intelligent
thoughts Joey (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm on the moon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - The whole time you're
talking about like the pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my head that was just
replaying over and over again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I wanna go swim in a pool again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's sad because it's so
hard to like find a place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to swim, yeah.
- There's like no pools here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Its like they hate
swimming for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unless you fucking pay 150
bucks a month to go to a gym </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that also just happens to have a pool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd paid to go to a gym
with a pool on it, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna swim.
- I just wanna go in a pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and swim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't seen a pool anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's weird to think they
just don't like pools. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, I don't know
how statistically correct </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is, but there's a lot
of even adults in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that would just never learned to swim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean if it wasn't
part of my curriculum, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I probably would not
have learned how to swim. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know where I would've
gotten the motivation </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, okay, I'm going
to go out and figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how I'm going to fucking
play through water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Pool's everywhere in the UK. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) in the public.
- Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just pay like two
pounds and you go swimming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause in Australia it's
almost like second nature </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, oh, your kid is
like three to five years old. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, then we're gonna take
you to swimming school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As someone who's a
lifeguard, was it pretty common </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like you to find
pieces of in your pool? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it happened like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in a year.
- It happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like code brown. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So it was like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Code brown.
- That's what it was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You have to empty... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone has to get out and
you have to close the pool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause you have to re-sanitize it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's like it's contaminated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause obviously there's
tons piss in there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you can't see it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the moment you see a giant
mass bar floating in there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta fish it out and then
you gotta kick everyone out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Same if like someone throws out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I think more people throw up than- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Throwing up in a pool? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ah, I guess, from drinking
little pool water, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe some kids are
stupid they would like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> some of them would drink the pool water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of them would just eat a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and they'd like jump around
and then swim a bunch, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get really exhausted and
then they would throw up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - How long would it take to
fucking sanitize the pool? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. We had
like a Roomba that did it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> There's like a Roomba that
went around the bottom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's bunch of-
- Oh yeah, like the little? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, we used to have these (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it would go around
and it would clean it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but the water is like never like emptied. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like recycled, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you gotta do a chlorine
test every like two hours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sure the chlorine levels are okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I never did that, I wasn't allowed to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "We don't
trust you with chlorine." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) We don't
trust you with chemicals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "We don't trust yo with
the chlorine, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get outta here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was never like a manager
there, so I was just like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember still having
like fucking vivid memories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> when I was like learning how to swim, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like finding a shit
in like the swimming pool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it happened like
twice, I think, to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause like we would never float. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You would always be at the bottom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like as a kid, I was just like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I was always been shortsighted. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was always shortsighted my entire life. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I didn't know this until
I was like maybe 10 years old </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I was shortsighted. (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Actually, I remember. (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember as a kid, I would
be sitting really close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to the TV because like when
I'm playing games all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My mom was just like, "Stop
sitting so close to the TV." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, but I can't see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my mom's just like, "Look harder." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not looking hard enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get better eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my, Garnt.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was only when we realized
that when I (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The audience will fight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just born with bad
eyesight unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So as a kid, I didn't
have glasses at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I would be swimming in the pool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and I would see this like little, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I remember seeing this like
little black fucking thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like in the corner of this pool, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What did you do? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And it was fucking
blurry as fuck, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just like, what the is
this black thing in the corner. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never seen in the corner pool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so like out of, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they say curiosity killed the cat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> So me being the curious little, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> `fucking six-year-old I was or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swim closer and closer
to it, right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And looking back, I can
hear the fucking "Jaws" music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just playing in the background. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, ta-na, ta-na. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I start swimming closer and closer it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it starts like slowly, slowly- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Enhancing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Slowly, slowly coming into focus, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it starts like, okay, so
it becomes this blurry mess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it becomes this cylinder shaped thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, what the
fuck is a cylinder shaped thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing in the swimming pool, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I get closer and I get closer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I'm literally like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so the the shit's there, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I literally was just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (claps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause like when it felt like
it fully came into focus, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously when I'm this close </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I can see the entire fucking
detail in everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're like two inches
away from pieces of shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you can see the fucking texture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the shit right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's how detailed
it was in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I let out the biggest underwater scream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had of my fucking life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was literally like
a fucking horror movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm just like, (screams). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what the... (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> That's such a good story.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's a great story. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - The weirdest time there
was a shit in the pool, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and this happened to me
twice while I was there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was just completely confused </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at how there was a shit in the pool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I still to this day cannot
figure out what happened. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I'd love some scientists
in the chat to explain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what the fuck happened. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- So they would do this thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> at my pool where they would have like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how to learn how to kayak. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So they would let like six people- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like in the pool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, they would put
six kayaks in the pool </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and just let people kayak around it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And I don't know how this happened, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but after the kayakas left,
there was a shit in the pool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, they're in kayaks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> How did it get in the pool? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did some of them just window, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like put that butt out just for a second, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like squeeze it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> How does that happen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How is there shit in
the pool after kayaks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Does anyone have an idea
of how this happened? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> We were all completely confused </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and luckily it was the end of the day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but we were just like, how
is there shit in the pool? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're looking back at like
the security footage camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "We gotta find the exact moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when the poop came out.
- We wish. We wish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We wish we had security
footage to fucking analyze </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if someone had done a cheeky shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Did they bring it and drop it in? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, did they do it in the kayak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just fucking scooch it in? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> To this day, I wake up in a cold sweat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wondering how did that shit get in there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, were they like
adults in the kayak? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, it was just like
15, 14, 13-year-olds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What 15, 14-year-old is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'ma in this pool." (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kids are fucking weird, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kids are weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - But you think like
after like the age of 12, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you think like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nah, nah, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is like a mental stop in my brain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, no, pooping
in the pool is bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some kids so dirty, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't give a shit.
- (scoffs) Gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, even just
pissing in the pool, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've done it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone's done it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's something we don't- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not gonna pretend like I
don't piss in the pool, okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's something that
we don't like to admit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but of course everyone's done it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone does it.
- Right, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never.
- Right, Meilyne? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sounds like smelling your own fart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Everyone does it.
- Sometimes, you just get in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the pool and you realize,
fuck, I need to piss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah
- I just got in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't wanna get out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not getting out, I'm gonna piss. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone else is doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We're all just drinking
each other's piss anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> This pool is massive, no one will know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got chlorine in it for a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Waving around a bit.
- Stop (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a fucking pool, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a public pool, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Public pool is basically piss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Why do you think they put fluoride in it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Michael Phelps says
he pisses in the pool? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> If Michael Phelps can piss in the pool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can piss in the pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it propels him, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like an extra jet engine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He is the gold standard of swimmers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> If he can piss in the pool,
as far as I'm concerned, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can piss in the pool.
- That's like a just propel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like through here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not shitting in the pool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- I'm not doing it, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Big difference between
pissing and shitting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - One of them evacuates the pool, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the other one is everything
everyone else is doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its not a problem, whatever.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will not have to
justify pissing in, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't just get in every pool
and I'm like, (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pissing time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm about to pee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - All I'm saying is if you're
in a wet suit on or something, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like, you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna make myself warm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know who else pisses
in the pool, though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Our Patreons.
- Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - All of these people
definitely pee in the pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - They definitely piss in the pool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Look at all these lovely
people right here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who piss in the pool.
- Look at all these lovely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> pool pissers, right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've gone from fucking from spicy food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to fucking pissing in the
pool while we do an episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of "Trash Taste"
- Sounds like a "Trash Taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> episode to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But hey, if you'd like
