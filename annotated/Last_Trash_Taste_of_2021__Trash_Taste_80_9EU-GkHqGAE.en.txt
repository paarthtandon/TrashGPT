<SPEAKER_02> out of like did it come out on new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> year's eve or did it come out on new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year's day i think it came out yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> new year's eve i think because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember just getting drunk with chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was like the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first episode of the year right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah so i think it must have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after new year's day then that doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like a year ago it doesn't feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my god like where did this year go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it feels like the past two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have just like flown by i mean 2020 just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disappeared in a flash obviously because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was just inside and depressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but like this year i feel we were able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go out a little bit more at least in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan we're able to go out a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more than last year but i think in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> case we just had so much [ __ ] going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that it all just like seems like a blur </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i was i thought i was busy in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2020 and then 2021 was like allow me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> introduce myself and then yeah every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know on the uh on the iphone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> calendar yeah yeah like when you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something on the iphone calendar like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have something on that day there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a little dot to symbolize it so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's very easy on iphone to see how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> busy your past couple months were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because every month i came up to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next month and i was like yeah i'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll be a lot more free next month like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is super busy next month though no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dots enter that month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all dots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh cool i had three days off last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> month no wonder i'm [ __ ] tired yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surreal seeing just your calendar fill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up because i remember when i first moved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to japan i i thought who needs a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calendar we're youtubers we don't need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calendars we make our own schedule you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> move to japan and slowly you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe i need a calendar just to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like keep track of like one or two days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then more stuff keeps creeping in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like oh wait i need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put my personal life on my calendar as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well because like now i don't know when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my mates want to hang out if i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something going on that day yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so surreal just being this busy and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i never expected to be this busy in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> life i mean it's definitely a good thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like you know it's a very uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a definitely a very privileged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> position i would say to be busy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing all sorts of cool stuff but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the same time you know it's only so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> much my body can handle you know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scene in like every like business movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the ceos like put it in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> calendar i i thought that was just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cliche </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh do i have time for this meeting put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it in my calendar it's only a matter of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time until we all have our own deborah's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pencil [ __ ] in for us i think so i i i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ironically want an assistant yeah right </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> dot is non-existent i have a day off i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can do whatever the [ __ ] i want but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i go to my computer i look at my other </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> sponsors all right so it's not a day off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a day to be inside but i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> necessarily doing anything outside so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a day off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh yeah that's been my life for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> past did you guys have to-do lists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i've been starting to like do to-do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lists now because i have to forget what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have to do list when i the day i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> discovered to-do lists like to do like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a caveman jumping over a rock yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a game changer there's a list of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had to do with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't even think cavemen were that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> impressed when they discovered fire like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i i because like one of my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly dude like especially when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes like our stuff because because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have so many things that we have to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so many things that we want to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dad actually taught me like how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make the perfect to-do list which is you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wake up in the morning and you think to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself all right you jot down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that you can think of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do and that you have to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you jot it down and then from that list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that is super important goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the top yeah everything that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything else that can wait a couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of days goes to the bottom yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go on with your day you tick off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that you do and at the end of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the day if you're left with a couple of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things that's all right that becomes the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> top of your to-do list the next day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and just i've been doing that for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the past year and i've become </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> infinitely productive like i i guarantee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what moodon does as well probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with the imagination </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm i'm like how do i find more hours in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you seem to like pull from this infinite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pool of hours that i don't know where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you find i don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i just want to know what did mudan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sacrifice you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think you like how did it cost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everything i think he hooked his like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brain and cardo like brain and heart to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a car battery it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly just going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't wait to come on and explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> himself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like just don't sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he's awful at like explaining how he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> productive like he doesn't make it sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic he's just like yeah you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just wake up in the morning i just do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he's the epitome of just get good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you like with mood on i only see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the input and output like input </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> editing work outputs a video i don't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like what happens it's basically just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a black box right it's like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube algorithm because like you kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of know how it works but no one really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knows the inner workings of the youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> algorithm that's just like mudan and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> editing for me man have you ever seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mudan edit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is on stream and that's where he's also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing something else but he's probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like holding back on streams as well as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people don't get freaked out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly that's how impressive it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like i i think you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people already know who watch the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are aware of just how much he edits for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste and also for me and connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i think people forget that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> other people also ask him to edit oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's he's out for sydney now as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right so i'm just like and not to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mention he edits his own streams and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> streams and he also streams and he also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> streams like pretty regularly so i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like what how the beast man i would like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to know what i do mudan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> episode we're also waiting for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> country to open back up which hopefully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will finally happen next year as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ish that's the biggest thing i'm hoping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for um i think it'll i mean it's gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happen next year it's just when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like is it going to happen early or late </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's the you know that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big question i think everyone is saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh like as early as maybe feb or march </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i think much would be nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> visitors can come in because right now i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think uh if you're a non-visitor so if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like a student or you're on work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fees or stuff like that you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> technically come in now yeah um not that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i've seen any actual examples of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> coming in well i assume they need to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real i haven't looked into the process </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i assume they need to reapply for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some kind of problem application </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um because you know not tourists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but at least if you have a working visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you've been waiting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a job or to study here then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can come here which is which is good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like it shouldn't have taken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two years to get to this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel bad for the students man yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know right just being like finally i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to live my dream of coming to japan no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes me feel so bad because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we applied we have to wait like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what three months and that was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the worst three months right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not it's not the fact that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three months it's the fact that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three months where you don't know what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to happen in your life and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like your your life is kind of in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> limbo until you get that confirmation to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like oh okay finally i can start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> packing i can start preparing to go and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then but while you're waiting you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like uh should i start should i go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's kind of going on in my life right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now i was wondering with the students </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing i was thinking like okay we had no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way of knowing that it's gonna take two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years for japan to open yeah and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what i i haven't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> spoken to any students about it but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what was like if you got to like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like day one right you find out japan's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closing like do you just like wait and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> see or do you just decide to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something else and then like hope and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hope that you can just then go back i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know i think i think for most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> students i don't think anyone was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anticipating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them to [ __ ] stay in limbo for two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years right so i'm sure the majority of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> students were like oh you know i you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know i still got time i can wait imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> losing two years of like i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> progress you could have made in your 20s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah but then again it's not it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not really that important because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess a lot of people in in life didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> start doing the their main thing until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like 40. so i guess it really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't [ __ ] oh yeah yeah sure i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i think what sucks is that you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have two years where you can't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> commit to something you know that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what really sucks for me where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i always want to have a goal that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> working towards and know that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actively working towards that goal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because one one of my biggest pet peeves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like if i feel like i'm not working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towards something then i just feel lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i just feel like a [ __ ] lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> soul and i need i need i need something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concrete to work towards yeah that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i really empathize to anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting for a visa and thank god you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guys can finally come here hopefully you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get here soon get to eat some superman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the number one thing [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sushi [ __ ] the ramen go to your local </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skimming joint and discover true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> happiness yeah we had we had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> michelin star ramen oh yeah we did and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was very exciting we didn't know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was michelin star right so there's a it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was the place man recommended to it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah was it ramen because i i thought it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was sober no it's ramen it's like chu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> casaba which is like chinese soba which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is like technically some people call it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ramen the noodles are more ramen noodle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> very light for a ramen it was very light </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like when i when you said like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen i was just like oh it's going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be a heavy ramen because ramen's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of meal that like takes you out it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knocks you out for like an hour yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was thinking about it i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay what do i i think i have the wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expectations of michelin star the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expects some kind of stupid luxurious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like gourmet thing but i guess it's more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about value </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it was like a thousand yen i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the one i got was like ten bucks yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean like eight dollars right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guess like it's amazing i have a picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of it it was it was very good but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole time i was thinking i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think tsukemen is more tasty i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was better than the michelin star robin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i agree honestly i i didn't enjoy the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen that much and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so because here's the thing right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like michelin star if you've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to enough of them especially in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like in japan there's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many michelin star restaurants but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've realized that you cut with michelin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> star you come in with like the wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expectations right yeah and this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to make me sound you know this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going to make me sound so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> privileged no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> michelin stars aren't all that great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about michelin star it's the michelin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> star but like here here's the thing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> retirement no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like here's the thing when you go into a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> michelin star restaurant your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expectations are like up here you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knows all well because he often </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> frequents the mission of course of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course no but like you you you come in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with these expectations that you you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna get like a meal that's a cut above </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the rest yeah right and so you start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> judging things harsher than if you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go to this random restaurant and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> find out that there's like amazing food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because in japan i feel like there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just as many restaurants that have food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like michelin star quality that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just haven't been discovered yet you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know and i've and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me like michelin star isn't always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the indicator of this is the best meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can get in japan what it only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> means is that it's it's become famous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enough that people have started to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> notice it but there are so many there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are so many hidden gems and like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> example with the michelin star ramen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is not like the best even the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen that i've had with the best i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> had i've had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've had like sketchy ass places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i i i honestly think the uh the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> insect ramen i had for my video was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually better yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that has a hundred times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not sitting on the street </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we haven't named the ramen place because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i also don't want to like [ __ ] make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it i'm saying that because the insect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ramen was actually [ __ ] amazing no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and and also like because it's michelin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> star it actually made it a worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> experience for me right because because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you wait in line because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expectations are too high right one yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your expectations is high and two it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really [ __ ] busy right so in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this ramen shop it's a tiny ass ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shop it's it's like when we say michelin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> star it's a really it's a normal ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shop right ramen stores in general are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like not i would say they're good dining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experiences yeah like you it's not it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you're if you want to come here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and chill out with your friends don't go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a ramen it's it's a come in eat and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go yeah yeah yeah i mean it only that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> place only said like what 10 or 12 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people maybe yeah yeah it's busy it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like narrow you're like if you're even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remotely large then larger than normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna have a tough time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> squeezing past everyone and like we went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at about 2 p.m so not even like not even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> close to peak time and we still have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wait like a good 20 minutes like 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes and this is this is when the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country is closed the tourists so when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tourists come back in i was talking to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people who've waited for this ramen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like an hour an hour and a half two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours right and you get you get shepherd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in and then you you're expected to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eat the ramen and leave right there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no down time you get given a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bowl you eat it and then leave you going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like to me part of like the food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like not feeling pressured to eat the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> food but just yeah but just like feeding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i can take my time to enjoy this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> food yeah i couldn't i couldn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like bask like as good as the ramen was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i couldn't bask in it because there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the pressure of oh i could take my time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with this but i'd also be pissing off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the 20 other people still waiting in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> line exactly right standing outside this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is why i've realized that ramen is best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at like midnight yeah you can just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they they have time they always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> serve beers everyone's having like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good time in there like it's a way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fun atmosphere like some of the stores </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that open 24 hours normally have a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more seats as well it is the ultimate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> midnight snack for sure it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly it's awful for your stomach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a good chance you might like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring it back up but yeah but some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the best ramen experiences i've had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> midnight we're in like a sketchy area of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some place in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's drinking beers in the store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's cool atmosphere everyone's talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so much more fun than ramen during </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the day where everyone's just there to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eat and get out yeah the best the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ramen experience i had was when i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely shit-faced yeah at like 2am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then my friend makoto was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 2 am and i was like uh okay so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ran around the corner to this like awful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sketchy place like the ramen wasn't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that good but just like fun it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fun like when the moment it went down i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was like damn good to feel alive but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then the moment you walk out it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's awful all right yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've ruined your stomach with you i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about gonna die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because to me like the restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience goes beyond just the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste of the food right there's there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a reason why your mom's cooking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> always tastes [ __ ] good right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's cause like because cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that cooking means something to you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you know you know where's the heart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> man what's the heart in the brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly honestly you can taste in some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese restaurants where they put the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> heart into the cooking oh yeah and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so obvious with some like very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i i just think that i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i realize that i don't like ramen as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much as i want to like ramen like oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i i uber eats men on sometimes all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and that [ __ ] is [ __ ] good yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because also ramen travels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> terribly that's why never ever order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ramen it's i mean unless you have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of those really old star ones where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like bring you the actual bowl with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that's that's the only one i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get problem is nowadays with ramen with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ubrites they separate the noodles and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the broth so they give you a broth and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a plastic really a lot of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they don't actually put the noodles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in you put the noodles in yourself yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not good and the noodle's supposed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like piping hot in the in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> broth so it doesn't really work but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it travels pretty oh like i'm pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay because you it's because the broth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is so thick it's like magma yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> broth is so thick it stays really hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the noodles are supposed to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> separate anyway yeah and then you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dunk the noodles in and it's almost as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good yeah no i wouldn't say it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely better in shop but yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but like if you're you're you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're uh you need that you need that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> edge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> man i've been advocating because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen ramen is that one japanese dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where before i moved to japan i was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was thinking oh i'm gonna eat ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every [ __ ] week every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've had ramen three times the past week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> though really but i didn't have ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like months before that oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i was saying like the last time i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ramen before we went to this michelin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> star ramen place uh was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think a year before a year before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just because i have like zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> craving for ramen because why would i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have ramen when i can have tsukimen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like but the one dish that i haven't got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bored off though is a sushi like i eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi at least one once a week really at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> least once a week damn you eat more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i love sushi i probably go maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah two or three times a month i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wish that was like a really quick and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easy one near my house i would probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go i just i don't want to order it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no it doesn't order well but like i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like there's there's a few conveyor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> belts she's near my place and it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect for lunch man it's it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like 100 yen because i even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the 100 yen sushi which is like 80 80 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cents for like one piece of like salmon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something yeah it's so good yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly like my experience with sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan is that you know you they you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know i've i've also you know melin's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> taking me to some michelin star sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places as well and of course she has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only eats if there's michelin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like i don't see the michelin men </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway i'm not going basically part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big reason why we've gone to more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> michelin star places is because you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> melin suggested these places to us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where's buy it yeah which is how we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found the mid the the robin place which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is made and recommended the robin place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it happened to be michelin star but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh you know i i have tried like a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of different sushi places of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like different price points and my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honest opinion is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like sushi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you reach about like you know you reach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about like thirty dollars a meal for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi which is about you know mid mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi uh in japan right it's not cheap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not expensive and that's about as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good as it gets to me because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go you go you can get sushi from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like thirty dollars like a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dollars like two hundred dollars gourmet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> super famous chefs out there like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dare you guys yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like my like my honest opinion is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i've i've had the expensive sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's better but it's not that much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better than like the 30 sushi that i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get that's how it always is though like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i find that the meals that are a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more pricey than the the you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal ones are generally like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nice ones and then when you get to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stupid extravagant levels of prices it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like not that yeah it's like a 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 10 fold increase for like a five to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ten percent better meal you know i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think i would argue that like if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever going to go to like especially like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the high high-end sushi places which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all around tokyo then like get something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could only get in that high-end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant yeah so like because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember i took uh my friend luke to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the the really high-end sushi place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he's never been to like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high-end sushi place so i took him to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one in um harajuku yeah and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like 400 bucks between the two of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like really rushing a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that place has like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh i i think i don't know if you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have been to it but like it's the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can have like the nine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different types of uh sea urchin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different types of seeds yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do this like especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so there's a special thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do like nine different types of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seeds we're talking about sushi and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get like my stomach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get like taste tests like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different types of sea urchin from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different parts of japan and around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world and stuff and like that is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cool because i'm literally salivating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'll give you 0 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that is cool because i've only ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> seen that in that store like yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive but that is an experience that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only get in that story you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to like a [ __ ] sushi chain right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like if you're just gonna go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high-end sushi place and just order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] salmon on the ice then like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no point there's no difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're not the average person is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not that much of a sushi snob where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're gonna be like oh this is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't the high grade salmon that they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like even if it's high grade </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> salmon it's like a like five percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> increase in how better the taste is and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sushi is basically just it's rice it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the fish it's the wasabi and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the soy sauce they put on top and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's basically you just have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like make sure the ratios are right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then there's only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then there's only like so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fish can be fresh right yeah at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which point do we at which point do we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like say hey you just can't make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this taste any better with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ingredients you're given right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you have like like ten times the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> number of taste buds than the average </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> human like it's not gonna change yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly exactly like my my tongue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm not i'm not part of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shokugeki or something i can't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste like the exact percentage of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> salinity in the [ __ ] although i must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say when i did try the nine different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> types of like uh sea urchin i was ready </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to take my shirt off from how good it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was she's like oh i'm just i'm just an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unagi fan man it's my favorite food in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan unani it's the best yeah but see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like even like unagi right like after a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain price range it's like oh no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't you can't taste it no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but like that's why like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you just go to an aggie place it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of expensive in aggie in general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i mean like even like the the lower </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lower price point ones i'm always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> satisfied yeah exactly and i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhat good for you so that's good is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's it's not terrible it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible it's got a lot of like uh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know a lot of good uh omegas um those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fishy oils but they are also going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extinct as well that's the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> their prices well it's not like japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eats like 80 percent of the world's eels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something something like that but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then they there's tons of eels from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other countries it's it's it's 80 it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like most of japan's eels they have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nearly yeah yeah they're like almost all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gone that's why they're just getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> more expensive yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so i saw like a whole business insider </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video on that yeah because they because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan has a thing of like we don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to import foreign things it's low </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quality well they're starting like eel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> farms now yeah they're where they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> import the eels like as babies from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> other countries yeah and grow them in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> japan like they're like they're japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's just like japanese eels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why i realized you know when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to a restaurant and they serve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you this like really expensive dish or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really expensive meat right that doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> necessarily mean it tastes any better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of it's like a lot of more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meats weren't that expensive in history </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so you know the taste hasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed like for example lobsters you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know they they you know they used to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like peasant food yeah they used to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like peasant food or you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> these [ __ ] restaurants the ones that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like the super high end you feel so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] out of place because you're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an oligarch from russia i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i belong there i want to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the place that has a cool vibe yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food's a little more uh pricey than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going into like a yacht </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something you know it's like a you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know a little bit more you get a vibe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a chill time there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expectations you don't have to worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how you've been dressed that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibe i like it's a nice time i just want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 12 burger that's like it's better than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mcdonald's but it's it's got a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gourmet but it's it's not it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gourmet but but they put avocado on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just that middle price point is my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> comfort zone i'm like this is nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just want to feel like the cooks and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the chef care about their foods yeah i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's a big thing for me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when i order a drink and they ask me if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it tastes okay before they serve it to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me that's when i feel like i'm out of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> depth i'm like i i've never done this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before i ordered the thing you give me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing yeah is our mission in style </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for your knees if i order a wine just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> give me the wine um even if i told you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if i told you it doesn't taste good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should just be you should just laugh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at me and be like yeah well that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's you you did like it it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small things if i get served food and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> enjoying it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's the kind of restaurants that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when they bring out the dish or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever and you look at and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what is this and then a light novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> title of explanation starts right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can i just eat it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like two bites i would be done by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the time you finished explaining this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i wouldn't care otherwise you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> those are the ones where i'm like if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said if they came up to me and they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like was it any good and if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hypothetically said no then they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be like what can we do to help you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like what the experience i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember was during the cycling special </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we uh went to their restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with their grandma who was basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like eyeballing us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as we were watching he pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pulled up a chair and sat with us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like you aren't feeding you yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i love that place though it's just cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when when someone cause because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get it because like when you cook a meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for someone and they enjoy that and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoy the food and anything it tastes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good like there's such a there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such a rush to that right and i i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i feel like i've seen enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chefs who you know obviously obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is a job you know i understand some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> some people just do it for a job but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just there's just some magic to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a chef or a cook who cooks the food and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just gets such an enjoyment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from seeing people enjoy their food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because i don't know it's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't just it's this is this isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just chefs but you know if i just see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone enjoying their job that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes my day better you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if you just go to a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mcdonald's and you see like that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person with a genuine smile and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you know what good for you man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're you're having a good time working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mcdonald's i'm [ __ ] happy i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know man if it wasn't mcdonald's i'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh someone's uh someone's getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> caught because you ordered a smile come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is should i get a smile for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason on ubereats in japan at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bottom of the page where you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> order all the stuff there is a muksmile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> option </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for zero yen and i don't understand how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would purchase said mcsmile because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not there to see the smile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> genuinely go to yeah because in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you if you a day is ruined yeah it is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lie in japan if you go into a mcdonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant and you say can i get a smile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> please then they'll give it to you so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i was fine with that right i don't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't agree with that i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone should have to smile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why the [ __ ] why the [ __ ] on ubereats is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it listed when how is the uber delivery </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy get a smartphone i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i don't even see him because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have the [ __ ] drop it off at my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> door opposite just [ __ ] like take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take like an instamax </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] uber driver just takes a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> picture of the mcdonald's employee just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> smiling i i don't understand why uber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> added this to the menu i'm like what for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what i don't understand how this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna work i added it one time and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing happened because it's legally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of the mcdonald's menu because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously nothing is going to happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i ordered the mcsmile via ubereats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because what would happen i was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> curious is this is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a japanese thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they would never work japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk they would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> employees would quit on the spot they'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like i'd rather die than smile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like yeah you want a smile please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> order it yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like an actual menu item poor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> workers being forced to smile upon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> requests </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least give them like a tip or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something you know you can't tip you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can't say you can't tip here so what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason for smiling oh it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the customer ordered me to smile smile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy your job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want someone to encourage me as i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> order these 30 nuggets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that will inevitably destroy my body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well what i enjoy is seeing someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smile without me having to order them to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smile you know just just but in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like you don't know if they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> doing it because they have to do it yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> to talk to the people that they seem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like they want to do you know you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you watch someone smile but their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> eyes aren't smiling </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> all that industry is also dying yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't be too happy about that i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like significant amount less of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> major um stores or cafes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but now they all have mass on so they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably not even smiling </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> into those many cafes anyway so don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worry about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really i've been to one it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sucked wow yeah i've been to one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as well yeah we've established many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> times on this podcast that they are the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> worst thing on the world have you been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to one uh no i don't i don't need to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to one to no i don't want to get it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm violently uncomfortable but it's an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> experience you should just try to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i know it's so uncomfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the most unbritish thing on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earth and i can't i can't do it i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and i've seen like i saw like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> offline tv went to one and i'm like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can just only imagine how awkward this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was when they were in there like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible i would go back solely for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason to take chris with me i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that that would be an amazing video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i want to do there's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of things i would do just to make chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> suffer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and to make myself suffer as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can i take you and crystal make up sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure we'll see how we'll see how you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guys react to that sure why not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trash taste made cafe special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> chris's reactions often are off camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are almost funnier than his on camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he'll just be like [ __ ] that was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why'd you make me do that see christian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the love love beam or whatever i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't remember what they say about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to see chris do that chris has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotten to the point where she's the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> entertaining miserable british men like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's so funny to watch be miserable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because he's perfected the art of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't feel bad for making him angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah you know what i mean yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some people when they get upset or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncomfortable you're like you feel sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for them but chris has perfected the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like you'd like he's just you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't feel bad for laughing at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chris but he's he's the only man that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can somehow laugh while having a friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah exactly that's right you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like but that's what's so good about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being british is that people don't feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad for laughing at you when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncomfortable yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because people just like they're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's having a horrible time it's funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like to me we've made cafes like to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me it's the perfect determiner to see if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's like a lost soul when it comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to differentiating between like anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and real life yeah because if you go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if you go to like a maid cafe and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't feel uncomfortable then to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that makes it that that makes me feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ripped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rooney he's a lost soul right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because mates are meant to act like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anime characters right and there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing more uncomfortable to me than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing like a real life anime character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like right in front of my art well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because in real life it's like extremely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uncomfortable to see somebody talk that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way it's like yeah please because people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that way just act normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> please just i don't know slap me or </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> this year then what's what's been the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the biggest growth the biggest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disappointments the biggest uh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> moved studios uh we've got we've got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> much without having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah this is probably the biggest it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> difficult because you don't i often you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to spend too much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> patting yourself on the back because if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do you often get lost in uh in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you you can't be seen you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep pushing forward yeah and never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never be complacent with what you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> done yeah i mean you know i i guess i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happy i moved house it didn't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like something that i've achieved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i felt like it was a big dub yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get moving to a better place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know sorry man sometimes you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you have to stroke your own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decisions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's definitely uh definitely a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> minuses the gym has been less apparent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life yeah i i need to get started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just happy karen can i say where we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> used to live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you could i would just say the i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm glad we've moved out of summer so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all that time when we said that we lived </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in tokyo that was a [ __ ] lie well we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we lived inside somewhere oh it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not exactly it's the greater tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metropolitan okay okay okay it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is zone 6 really london </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like different trains that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could get to go into tokyo so we could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like either take like the rapid trade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which takes like 20 minutes or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get into central tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like the rapid train is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only comes with once an hour there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unicorn yeah then there's a commuter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rapid oh the commuter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's the local rapid commuter rapid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the local stops at every spot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously the rapid stops like i'd say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan are definitely going to feed that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i really think so yeah because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> commuter rapid is like only one train </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh really well no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a few stops that it goes to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we could live in yeah but like you can i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think people in japan now figured out oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's definitely that line that they will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess well good thing we don't live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore so there you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well they wouldn't know they wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the exact start yeah yeah it's fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fine but there's because there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the there's okay there's two lines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inside though that you can get the kane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> toku and the the yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sucks it stops at every stop it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 hours to get anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like two lines one of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually gets you places the other one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it literally takes like two hours to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from like the the it's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes through four prefectures yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> great yeah it's nuts yeah and then like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we where like where we used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live like if you we could plan going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into tokyo right because you can plan to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go this time to get the commuter rapid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a fast train but my god going back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was such a pain right shinjuku at like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 11 was like nightmare yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're you'll never get the commuter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rapid you'll never get like the rapid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always the local and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly a 20-minute commute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turns into an hour you know yeah on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> local train it was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first few times i was like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i can do this and then afterwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when we started coming to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> office where we moved office um it was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to move a lot closer the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show didn't bother me much i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really care much then it got to but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm glad we moved uh i mean you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liked where we lived actually it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nice area yeah it was a really nice area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh it's just too fast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i i won't lie the ubereats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> selection was shocking you pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you had you had one option for every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cuisine yeah so it was like if if the if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the thai place was bad which luckily it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was bad okay the typewriters are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the best place yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like good italian food that delivered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was like this i feel like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the most privileged [ __ ] thing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't care i love italian food and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> love getting i don't know if you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard of dominoes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's pretty italian if you want to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh pizza they do pizza and pasta there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was one place but it was ridiculously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive for me the the biggest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i was missing in the uber's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> selection was healthy options oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like no like salad or anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like if you wanted healthy foods </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you needed to cook it yourself and a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of the times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the times i wanted to eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthy and then like but i would get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> back from work and then the day would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the first world problems god forbid i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chop up lettuce in my own home we like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the ubereats selection was rather poor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like pre-oligar like levels of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> water i i used to just go out a lot to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat just because when i did move into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the my previous place i saw the ubereats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> options it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are you [ __ ] that i'm just gonna go out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also you were a lot closer to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> places than i was saying yeah i guess so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like nothing new it was nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though like that area was super nice to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walk around in yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i i feel like i only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> started to really walk around and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explore when i was deciding whether i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should move or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was just like oh there's a there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of cool places a lot of cool cafes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and restaurants that i just didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notice before because i'd never bothered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exploring the area and they didn't show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up in ubereat so why how could i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discover them yeah exactly right and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like i i feel like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> small local places that i miss now but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i'm also happy to be in a more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> convenient area and i've been be outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that time i'm just happy we've all moved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> into much much bigger and nicer places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now yeah you know and like you know as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> good as our previous places were like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially after we got this office i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was definitely time for an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> upgrade in our in our personal lives as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i've said this before but i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happy with my place and i was very lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to find the place that i have moved into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but you know i was i was i was still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty happy with my place so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's to to me it's definitely an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> upgrade but it's like it's it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> natural progression to me and i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there are some things that i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely progressed in in like 2021 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's some things that i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've probably requested regressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in or stayed the same i don't know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been a it's been a weird year because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after 2020 everyone was just like all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right ready to like hit the ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> running in 2021 and then the environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just didn't allow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us to like hit the ground running yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so like i remember like i think for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of 2021 like like you know i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> say this now because i think before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going back to england i was definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> burnt out like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm saying it's not like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely burnt out and everyone's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's just like oh why didn't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take a holiday why why didn't you take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some time off to uh just look after your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mental health and all that stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i would say was there was nothing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was nothing that i wanted to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because what i wanted to do was see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family see friends you know back at home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seemed pretty two years for a long time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two years is a very long time and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like that's that was like my reset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so before that like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely burnt out and i kind of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dealt with it by just trying to fill up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my schedule and uh kind of kind of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ignoring it and i i didn't fully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize that until i went back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> england and i just had nothing on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> schedule and i just realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] this is uh this is really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refreshing i'm getting a lot of ideas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i want to go back to work i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing a single thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is this what it's like to uh have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> break have a proper break this was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have a life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to just not do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i mean that's that's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what has been hardest in 2021 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because 2020 was like what was the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you know the entire world was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flagged 2021 was like me waiting for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> world to get back to normal and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finally finally looking like it is going </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> just not on the end of the just on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime man channel yeah yeah i have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i told gant about it but uh because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been uploading a lot more on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> second channel now and i've been making </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot more anime content on my second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> channel now that i have a playlist on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> second channel called actual anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to poke fun but like yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm very harsh on myself when it comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my youtube channel and my content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that so like you know i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously proud of all the videos i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> upload on both channels yeah otherwise i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't upload it at all but i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely not i'm [ __ ] not proud of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like i'm definitely one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> after a week of that like honeymoon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> period i'm like yeah i could have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll do better on the next one and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i try and do it and i keep thinking i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going in the right direction then i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like at the end of it i look back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at all of it i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like five percent of it was okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 95 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could have used a bit of work but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think uh yeah like i have like plans for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next year for what i want to do with my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] but like yeah i don't know it's uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's going to be scary because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be a lot different yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much everything i've established </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up until this point so yeah see how it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes but uh you know that's i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what we have trash taste for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like as a fail-safe almost or uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not so much a failsafe but like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like a safety net i guess because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we started again it's like when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> started trash days we were like oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this will be like a nice side project </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for you to do you know yeah and like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could do all sorts of cool things on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sideline while we focus on our main </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content but now it's like well we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 1.1 million subs or something which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is insane on the main channel thank you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again by the way yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's and you know now it's like pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> much become like the main basket now and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our main channels and our side channels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and whatever else that we do outside of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trash taste has become the safety net </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost no like trash chase has become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like almost the number one priority no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is a number one it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we need to schedule recording </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's getting done before any of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] videos or anything like any of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my scripts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like you know definitely because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like we do have like lots of exciting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plans for trash taste obviously next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> year uh which obviously can't tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but look forward to it um yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely plan my work in greek my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> working week around trash taste yeah not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the other way around yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um and i think just like that right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that mentality is already just telling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like this is out but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but but also when there's i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because all three of us are involved i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think it i i guess we probably pay more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> respect to the the scheduling of trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste yeah all right well definitely if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i [ __ ] over my own channel that's my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> problem but yeah if i [ __ ] over the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> scheduling with like trash taste yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a burden to everyone yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know we have we have people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> turn up to help us with trash taste so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know when i [ __ ] around doing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monkey tier list on my own channel you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know if i don't do that it's you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on me and yeah that's it right no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one else yeah yeah i think that that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i guess like going back to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole like getting a personal assistant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah or like getting a team yeah to help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know behind the scenes of like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> main channel and stuff like that i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the one thing i'm scared of which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like i'm gonna feel more pressure now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to deliver on my main channel because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now it's not just me that i'm taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> care of it's taking care of a personal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> assistant or like you know an editor or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a manager or whoever right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like multiple people's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> livelihoods at stake right it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's really the only thing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guess that stopped me from personally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting a personal assistant i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even know what to talk to them maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll realize i'm [ __ ] stupid i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why am i helping it's a lost cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no like for me i think the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change for me this year is i guess i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been really trying to figure out not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i want to do but how i want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it i feel like you said this last year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the year before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it okay for me to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> did i say this last year you definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely said this last year yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i think this year has been the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year where i've really like knuckled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try to really start thinking of my main </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> channel as like content as a job that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to like break down and uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually be strict on how long it takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to like make a video because right you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't be taking months to make one video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no i mean like it's like because because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think one big thing that has changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since joining trash case right is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for better or worse my content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my content upload schedule is compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to your guys right and like especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like seeing how your guys's content is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> made like not saying like obviously i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not saying like anyone's content uh is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better or worse you know it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've kind of realized that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to upload as much as you guys but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with with the workflow of my kind of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> style of content i've tried to like cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as many many corners as i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there is like there is just too many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bottlenecks that i can't i can't do to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like to like like i've i've reached max </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> productivity that i can reach with my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> channel and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last year i was like i can improve i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do better i can do like three videos a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> month and trash taste and now i've kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of i've come to realize that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not only is that setting the wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expectations for me to feel like i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it and you know i feel bad if i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it but it also like sets the wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expectations for the viewer as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if the viewer is expecting me to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> upload that many videos a month and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i kind of keep doing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's that's just going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unsustainable and i'm just going to burn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out which which i did do this year but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like i didn't burn out because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was putting myself in through too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work i burnt out because of the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situation but i've just realized that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to like i need to make a schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is sustainable and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately you know it's for better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or worse like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my upload schedule does get compared to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your guys but like i've come to i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come to realize to not feel guilty about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that anymore yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i've when i make jokes about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i don't give a [ __ ] but i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think it's a like just sound a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of fun yeah i also don't like i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> considered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think that me or joe have ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought that your channel your content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and channel is comparable to ours in any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way like i don't think one upload is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> equal to one upload on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no no i'm not like definitely not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess it's like forced me to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really break down a workflow to like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> video right because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how long would it take would it how long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does it take you guys to like make one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video like hour-wise would you say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> varies yeah yeah that varies literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like two hours or like a hundred yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some videos that like even one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now that's really it's like a really big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video i've been working on that i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been wanting to do for a very long time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah a lot of moving pieces and a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of a lot of love edits and a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of footage to go through but you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that no matter even if i put like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> month's worth of like like let's say if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just took the hours i put into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say it's like just a a full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working month of hours into one video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it doesn't [ __ ] matter because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> got uploaded the week after anyway so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah exactly but then maybe the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> week after it'll be something that took </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me two hours so it's it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you kind of have to juggle it but also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not make it look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like all these videos are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different quality yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly which is why i kind of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized okay the only way i can make my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos not seem drastically like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different in uh feeling uh theme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quality production is to just have i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me being an idiot and me my personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> being like the focal point yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the video or at least the main aspect of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the video yeah sorry so like so like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had to break down for like let's say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fastest video you had to break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> down yeah so had to break down like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video making process like the fastest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video you can make is like say in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two or three hours right let's say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like you needed to get a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out so i've had like a few times where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just need to get a video out right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's at the time on my end not doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> editing yeah yeah yeah yeah so like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me like i need to like pencil in let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say let's say i'm doing a video about an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime right so i have to pencil in hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like around about a day to watch the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime which like assuming it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> season of anime right and then let's say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two days for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two two days for scripting which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one day for the actual script one day to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like finish the script and actually make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like a good script you know and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so that's that's already three days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and then i have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like you know two hours or so two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two hours for like the recording of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> script and then nice and then i send </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that off so that's like on my end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three and a half days already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um to be sent off to the editor now the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> editor edits it and he has to send it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to me and i have to do like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finishing touches upload </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um finishing touches upload thumbnail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and title which if i'm really lucky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would take half a day so that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four days basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of workflow from beginning to end let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say and that's if i'm fully productive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing goes wrong right that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fastest i can make a video of you to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> assume i don't procrastinate now so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's four days in a week right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste is one day in a week yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i also want weekends as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so now you just wish for thinking you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have that boy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i've realized like in my previous years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i've been able to do three videos a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> month i've been able to do three videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a month and trash days because i've just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've just worked on weekends and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just realized i kind of want weekends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i kind of also want to do other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things like stream and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe focus on some side projects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well and i've just realized i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to put too much on myself and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like with the type of video i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making there is no way i can make this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video faster than the way i'm making it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people will say well why don't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> become like a personality based channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know you guys where you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you can do different kinds of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content that is more focused on any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personality and i've played around with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that and then i've just realized no i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of i kind of like enjoy what i do i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of i i like scripting i've i am you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i've already i've already got trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taste i have a channel that is based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around my personality so called you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so i've i've just like i've just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized that my main channel is always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a max cap two uploads a week uh two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uploads a month if i'm lucky three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uploads a month and i'm not going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel guilty if i don't make that if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one upload a month because i'm traveling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or because i'm on holiday that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're getting and like i guess this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a message to you guys as well which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know i know like i know the image is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like oh gods are late it goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to lazy bum who doesn't upload that much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but uh trust me i am working at full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> capacity and you guys are getting two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uploads uh you guys are getting two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uploads a month maybe one upload a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i'm busy that month but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is me at max capacity and i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to try to pretend that anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> else is that you know i honestly never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saw a problem like you know as much as i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know poking fun of it or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you know in episodes and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that i honestly never saw a problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your upload schedule um because again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i know how much work goes into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content that you make specifically like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you say you take two days to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make a script i sometimes take like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> week to make a script because i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nowhere near as good as making a script </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the two-day script happened this year oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right before it would take like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe like three days or four days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before i can't script yeah but i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more scripting you do the the better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get at it because you understand you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the basics of how to get a script </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down right like you know i remember the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first script i wrote took me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forever because i was like how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> write jokes i i've never written a joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down in my life and performed it off the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> script right so it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i would see like your upload schedule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i would see your videos and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would think to myself all right if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> were to make this video how long would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it take for me yeah and then i think to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself yeah it'll probably take even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> longer than it probably took gone yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and that's why i've never really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seen a problem with your upload schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if anything i think like i'm i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly even thinking like for next </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> year i'm thinking to maybe go to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something similar to your upload </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> schedule as well because i want to put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i think this year the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's changed with my channel is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've definitely upped my quality of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content or like yeah i've upped the bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the minimum standard that a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> should be yeah and that has resulted in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos not only taking longer to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and to edit for mood on but also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's taking longer to prepare just in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> general yeah so it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now especially these last couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of months that i've been in like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit of a burnout um i've noticed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a week and one video a week is starting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get tough i i actually forgot i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to upload the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right i was so busy i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> especially legitimately i just forgot to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> upload the video and then the day i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was like midnight and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh i could upload it right now because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to go up in three hours but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> had to wake up at 4 am to do a call yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i was like [ __ ] this i'm not i need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like these three hours of sleep i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> getting yeah yeah right so but it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with us too now that we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like put more effort into our second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channels as well right yeah and on top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of trash taste every week and then trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days after dark every week right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's already so much [ __ ] on my plate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i realized like oh if i continue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you know once a week schedule if i or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i kind of lock myself into this once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a week schedule i'm either gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely burn out yeah i'm either just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be so [ __ ] exhausted that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't do anything or you know worst case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scenario both and the quality of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> videos is just naturally going to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down yeah i've been toying with the idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of uh just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not uploading all january doing the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> classic youtuber move oh yeah i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of want to like just do streaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all month so and i thought january is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the best month because that's when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ad revenue you get a zero ad revenue and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the youtube a month that everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> takes off because they don't get much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money yeah yeah yeah yeah but i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i do actually want to try doing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> streams uh full month see how it goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah have more of a consistent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> schedule with that because i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've invested a lot in the streaming but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm still like in compared to other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who are full-time streamers i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nowhere near as consistent yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that's one thing that's like is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> detriment to that because people always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> complain like connor i never know when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] you're gonna stream yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like yeah i know but that's what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like that i just turn up and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all right we're just gonna stream for 12 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours now casually let's do it i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i think like trash taste has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely done a good job with like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know to varying levels uh or or varying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> results like trust's kind of like gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> us to kind of look at our main channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and being like i could probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> change is it actually a main channel is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it like i just say main channel for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> purpose of main channel i really don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think about like the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's weird now individually it's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't even think of any channel as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the main channel i'm just like i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make [ __ ] some of it has priority over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the other ones yeah but it depends week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by week which i'm prioritizing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like part of the reason why i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been uh putting down the uh not not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been putting the same amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos on the main channel now which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two videos a month and i'm not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> try to do more because i want to do two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos a month huh i thought you did one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a month no i only did i only do one a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> month when it's uh when it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> polygon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so yeah yes so right now i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing two videos a month um and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting all my extra time into i do also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to like make a second channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that seems fun you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's super fun i see you guys doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like you know what maybe my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> main channel doesn't need to be my top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> priority you know i've got like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> formula down for my main channel and now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just wanna i just want this extra time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do other [ __ ] now because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking because i have like a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ideas for like big projects that can go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my main channel right which which i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> am sitting on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but my god they're going to take so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much [ __ ] time yeah um and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing these big projects really takes a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot out of you especially when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also trying to maintain your const </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> consistent upload </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> schedule on your main channel anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah so i've kind of come to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize that you know when i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really feel like i'm down on youtube and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i need to work on a video without that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm really passionate in then i'm going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to start doing those but for now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i want like i want to do more more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small stuff i wanna i wanna i wanna do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the thing for me was i there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a you know because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not sitting here saying that my main </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> channel is quality by any means i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is some level of effort that goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into it and uh i'm going to have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> harsh myself would that not be quality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know if there is a certain point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a certain bar that i try to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the channel for most videos there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes like i did like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which chris loves to joke about yeah my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monkey tls video which i just wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do because i thought it was fun but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously you know it's not it's nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like exceptional yeah but you know in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> general the videos that i have were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite difficult but you know sometimes i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see someone doing like a you laugh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lose challenge i'm like that seems fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd like to do that yeah i'll do it live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead i'll do it on the the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel because it works and so it kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of came to a point where a lot of fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ideas that just weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big enough or weren't uh exciting enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> warrant putting a lot of time and effort </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into that yeah just kind of work really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well on the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's that's what i've noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well that's why i want that's why i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a second channel because i feel like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have set a bar of quality on my main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel and i've like tested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uploading videos that maybe have not had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as much time put into them and use you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do see it in the view numbers if um like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eventually so that's why i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay let's just keep my main channel for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the contents big boy videos for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big boy videos for the videos that my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> audience expect to me but that doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean you can't do other things on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> second channel yeah it's like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like so many like especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> timely things or you know like so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things that perhaps have nothing to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with the [ __ ] i'm known for right that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to talk about in the video like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know when youtube brought out that news </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they were going to get rid of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dislike button right i was like i want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about this in a video but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can't just put up a 15-minute rant of me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like perfect i have a perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> outlet for random [ __ ] have you how many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you get the comments of i don't watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime anymore watch joey yeah a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean you know that's fine and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything because it's like you know at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of the day it's still me right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's whatever and you know it's weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because especially this past like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two or three weeks uh i've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uploading a lot more on the second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel and i've just like i found </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myself waking up and thinking to myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right what should the next channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the second channel oh the next video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on the second channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh wait wait i have a main channel [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i should probably think about that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as well right i think because another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big thing as well is um i i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now with my main channel it i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely seen the plateau of just that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of anime content yeah like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of amazing concept and you know i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do i do have like ideas about how you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you can i could i could keep that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel growing and grow past the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plateau but the the amount of time and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> effort that would take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would to to me that would take too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time and effort that i just don't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right now that would take giving up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste basically yeah to uh to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> content and rebrand my channel to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> point where it can grow plus past the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plateau of that kind of vanity content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right how do you feel about the growth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on your channel your main channel uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i'm i'm fine with it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because i know like right now any tube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as it is has just plateaued like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know we've seen the plateau if if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there are any other antitubers who would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like to prove me wrong please because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i'm i'm waiting for that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> person to prove me wrong yeah i i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting as well because i need i need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kick up my ass to be like oh you can go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> higher okay that's like my motivation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sure your you guys are the same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter how many subscribers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you have right what i find what what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find happiness in is growing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like making making it feel like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have made progress on something so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i felt way more fulfilled seeing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> progress and growth on trash taste than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i did on my own channel for like last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year yeah and like that's why i'm the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought of a second channel excites me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way more than even making big videos on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my own channel because even if i make a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big video my own channel which i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really passionate in i know that there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a certain cap for like the number of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> views that's going to get and i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's already like you know especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like all of our main channels like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's already at a size where we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happy with right and it's like it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive to a lot of people right so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah yeah it's just it just makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more sense that like you know obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna have more excitement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watering this tiny plant than watering a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giant tree right yeah obviously watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this tiny thing grow into something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bigger is going to be more fulfilling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're trying to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that you otherwise not really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> known for perhaps it's like content that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've never tried before and stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and i think that's why i've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having so much fun with the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel but like yeah i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so like my main channel grew as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i hit 3 million subs this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right but like to me it's like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know like i know definitely past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me would look at some months of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel's growth and being like oh man i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really grow that much at all but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think i've just rewired my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this year to be like if it ain't a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> negative then it's all good dude like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if every day i'm gaining at least one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sub i'm i'm completely okay with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now because i haven't been canceled yet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly it's like if if people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still like looking at my [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanting to come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cool dude like my doors are open but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm not i'm not at this point now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i'm like oh [ __ ] i only made 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 000 subs this month i'm slowly dying you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's like yeah the channel yeah i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like don't chance like oh no i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> past that point now like i'd much rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put in the time to like be like oh i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have this tiny second channel that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to grow into something big so let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's focus on that kind of thing or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know with like trash taste for instance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah like that that's way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more exciting for me and i think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why you know at least you and i have had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of fun doing the second stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right because it's just like streaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just something new right it's fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah did you start like properly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> streaming this year or did it start last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> year i can't remember it it almost feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like you've been streaming forever like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> properly properly like consistently i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was this year right it's been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more this year than it was like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> last year it was 2009 no 2008. when was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the chess tournament the first one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh early 2020 yeah 2020. okay well 2020 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was around when i started streaming okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i think yeah this year is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably where it's growing the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been a lot more consistent been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doing a bunch of stuff with that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i still occasionally get people coming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the twitch being like i had no idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had a twitch channel yeah oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i have that every time i stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess it's a different platform right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it is a different platform yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah is there any changes you guys want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to make going into the next year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh i'm just continuing what you're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess just like i don't know for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> new year's resolutions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube youtuber new year's resolution i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> will probably i'm gonna hit a million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> subs on the second channel there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> probably gonna be a point uh because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when the world does open up i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do want to travel a lot more yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like have a bit more time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> relax so there'll probably be a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i'm uploading a little bit less so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not i'm not really too bothered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about it all right i'm just gonna say it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now just exp expect less uploads on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> main channel i think just because yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for one i want to put more effort into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each video now i don't want to like be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> confined to this once a week schedule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not gonna talk about what anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not gonna watch no probably not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if i do that'll be on the main on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> second channel where actual anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content exists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> subscribe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh yeah i don't know like at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the main channel like i think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what kind of content i want to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> focus more on on the set on the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel from next year but that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely going to force me to not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> upload every week yeah just because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be impossible yeah i think last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> year my new year's resolution was to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more productive and to upload more and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then as i've just said this year i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of realized yeah that i tried i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really did because i went i went like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good like four months where i had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three videos a month and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before we went to the uk it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty consistent what's it really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah [ __ ] you don't watch it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was literally just before the office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> move and then and then it took like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right [ __ ] [ __ ] three weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was around the same time so it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first half of the year um and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized okay my my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resolution was just unsustainable and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i've accepted that yeah so my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> new year's resolution is i want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more collabs and it's not going to be on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the main channel which is why i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> focus more on another channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i've kind of realized collabs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just don't work for the dynamic on my on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my main channel yeah yeah that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what would you mean what about our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collab on our collab remember that one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that one the one collab that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean because like i want to do less </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's like not scripted and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd feel like any anything i script and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> collabs uh anything uh anything i do on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my main channel has to be scripted so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that that video was obviously scripted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i also just wanted like more time to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work on like side projects i want to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a week-long live stream at least at some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point i'll do it at some point good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just double it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just stubble yeah there's that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> easy did i not like break you no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three days three days would like easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> break me off like three hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i made a mistake of shouting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during one game too much getting angry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it [ __ ] my throat for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the next day and then obviously it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't having any time to heal because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just talking all day yeah and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a rookie mistake but do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again i'm not going to shout as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not as angrily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually the sleeping in that [ __ ] bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was kind of uncomfortable i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really get good sleep that was one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no yeah i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't with the fact thousands of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people yeah with the [ __ ] rave going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on in the day it was the bed the bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sucked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd probably just do one night where i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go and sleep in my nice bed and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh i'm rested boys let's get it let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> come on must keep streaming yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know yeah no i i want to do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at some point i don't know when though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i mean like i guess like in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> case with like trash days as well like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know we're the world is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hopefully going to open up a little more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> next year yeah we're just going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really busy with that [ __ ] as well like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the workload for trash taste has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> upped as well right because we don't we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now we stream every week if you didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know um until at least until christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comes along which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around now but uh once the year rolls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> along i i want to continue the weekly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> streams yeah i just work right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like what that means is that we we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically just recording another podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every week we have two trash tastes at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this point yeah we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if there wasn't enough of my schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> already there's there's another thing to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tick off the main channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's another trash taste recording </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somebody added up all the runtime of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trash station it was longer than like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all of dbc or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that i believe that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would still rather watch that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've rewatched episodes there and all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them oh my god regarding trash though um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we uh we figured out earlier that we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only uploaded one special this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah which was the cycling special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in february which we filmed the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> year prior </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so uh wait will the figure episode count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as a special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of it's like half a second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a mini special yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guess i guess it's special in nature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah not a name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we're still in the office yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mean we had the cycling special and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had like some mini specials like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the figure special the pc build special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but i guess i guess it truly is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> top gear now where we get like we get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like once once a year one big special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and every other week it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the normal day two specials a year right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's probably a healthy amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i i think two special yeah well a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big portion of this remember remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we first started doing specials we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four a year let's do it all right that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ain't happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well because we had we had like we are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back then we had our main channel and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste and that was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now we have our main channel you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are doing your second channel streaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste after dark um and then we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotta do our specials on top of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> moon on teach us how this is done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and people wonder why we want assistance </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> it for next year i think i think it's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> me neither </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't have regrets i'm trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think i just i just that question just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> came up from the top of my head not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as we found out on the trash taster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually regret not putting more time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into japanese because my japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> studying has been like very spotty this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year i'd be like super into it and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like something would happen and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i would take a day off and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would just like stack one to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two days and three days and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly i'd find like a month had been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taken off of learning japanese and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first few weeks of me getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back into japanese is just like me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> relearning the [ __ ] that i already knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before right it's kind of like the gym </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that day right where in that way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you make your gains and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stop going and then when you go back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the gym you got to like regain the gains </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you already had yeah it just feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really demotivating it's like trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> push through it sucks i really wanna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the gym more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm just lazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah are you are you just lazy or is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got so much going on in your life now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you just don't have the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean if i really really really wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to the gym i could make time you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know what i mean like but but it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not something that i enjoy as much as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other stuff but i really do want to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more yeah also some days after i've like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after i've been and you know you're hurt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the next day and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then the day after that i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not not great feeling 100 but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only time that week i have time but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i'll go maybe i won't ah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's tough it's tough it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> annoying i don't know my schedule is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot more unflexible now so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i have times to go it's just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot difficult a lot more difficult to to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it in in the way i wanted it to yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i think because you just have so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> much more [ __ ] going on right so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you are at the gym it's like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] you're just thinking of all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff that you could be doing otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it just feels better right i travel a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lot more for videos as well now so yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that takes yeah it feels it feels weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was a point where the sea dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel was just you inside filming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video is not outside i'm just like kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of slacking man kind of slacking what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is what i'm worried about because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like [ __ ] all right so let's say i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to go back to the uk at some point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] am i going to do on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel everyone's going to be like why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't he outside like what was there to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] do in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just try every pint in weather yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not bad actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd watch that try every meal deal at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tesco </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd do that too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've already tried them all but i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tell them yeah do it on video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't even know what i would do like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'd basically be like shitty tom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scott at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is this is a house where they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get water through a well it's really old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the uk we don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we only have like really old quirky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff in the uk we don't have anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> modern that's like [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i guess that's why everyone travels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff right i legitimately don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what i would do with my main channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content if i ever move back to the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't worry i don't have time uh plans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it's not happening it's not happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anytime soon yeah just boys keep me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hostage uh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> because i like that about channels i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch that like no matter where i am </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even because sometimes you know maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas i got some down time you know </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> that's come out that i'm really excited </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for you know exactly i like it i like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the thing about christmas right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that okay so you have you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have the beginning right you wake up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> early </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> everyone opens their presents everyone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all merry and happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so what happens between like 11 o'clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to four o'clock food and alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no food alcohol and check this [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> food comes on at four right so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> food comes out about well you don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have like a christmas lunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for christmas lunch whatever you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what whatever you envision food a dinner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to be dude i'm about to have like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all-you-can-eat buffet for dinner you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bet you better know that i'm saving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> space for that christmas dinner well no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i have that buffet at lunch and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have dinner i have both because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> during dinner time i'm busy getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> drunk no dinner dinner time christmas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dinner it's like it's like one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> best meals we don't do that in australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you do in australia though in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia we wake up we have we get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know open up all the presents or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever yeah uh and then you know by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that time it's right lunchtime yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then all the family comes over you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know kind of a late lunch maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two three o'clock type of like big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big lunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> finish at like 5 p.m and then that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you get shit-faced with your family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and by the time dinner time rolls around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not hungry because you're still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> full from the massive lunch i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have lunch and dinner christmas yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a lunch industry yeah it's for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me it's like it's one big meal no it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one big meal for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how can your stomach handle yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> christmas baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that christmas spirit man like i i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> large is my stomach by four times like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason we don't have a christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lunch or i've never heard of anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a christmas lunch is because i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure during christmas dinner you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eat enough to like fill yourself up for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] week well sometimes like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have friends who can't come to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dinner or something so i'll go i might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> go meet them for lunch or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going out on christmas day yeah i'll go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now blasphemy i'll like go to their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you don't spend with your family no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no i'll spend the dinner with my family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because maybe there's someone who i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't spend all day with your family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not all the time sometimes i do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depends on like who i can see when and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i can't you know some people they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like they're having a christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing and i'll go and say hi i'll turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up and then i'll go back and spend the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> evening okay so like last time i went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to australia i did that like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spent like a christmas dinner with my my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friend at my friend's place like my uni </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mate but i did that the day after the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual christmas event as like a late </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> christmas kind of thing right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right but like on christmas day if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not at home with my family no then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> something's wrong if i'm if i'm not at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> home with the family or we're not going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to another one of our family's relatives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> places yeah then there's there's some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> beef what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> some of them are friends some of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are family you know it's kind of a mix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay but like my justification for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas lunch in australia is that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have to understand that christmas day is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a very nice summer day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going outside eating a massive thing by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a pool side is very normal in australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah pass me the turkey i'm in the pool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right now yeah exactly so you don't have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a roast no we do okay but outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it gets cooked with the sun because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so hot yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we we pop off we just have a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> barbecue basically not even we just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out onto the road and just pop a whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken on the tarmac and then it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cooks by itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no but like it's it's like a usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know mid like 34 35 degree like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice summer day right and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're out on the balcony with your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family and you're having a you know a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice roast or you know pork or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it is that you eat yeah you know during </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas and we have that during the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day because the sun's out and it feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good you know that's that that's my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> justification of why we have one meal at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like two o'clock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously if it was like that's so alien </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to me yeah obviously it feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> winter time right yeah i'm not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay yeah i'm right okay okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so as as someone who obviously grew up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in australia celebrating christmas that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way yeah do you do you have like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmasy feeling like what what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a christmassy feeling or do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have anything that gives you a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmasy feeling yeah christmasy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling is when i'm having uh a beer at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like 2 p.m in a pool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that could be that's like any day for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australians joey like it's yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hell yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it like weird watching christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't watch christmas movies at all i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know at least our family doesn't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mean australians do you have like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas spirit like uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like they are like dead inside no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no why are you sad joey tell us why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you are sad because i remember because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh when when i lived in thailand uh me </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> for like two two or so years and every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every year she'd she tell me you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what you know the trees up we got we got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the christmas we got the christmas songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the roast is out but it just doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like christmas she says as it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 35 degrees and like yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you're outside no just listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't feel like it but it just just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't feel like christmas i mean you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know we put up a tree and everything and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know we decorated it and put the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lights on it and stuff like that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's also you know i'm in my board </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shorts and t-shirt at the same time that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just doesn't sound festive to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like board short board </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shorts t-shirt christmas hat you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a yeah there's a great photo of </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> sweating my nuts off because it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 38 degrees okay okay okay so like is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there like a certain period of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you see something you know and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like oh christmas is coming up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because for me right like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england you know it's it was whenever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weather would start getting like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really cold and then you'd start seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know christmas decorations pop up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here and there what is it like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i feel that i lost enough of my lifetime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once because you didn't go to america to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see sydney's family right yeah so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> guess that's fair enough i i don't have </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> they got to see me i'll see you next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> april or something and see them again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wait was it your parents that said that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they would probably never come to japan </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> before either no no no my parents really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> want to come to church yeah as well i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> like especially when you're buying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> furniture like when you first make so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i was first building my my room i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was like okay i have a much bigger room </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> the desks and like shelves and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything with like much bigger nicer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> places that fit the atmosphere right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously when you buy stuff from like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ikea or amazon or whatever they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come in one piece you gotta [ __ ] diy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] right yeah i've i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely been feeling that for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you hate it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> twisting the [ __ ] screwdriver for 17 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours in the week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to the point where your wrists and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your thumb starts to get sore i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> regret not buying i guess yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like furniture yeah i regret it so when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i bought like my new bookshelf i i still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had the screw right and i was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good this bookshelf has 50 screws that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to screw in and they're hard as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] as well by by the time i finish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like three hours later my hands were so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sore so i was like [ __ ] i'm buying a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> power drill because though i had another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shelf coming in built that [ __ ] in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 30 minutes because all i had to do was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> technology is amazing it's incredible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when ikea selling point was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that you get to build your own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> furniture and it's like all convenient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff yeah and now i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've ordered some furniture furniture of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazon which doesn't need to be built </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like this is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> godsend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're ahead of the game man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> some ikea products i'm i think you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pay them to assemble in your house yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can you can because sometimes ikea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> furniture is actually like really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because they have some things that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know ikea has great furniture it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just you know like paying the ass to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> make yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like especially moving into a new place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know making making one or two things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that ain't too bad that's that's a fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a fun afternoon when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making like 10 [ __ ] things in a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing just come pre-built and there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are some like there are some ikea things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like even the way that you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> build it is like some kind of artistic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feat where it's like [ __ ] algebra one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get like a [ __ ] piece in because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just looks so weird on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> construction thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my table kind of broke a little bit and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the screws is missing but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should be fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly it happens one of one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the biggest things one of the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things that annoys me is that i've now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i've built so much furniture in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> past few weeks i i know what kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> packaging is just like good and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> optimized and what is awful right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was building i was building a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shelf yesterday and like every single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> screw every single compartment every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single plank had like a number sticker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on it or like came in came in came in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bag that was labeled as a certain number </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and that's great because you look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the instruction manuals and you see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ah this number of screw goes into this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> number plank yeah yeah i [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the furniture that gives you a bag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of screws and then you get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> instruction manuals and it gives you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 different kind of screws </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so [ __ ] hard trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> differentiate like a screw that's this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> length and a screw that's this length on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the instruction manual and i just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that could be one of ten screws which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> screw am i supposed to use no the one i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hate more than that is like when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tells you like okay you have this many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> screws right yeah you should have ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> screws and so i go to count and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is there 11 screws </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not the screw then i realized one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just there for a spare right here but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't tell you it's a spare so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have to assume that one of them is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a spare so it's like okay because when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you finish building it and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize and you look down and there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like three screws left over you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well i clearly [ __ ] up somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some sometimes in japan they they give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you a pair of gloves with your furniture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah oh yeah yeah because for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason you need like they it's like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not hurt your hands i guess when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> build it they give you like a pair of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> white gloves it's really yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's cute yeah it's really cute i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never wear them because i'm like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] would i wear gloves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think but i actually i don't like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> give you these shitty screwdrivers and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like allen keys oh yeah it's such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> waste yeah i buy like eight things and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now i have eight [ __ ] screwdrivers that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i have to get rid of i i have a cupboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of just the unused allen key yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the shitty screwdrivers are less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> common than the allen keys yeah well i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought my own set of allen keys yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same thing all like perfectly measured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and they're great really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> quality and it's so much better than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using these tiny ones where you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> destroy your palm trying to do that last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they clearly don't understand the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of torque yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not like long enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah it's so easy just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah and like the quality of for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some reason there are some furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the quality of the screws it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like all over the place [ __ ] there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some that are just like perfectly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ingrained you can get yourself drivers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steel enhanced nails and then there are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some which i swear like pre-sheared so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you so like you turn it it's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a [ __ ] ice skate right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just slipping in and out and i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like how how am i supposed to get this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> career the worst feeling is when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like go for that like it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like this much of the screw is still out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you turn it and you feel it sheer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and you look at it and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> already sheared you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it makes like that horrible like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to like fully like put your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full pressure on it yeah and not stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because if you let go it will shear it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah you're like [ __ ] i gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> give this in before before i [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> shop </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> really did not like doing like diy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's not until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suddenly i've like moved and i've got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all this like i think you know what it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it's not that i enjoy diy it's that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the feeling of getting new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> furniture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that that that just changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> drastically as a post </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like it's i think as well it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's nice because i mean you guys </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> just am in my own world as i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> furniture or like whatever it is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when i'm making something it's like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think i like that feeling because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> almost meditative to me no i i like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling of buying furniture that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's that's a good feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like i i knew i was eating on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> furniture when it's done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i knew i was old where you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the ikea catalog and you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh that that's a good that's a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking desk right there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now you're gonna go there in person guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go to the ikea mega store you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta sit down you gotta feel the chat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> buying furniture become fun dude [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> welcome to a dollhouse baby you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what was the most annoying part of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i bought that uh that ikea grass [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like generic grass that goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your yeah your uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the [ __ ] you want because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to have some grass so i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cause it feels nice yeah it's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feels good so i bought it turns out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though those ikea grasses like the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that sucks about them is that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't measure them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't like fit them in precisely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah all right like they either fit or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't yeah i can nearly have some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your val patio covered or you won't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like squares they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like ah i think they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> five by five i don't know oh you got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got the squared tiles yeah yeah oh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got the ones because yeah i just got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> roll because my balcony is massive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because ikea does like square tiles of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fake grass yeah yeah yeah yeah and so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really consider how it would fit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i roughly measured it i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah realized there i can't block the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the drain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the water drain yeah otherwise no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> water again obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so so then i was like okay well now i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either have like a big chunk of my patio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not covered and it looks weird yeah or i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have my drain cover which i can't do so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why not cover it with like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's because i know the tiles there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a wood tile which has holes in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can you just put that there i have some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wood towel on the other side okay well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what about if you get the square and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cut a hole that perfect so here's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> drain and then you just pop it on top </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's what i did at my place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so what i did it's not it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not it's not like um one big drain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the drain's in the corner somewhere else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like the thing that leads into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the drain oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff needs to be occurring in it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i was like okay [ __ ] i'll cut the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] in half yeah it's it's it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> rock-solid plastic oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know it is impossible to cut the shoe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like what tools did you use to cut </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my willpower i literally like got this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of plastic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this big right like this not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even a saw i literally just like spent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it together with my hands like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and then i just kept bending it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that yeah and it weakened and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i did it the other way but the other way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all plastic so it hurts your hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to bend it because i'm [ __ ] bending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it so i bend it the other way and i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kept doing this and it got loose enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i got some pliers and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cutting the plastic along jesus christ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so goddamn long and then i had the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem of okay because of how these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> towers work there's only like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two sides like the one 90 corner right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 90 degree yeah this side and this side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like the holes that you connect it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to and these sides have like the clips </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it clips into yeah so i have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem now where some of it clips in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well some of it doesn't so i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't step on that one people when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people go to the balcony because i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh yeah you're just all gonna like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] break and fall apart if you step </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by but it looks nice yeah we got it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect yeah it looks like i hurt my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hands and it took so goddamn long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why i like the roll variety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's it's designed to be cut but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but like i didn't have a big enough area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to warrant a whole roll yeah yeah it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a small area i just wanted grass i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to see more green yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because i i in my previous place i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had like the wood things oh those are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the wood towels which look nice but also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i just prefer the feel of fake even if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah it feels great yeah that's why i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> got some parts wood just for to to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that over there i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i got grass for where my feet go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's something about with touching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grass with your feet feels good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what can i say we touch grass yeah they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> touch grass every morning next time you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> consider insulting me remember i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> grass and that i tell you whenever i see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's fake wrong whenever i see a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> comment that says touch grass i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't mind if i do it i go out to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> balcony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so much girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you wait do you have a garden in </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> consider a garden </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know i want a garden i don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look after said god that's the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea of a garden is nice um because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have a garden in our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> english home as you know you've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there um and there was a point in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where my parents would just go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thailand and there was a point in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i would work from home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that house and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the months that they were away i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just i noticed that the garden just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> progressively looked like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the grass would grow and that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that at that point where i realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh someone's gonna take care of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> garden for it to look good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want to do that that's that's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much effort it's a big garbage plants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are alive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> plants are living things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever since you know ever since then i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like the idea of a garden is nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but just i've seen a lot of people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney's house has like a massive garden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can lose like half a day or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something just like taking care of it my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad regularly spends multiple days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taking care of it multiple days i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like he loves it though it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like his new child but it looks amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be fair he does a really good job but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to me it's just like i i think i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely love it if i had the time to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> take care we haven't got to that age yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we can appreciate just being able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pull out the lawn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know have your coffee or your beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just just go at it yes exactly just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just grab a hose and just hose down is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that a good thing i don't know like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you get older you'll probably enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> those pleasures more yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember when i was a kid my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mom would be like go on go cut the grass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now it's it's your turn and i'm just </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> did they have all the other choices oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they made me do that i [ __ ] hated it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me it was my dad's like he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not i'm not letting him do it it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my garden it's mine he's gonna [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> what i hated i still hate putting on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> laundry well sydney does actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certainly loves that [ __ ] but the way it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> a line and a big stick that props up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> line in the middle yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it was always [ __ ] annoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it was windy doing this when i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like small as well and this pole is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive so i hated doing it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] that they like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff they say on twitter it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind-numbing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since nfts has become somewhat worse i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't understand how twitter got worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but like nfts made twitter so much more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> annoying and then every goddamn youtuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like somehow using nfts for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scams as well it's all they are so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> youtubers using nfs okay can you can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explain to to me and perhaps audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't know explain it like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] even is an nft so there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a there's like a you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically buying the the proof that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> own a piece of artwork right but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> digital right but it's a digital piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of artwork so it's not a physical piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the in the blockchain which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of i don't i'm not going into that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah don't go into it explain the like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on five explaining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in like proof to the world that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your ba but essentially you are paying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the proof that you own something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay right that's the most basic way i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can explain it right so you get a token </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can't be replicated to say you own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing right so it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certificate of authenticity no that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly what it is right right that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are buying artwork digital </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> artwork for like ridiculous amounts of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> money because yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in in a sense even though you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right click and save as that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like there there is a token yeah or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a certificate that says you own the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> original piece of the artwork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even though even though it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> digital like that's dumb as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i have friends good friends who uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have made a lot of money from it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's what they do and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> produce them themselves and they you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's all for them i don't mind them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing it i'm not like you can't do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like just this whole this whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aspect of shoving it down everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the craze right because people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are trying to make money from it yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so the only way to get money and make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> money from a lot of the a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not all of them are scams but there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of scams as well there are so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scams and there's like so many uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> scandals and stuff because there's no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> regulation or anything so do people like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy certain nfts and then resell them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah okay so it's like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> investment so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's how that's how they freaking have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a phrase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's been stuff like insider </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trading where like websites that sell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nfts and showcase them they have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> things there was like one case where um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing where they basically promote </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an nft every week and the guy one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ceos or something knew which nft </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was coming up so he would buy a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that type of artwork and then when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it went up he would sell it and make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ton of money but there's no laws against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it because it's not considered insider </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trading because it's cryptocurrencies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the cyberpunk so there's like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just the wild west right now and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some people it's great they love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a place where because because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no rules there's no regulation a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of people can get scammed a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people can make a lot of money very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fast um and it's just kind of like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toxic environment right that's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bad yeah it sounds like it's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scams and i hate the fact that youtubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have started promoting them and doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course they have of course that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] awful oh i've released my nfg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like a shame because i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i feel like the the idea and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technology has like so much potential </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now it's just being used for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really shitty things basically yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know there's also the criticism that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's terrible for the environment and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh what not how's it terrible for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> environment oh because the oh wow god so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do i have to go do my own research the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way that like though how the system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> works it uses a [ __ ] ton of computing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> power to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have the blockchain okay it's quite an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> efficient all right yeah in general it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it wastes a lot of energy to run these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] nonsense yeah basically like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of these cryptocurrencies at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have as much energy usage as some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> countries to run right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely it's insane like like the like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the network that nfps run on which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called ethereum i think uses as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> energy as like sweden or one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> countries you know i'm not like i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this boomer who's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anti-progress and anti-technology i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all for like good technology but it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feels like the way it's been going is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such a [ __ ] mess well it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just awful well because because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually been shoved down my throat i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did actually do like my research and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reading into into this thing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if there's if there's this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i like to understand things and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like the problem the problem now is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just so [ __ ] new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah nobody knows what the [ __ ] to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do yeah it's the wild west and i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like as the years progress and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> becomes more stable then this could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is potential for this technology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be used for something actual good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually good and it will i i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it this technology will be more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sustainable in the future as well as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cryptocurrencies kind of figure out hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's let's build a system that doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like burn the entire amazon rainforest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get running right but i feel just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now it is like i'm staying the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] away from this oh yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> touching it like the the knee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> although that's the last thing they want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it does need some kind of regulation in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some sense to stop all these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scams and the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know how many scams there are is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they always reach out to us to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ask us to promote them yeah there's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many that ask us to promote them and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like this [ __ ] nonsense it'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like hey we're like a badger poop uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nft uh we wanna and it's like [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are you off forward to nfts being added </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to your favorite video games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i like i i think if it gets to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like it's not like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> burning the planet and it and it's chill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know and and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's not so scummy because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i see this [ __ ] i'm just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cs go skin community is like salivating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right now oh my god oh my god yeah nft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> skins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> came over but it'll probably get there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah i can see it happening i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> easily see it happening if you're having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the kind of things i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so out of the loop with like that kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i feel like this is what my grandma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> must have felt when vr was introduced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's like where it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wrap my head around like i did ask like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i when you said ethereum like i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay yeah i've heard of that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the first time i heard ethereum i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like i'm pretty sure you can collect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that in starcraft right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's what that's what it sounded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like to me and then i was like oh wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it's like a crypto thing okay never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind i don't wanna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel very old right now i'm not bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the only trend i hope changes or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dies down yeah yeah that's all i want i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't care yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i just i just i just want some actual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cool applications that are not just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> selling overly priced artwork which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the exact same [ __ ] artwork it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the amount of times i've seen that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> monkey nft like we're just different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> skins i don't even know what that monkey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> nft is like oh well i've got the skin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> boy he's wearing the pirate hat and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] off i realize how stupid this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh god at least if some guy spends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking 200 on a monet he's got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] monet but he's also i don't i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think he's good either but yeah at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> least he's got the [ __ ] paintings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly didn't burn down the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rainforest to get a [ __ ] token and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was such a boomer i know i hate i hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all this stuff man it sucks i just yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scam suck too and yeah again i hope that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it gets some kind of uh i hope that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> regulates up its act yeah because it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stops being so [ __ ] yeah because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was reading about up about like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> possible applications nfts could have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like you know you know you have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> non-fungible nft stands for non-fungible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> token so of course right now it's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used as a certificate to say you own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this stuff but it has like a lot more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> applications above that you can think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about hey sending over certification to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say hey this person let's say has a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driver's license or has like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has you know is certified has a master's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> degree or something along those lines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like one centralized unit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that anyone can check so we don't rely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like some companies like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forging driver's license or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> documentation or like having to go all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way to like even thinking thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about house ownership or any kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ownership right yeah the amount of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] paperwork or you know you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think of think of how much it can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> revolutionize japan if there was one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> system that said this person owns this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and this person owns that that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like that's got so much potential </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like reduce the paperwork by tenfold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you got to give japan time they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just discovered databases so you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> china still uses the phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they've just discovered what excel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is yeah like yeah maybe like 30 40 years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time for that no i i think there is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of exciting things that it could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> useful yeah but right now it is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds cool yeah right like yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like a real life use but you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i remember like the only piece of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> news i saw about nft is when it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> first popping up was like the original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nyan cat gif got like sold as an nft for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some some stupid amount of money and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who what i want to know is who sold it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how did they prove that they had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ownership of it i think it might have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been the original creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i don't even like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> original creator was like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually a loophole for this we can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like this concept is actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not applicable to what yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's that's the biggest leap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so what we're saying is we can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> authenticate whether it's authentic or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not yeah that's what they said what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's still a lot about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place i don't understand so i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna i'm gonna i'm only gonna comment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on things that i do know yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just want less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please less scams yeah so like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> example like a single ethereum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> transaction consumes as much electricity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as an average u.s u.s household uses in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a work week and has a carbon footprint </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equivalent to 140 893 these are like for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> example our visa credit card </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> transactions or 10 595 hours of watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like every nft transaction that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why yeah right now right now it is we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> truly live in a society </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bro </SPEAKER_01>
