<SPEAKER_00> so connor was like it's 20 minutes home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a comfy taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so then we get in the taxi taxi's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driving fine and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then just some random police officer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just walks out onto the street and kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flags us down there's like four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> policemen surround this like old </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> weird like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because normally we record on tuesdays </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people probably figured this out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know how you figured out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like tr some people have figured out the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire trash taste schedule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mentioned it in passing yeah what we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think is a passing comment people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like remember i remember i got a tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well i was randomly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> checking twitter like right before about </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> i was just like where are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're watching me yeah and people have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figured out like some like the recording </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> watch order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the official trash taste watch order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere on reddit i don't know yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> get mixed around right yeah sponsors and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatnot but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in general you could figure out based on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's sitting where </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> that tastes like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is for a challenge and i lose then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's my fault right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so how are you enjoying your christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> holiday boys well that's when we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recording this right yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we are recording this during the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas holidays we've we've had our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas episodes but uh we are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoying our christmas holidays right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now even though we're still technically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i took two days off and then i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right a whole two days back back to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back to youtube i don't know i i really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i even like going one day without </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube i'm like [ __ ] i want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i want to make something yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to entertain i want to be a clown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know why you're a clown every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day it's all right i think yeah there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty some deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> insecurity that happened during my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> childhood that makes me strive to want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to entertain i don't know why but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know it was nice it was fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i it's nice having actually i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the difference between like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> holiday that is everyone's holiday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and one that you set for yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that when it's like a like a national </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> holiday you're like well [ __ ] i have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obligated yeah yeah but then sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you're not your headspace isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it you're like man i kind of want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take a vacation but like i don't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then when if you do it yourself you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hype yourself up for it you're like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking this time off no one's going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell me what to do but on christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like [ __ ] i kind of want to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to like make a video i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to [ __ ] around yeah i don't know what it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is about the christmas holidays i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> well i've always ended up working during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the christmas holidays because i've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my yearly videos that probably won't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen this year but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's probably that's mostly what i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working on during the christmas holidays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then i've realized that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know as youtubers you need to take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] break right yeah yeah and yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels i don't know what it is but do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ever get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know sometimes we take breaks during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the weekdays right to us we don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weekends don't technically exist but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> found that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking breaks on the weekends feels a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot better than taking breaks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in during the weekdays because it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feels nice when you know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone else in the country is on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> break as well you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well except for most hand where yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah except in japan where christmas day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is just a regular workout yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also weekends are a suggestion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stop working yeah they're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> enforced every holiday is a suggestion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> let's be honest i went up to uh to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the north of japan for about three or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four days to go see chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um and that was really nice there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much [ __ ] snow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did he make you drink shitty sacking uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no he made me drink good suck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah and also that's an oxymoron for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor though yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also it was the first time ever i did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a proper japanese christmas aka kfc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how was it it's just kfc this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly what i thought it's just chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's just like a trip to kate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> although it was kind of weird because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chris had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> schedule it like or book it book kfc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> king kfc yeah we have to watch the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like two two or three weeks in advance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and it's also weird it's not just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you not only have to book it but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to book like a day in time to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and pick it up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah as well so it's like not only do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to come in on debt on a certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> day to a certain store but it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come between a 2 to 3 p.m time bracket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this and we went there and there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a group of about maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> five or six families just lining up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get their christmas chicken from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> colonel and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would rather die than line up for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> chaos yeah and i mean you know it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we got like a full bucket of like just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bunch of chicken wings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you do but also at the bottom of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bucket there was like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of christmas cake or like christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pudding right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know because i don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone had a slice of it but it was at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bottom of the thing we're like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a little weird that it's just been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting underneath this like greasy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> greasy [ __ ] chicken that's no way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd want to put a cake no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the last thing we were expecting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the bottom of the the bucket to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh it was like 5 000 yen for it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could feed maybe about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three or four people you paid 50 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for kfc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on christmas yeah oh my god i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't kristen you could have had a nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> roast dinner for that oh no we ordered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all the food as well okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but we were like just because it was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first time for all of us we've never had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a japanese christmas before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we're like you know what [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> let's do it and uh wouldn't do it again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be honest it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just kfc isn't it i just go wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is i think the fourth year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asia celebrating christmas and i gotta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say i you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really understand the entire the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like height behind this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh the the christmas spirit you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i thought that was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought that was just my [ __ ] meme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a marketing point yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't understand that until i started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spending christmas outside of you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you know countries that normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> celebrate christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know you can do a lot of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it feel christmassy but having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spent a few christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> christmases in asia i kind of miss that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> christmas spirit because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's there's a few things you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can put on the christmas songs and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do whatever you know put up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's just something missing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't put my finger on it but it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't feel fully christmassy i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it just has to do with the fact that at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> least in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> christmas is not a family thing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a romantic thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and also everyone's working so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah yeah like i got a delivery </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on like as we were having our roast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dinner and it was like the least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like the immersion breaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas right the moment where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> simulation ruined yeah yeah i had an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> amazon package and i was like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not christmas that's the door on your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> red hat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i refuse to have this wine in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah christmas simulation over it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that rick and morty episode where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just trapped in an ultimate like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this this like reality yeah is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas is like going back and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reluctantly having to talk to family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> members about like oh i do youtube you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know this is what i yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> naked online yeah yes i make this much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> per year thank you uncle for asking me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for the seventh time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're investing right in the pension </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yes yes i am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no i don't know yeah i don't know it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> felt it felt odd because i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't i didn't appreciate christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that much because i didn't realize that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a really good way of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head at least i don't know if this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because i've been this is how i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like this is the end of the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah now now go and restart it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then build up to all of this again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was it's not just christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that period between christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas and new year's yeah that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the blank period we don't do anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just like what rules </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what what are the rules nobody knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's going on are the buses running i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know are the trains running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our shops open it's [ __ ] anarchy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i love that period because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> google how how long can i have leftovers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how many christmas dinners yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living in england that was like one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorite parts of the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just it was just as you said like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the reset of the year it was like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entirety the entire society was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of goes into cooldown right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly right whereas here it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> businesses business as usual like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> supermarkets and convenience stores are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally 24 7. even on new year's day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mum won't shut up about kfc christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me she's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fascinated by it she's like i heard they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have kfc for christmas is it true and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like yes they do mom it's like wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how crazy is that and i'm like yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's too fair it is bizarre yeah it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know just all the things that japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no interest in from like the west right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we bring our finest things they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no no none of that none of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then suddenly the colonel rocks up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like listen how about let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> picture this like greece </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me take this absolutely nothing to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do with christmas food and somehow make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it christmas food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who did like oh my god like how do they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pull this off like i'm sure someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knows the history behind it but like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me even if you explained to me how it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the kfc marketing department did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this i mean i explained it to you last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time right but even then it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> still doesn't make sense to me it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i researched it and it doesn't make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the marketing heist of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> century like i swear in japan like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> normal marketing things they just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> care about that like advertisements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't care about that oh oh there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collaboration where i can get my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> poorly printed on a latte oh well a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hundred bucks hello </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that drives me insane dude when you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it on paper it just sounds like a great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretender episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how do they pull this off this is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heist five now this is like the ova </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they sell christmas to the japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like it is it's [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like some ocean's 11 [ __ ] with every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> marketing department and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they they do collaborations with stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is a really common thing japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't just market things normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't have adverts it's like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to collaborate with businesses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like i went to the supermarket and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw like washing detergent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a bungo stray dogs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> collaboration oh yeah we got one with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> levi on it yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay levi that makes sense yeah but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> some shows it's like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why does bongo stray dogs have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> collaboration with washing detergent to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it works i'm a weeb it works i see i see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i see evangelion i see oscar's face </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> plastered on some coffee i'm like i need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no no no this is why i hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me right you don't go to a fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dining like restaurant for example right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they draw a [ __ ] smiley face on your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hamburger you'd be insulted wouldn't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd be like no no no where's my steak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why is there a smiley on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the way i see stuff and like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you put like characters on it or you put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] smiley faces i hate it when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disneyland does that by the way when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put [ __ ] smiley faces on your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like what is my food a joke to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to eat it [ __ ] okay never mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna get it off around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like to me you're making the product </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seem more childish by putting stuff on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it so when i see these collaborations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like most the time with like especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with the animes at the cafes i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is all disgusting right you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> selling me a three dollar latte for 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> times the price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i'm offended i mean i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just it's it's very similar to what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they do in the west with celebrities but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you don't get like a kim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kardashian latte um </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] collaboration with mcdonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i wasn't that insanely like successful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as well yeah but wait okay first of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm near certain correct me if i'm wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't plaster his like face on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm pretty sure they had like a specific </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> menu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i thought okay fine yeah it's ten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dollars by the way yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is [ __ ] ridiculous yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with stuff like that but you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> understand that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the fans will pay any amount of money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right for that one photo right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so then i i you know i go i go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to have it and i gotta drink it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as i drink this latte </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this film of like the plastic [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they printed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes in my mouth and i'm like like god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's disgusting </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> off my coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to eat it so i'm here scooping it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ruining this picture they printed on it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> am of something i don't want that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> printed on my food i mean that's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on you then for going to that cafe right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you could have easily just gone to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starbucks right here yeah that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing is if you go to the exhibition or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you go to these things i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean not that like there's like enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there if you're a fan right but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you have to you have to obligatory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go to the gift shop on the cafe because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know yeah of course you have to and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the gift shop sometimes has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some good stuff but some stuff that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care about like they're obsessed with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making coasters of characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's it's it's not just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coasters i've noticed that as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's they they're putting gacha into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as well because the blind box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so if you want to collect the character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you actually like you gotta you gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy more [ __ ] right you gotta buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an extra meal because that was exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the same thing as when i went to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fate museum as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like being a kid all over again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the the happy meal toys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah man i remember one time i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really there burger king were doing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> collaboration with like spongebob toys </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> get me the the other toy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah my my parents used to do that all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the time you would always go up and ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but sometimes they'd be like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really yeah i've never heard of someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> saying no yeah really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're usually just like whatever i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't get paid enough yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like i don't control the gotcha </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a [ __ ] guarantee i don't care i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get paid six dollars an hour i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give it to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah i just i'm not a big fan of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collaboration cafes i just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really get that good of an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> experience of the show i feel like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> collaboration cafes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are a bit [ __ ] a bit tactical a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tacky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no yes it's tacky like which i i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like most anime cafes are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that i've never been i've met never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> been to like an anime cafe and been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> impressed by it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because no it's it's like you go in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room that's like a normal sized cafe and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've just plastered paintings of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters in the shows on the wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wow look at this like they don't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get creative with it like i i would say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been to quite a few because aki </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> likes to do videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i'd say the only i've only ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been to two collaborative cafes where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like i would go back and that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the pokemon cafe and the kirby cafe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's just because nintendo has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so much bigger of a budget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that they can afford to get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little more creative with it right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's so many of them you go and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch a youtube video of someone like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to a cafe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like you could see these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtubers desperately trying to get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven minutes out of this cafe yeah at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of the day it's just like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally just paintings on a wall yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i went to the weathering with you cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that [ __ ] was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] it's because it's the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> formula every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you if you like if you come to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come to like one anime cafe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then realize that that's that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> experience for every cafe you know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you the way i see it is that you come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once as a tourist and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was cool yeah and then you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't go to any others because they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no i was gonna say like also how they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get you with all these like anime cafes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're only open for limited amounts of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time right because they would [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's a sense of urgency where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh the promised netherlands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cafe is only open for two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean i would promise neverland </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go and then you go and you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disappointed and before you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> file a complaint it's it's gone the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was vile as well oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all microwaved food or whatever the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kirby cafe that had some really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like i was like i was actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wow i've never had someone be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you must try this souffle you must you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> must go to the square innings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> collaboration cafe for the best it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's not like going to the jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bar where there was obviously like a fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of jojo who like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personalized these cocktails </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all sponsored it's all corporate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> businessmen stamping like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes collaboration yeah what can we do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coasters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> let's print the character on a latte and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put some anime posters up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then sell a bunch of clear files i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> realize you're probably like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like breaking so many dreams right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by explaining how [ __ ] they are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> listen if you come here on a like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> visiting you'll probably find it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting if there's a show you really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like but in general </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like like the cafe is always the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lowest point to any like big anime event </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i went to the faye cafe but that was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fake cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the fate museum and the museum the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exhibition actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was [ __ ] awesome oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you got to see the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] history of this franchise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like of not just fake but like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire like type moon universe and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see that's cool if it's like a like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i went to the corner super cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that was in par with the corner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so you you can only go to this cafe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you bought tickets to the movie yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like okay you know it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> little bonus thing but i wouldn't go all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the way to central tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to go to a [ __ ] corner no no no it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just not worth it like i i definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't recommend going to any pop-up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cafes if something's limited time then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have not put effort into it no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dude the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best cafe i went to is actually like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one i made a video on which is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 3d latte art yeah that cafe is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] good i went to suck your own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dick there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yeah i must say the only good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cafe i've been to is the one that i made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i wouldn't make a video on if i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was good right like yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that again that's like a permanent cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's right yeah that's bad because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can literally the best part about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing is you can take in like anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you want you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make it 3d yeah like they'll find a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do it it's so [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also that guy on twitter shitpost like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> crazy the owner is so good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so funny yeah that's the thing it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> again like again the reason why i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the pokemon cafe and the kirby cafe so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good is because they're permanent yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> every every season they're like oh we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can bring out something a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> more experimental if it doesn't work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> take it out yeah nintendo are really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good at doing like i mean have you seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the new uh theme park they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> releasing yeah yeah yeah it's opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> february right my god i saw that i saw a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> picture of that i thought wow legoland's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really improved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't think it was real at first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think we've talked about that okay so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched the video of uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh what's the guy's name shigeru mimoto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah like having a tour of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get like a bracelet that you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hit [ __ ] with and like there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keys and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really dude it looks badass yeah like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like a 10 year old watching him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like talk about it i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry i saw a japanese youtuber who got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like first access ever as a youtuber but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's also been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's in the japanese of course but he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> been sponsored by usj </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and nintendo in the past he's literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like japan's like youtuber oh he cooking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah because one time the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i had a policeman that was asking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me like what do you do and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> youtuber he's like oh like hikakin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like no i'm not like hika i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah dude yeah whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like hikakin and youtuber are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> synonymous yeah yeah they're pretty much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> strange but uh yeah what's the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we've never talked about yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this is how you get tickets in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> basically yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's better than scalping let's go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's golfing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> scalping is people who buy a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> things and then just jump on prices </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean people do that too i mean it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's in theory to stop that from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> happening right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like for example the when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> olympics for example uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't know if that's going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happening next year but uh we've already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> announced that it will be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we'll see i reckon it'll happen no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> matter what but it'll be interesting to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see how they'll do it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly but like with the olympics for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> example they did it it's so dumb so they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do a lottery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you enter and it's like a lottery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get a certain amount of tickets so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is how we do it so like uh when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to the persona 5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh concert yeah it was a lottery system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was really weird because it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go into the lottery to get a certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> number of tickets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're different lotteries so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you want to go just by yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you enter the lottery to get one ticket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's another lottery to get two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tickets or three tickets or four tickets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just because you enter into one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guaranteed that you're gonna get those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tickets yeah but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what it is is that you might think oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so if you win the lottery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you just get the tickets right no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get the right to purchase the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tickets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan have figured out a way to gachify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every process </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> possible man yeah i mean it's also i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also saw that you could get some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tickets but you could only be entered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into some of them if you bought like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> panasonic device </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah they were like giving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> away some of the tickets to i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and also and also the shitty thing as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well is that like say you enter the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> lottery to get four tickets right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're not sure if you're gonna get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it so you want to enter multiple times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but here's the kicker say you win twice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right in that four ticket lottery you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> forced to pay for those eight tickets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't back out of that [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're actually forced like even if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's only four people that you're going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with and you just did another lottery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for backup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to buy eight tickets it just it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just doesn't make sense to me it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't make sense i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i understand in theory why they do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this this is like trying to put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out a fire with cooking oil </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i mean it's just the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> roundabout [ __ ] time-consuming way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do it and i guarantee nintendo line's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going to do the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah probably i mean nintendo haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got the best rep at the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've been like [ __ ] everything up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't believe that man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nintendo and dmca are like that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now yeah with the stuff with the smash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tournament did you see that as well that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was a while back yeah yeah did you not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> see that no i didn't see that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically they like just uh cease and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> desisted a big tournament they've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on for a while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone was like the [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were using um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so the obviously the netcode of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> switch smash brothers is pretty garbage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so people fan modded their own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> version of it that's much better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh it's called like slippy or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they didn't allow that and because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were going to use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's called slippy yeah because it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like actually runs smoothly because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nintendo online sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and always has sucked and the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they pay for it is kind of a joke yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um because you don't really get anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of it like it's awful it's so bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i love nintendo but god damn is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sock yeah they're really going to fix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and so they cease and desist of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they were also sponsoring a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> splatoon tournament </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and guess how much the what guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the prize was for the so they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving the prize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sanctioned event yeah they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving the top prize for a team of five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> versus five was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 25 nintendo eshop gift card </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then oh my god they're dead they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they canceled the event because one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the teams had something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> free smash or something it was like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> along the lines of like nintendo over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there i'd like to for solidarity with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the smash bros </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prize you can't even pay for whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't even split that you can't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pay for the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your [ __ ] tournament is it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> funny because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason nintendo just wants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their [ __ ] eyepiece to die like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't get it dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right games are sweating man they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like oh there's a new competitor in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the esports scene now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's wild to me because you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> see the like the complete difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again like you said riot right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you have the [ __ ] what is it the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> baron pat red bull pack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the red bull mercedes drive to victory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like they're fully embracing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> becoming sports and nintendo's like none </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games the state farm analyst desk god i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember watching worlds this year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was so weird just seeing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally everything monitored it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally like watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i say that drinking my g fuel out of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> g4 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thank you for sponsoring trash taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> their meal and i said it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it is it is funny how it's become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like american football where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every single part of the game is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sponsored and then you again you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the complete opposite where nintendo's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we don't want to put any of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because because nintendo could make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> money off it if they really wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they only be in charge of this but they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just have no interest in it no i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we've i mean they're probably already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making enough as is well that's that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the japanese mindset isn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like we've made enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doing it the way we like you don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make more money yeah but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess which is so odd for a business </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> say because i think what was it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> last year nintendo was the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cash-rich company in japan yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is insane i i i think there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something is slightly wrong with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> statement it's not that they don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make more money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because from like my experience working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with japanese money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese companies they want to make as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much money as possible that they but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to make as much money as possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> using the methods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not that they don't want to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> money is that they don't know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> make money in other ways exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly because they like esports well i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it's where if you ask someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know if you ask me connor you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ten dollars guaranteed or connor you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> make a hundred dollars by you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pushing yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being a little crazy and it might it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might might go horribly wrong of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time i'm gonna be like 100 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's do it yeah of course but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the japanese companies don't see it that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way yeah yeah japanese companies like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's one person in the company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that wants to get creative but he has to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ask 60 other people for yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know and that might take a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while but by the time they always say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah our new trends come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get it because almost you know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the you're the head of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> companies you don't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get make a hundred odd people lose that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> job yeah right so you're getting a safe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> route </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but sometimes the safe route can just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lead to being stacked yeah but also it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> detrimental could it be if like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thing doesn't work out right like again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nintendo is the most cash rich company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan right it's like how much do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they have to lose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sucks because you just everyone like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wants nintendo to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do this [ __ ] yeah because everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] loves everyone wants to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] scene into everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cheering for nintendo just to do the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right thing yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what i mean it's literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opposite of like ea where everyone just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wants the a to keep [ __ ] up and keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] up to the point where laws have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be made but with nintendo everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wants to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's it's like in the sh you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have those typical shows where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the brother is addicted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drugs and the whole family is super nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just please stop just come on get get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back on your feet man come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nintendo yeah how many chances do we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have to give you how many rehabs do we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to put you through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to see you get back on track especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after all the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> w's that they were taking these last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couple of years yeah they were just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killing every e3 everyone was like yep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nintendo king yeah exactly [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody else and now they just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we haven't had a nail in a while let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's let's give that a couple of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people [ __ ] lost their [ __ ] when they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> brought out literal cardboard like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is a company that can release </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cardboard and we'll eat it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this this is how much all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i completely forgot about that yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay at the end of the day they do like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the coolest [ __ ] [ __ ] like they do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nintendo are just doing their own thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man yeah like i played ring fit and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who what kind of crackhead came up with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this idea to like just [ __ ] exercise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a ring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like and it works and it's good like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who came up with this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is insane we've never seen this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from any other company it's it seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like creatively </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they will take any [ __ ] risk possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but like on a business sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> mean most people come people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i also the thought of having to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a track down and then clean it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly i mean you know just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whole concept of mario maker right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's like it's like clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're embracing like their fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> creative side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i love watching mario make your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> videos yeah they're so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no on the but but at the same time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mario party online no i've never heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of that oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you just said you just said three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> magical words that i didn't think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> needed to hear and then i was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why why why have i never thought of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before it's like that meme of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whisper the three sexiest words into my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ears </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't believe they released super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mario party on like two in 2018 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and it didn't have online play and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had like four maps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were [ __ ] sorry i yeah i was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disappointed because i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mario park i mean my body's still good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> land </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah you know online would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] amazing i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay do you feel that some part of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> married party experience is being next </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to each other and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ah i get that but i would like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> option to play online for streaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right if i need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also like you know it's the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing with like smash right like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing smash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> land like next to your friends and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] on them irl is fun as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but they we very quickly found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that online is also just as fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gonna sound like a discord call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's fun as far as it's just sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just hate happiness sometimes it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like and i thought when when super mario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> party released it's getting way too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> detail they had like four maps and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were all mid and i was like okay well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll release new ones right they'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> update it they'll have dlc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like i'm a [ __ ] liar yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that never happened so i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] dude i'm so sad about that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> game could have been something good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm always just hoping next mario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parties is the one that's gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> online because i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing is the problem with it is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone else is playing jess and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just playing [ __ ] hungry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hippos or something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes sometimes it's [ __ ] fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as [ __ ] but other times you're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can you just go back to like a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of chess you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> play by the rules just a little bit you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i don't get it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know we live in japan and they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> develop the games i do not know of any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese people who go around to each </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other's houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean you never hear of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people japanese people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meeting in their other people's houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always an izakaya or another place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah maybe it's just because you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have that many japanese the ones i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have never do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh i do that with my japanese friend do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you actually yeah i stand correctly i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mean not obviously not this year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but nowhere near as often as like going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out to like eat in an izakaya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah of course but like there's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of cases where i would go out to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eat and then we would go back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's place yeah right but it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like in in the west right we are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like 90 of the time it's like meet up at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> each other's house get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know future yeah because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] expensive to eat out in the west </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> capricorns and sagittarius tend to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> very rough knowing knowing the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese it'll probably be something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it'll be yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll be blood type earning and male to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> female and it'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right that's good you're compatible with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> half the population fantastic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing has changed i don't get japan's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obsession with blood types man that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah what is i don't you know your </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> three different types right there's o a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> b and a b </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah one right a b is the real one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i i should know because i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a blood disease so i i used to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a medical bracelet </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> shouldn't lose i haven't got a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> replacement it's been like a few years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> now so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you meant to like wear that always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not meant to it's just like a suggestion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the doctor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what blows my mind what blows my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though is that in japan at least like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese schools like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get bullied for your blood type </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's right damn man that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's next level bullying it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like oh you're an a type that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just racism with extra steps man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that does sound like an excuse it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i thought he's a filthy old type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't hang out with us oh times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're an a type right and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why why does everyone know each other's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blood type yeah i think i think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like when you do like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> health checks oh yeah we did that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i haven't done mine yet it should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> written on your thing that was that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so strong so so to explain since we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> starting with geeks plus we are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technically under their health insurance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and their company policy is that we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> health checkup once a year which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in japan has to do is work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twice a year okay twice we've been here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one year already mail in but we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already had one checkup how does that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay okay so we're supposed to go twice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but we've only just been once um and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was weird because i it was weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing how efficient a health </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> system can be yeah how long did it take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i haven't gone yet it took about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 minutes to get 30. it's like 30. okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well so still that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so in 30 minutes you do an x-ray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh your blood pressure you get weighed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get blood taken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you do a hearing and uh sight test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you talk to a doctor who'll talk to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you do a cardiogram and a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cardiogram yeah wow 30 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all inside it was like it was like speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> running we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we were speed running health checks and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they even had like [ __ ] splits as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's a gold split on that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> x-ray x-ray split done all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blood taking split let's go it literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt like that because it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was about like uh because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had some problems with my forms i had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fill out my form again so i was only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about like five to ten minutes behind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor yeah and by the time i had just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like just started my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm gonna call it a conveyor belt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's what it felt like it felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i was in chicken run being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> processed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so i was i i just started the process </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and connor was almost done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wow it was the most efficient </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i saw the list of all the things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that get checked up and i was like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is going to be like an old day yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you also have to pee the night before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and bring it with you which i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always feel weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah carrying a a violence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who knows what might arise so you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into this room and it's like this really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> busy place in like shinjuku which i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine a lot of people will go to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there's uh like you go to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh reception area there's like 12 desks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like come here you hand the form like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right go upstairs you go upstairs yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's in like medical gowns yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really fancy office looking thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's really odd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's basically just a small room not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even that big with like couches in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you can see the like sections </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have a number so you're literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a chicken in a farm it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a piece of meat being like passed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the different things </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> that was so alien for me especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming from the uk which you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pick up the nhs forgiving giving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone everyone free health care but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the price you pay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for that is that you have to wait for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and when i say everything even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just going to the [ __ ] gp </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a a rectangle on a wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just put your chest against it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's really odd oh because when i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> to come </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> feels weird that squeezes your arms yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the doctor was like yeah you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> we were before we got a blood team we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> were talking about you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we were talking about how the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese health system had we've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've all had pretty good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experiences with the japanese health </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> system because we all have like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know why we all have like that inherent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fear that you know everyone's had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shitty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shitty experience when they have taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the blood and they've just missed the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vein </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah and that happened to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that really yeah that like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> foreshadowing that happened to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i knew it as soon as he stuck the needle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in because you know you you can feel it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when when like it goes straight to your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vein </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels exactly like the doctor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describes it's just like a prick right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it just comes out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so he sticks this needle in and i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that something was wrong because it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's not a vein that's muscle and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you start feeling pain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i felt sorry for anyone who has like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a needle phobia because i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not uh like so i can feel him like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twitching the needle around my arm and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like i'm just like how do i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell him he's not there how do i tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him it's not there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he does it for like a full like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> minute before he realizes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh there's no blood coming out and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> look and i look how he's just pulling up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fat like yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> your inner [ __ ] and just be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't i don't know i i can't look at </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> because that's that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you have you ever like cut yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or have like an injury you don't feel it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all day </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that's me that's me a needle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really because every time i get cut it's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> a pain like i can't imagine seeing blood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally gush out of my veins and </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> oh that looks sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i like looking at that it's kind of cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> huh i missed one i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like whoa that's coming out of my body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i remember as a kid they would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me this like contraption that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like filled with like paint oil and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would just like all of it would like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would flip it over and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start playing like crazy yeah you should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do that to distract to distract yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like wow look at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing going to look at the vial i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whoa that's cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's weird i can't do that really i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go ahead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why'd you have to like smack it i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> come on get ready boy belt in the mouth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm like using mine we're using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was weird for me because because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally when i get my blood taken i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> used to it being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh like a private place if you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm sorry so we had our blood taken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a conveyor and i was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eyeing up the next guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy next to me again three of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was getting our blood taken he was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> odd neither of us could look at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look at the blood getting taken and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] like met eyes and just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all right well it's it's kissed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like meeting guys in a urinal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know it's just like so this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> awkward how's your day going oh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's you look like a no-type there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you trying to say right trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to strike up any conversation i guess it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is odd that we kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made it into a private thing in the west </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like does it really need to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> private getting your blood taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like if i mean it doesn't but i would i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> feel more i think i think it's that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people would prefer it right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i prefer it but if if that means </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you know i get medical tests way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] quicker in the uk yeah by all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> means do my colonoscopy in front of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other patients i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do not mind like let's get this done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like oh you cracked the fat too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> high if that means i can get it done 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> faster and i can get on with my day yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll i'll i'll get it i'll get my blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if i faint in front of a group of 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people who cares that's that's why in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> head i was like oh this is going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> an all day thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anywhere else is definitely an all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing right yeah yeah well i think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> worst part was that you couldn't eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh or drink anything the night before oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really after like 8 p.m you have to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating and drinking and yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally that wouldn't be a problem but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you tell me i can't eat and drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like well [ __ ] now i want to well no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i want to just wait you can't even drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> water are you drinking </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> only thing you can drink alcohol </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> it's not comfortable it's just that much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so much more comfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you say it as if it's like business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> class versus economy honestly that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way i see it like no </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> a train i'll avoid getting the train i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> understand that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but for me like i would most like nine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> percent of the time i would rather get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like have have a longer journey that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can actually do stuff on because i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do anything on a taxi i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can do more on attack i look at my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> phone and i immediately just get caught </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up through anything on a train in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean you can watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube videos you can be on twitter no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no because i get carsick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i don't know why i'm sorry that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your natural selection didn't favor you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jerry that's not my problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well i'm not the only one getting asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to do that yeah i don't think this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cast yeah is what i how do you get i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> focusing on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the youtube video whether it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's because you can't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside so the inertia just [ __ ] you up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because that's how you get casting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not sure about the exact signs of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> car sickness but i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cars are the only vehicle i get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> motion sickness in yeah anything else i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read i can vote boats well that's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> carsick is it it's yeah that's just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> vehicle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think i get seasick really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i get c6 i guess slightly seasonable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because normally people who are carsick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gets seasick yeah yeah i mean i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get carsick that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easily though unless you're watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something unless but if i'm looking down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on my phone or like i can't yeah no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like i i don't get car sick if i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sitting there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to me hell then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why i i think that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've conditioned myself to be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sleep so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> easily in cars yeah because i literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do anything in cars but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> listen to music i can do the exact same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing on a bus and not get sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on a bus yeah i could be on a bus and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever i will read i can look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but i can't but i but if i do that in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the car i think it's five minutes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's the smaller the vehicle the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> more likely i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get sick i don't know what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> science is behind that yeah but if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a like this if it's like a small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if it's a small taxi and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like squeezed in then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the back seat right and if you're in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> backseat yeah i just get immediately i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to go in the front of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> taxi i don't want to i don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make eye contact with the taxi driver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you think you're just going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] do these things sometimes you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know you might find yourself wandering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you look at him and it's an awkward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> moment of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hi i did no i never driving good driving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you like i'm awkward i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to make eye contact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i have the same problem in the back seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i accidentally sometimes look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the way i say sometimes look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the rear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the worst is when they're a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awful driver as well you gotta pretend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're doing a good job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're just [ __ ] yeah and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why i prefer to be in the front because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm less likely to get sick in the front </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from [ __ ] driving yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the back because you're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thrown around in the back anyway the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> and then we go on to this like kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bridge thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh and then just some random police </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> officer just </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> flags us down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and tells us to go into one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> roads and immediately the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> the first time i've ever had a taxi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> driver been pulled over by the police </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like i was like i was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hoping that they wouldn't be like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right let's have a look what these these </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like far come on yeah no i i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> afraid that might happen as well so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately like before the police </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> started talking to us i just immediately </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> yes i am japanese they they the police </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> officers asked us they were like is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay if we stop you for now </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> i was like what what </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> are you supposed to say to that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we're in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no taxis anywhere what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> expect us to do like they pulled us over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over some bridge so there wasn't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much there so it was just like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like a bunch of like a power plant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nearby so it was like nothing it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really odd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so four police officers like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> down this decrepit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's two other police officers just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standing there doing nothing because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what they do here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every police officer every police store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard in japan is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is all about how many police officers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you need versus how many was actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they literally sent like six police </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> officers to like you know someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> falling over on a bike yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's insane they're so bored here they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have nothing to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah or they need you know spotters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i got you bro nice policing you're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> always like two people like it's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a squad yeah exactly but one yeah one in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your partner right yeah that's normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how it should be right and you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because also this i i don't know if this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is on purpose but it's very intimidating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when four or five policemen are crowding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around you and you haven't done anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're asking you questions they </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> i don't know there's somebody again who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinks about things a lot socially i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to think of like the perfect social </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's what's awkward about them yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well i don't know okay well actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> talk so highly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of taxis right in japan in japan it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good because i know they'll they'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually know some of them do actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try and talk to me yeah that's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying none of them would talk to me but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of them some of them will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i feel some of the older ones they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bust out of conversations yeah yeah some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of some people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also like maybe learned english in </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> talking yeah yeah in the city it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're a customer i am a taxi driver i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> will not communicate in any way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's charming um in in japan i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when the taxi driver is trying to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in english when they try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk to you it's like oh damn you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're putting on the work but please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> focus on driving but you know go ahead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the best the best taxi driver i ever had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was in um it was in okinawa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh we were going from what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constitutes a good taxi driver yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a good question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it was a good taxi driver do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you like it when your tax drivers talk </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> either drunk or just tired or both yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm stepping in i don't want to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] conversation with the texture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah some sometimes sometimes you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get a taxi driver and they ask how your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> day is going and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just saying can you not control by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the way here we go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here we go i mean it depends if i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> alone or with friends have you ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever had a taxi driver who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought into a conversation between you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and friends oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that i hate that yeah yeah i'm like hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on hold on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this isn't a social invitation sir </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best taxi ride i had was in okinawa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we were we were going to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were going from our hotel to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one uh castle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in naha and it was like a 30 minute taxi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ride </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right um and the dude was like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously an older </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gentleman yeah but he clearly had been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there his entire life so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he knew immediately he's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> foreigners you clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know a whole lot about this place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> huh and he started talking and he took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> us on this really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] scenic route oh like throughout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> places but he said he's like i took you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the scenic route but i'll charge you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the regular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh so he was nice enough so he would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like actually like kind of stop the car </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> taxi drivers just part-time like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> just have one they're happy to have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tourists there yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm pretty sure business has not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been banging this year yeah um so yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> me and sydney were on his taxi drive uh </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone right now just show me these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi drivers i mean again like i feel </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> this giant cemetery right there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> big stretch of road yeah taxi drivers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just sleep there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really there's hundreds of taxis parked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> no i feel most countries you can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that no even in the countryside that'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be weird someone would like come and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop you be like yo you're okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have you by the way seen i couldn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] believe this but have you seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh those like rare taxis that you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get in tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rare taxis i can't believe japan has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually done this but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've literally turned taxis into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gacha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like of course they have of course i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> forgot the exact name of it but i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sakura taxis right so you know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in most taxis in tokyo and this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only a tokyo thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh but like you know how on taxis like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they usually have like the signs on top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the car yeah like show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know whether the taxis open or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatnot yeah apparently out of i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 7 400 taxi cars in the greater tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there are five taxis that have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a sakura thing on top of it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and supposedly that's like the ssr of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> taxis </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> oh in tokyo they're [ __ ] expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they get pissed off if you take a short </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> journey yeah yeah yeah i've taken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes i've had like too much [ __ ] to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> carry so i've had to get like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a short walk from the station to my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> house but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember like a few times and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotten the taxi because i had like too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much stuff to carry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like oh there okay oh here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i said yeah yeah and then i say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like thank you when i leave and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't say it back and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wow okay in japan that's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest [ __ ] you yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't say thank you back the audacity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like the equivalent of flipping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the boat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> literally yeah i didn't realize that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until someone pointed out that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened another time as well they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like wow that was really rude i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well is he yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought he was just driving well he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't say thank you back whatever what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] what a [ __ ] [ __ ] the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time it happened was a similar situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was like a very short journey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an eight dollar journey yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i got out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other person with me was like wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was so rude and i'm like what was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> rude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he just drove us he didn't say anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like yeah i said thank you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't say it back i'm like yeah oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay the audacity of this [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> afraid to get back in that car and give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> him a slap you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no but like that's the thing it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just tokyo taxis that are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] expensive because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you think about it catching a taxi in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tokyo is a luxury </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because trains are just so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convenient tokyo whereas the moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're out of the greater tokyo area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of places without a taxi yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it depends i think it depends where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going because there's some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're on the outskirts of tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right sometimes going if you're going in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an art like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quarter circle let's say they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really have trains that go like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> london right it's the exact same where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trains go in and out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't go around normally right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so if you want to go the outskirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not some most the time to get like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know a 15-minute taxi drive away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it might require you to go in all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way to central and then go out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like 50 minutes and yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well you know how much is 45 minutes of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my time worth of 30 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right but i think like the majority of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people central tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care about that right yeah yeah if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like you know going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas in okinawa there's literally one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tram line that goes for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five stops and that's the only train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> line that they have on the entire island </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's why the taxis are like half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the price that you get in tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if the people rely on it the local </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> government will yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the 30 minute tax free ride in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> auckland i was talking about was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 2000 yen oh [ __ ] seriously yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really in tokyo that would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like 60 70 bucks i'm convinced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's right that in tokyo they don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't make people retire they make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> them become taxi drivers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most taxi drivers when i see a young </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi driver i'm like wow you've made a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> career choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you made some examples of career choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here what's going on because i speak to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they like i swear to god they look they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look at taxi drivers like mcdonald's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> workers here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like it's like it's it's uh because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because it's like you don't need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any qualifications except thrive which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know they expect you to do yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like a throwaway job that they make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or gsans do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah basically it's like i've i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the average age of a taxi driver </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here is like seven years it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can retire or you be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan yeah you need to see yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> retire or become a taxi driver it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's either taxi driver or like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> construction worker but not actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> construction just like holding the signs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and being like this way please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's nuts how fast they build houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here it's like crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we had a we had like a whole school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bee built right next to the apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the span of the year i was living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> here which is [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they built a full like three-story house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> next to me in like two months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i was like what the [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no it is crazy like especially like say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go into like the city or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you haven't been for maybe like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couple of months it's surprising the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of things that have changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like oh this building was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely different two months ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that was just magically here going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to taxi drivers though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever had any weird or like bad </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> which is the convention center </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stay one second longer than this </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> people like that i don't care how nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are you shouldn't [ __ ] be an uber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> driver if you're pulling [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the equivalent of like getting a pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> delivered and the guy being like twenty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dollar tip right you gotta give me at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> least a twenty dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ten dollars no no twenty but i i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very much see during that experience why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people gave him one stars because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i kind of feared for my safety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at one point during that taxi ride i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's like it's not even a matter of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> him just like ranting about like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna kill a [ __ ] if i get another one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because yeah yeah it's the fact that he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't even going the right way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he wasn't going the right way and like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the beginning when he asked for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five stars like whatever it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] review i didn't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when he was like i'm gonna lose a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was just like oh [ __ ] man this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] terrifying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially la you don't know what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] gonna happen yeah exactly oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty scary yeah i've never had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything like that i i yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sadly haven't had any crazy taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> journeys really most of them are pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i feel like it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hard to have a bad taxi journey although </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone gave you a one star once as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> customer on uber and i was confused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because really i don't think i've ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> done anything in a car but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i did something that like ruined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this man's day and he gave me a one stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i know i was i i had i had one like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really memorable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh uber ride in la uh and it was again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from where we were staying to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> convention center it was like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> well some countries have way stricter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rules on taxis than others and like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> don't get in any van ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was it was fast as [ __ ] but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think like the craziest in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> driving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi drivers i've had uh probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in china i remember there was this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi driver had in china where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was literally like i was in a crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi game you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like this this guy this guy was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> full on [ __ ] he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he might as well have just been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drifting initially right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like he was in the middle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] shanghai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and whenever there would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pedestrians on the road he wouldn't slow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he would he was like he was like tapping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his horn like it was a [ __ ] quick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what i mean that's how like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like he's dodged yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like he literally had one hand on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steering wheel and one and the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hand on the horn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's how often he was tapping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it man oh my god i had never like feared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go to chinese driving school they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like right so roll the window down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty so you get rid of the shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make sure your hand is always on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle steering is optional </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jesus christ oh my god i mean you told </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> us about the story before about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the situation that was not wiping right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i've just had weird taxi jobs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just asia seems to have some weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] time that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just asian driving rules yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why like you were talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bad taxi experiences in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for for like i don't think i've had even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bad mediocre experience in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everything is just good got the job done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if anything the best taxi has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have been in like countries like japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan right yeah everything's meted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to worry about tipping or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like that i mean sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan has been the only country where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wish tipping culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i've i wanted to tip that taxi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> driver who took me on a tour of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different wineries yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that i'm like please give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like let me give you extra money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we were all fully prepared to like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> tonight treat yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly get something nice exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like speaking of like giving like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five stars and one stars and stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that have you ever talked about what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the reviewing mentality is here in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it just tells us everything it's i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> noticed that right away when i moved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah how like nothing on amazon is above </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four stars yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not just not on amazon like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything on like google google maps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and stuffing if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like hardly anything is above four stars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like mostly is then it's only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two reviews right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also like they have a so they do use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> google reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh mainly for like restaurants and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's also a thing called table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> log </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they like a lot of people who think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their food critics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use and it's just it's it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yelp of japan basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's insane because it's like these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people review </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these food restaurants and like three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stars for a restaurant is considered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's like it's done it it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> impressive because i remember when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first moved to japan and whenever you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> look up restaurants on google </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd see like three 3.5 stars maybe the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> occasional four yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and in england or in america when i see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a three-star restaurant i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yo something's gone wrong if it's below </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a four then i'm just like something's up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone found a rat in their food or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something man like i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand yeah i don't understand what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's like do the japanese think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the stars on google reviews like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> michelin stars like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i mean i understand it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they actually i i respect that they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a mentality where they literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every star in the review system right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like the male review </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right where anything below like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure like now below seven is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm pretty sure like mao users don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize that like under five stars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um because it's either like seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um six is really bad six is really bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five is the most awful animation ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i the way i imagine it is like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would i tell the owner if he was right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of me now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right would i genuinely sit there and be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is a three-star experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know what i mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because yeah how are you going to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that to the poor guys you should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> run a business right yeah because to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know if i go somewhere i really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the food i have nothing bad about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how in good faith can i be like yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't deserve five stars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because there was nothing wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with it like this was exactly what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i got what i needed yeah it wasn't fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dining it wasn't crazy but like there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh sorry i was going to say like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing i want to ask about these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> super harsh japanese reviews right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what is a five star yeah yeah it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you want to blow job from the share </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause this is like this is also another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you how can you judge really a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant the same way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mcdonald's yeah because like because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what was what i was going to say is even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the fine dining restaurants are the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story yeah yeah that's because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expect a fine dining experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so if they get the fine dining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's standard that's standard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've done the job and so that makes me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wonder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] would a fine dining </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant have to do to get a four or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> five star man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it blows my mind because like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i said like comparing mcdonald's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fine dining experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they really shouldn't be on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same scale right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're totally different things yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like so when you go to mcdonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you judging about mcdonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you judging the place the food what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you judging because the food isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going to change really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's probably not going to be any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different the only thing that determines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a good mcdonald's experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or a bad one is like how fast the food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> costs yeah this is what i see on google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reviews i'll see a two star mcdonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'll see a four star and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not like ultimately i cannot tell the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> difference yes it might be dirtier i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three less fries than i ordered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what confuses me because then i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i'm also like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if i rate this mcdonald's a five star </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh what am i rating it a five star on am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i rating it on a five star because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to other mcdonald's compared to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a bigger question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is who the [ __ ] is raiding mcdonald's on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> google </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> because like oh they're paying for those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reviews yeah yeah true because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember when i was buying a like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going back last week buying a bed i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could not find a bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over like three stars on amazon i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't either i remember that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there was no bed that was about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three stars and i'm like who how many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problems people having with beds and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would go to the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reviews to read what they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saying and they were all saying that the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> build was too long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was the problem that sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like your problem i've had i've had some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of the most pedantic reviews on japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> amazon i've had like someone one-star </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> product because the packaging was bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah completely fine the packaging was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bit off so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like once that's what drives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me insane is that they they almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always review the [ __ ] around what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're actually reviewing yeah like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the delivery man had a bad attitude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] like i if the package is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little beat up but the thing's totally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fine yeah fantastic are you gonna throw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out the packaging anyway yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't give a [ __ ] like as long as i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can use the thing i need so what like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this shouldn't be a blight on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company that send me it like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] absurd i guess i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually brought it up to chris as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well because i was confused and chris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was telling me that ryotaro told him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three is like what you expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is good and then five is like like above </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and beyond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so he has to go to get five stars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it has to be beyond exception like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> beyonce </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas i think for me five stars should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be like all right this is what i paid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for yeah gave me exactly what i asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for no problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lifestyles i don't know weird weird i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guess it's difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you guys feel about seasonal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> products here in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know every country in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world has like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seasonal products and stuff but i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah japan take it to the next level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas half the shelf sometimes i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like seasonal products yeah every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything is seasonal everything is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> premium as well i mean i i get it now i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> meant i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember they would talk about it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> animes they were like the enemies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like you don't know the pain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until your favorite item has been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> removed from the combini yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i feel that because i saw that as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well so many items that i just liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason the the what the items </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i specifically like would just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> randomly get removed yeah from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely yeah yeah i'd be like i'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll be back next week not gonna lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> every time i walk into a corn beanie and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i see something is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> new yeah i'm just like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i might grab one of those yeah i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to try it i don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> get attached yeah that's exactly that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly how i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling i've been like so many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living in japan i go to a company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i try out this new like oh this like new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> product that's only available for spring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like the spring special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> winter special products try it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely love it and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a few months later it just got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disappointing i'm like [ __ ] man i want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've given me a craving and you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> removed the craving and now i'm gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all year for it to maybe come back yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for it to maybe come back because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> might not even come back i hate that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they like bring out like a new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> strong zero flavor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm just like man this is way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better than the standard flavors too bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's only around for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two weeks and i'll never see it again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> once it's gone because it's not just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like items sometimes there's like menu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> items on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on in like restaurants yeah only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> available during certain seasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i feel the biggest problem with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is that the one thing in japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like especially supermarkets and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurants they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> love to do that whole like seasonal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> premium [ __ ] is with fruits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh god right we've gone out we've ranted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about for sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like i remember like i went to uh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no i was a royal host i went to a royal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> host and they were doing this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seasonal thing with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> grapes right like the green grapes oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like the muskets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i tried a few of them because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like green grapes and i was like oh this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> went back the next week and it was gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like [ __ ] hell this is really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> premium isn't it it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i swear it was only on the menu for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> three days and it's just gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i swear they they take like limited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time sales to like another level here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like a lot of things are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very limited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's a limited edition something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's limited edition products i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know one can argue that that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very good marketing it is very good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people will look at something premium </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> being like well i guess if i can only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get it now i should get it now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is it is kind of cool going into a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place and just having stuff be new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly but then there is also the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fact that like yeah i did really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this one thing and you took it away from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i'm sorry it's like the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing whenever you travel to a new like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prefecture or something and there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every pre like we talked about before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every prefecture has a specialty and an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> item you can only get in that prefecture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every prefecture will tell you that this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the best rice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah in japan so every prefecture will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tell you it's all the [ __ ] so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely living in japan i've tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more like i've gone out of my comfort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zone with trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new products and new suites and new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> views and everything but at the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time i've just found more cravings that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't get on a normal basis anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's only available from a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> certain preference what was the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maple cakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that we bought from yeah the manju that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we bought from like hiroshima oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah those were so [ __ ] good yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> problem is you can only buy them in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hiroshima so it's just like cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not really a sweet person but then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah we bought those and i ate one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i want to eat all of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like this stuff that i thought yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> only bought a tiny bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could have gotten the pack of 24 but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i got the pack of eight but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never know sometimes you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go you try out this new thing you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's all right it's it's mid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's whatever right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but sometimes you find that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing product and you're like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but then but then on the contrary isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it amazing when you find that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> regional thing that you think you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never gonna see in tokyo and then just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one random shop sells it yeah yeah man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah like i remember like uh in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tochigi for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they have this thing called lemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> milk yeah which i [ __ ] love and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a regional specific thing for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> longest time and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well [ __ ] i gotta make a trip up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tortugi every time i want this yeah so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would always buy it in bulk when i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> come back home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but of course it doesn't last right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then the craving comes back and i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] progressions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then i remember uh i walked into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a random company once and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just selling it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and it was like [ __ ] oh it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] el dorado you know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the secret was here all along [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bought all that [ __ ] and brought it back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like all right no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put it on google maps this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> company that sells the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the lemon milk man the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sapporo special um thingy beer what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it what's it called again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sapporo beer no no no no it's uh what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the prefecture called hokkaido yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we forgot for a second there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah hokkaido the sapporo beer is way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> better when they have like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sapporo actual sapporo beer yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah this is so good i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bring so much back but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's heavy does it actually make a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference i genuinely think it tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really better yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's weird i think sapporo in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes worse than i remember it tasting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> abroad i don't know it's it's it's weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's cause i have it way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> often now but when i had sapporo like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on tap somewhere else i was like oh this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is so much better than the beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we that the other yeah yeah but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's because you're comparing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to other beers right like i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> asahi tasting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> infinitely better in australia yeah now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it tastes [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but now i'm more scared to go back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia and have the [ __ ] beer in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> australia i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if i think osaki is mid now which used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like god tea before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't want to drink a vb right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like i feel like i'm gonna throw up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> drinking that [ __ ] because i can't </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know uh group you can imagine like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> young girls old men </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> just really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] strong it's basically okinawan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vodka that's the only way to describe it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i i forget sometimes about the public </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drinking lawsuit </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah they're not soft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the difference because that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soft biscuit to us because we have these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things eating rocks for harvesting we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have these things called anzac cookies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> rocks like i don't want to have too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> break teeth you're trying to eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to have to worry that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a cookie if i have to worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> breakfast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a cookie if i have to worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> breaking my goddamn teeth it's not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] cookie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> antic biscuits are [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australians watching this one though as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> biscuits are [ __ ] awesome it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds like a health hazard it is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> health hazard because it sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like chewing it's like dude you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work out your jawline eating this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] cookie like it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tough we had these growing up i still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have these in the uk obviously but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're called digestives did you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suggestions digestive biscuits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> digestives yeah they're called they're i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized that they're not appealing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i realize that's not very fitting yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were awful like nevertheless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> biscuit you can get and it's got like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> soft layer of chocolate covered on top </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and the chocolate is [ __ ] chocolate yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the biscuit is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just dry like a milk biscuit or no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's like a wheat biscuit yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what it looks like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh god that doesn't look good at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're supposed to like dip it with tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh coffee and stuff like that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then sometimes you dip it in your hot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tea and it falls apart and your [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teeth ruined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but you can do that with a tim tam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well i don't want to put anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i guess there's too much chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to put in the tv there needs to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a perfect chocolate ratio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate to biscuit ratio because tim </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like covered in chocolate right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's too much chocolate starts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> melting on your fingers as you dip it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and see that's that's like you've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had you've never done a tim tam straw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that's like a thing that you did in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia so it's always like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't got a flip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kangaroo here's something there's some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australian culture for you all right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like usually you do with a cup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of tea or a cup of coffee whatever you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prefer you get a team time you bite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> both ends off right and then you use it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as a straw to suck up your tea and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's [ __ ] awesome is this some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> down under jokes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when is something a culture and when is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just like stupid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's what we do that's what some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do i did it once and i was like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's cool i don't do it every time but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a little thing you can do yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> um we gotta find our own fun in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> australia right there isn't a lot to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly all right but yeah i've like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't like biscuits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at all no it's definitely like the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i'm not really fond of cookies either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think cookies are over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just because uk cookies are just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> uk the the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> store brand cookies are always [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fresh cookies out the oven when they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they need to be soft and chewy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i hate is if i bite on a cookie and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it crunches it goes everywhere yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and crumbs annihilate them if i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crumbs </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> excuse me because you know you grow up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the uk you're watching american </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> they're like let's just substitute with </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> i'm i'm having i'm having a good day and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you eat all of the like lint package in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one go because i can't like because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like i need a palette cleanser </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time i have like a rich chocolate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give me the the wine to go with it yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sir to empty the flavor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have i have a like a problem where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have one it's enough you have a sweet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tooth though don't you i do not have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sweet tooth [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only in japan actually only in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because here's the thing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i hardly ever used to snack i either i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either was that guy in england who would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eat a tub of ice cream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or not i'll go over that sweets for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two weeks like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i there was no between for me like only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have i ever like kind of embraced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snacking culture and that's just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are so many different kinds of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sweets and snacks here yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like kind of want to try something i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used to be a sweets guy back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia but then when i moved here i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realized that japan's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> snack or like confectionery section </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> savory [ __ ] yeah that just tastes way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better than the sweet [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm just i always just go for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> savory [ __ ] now it's easier to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes good that's sweet though you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] put a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but i also feel gross after eating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it right because if you ever come to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> house in england if you ask for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything that's not savory snack i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> probably not gonna have it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if i do have a lint like like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a lint box that's gone in like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> few hours most of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's because i rarely buy but when i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doing i'm like i'm like super craving it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i mean i haven't had a ferrero rocher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like probably like a year and a half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe do they sell them in japan oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do yeah yeah yeah you never see that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you go to like uh uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> international shops </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like they'll have it yeah oh because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in in the uk that was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not expensive it's like the the if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to look expensive but not actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spend too much money for error or shares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds fancy but the only thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't fancy is like the price tag i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're expensive but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to like lin to lenore or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that right i've had some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super super you talking about lint and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ferro russia being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've really liked deep taste i've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like shows aren't that intense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've i've had some like the super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive chocolates are the ones i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to do you you're going you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on a [ __ ] battle with taking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your bite out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> forever shares like the premium </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like yeah it tastes like [ __ ] ash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you like dark chocolate i do but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a limit like right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like ninety percent couch yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you'll go to play in these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolatier places and they'll be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's amazing isn't it and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eighty percent like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you're like yeah that's great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's good sometimes i have like one bite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like oh i gotta [ __ ] battle this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm having a [ __ ] battle with my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mouth like trying to get this down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i get it if i was having like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> espresso or something to go with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah perfect like they'll wash each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other out and you know i'll feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happy but when you have one bite of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super dark chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it [ __ ] stays with you for the rest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the day yeah it does like think you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can't you cannot get the taste out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i don't want to feel like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just bleached my mouth i've never </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> like anything else actually really it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with coffee it's like the best yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta have it with the coffee i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eat chocolate that's just with a hot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i find it because for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like coffee and tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just like by itself i've never tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if you dip something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the tea that root that kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i eat it you eat it when you drink it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a palate cleanser yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if your mouth's too chocolatey you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> keep eating more chocolate i might want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to give that a go then because i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only never thought to combine the two no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i never yeah i never thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it chocolate and tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like unspeakable like because chocolate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> has always been a snack for me </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i actually like didn't start enjoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wine because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid or like as as like a teenager i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would say wine was like the one alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i just couldn't get into yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't understand why people liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wine and then i remember the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> red wine or good red wine with good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> steak and it was just like an instant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> eye-opening moment for me man i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's be honest you can't you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really enjoy wine unless you're a bit of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a disposable income really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i don't know about you growing up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but parents were like think that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> waste of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you're here even before whenever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you've got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like your family or you're like one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your rich you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> relatives whatever you try this try this </SPEAKER_00>
