<SPEAKER_04> I look completely different oh yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanted to point that out I know we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like brushed over that but uh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friendship with Joey the anime man has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> ended I'm Joss the mongolad now yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look like the hacker character in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movie that doesn't want to explain how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the hacking works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> am I going like crazy or is like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> internet gotten like the worst in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the past five years am I crazy I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think you're crazy at all I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gotten significantly worse no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole internet but the way as in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the level of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up [ __ ] yeah maybe that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> messed there was a lot of messed up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like you know five six years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever but like I feel like now it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all just out there I feel like it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's so interesting how it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost like an opposite effect that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> happening like for somehow for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason even though the internet or the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> internet culture and people on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> internet in the past five six years have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotten more PC than ever before and yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like almost counterintuitively there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> more [ __ ] up [ __ ] that has like come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out onto the surface as well I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I'm like retaliation yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know yeah you see the more because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like like I've seen I I see [ __ ] now on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like regular Twitter and Instagram that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you'd only ever find on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] B board yeah it's weird man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're just like I'm I'm I weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for for being like middle ground on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like I feel like I have very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normal opinions yeah but the more I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> online I'm like am I am I not normal do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I have not normal opinions yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what is a normal yeah yeah just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being I feel like being fair I'm like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really have heavy opinions on well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I see other people I'm like oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah I mean Common Sense has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely become less common artificial </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's weird I mean I don't know what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> common sense anymore yeah it does feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like is is this the point where you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the where the older generation starts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking about [ __ ] talking the newer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> generation you know what I mean like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> these damn kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did you ever think like you do this is I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's the opposite I I think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because the internet in general has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> become more accessible to every age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> group that are seeing all of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because before it was just it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like 20 year olds who who gave enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] to go on yeah like social media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and I felt that it was a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exciting time and everyone was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really into it and you know and new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> websites the new hipster Miniclip was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still thriving you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Farmville was still going strong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> um Mafia City uh I'm just gonna keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> naming good old days I feel like now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's become so normalized and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone uses it yeah like do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember do you remember a point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it felt like there was a separation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between what you did on the internet and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what happened in real life oh absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like when that barrier kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like kind of like got broken where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you felt like what happened in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> internet was like was pertaining to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your active your your at your how can I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say this because like isn't that is real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> life but it didn't feel so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> suffocating yeah you know it didn't feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it didn't feel like you had a yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a tangible effects on your you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your day-to-day life but now it feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like whatever's going on in the internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever's going on in the world has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this tangible effect to this tangible uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the tangible effect on what's going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in you know what you're doing you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just explained the plot to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> serial experiments Lane like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the time you think it is I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> curious if you have the same opinion on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this would you what you said the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when it felt like that became the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when it fell I became like I feel it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depends on how long you've been on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> internet right like yeah did you ever do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Myspace uh no I came right after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had Bieber I did that was very popular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in League yeah okay yeah would you would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you say like so like the bibo in Myspace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here right it's like roughly the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time I would say yeah right like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you were on bibo and when people on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> MySpace were on MySpace did you see that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as like this is me like completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible is a game right yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like how I go into Sims and I make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> myself look attractive I think yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like that's how I kind of traded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Myspace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah it's it's like I I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think what really uh the first time I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really thought of social media as a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was actually uh so Charlie Brooker do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know Charlie Brooker he wrote Black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mirror yeah so like a few years ago or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe even a decade ago I can't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how old this video is he did like a top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 50 most influential games of like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time and uh like number one was Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that like and and I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you talking about Charlie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Brooker because before that he talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about you know games like that's not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> game Last of Us [ __ ] Tetris you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> all these games and none and he was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like well think about it you play as an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> avatar on an online platform where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gain points for interacting with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> game and I'm just like yeah I mean he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind he's very right he's like social </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> media at this point is a game and we are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the game now is our job you know it it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is our job because we're falling right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the system we are we are part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the system guys we can't criticize the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> system because we are the system we are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the system we are part of the system but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that that is definitely how social media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has become and I mean like in a way like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see especially like YouTube and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like a kind of like a game I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been it's been gamified to [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> post a video of this game you post a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> video and it even puts you on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Leaderboard on like how well he has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> performed in like in the past 10 uploads </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you've done but but the game the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stakes to it or whatever you give it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like a game is it's the same with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anything right like it you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> jumping whatever whatever it is it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game only in zero days the the game only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> means whatever you you assign to it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right so if you with the videos right if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're making these videos for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> purpose of of cracking that one out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> ten then yeah if you're making the video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because you want to make a video and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think it would though it's a game yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you get to that point it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like like you're kind of testing the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> limits on what you can call a game right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know is the stock market a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah well yeah some people will say yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your life some people say yes some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people say no it's it's roulette with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> extra steps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really it's we're all like with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive repercussions let's rule out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's a really really boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> option that will probably pay you back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you can spin the wheel yeah spin the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wheel spin the wheel good coin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like deal or no deal but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually serious yeah I felt like the I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know when the internet started to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> become very very real if you will yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh but it definitely jacked up to 100 at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 2016. I think that was when it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely like what 2016. schedule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> election huh first presidential uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Trump's presidential election I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's when it just went boom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when like the two the split went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like crazy I felt like the the left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> leading internet right-wing internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just went really full-on I think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might fall I think it might be earlier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [Applause] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube Rewind started becoming [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know because it was that like 24 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 2014. okay oh yeah yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just thinking yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as in when everything on the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stopped being universally loved yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah basically when we started like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being segmented I guess I I just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just going I just tried to verbalize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how I felt I'm just like kind of feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the same time that I stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving a [ __ ] about YouTube Rewind yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that kind of feels like it was 2014 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 2013 maybe something like that very like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very early on when I stopped when the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the internet stopped being like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conglomeration and just because and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> see things happening and you just didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recognize who this person was who that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> person was people stopped getting along </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh and you know factions and groups </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> started to form and uh yeah but that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I took something like the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> presidential election which is like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most uh televised horse race in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> existence yeah it's like it's so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know other countries we don't you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the UK it's like yeah we have this whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing about who the new prime minister </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to be but yeah we don't nearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like make it as exciting you know as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> America does America's so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt like it was the perfect event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was so polarizing and so well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> telegraphed with so much information in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many parties putting stuff into it I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think regardless of your opinion on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and who you voted for I'll give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] I'm just saying you can't ignore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fact that this was a thing that just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really took the internet and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ran I think it's also around the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time roughly when like a lot of social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> media sites were like just where that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of discussion was just becoming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more open like that was roughly around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the time where like Twitter increased </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their like character limit yes people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like so people you know could only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tweet about like Yay Obama won and that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was it and now it was like let me write </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a full [ __ ] novel about how I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about this presidential election and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you know this is when they also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> after that is when the platform started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having to correct misinformation yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that further caused more of a device </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and then now there's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely different platforms for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> different opposing views so now you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't even get you don't even get to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hear the other side yeah I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what was so prevalent about just not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the presidential election but just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that year in general was that it felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that was the real turning point for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where social media kind of felt just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a TV show it was like a part of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment right where the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> presidential uh election is the most is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best rated TV show of all time I'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> probably say yeah everyone Tunes in to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch the next episode yeah I mean like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean it even had Like A build-up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season though which was uh brexit right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had like the mid-season is that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pilot episode that was the mid-season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> twist right we had the mid-season twist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we're like guys this show can't get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any better there's no possible way they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can surprise me but jokes on you you'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> never expect what comes next okay just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] look right look at the how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they decide the nominee for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presidential thing look at that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's laid out like Who Wants To Be A </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Millionaire yeah they're in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> semi-circle with all this amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] TV show s Britain's Got Talent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> background and they all take turns a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive audience and [ __ ] what is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] yeah like what who gives you let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the party pick and then we'll [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decide who wins this this whole thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so reality TV show-ass yeah it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bizarre like when you sit down and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like what am I watching like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is this is [ __ ] up yeah like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's a question do you think that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people cared about politics as much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before and we were just like too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ignorant because we were like too young </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the time or do you think people care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more now because of the prevalence of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> social media and just so many people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> verbalizing their opinions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think it has to do with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amount of people caring I think it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has to do with how much we are just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exposed to it now yeah so I I think one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the main things here is that you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to bear in mind as well that I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like with with the internet this is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giving everyone the platform yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like before if you're one of the if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanted to get support as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> politician you had to go on like a TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> show and then say something right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or if you're in Japan you blare out of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] megaphone in the Stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyingly so like now it's like okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you have like the kind of Perfect Storm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now there's more ways to to discuss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's on the internet not even 40 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 50 year olds are on the internet so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're willing to listen to you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> combine that with the fact that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> become really easy to give politics a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of tribalism with nothing to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with it right so the whole vaccination </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing or whatever and all that nonsense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nonsense but the whole argument around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah yeah it very quickly stopped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> becoming about the science and more just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about like which horse are you backing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so I feel like now it's became </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> political it's gotten really easy to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just assign identities to certain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> political views yeah and this is how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> politicians have realized that they can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> push their agenda is by just giving it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like are you a real American then you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believe in this right it's like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about you just if you push it used to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> before I felt like it was just about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more so it was like this is the policy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is what we're going to do and now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like all right we have to give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything a meaning you're either with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> us or you're not here's here's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meaning between it and all that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] I could explain this better if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was more eloquent with my words but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately that isn't the case I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean they did that subtly with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holobola crisis right that was the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> same thing like it suddenly became like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you with us or are you not with us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you care about these people then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> should be with me it's like but it's got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing to do with it in one case sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the Ebola stuff like what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> do you mean well like it very quickly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> became like especially in America became </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a political drive right for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the campaigns and whatnot and it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like well oh that's it yeah oh I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember it absolutely did and then when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the actual election finished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone stop talking about it because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's as if it had nothing to do with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> American elections yeah because I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just it's much easier instead of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> proving yourself right to prove the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other person wrong oh yeah by proving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the other person wrong you're in a sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> proving yourself right even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not how it works at all you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like when did uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when did like Ben Shapiro start owning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people with facts and Logics all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like that's when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> started you know at the same time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> believe yeah yeah when it was when it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't about being involved in politics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just like you know you start off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching someone else just like owning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other people when they're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> logistical like logical arguments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever you know it became part of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment it was like the what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this guy the proved me wrong guy oh um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I like that as well just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] exploded out of nowhere too yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's weird how seeing the seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these waves come up first it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you have the group that proves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the other group wrong and then and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after a while people get bored of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it's like people proving that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> group wrong and it's just it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's a constant you know it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a constant ping pong [ __ ] yeah as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well you know there's it's information </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> on a lot of things there's always way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more nuanced than people want to to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into right so a lot of the time if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just take one correct argument or one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> correct fact about a flawed argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> right you can just run with that and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> push that and say like look this is this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is right even though in in context it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> might be incorrect but you can just keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> running with something that that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know that you you can power and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> safe to do so yeah and even then even if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're wrong it doesn't matter because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as we've learned is that if you're a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> narcissist and you're willing to not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> give a [ __ ] if people are trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cancel you yeah uh people have really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people have learned that canceling only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does [ __ ] if you give a [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people are being rewarded in Mass uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know and a lot of those people like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that who uh even though they get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong as long as they don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just make something new or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't mention it and just continue on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't matter you get what you want you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get your platform you can continue you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can get new followers oh you lost you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lost a few hundred followers oh you'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> get a new thousand who cares yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly it's like negative it's there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never been more of a time when I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realized that you know bad was it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bad press or bad like there is no such </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thing as bad bad press bad press yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's as bad as you you give a [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the thing is as well as a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people have realized a lot of you see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this on YouTubers aren't influencers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's as bad as you let it seem it is as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well so if you're like you know that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why a lot of the scandals around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the presidential election that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in 2016. a lot of them because if the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy who you're supporting is like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not a big deal yeah then maybe you'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh it's not it's not a big deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I guess not yeah yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's kind of there is a kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it's as bad as they let it seem right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah if you address it'd be like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> give a [ __ ] or you don't even bother to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> address it then you know yeah I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I mean I think I think you're right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a sense and I I feel like even more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so was when it was like when Trump got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> elected like you know regardless of your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> opinion you know of him as a president </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or me as an outsider who is you know not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any part of American politics it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost like watching a character in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show you know like like see like going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on your Twitter timeline and seeing some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of the stuff that he's cartoon villain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah like remember like the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> conf [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that shows like I don't care what where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you lie in the political Spectrum I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think we can all unanimously agree that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> called fifth was [ __ ] hilarious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah it kind of like well I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what the right word is but I kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like cartoonified [ __ ] yeah kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cartoonified your you know your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real life and you know the world events </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though even though there is you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know even though these were real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prevalent issues and he's had a real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cartoon about it these had these had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real tangible effect on the world and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like especially a lot of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> younger generation who you know who have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grown up in the age of the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um that's that's kind of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> environment they've grown into you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where where everything when it's seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> through a phone or through you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through uh with through a tablet they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like it's like suddenly not real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because we're like we were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what 20 plus when all this started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> happening oh no yeah 20 uh yeah maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just nine I was like 19. but like I've I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't imagine going from like 12 to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like 18. yeah and this has been your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like entire memory yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's really pissing off yeah crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know we know we talk about it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the podcast or political views or our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> political opinions because I I the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part I don't give a [ __ ] what you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe in yeah yeah exactly I have my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> own opinions but I'm also not I'm not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't think I'm some kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> benevolent man who knows all yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I know that I have probably have come to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conclusions on things with through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flawed like uh thinking methodology </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever the [ __ ] you say just because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of how I've been raised right and you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been raised whatever way you have and if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you disagree with me on things I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give a [ __ ] how you came back religion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna judge you I feel like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the biggest problems that's come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all this is that everyone's calling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> each other stupid for believing in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something and I'm like I'm sure you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a reason if we if we just spoke to each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other normally and didn't polarize each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> other all the [ __ ] time just you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> agree to disagree right it's like we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> not here to [ __ ] like you know dangle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] carrot in front of your face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like believe us because we we hold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the truth and it's like no no one does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it sucks as well because obviously with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole chronovirus stuff and that all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got politicized of course yeah of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it did that unfortunately came at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cost of people's lives yeah and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people who felt they were right felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so strongly they were right because they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought that you know they're like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to protect people and yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's fair enough but it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult to convince people when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> calling them stupid yes it's been shown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it doesn't work no no no I mean I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think another big massive thing with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> age of the Internet is just like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] overload of information right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where where it's like I remember a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you you know read something in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> book or read a newspaper or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know you you'd kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> educate yourself but it feels like there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just so much information right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I don't even know what information </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the right information to educate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> myself right right so what are the times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so many times I look at something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> online and I think like oh man this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of interesting piece of information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a couple of hours later I found out it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> total [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you even you hear about a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> story or an event and you're like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> man that [ __ ] it's like crazy like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I get told by like five or six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different people being like have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seen this thing and I'm like well [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's five or six people around me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I know yeah and I understand yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who's telling me that this is happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then it must be true and I'm like turns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out nope all [ __ ] when you were a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kid right did you think that people were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you think that you're like too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> smart in what context just in general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like as a kid I was one of those little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids that just thought like in school I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think I half the reason I was angry half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the time right so I thought like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so dumb I'm smarter than all this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right I can't even remember I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to play video games I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really oh [ __ ] I didn't feel that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> strongly about things and so I I I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I thought as a kid I just thought I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was smarter than people around me right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right I think everyone had that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> phase though right right but I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people don't grow out some people don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grow up some people grow don't grow out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it obviously yeah because it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting because I was just scrolling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on Reddit yeah God forbid and I I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this and it was like a post where I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think everyone else is dumb and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's infuriating having to talk to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people right yeah and then it was really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting seeing how people were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to reply to this and kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> break it down and ultimately and I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think this is really good and I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone should keep this in mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we judge people based on how they speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not how their level of intelligence is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right and I feel like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely happens on the podcast I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen it in the comment section where we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might have a bad take or we might badly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explain something yeah and everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like well Connor's dumb or Jerry's dumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God's damn he couldn't explain this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like it's it's so hard to grasp we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only can interact with people based on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the things they say right not how they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think because you're probably thinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about things way deeper than you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ever explain oh yeah about it right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so hard to get that out of your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> head when someone's talking to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you you have to you only have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that to work I mean it's a skill and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why like I have trouble properly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> expressing myself unless it's written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down yeah which is why I script right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right because we can't do on the podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately but like uh and we can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like edit it either so like that's why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I I know for a fact that I express </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> myself best in like text form or like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> written form but but also on the podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you're quite eloquent with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> way you word things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there has been several points well I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look at myself arguing an argument and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like I'm a [ __ ] clown I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> deserve to be [ __ ] loud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> trash takes comments it's been like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> a normal thing where they'll be like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get what Connor's saying but he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> explained it badly yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm extremely guilty of that I I do that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot and there are a lot of things that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I try to explain but in the moment it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just hard to get the worst because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't come into this it's not a debate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't script this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I get what you mean but you probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should have double checked this like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> whole uh the [ __ ] the food illness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing it's like yeah if you give me 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes in a room alone I could probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prepare a decent argument yeah however I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't yeah yeah but if it gave me time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put it in an essay form oh I'm sure I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could tell you this is how real life is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's weird because I feel like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watch people as well speak and again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is this is going back to how just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> general life again this this ties into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the previous topics with the online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right how we respond to people who have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or it might be uh have bad opinions on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things we observe to be bad opinions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's so hard in this current </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> climate online to just give people the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> benefit of the doubt and just be like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think you mean well and I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this this opinion you have that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could be hurting people I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you genuinely want to hurt people yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could be like you just have a bat you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just you have been misinformed and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> believe it yeah you genuinely think this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is helping people that's that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem though is that like I feel you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know a lot of social media like Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Reddit stuff like that is like 99 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> emotionally driven yeah right because of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just Humanity yeah that too but also you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know a lot a lot of people like to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like oh I see this massive post on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know massive comment replying to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain [ __ ] take on Reddit right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they think like oh judging from the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> length of this whole thing this must be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a very well thought well written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> argument 90 of the time no it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> emotionally just it's emotional drivel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's unfortunately how the nature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of a lot of these internet arguments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah work right it's so depressing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like even when you go on the Reddit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like look at it and it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone will say something that's being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> correct and it'll just immediately turn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> into like argument yeah yeah it's like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like what why do you want to do this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like no one's [ __ ] citing their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sources in these kinds of comment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sections it's all it's all emotional </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I mean like that's I mean that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just how humans are like always and yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why like that's why I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally try to get involved on like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> platform like Twitter because like I do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you think anyone's ever changed their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] mind from like a single tweet or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like or like a Twitter discussion I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> don't I can't see it happening I'd love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to meet someone who's like you know I </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> isn't it [ __ ] up that like a PornHub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comment section is more chill than like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a YouTube comment section I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you it's to have to interact in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a community you have to have a level of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> self-awareness I think oh yeah yeah so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think that's where it comes from it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yours are so self-aware that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just don't give a [ __ ] anymore and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's when you're most designed yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah well basically it's it's a massive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> barrier of Entry just to sign up an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> account to a porn site right that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> level that I just haven't been able to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't want to give my my Gmail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want to be at that morning where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like I wake up in the morning like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making a pornography right the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trash taste segue ever by the way can I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say that that we've gone from like very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> serious topics to signing up to a pawn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what kind of person is like I need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just have my say in this I gotta have my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta make it known I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's steps because I've never signed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up for a PornHub account yeah and I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for like hentai sites right right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I have Yeah because sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you find like a like a lit hentai like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> want to remember this because I'm going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to forget the name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a free-to-play user of the the porn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Universe I will say that he's the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> annoying thing is trying to find a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I did enjoy yeah because because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the problem is you know after you do the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deed you just you're not interested in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it anymore so you're like I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] need this anymore and then you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like it just goes out the recesses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of your mind and like [ __ ] a week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> later you're like yo what was that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] A-Class hentai there is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sobering moment when you're trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> type in the keywords to find the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and you're like I'm disgusting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just scrolling through these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> videos trying to find it you're like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no there's something wrong with me I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> gone to a point where I've like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anonymously gone into forums and asked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's your profile pic I'm not telling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you do you know what Anonymous it's got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be Joey I want it to be yeah yeah no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one would ever expect the Joey to use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his actual profile picture on the Forum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's true but now everyone's going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like I was yeah because I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I didn't know anyone at the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and I was in the exact same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> situation where I was like I just saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this thing but it was on incognito </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no I don't remember what it was called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all I remember is like what the girl oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my God if you could log in do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the login information did you still use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this account no not anymore I don't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think the website exists anymore yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that is the one problem with incognito </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> mode is that it doesn't give you a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> search history yeah or a like or like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> history like the moment the post not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Clarity hits and you close that window </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> depends because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hentai and stuff it's different yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normal one I don't know what would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compel me to want to pay </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] credit cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> see that feels like such a you know when </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah how many only fans was these like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sub two all right yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> had a porn addiction yes yes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah I don't remember who it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was I do remember yeah that sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> familiar it's like the most Chad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTuber apology not apology videos yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was like he was never accused of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anything he just came out he's like guys </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> like yeah well it was like literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ruining his life right yeah well it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those things that I can always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> die I always [ __ ] say it's one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> those things I gotta stop saying that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor this is a message you stop saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of those questions it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> literally my question for you I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's one of those uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that people talk about and oh sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people do not talk about it now yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it it's one of those things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people don't want to give credit to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or talk about it because it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really embarrassing oh yeah of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there was your credit to how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> debilitating it can be to have that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have it man I hope you can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> help I hope you can get out of it no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shame to you man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's because it's something that's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like it doesn't seem like on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Forefront of things you should be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worried about you know like like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you can easily it's it's easy to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> able to justify to yourself oh yeah a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gambling addiction of course that's bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like an active ruins your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or like an alcohol addiction right I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of destroying my body I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> destroying all my relationships around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> me like a porn addiction because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> porn is so secretive anywhere you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really have anyone to talk to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it about it's not it's not an immediate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> threat I think is the thing because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you hear about it's like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course I watch porn I'm an adult it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone does it it's fine you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone most people are normal living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> normal lives you know while watching and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then you know you go down the rabbit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hole deep enough and you realize oh it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> actually [ __ ] like we're just as bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> at which point do you like accept that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is an addiction and not just like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recreational activity that everyone does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is it the hours spent consuming that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> medium or is it the money spent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> consuming that medium or is it both I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know is it when you can't think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anything other than Paul because no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one wants to help people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> addicted to porn because I don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a a thing yeah because they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like just just stop watching it oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just stop jacking off just close your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eyes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so put your dick away it's easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to me like I guess I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the actual definition of addiction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is but I guess when you should start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being worried about it is when it has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I guess like a a tangible effect on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe your life yeah or in some way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shape from people like like affecting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> negatively yeah yeah that's it a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tangible negative effect on your life or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an aspect of your life but then again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when does it become a negative </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> effect and when does it because just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> become like oh yeah I just had a weak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> binge drinking with the boys because we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were like partying a week you know like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like at which point does it become a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> negative effect I don't know I guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the hard thing about it I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's when it's I think in my opinion I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's when it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consistently for a long period of time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's consistently just adding on to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a negative effect I think that's when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> becomes like a problematic addiction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like you can like as you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you could have like a week being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> range of like drinking from morning till </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> night with your boys right yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're most likely not going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking for a while after that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that I wouldn't count that as an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> addiction like that's like a short-term </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like binge that's just destroying your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> body yeah that's just that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> destroying your body having a good time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boys right but like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's like a constant amount every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> day or you know for a long period of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time consistently yeah and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> getting worse and worse and worse and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> worse I think that's when it's like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay you should probably seek help kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of thing that in my opinion I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's when you sign up to a PornHub </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> account it's when you you're like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know what I need people to know how I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feel about that [ __ ] scene like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's so good I need upvotes on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> PornHub </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the one thing I don't understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand like I I the thing about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> PornHub comments is that I understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people asking about like say [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Call of Duty's tactics or like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how to get past this level uh rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than people actually yeah rather than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people actually commenting on the pawn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> itself like to me for some reason reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't know why you would ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> comment on like a porno right as like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're either like watching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're actively involved or like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never gotten to a point where I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching this I'm just like I want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> verbalize what I think what do people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> think about this what I think about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know my favorites are the ones that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are just like just so simple like so so </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah I don't know it's like for me it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like I'm given like this you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> job right like like youtubing and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like being on social media where it's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> this isn't gonna [ __ ] affect yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know my videos right like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't affect my job yeah it's just a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> matter of like personal preference so in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my head it's like why if I'm given this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opportunity where I can kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experiment with how I look and it not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really affect my job you know maybe it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might even affect it positively for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why wouldn't I try it it's like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like with my hair for instance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like if you hate this hair just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait a month it'll go back to normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna go back to the length you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comfortable with it's fine but it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know why would I not give it a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but also I feel like a lot of that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just people not being used to a look or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a new yeah of course because I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> remember like like I remember when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first started growing out like a stubble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's like oh you look weird as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] and even I did I thought man I look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] weird I look [ __ ] weird as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] with just a stubble because I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never had a stubble or I've never like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grown out a stubble in my life even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though I've always known I could and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember like I was like working on uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my latest Vlog and I was looking at you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know I was looking at my uh my trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> taste video where I talk about trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taste and then uh I was looking at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> previous Vlog I did before I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recording this one and it was the BBC </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> video that I did without a stubble and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like man I look [ __ ] weird like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now I think I look weird without a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stubble and I look back at all trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taste episodes and I'm like man I look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> really weird I don't know dude like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you like go back to like episode one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> trash days and I'm in a [ __ ] ponytail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my God I completely fine if I look at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that and I'm like you look homeless I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so glad I don't look like this anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but back then everyone was like yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus here dude it looks [ __ ] sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and back then I was like yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know what it kind of looks sick not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna lie but now I'm just like no it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it it really got to the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I knew it was gross when like even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Aki's mom who is like the most like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] accepting like kind like nervous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a bad thing about anything just one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> day was like I think you should cut your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like if you're saying that maybe I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> should yeah I think maybe I should the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mom not my own yeah I feel like I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I needed to hear that though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like that's probably how dire I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> looked because like now now I know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she means I look back and then I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know what if I if I saw a guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that who I cared about I'd probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell him to cut his hair too yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's kind of gross but it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I don't know it's like even with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the piercings as well it's like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surprising how a lot of people are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh I thought your ears were already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pissed yeah and it was like yeah now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that you say I don't know why I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's never been that way but like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> had to have like that energy where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had your ears pierced yeah you did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did really because like when you said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you want your ears pierced I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't you already have your ears </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pierced or am I just like dreaming that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> up yeah everyone said that I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really it is weird how much like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> changing a little bit of your facial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> features can change to perception yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was growing out my beard a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bit I looked like [ __ ] Willem Dafoe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> from the lighthouse and I was like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of digged it though but also at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> same time it was really [ __ ] annoying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah having it long actually you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually reminded me of Linus Tech tips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> more than anything really yeah I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know why you just like I don't wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wear sandals and socks side by side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he is not a drip you know like I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> want to be comparedness I think he looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good with a bit I I just like he wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> willing to fight it was like it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Linus Tech tips with a beard energy that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I got for me I don't know I I take that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one moment I think it's very different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one I thought it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hear you it's like a 12 inch [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what's is that like the biggest change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you've ever done aside from like getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your hair dyed and everything like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are you very much I think you turning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> silver was the biggest change right that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was weird yeah well I look at that a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of weird I liked it when it was half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> blonde half Brown kind of yeah dirty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blonde like when the silver was fading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah I like that I liked it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> towards the end yeah I like that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> segment but then uh it's like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to have to do it again also she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> probably shouldn't be dyeing my hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I haven't got much left to it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently that's a myth is it really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah I don't know my hairdresser </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was saying yes but she got stakes in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well no yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's true but also she was saying that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like unless you're like directly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> applying the bleach onto the scalp which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah a hairdresser shouldn't be doing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> begin with it doesn't affect true I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know either way I I'm I'm yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what you're cautious about I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> gone out of that phase as well I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I need to dye my hair I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just in them I'm in the Boomer stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now but I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll do whatever it wants and I will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just deal with it it does feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> regardless of age it does feel like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stage that every YouTuber goes through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right it's like oh it's the died </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's either they go through a bold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> stage or they dye their hair but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the it's the I'm a YouTuber with a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit of clouds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that is kind of like a YouTuber midlife </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> crisis right away oh people are starting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to look at me maybe I should spice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> things up I never really wanted to dye </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my hair it was like I think I was what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made you want to I think I was kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interested in it I was like I've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tried it yeah I thought it could be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting and then when um uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> childhood who dyes your hair right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> she was just kind of like yeah let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just do it I was like I mean I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was in that phase I was like yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it everything in my life is changing why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not yeah so I tried it and I remember I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't like it initially I thought okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it got to blonde and I thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> huh weirdly looks okay yeah I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mind blonde yeah but then also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it did make me look a bit weird I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think the silver looked weird on you to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be honest I think out of out of all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that compared to like a red or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a blue you know or like a you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a standard like I am a YouTuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube gamer color like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to that I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a ninja yeah yeah oh yeah ninja if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like ninja if you had ninja hair I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would have been like strong blue are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a twitch streamer </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> different colors now yeah I've done like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'm not even used to it right now I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> woke up this morning I was like like who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] that I'm just praying I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like God please I hope I don't have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> weird shaped head when I get bored that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was the one thing I was worried about </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> until you get to like this length and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like oh my head is [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like we should have found out a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way to figure out the shape of your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without having to shave it all off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> science come on we must have figured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> something out right just like it scans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the Contour of your head yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there's like a [ __ ] filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or something yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the filters always look so [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> what a man the king of balls many jobs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah aside from aside from Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gang's haircut uh I I watched another </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime this uh this past week I watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jujutsu kaisen zero oh in in this in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cinemas how was it it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> say it say it God it was okay yeah not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> made I liked it I thought it was good it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was good it was good it was it was did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you watch it in four XD what's 4xd where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they like spit on you and shake the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> chair and stuff no I didn't know that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was enough did they have that for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I I like the animation it was pretty uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if watching demon slay has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just spoiled me in terms like Shonen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I went into like the the not with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the expectations that it was going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Demon Slayer move and train level uh but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did come in knowing that that was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> last shown in anime film that I had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watched in theaters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I came out being just mildly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amused and just impressed by some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> animation points but at the end of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> day it was like the most seven out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ten yeah it was the story good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people in the cinema next to me were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] bowling their eyes oh yeah of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> course and I I was like yeah you good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> literally everyone in the cinema is when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched movie and train was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just light sobbing from every corner of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the room and I'm just like okay oh now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this one next to me was like full on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> balling and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> are you okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because like to to me Mugen train </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing that made Mugen train special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a Shonen anime film was that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually felt Canon you know it actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like it had a real tangible effect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the story whereas I know that juicy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kaizen zero is technically Canon because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's technically supposed to be a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prequel but also it's like starring like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a main character that we hadn't seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um and no it is Canon it's pretty cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no it is it is it is it is Canon but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't feel like anything I watched in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the movie had any effect to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything I watched in the TV series a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit a little bit very minimal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> though like mainly suit with the bad guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right mainly to do with the bad guy and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I find I like I found out spoilers from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people I was watching it with and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh okay so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not I'm not gonna tell me I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna I'm not I'm not gonna spoil </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but but it had like it didn't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have that much of an effect kind of felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like a side story if anything rather </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than actually having a proper like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should care about all the things going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on and I think that's my problem with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of Shonen anime movies is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's zero reason for me to care about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anything going on we spoke about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like last time we spoke about movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally every one piece movie well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know it's a good experience but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a bit odd because it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just I think it's been number one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> box office in Japan for 10 weeks now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah of course yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> these things are just running printers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> after Mugen train this is like every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> industry is just like Eagle Vision on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cinemas now it's just like that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where the money is yeah I mean it feels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the the industry is definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gearing up more towards movies because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah I mean Kevin's feel was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] insane as well for that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three month process of like all those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because like because like when I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got invited to see Jujutsu kaisen um I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> thought I oh it's a bit late isn't it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it still going to be in cinemas uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I missed out on seeing Dune </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that was only in cinemas for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a month and a half or yeah maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even less in Japanese Cinemas but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with anime movies it just seems like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just never goes out dude move game train </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was in cinemas for a year yeah like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a year like how how is it a year later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people are still seeing it in cinemas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're still making money of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> show I mean that's I guess that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the top grossing anime movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all time but like my time scale for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how long movies are in cinemas are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> completely [ __ ] destroyed by anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movies because they just never seem to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they never seem to go out they never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seem to they always seem to be in there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how long has Jesus Christ have been in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cinemas for now oh it didn't come out in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it came out uh Christmas Eve oh [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's almost three months yeah almost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> three months and it doesn't seem like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's even close yeah to uh it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seem like it's easy because they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> showings in four XD mxd whatever yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they have uh 3D and they've told the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> utmost and there's like in this a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> ton goings yeah yeah like when I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuck in uh Hokkaido uh because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> airport has A Cinema there I was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I'll see what's playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um literally every literally it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Jujutsu Kyson zero for every single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> place they didn't have any other stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no they did wait was it was it just one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> screen was it multiple screens uh I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe it was two screens oh yeah okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes sense yeah because then like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a there's a ton of Cinemas all around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tokyo that have like 20 plus screens or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something ridiculous yeah and you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watch there's tons of foreign films so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> many of them and you can want to use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kaizen on seven of them yeah I watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> operation mint speed that's what it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> called the one with uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Colin first that's all that sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a real movie never heard of that at all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's about like a World War II operation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where they like made a uh fake person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they got a real dead body and gave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it fake documents and then washed it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in Spain was that like based off a true </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> story yeah it really happened oh wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really cool really cool really really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cool story basically like they wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> make uh Germany think that the UK was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to attack someone they weren't and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so the way they did it was by floating a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> body to Spain with fake documents on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Spain leaked it to Germany and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then Germany thought it was real damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff because they made this person like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look so convincing that they were a real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person so he does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a really cool story but the movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was [ __ ] oh okay is it a comedy is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> drama but the problem I I guess oh there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't sure it was a very I was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like comedy five or six </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know it's like it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> focuses on like the personal drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amongst the people who are doing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> operation yeah and so it's kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like I love triangle and [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do we I mean I I I don't know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> notebook of World War Two yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just kind of like all right well the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the the thing is so interesting itself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the whole story but obviously there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not much known about it so they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously had to make it build it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah and so it's kind of like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mean the column foot's great he's always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> great yeah but it was just kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right just me yeah or like like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going back to what you said about yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was [ __ ] like I was having this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought the other day because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm getting so bored of the word mid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because like it just seems like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I tweeted out a tweet about like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] Demon Slayer and the animation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and somehow that was like one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> most toxic Twitter tweets you talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about demons animation why would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah that's what happened to me God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why would you do that I just said Demon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Slayer had good animation about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was it oh it was it it was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah Demon Slayer I watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> season two and I'm like okay maybe it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did deserve best animation my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God my like I had I literally had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mute that thread that thread compared to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything else going on in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was the thread that I had to mute </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in the past week I'm like gagging just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking about that comments four clowns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right like it does have the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> animation it's not even like a contest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so people say there's other things about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's not is the story the best no but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like people are equating the fact they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't like the show or they don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much attention it's getting yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like it doesn't deserve the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animation listen it does it like it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> flat out does yeah it does that mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's it's a good show no no it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't is it a mid Shonen series like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> story-wise yes yes it is but it but but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the but the animation is [ __ ] gotcha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> listen I I [ __ ] love Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right but it's the same reason why I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch porn I like I like what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the screen I don't like the plot I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I love Demon Slayer but it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the most like I love demons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you heard it here first I I [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was so high watching it bro yeah but to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sit here and be like it's a complex </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> storytelling it's not it's a super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> simple Shonen I I think what does mid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mean to you what is what does mid mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to you what it means to me is that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can watch it and there are many aspects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of it that you enjoy but there's also a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of aspects about it that just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> grip you like there's a lot about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like Jesus Tyson no to me no because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was I was having this thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the story is made yeah yeah like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know like as an overall show it's good I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think the story is you know slightly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> above me I think it's a solid story it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> does everything slightly above </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is such a [ __ ] mean that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> saying like that's slightly above [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because like the Train movie I'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> say it was boring as [ __ ] I was bored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of my mind watching that the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> way no okay that was bitter it was good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the first first 60 the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 70 of that movie I was actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like resident sleeper bro I was sleeping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I I agree I I think I think people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> forget that like because everyone only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thinks about the last fight and like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> last 30 minutes of that movie because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the last 30 minutes were [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were [ __ ] amazing uh the actual </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part when they were on the train was to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me pretty pretty boring as [ __ ] it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was very hard where they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the dreams I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snooze yeah yeah like literally snooze </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> literally snooze yeah I don't know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's yeah yeah but like to me like I had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this realization that to me like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something [ __ ] like when I say oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was pretty [ __ ] it was like it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five out of ten to me that's [ __ ] right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whereas you know like I don't know why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is a five out of 10 [ __ ] to you I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know why that's to me that board is on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like average yeah when was the last five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> out of ten thing you can tell you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can tell yourself that five out of ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in your head means that but it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> five out of ten means right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're never gonna give anything a one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you really hate it right you'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> never you never have 100. see because in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my head like I'm operating on like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the my anime list rating score right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when's the last time you in your mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gave something a five out of ten you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could be watched red whatever right okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because right seven out of ten means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you didn't hate it but you were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happy like you had an experience that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were happy with yeah did it blow you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> away no five out of ten means you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure if you wasted your time and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why it feels weird giving things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're like it's mid a five out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> ten like I think a one out of ten isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even wasting your time because at that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point at that point yeah at that point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you watch a one out and you're like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just entertaining this is this is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just so bad that this is so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you watch exam you watch berserk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 2016 you're like okay I this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously like [ __ ] terrible but I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> having a good time watching this just to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] on it so let's say like to me it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like five is at the Middle where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like all right if you do nothing nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good and nothing bad you get a five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's the most basically no to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me a five out of ten when it comes to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime so me a five out of ten is like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finished watching it I feel nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it and I forget about it in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> couple weeks if I want to send for me is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like have I wasted my time I'm not sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yes no no no five out of ten to me is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have I wasted my time yes this this was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a waste of time it was right I I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it wasn't horrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four to me is like I'm going to forget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this but all I'm going to remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this show is that it was a waste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of my time no no because here's here's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how here's how I think why when when we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say what the average when when we say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about the middle of the ground what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> average score is most people will say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven even though logically you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's four five okay so if it's a five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably like the lowest that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will ever finish a show because to me if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a three or four I'd probably watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one or two episodes and I didn't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finish it because there's nothing in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that to grab my attention five is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there was enough for me to finish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it and then I regret finishing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because yeah because there was nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in there that made me want to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember it or left an impact on me but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the five out of tens are like in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opinion they're the worst shows because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you just they're just thrown into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pile of like oh yeah that existed out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ten I give it like a seven okay because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like because because no no I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't I wouldn't consider that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> slightly it's okay it's okay see to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right when I hear it when you say seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seven is like you were happy and had fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching it but the moment it's over you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't feel compelled by the show at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's nothing that makes it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really stick in your memory it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a good experience and you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> regret it but nothing after the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> makes you want to effectively think but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's the thing it's like with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> juicycin like I I finished it yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like I had a you know pretty good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time watching it I was like okay yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is good but like when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was finished I was like am I compelled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go read the Manga or like continue it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on not exactly like to me my hero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Academia is the exact same thing where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like season one it's like yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was great yeah it was cool you know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can see why people enjoyed it I had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good time with it am I compelled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to continue on with it personally no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what would you give the did you watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> any demonstrated season yet have you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watched it yeah yeah what would you give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it I personally even though I said the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> story is not the best I still think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I would give it an 8.5 to 9. um and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the the reason I say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> agreement the Demon Slayer council is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stronger yeah it was amazing because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't agree that the story is mid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because a lot of people say the story of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Demon Slayer is mid and to me like demon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slayer's story it in it's as simple as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it needs to be right yeah I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's as simple as it needs to be to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rest of the good parts Shine the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem with demon slay is like when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have an arc like Mugen train and there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like fights that aren't that don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stand out as much it's like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really apparent like just that the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and the characters don't carry the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much but with season two because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because half the season was just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] full-on action fast you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like [ __ ] it out this is like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nissan 9 out of 10. and like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's the point where okay I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't really care about the story that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> much if the action just [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> slaps this hard yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean you know what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mean how dare you today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wow I don't think we've ever talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about that on the podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm too afraid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've been on the other side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> quite recently can you cancel about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about the animation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just trying to think of like a five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of ten this is the problem with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to remember a 5 out of 10 anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show is that uh I don't remember that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why there are five out of ten you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like the moment what about manga because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you read more manga because I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember most five out of 10 shows it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> literally like I go to the list of music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I finished I'm just like a lot of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are literally five out of ten even five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of ten manga I'm like I don't I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't remember them and that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem is like it's so hard to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about these kinds of like mediocre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> middle of the ground shows it's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like unless I recently re-watch it again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna remember it I'm like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's probably something along those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lines but I could wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know concretely tell you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the reason why it's a five out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of ten it's just so like impactless that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like oh I didn't even know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that existed yeah you know I do feel bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you feel like you've wasted a time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching a show no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um you know you don't no I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when you start caring that much about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the media you're the media wise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something the media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know stuff you're consuming I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you almost ruin a lot of it for yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like stuff that you might have enjoyed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just think you're worried too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about if you're enjoying it the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time oh that's kind of where I got to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately with that like it's like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it got to the point where I was so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> selective on what I was watching to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure that everything I was watching was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worth my time that if I ran into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something that I was like well I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasted an hour because of watching these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> first three episodes right I've I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if this is like a I haven't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> consciously chosen to do this but I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> stopped it's scrolling or looking for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows yeah it's just kind of whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> appears in front whatever whatever is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recommended whatever is put in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or I think that's the best way to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> consume and honestly I've been having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> great time I I feel like I honestly wish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I honestly wish I could do that yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to watch anime well no it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even anime it's like pretty much every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> form of media and it's not even about me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like being like a [ __ ] snob wanting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like consume the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um it's literally I started really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> caring about it when I just didn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the time to do everything I wanted to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right so like nowadays like even even if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like picking a game I want it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be a game I could properly get into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't I don't know we are stuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this cycle of constantly worrying if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the game is good enough for your time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you know you'll never start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you never [ __ ] play anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly yeah yeah I mean that's what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feel games are way more of a Time sync </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> than an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only on average yeah I mean I mean it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> depends but like to me getting into a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game getting like properly absorbed into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a game is just like it's one of the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> magical experiences and I [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it when I just get absorbed into a video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game world it's the same way that I get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absorbed into an anime or absorbed into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a manga or something like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely and like to me I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like because my time is so precious to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me right now I'm it it sucks that I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like constantly have to like have this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little part of my head that's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh could you be watching something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> better that you'd enjoy maybe a little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bit more no are you really in the mood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for this I don't know optimize your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> schedule in every way right yeah so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like the stuff that you consume </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> should be the one thing where you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no pressure like whatever you watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you play doesn't matter if it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't the game of the year doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matter if it wasn't the movie of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year yeah just watch whatever comes up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have an opinion on it like I watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that uh don't look up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it went on for like an hour longer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than it needed to right right and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah there were some funny moments of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there were some bits that I chuckled but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> overall I just felt like I I wasted all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my time yeah but I was like I'm glad I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watched this because it gave me even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though I I came out disliking the movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason that made me happy I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah that was [ __ ] and it was fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting to talk to other people who also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought it was [ __ ] I don't know I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> liked it I think as well it's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like even even if you do consume </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> something that is [ __ ] within that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specific medium like it just broadens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your horizon more on the medium and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it adds to the knowledge pool of like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now that I've consumed something on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other side of the spectrum now I'm I'm a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit more knowledgeable about what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes the good [ __ ] good right yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely like that with music where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like if it's on [ __ ] Spotify I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just listening to it like I I watched um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> as well I watched our Spider-Man movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the new one oh yeah yeah and like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it was great but I because it was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great and I had a good time my emotions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are way stronger about don't look up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right really I hated it right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched I watched no way home and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a great time but at the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> day I've already like forgotten about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't I don't care and it was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was good but it was just that was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movie I [ __ ] loved that was I liked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it a lot but I just I'm I after I'm done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with it I'm like that was everything I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expected it to be right and I had fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't feel strongly about it I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think that's the thing though it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the problem is like I think The </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sweet Spot of like you being able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really gush out about something is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when it's on two or the two ends of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the spectrum right where it's either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so [ __ ] incredible like 10 out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of 10 Masterpiece where you can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> gush about your love for it forever and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then there's the other side where it's </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> I didn't mean to watch this movie it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came on the TV yeah what did you how did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you see it it was on TV I was on TV uh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was in a hotel and like isn't it like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> x-rated movie like Bulgaria but it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on TV or something can you watched it I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I watched it I watched it in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> European country and it was on TV at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like 2 A.M and I couldn't sleep and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was just I remember just thinking like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] must have felt like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] fever dream yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that yeah anything loves Montreal means </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a [ __ ] Fever Tree that's weird man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how'd you find how do you guys think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like trash TV fits into everything would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you call trashy like which what rating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would you give like Kitchen Nightmares </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that or uh 90 Day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Fiance I think it just depends because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like people it depends if you grow up on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all right like like during like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were you were you surrounded of Gordon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Ramsay yeah yeah I'm in I'm invested in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that character I like it I know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> most of it especially in Kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Nightmares are all faked aren't you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but also that's the thing it depends on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you were like raised in a family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where like it was like a family event to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like yeah oh it's Wednesday night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's watch Kitchen Nightmares you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that kind of thing right like I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> grow up in a family like that so like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> me like I didn't grow up with trash TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at all so yeah we never watched it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> together yeah so when I watched like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube yeah oh okay okay so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like the first time I knew about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a kitchen nightmare was like through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like YouTube clips or like any TLC show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right I was like what the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know yeah just because like I knew </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Kitchen Nightmares uh because that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally when I first saw Gordon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ramsay as well it was it was the British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kitchen Nightmares as well which was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you compare British Kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nightmares to American Kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Nightmares and it's like [ __ ] night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and day like not only the editing but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just how like toned down Gordon Ramsay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is as well turned down in the British </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one yeah he's so he's like he it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's different right because it feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in the American one it feels like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they actually get like the formula huh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is a Formula but you know it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they get like the worst of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst [ __ ] chefs and restaurant like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual clowns yeah uh to to like present </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> their District Gordon Ramsay and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost like cartoonish in a way and yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you look at the British one and it feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's just like like chefs who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually give a [ __ ] about their food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who actually just like just need some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> advice who needs some advice a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the times Gordon Ramsay is like giving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them like genuine advice and maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're too headstrong or maybe they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> too like you know Pride for to really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listen to his advice whereas you know in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America it actually feels more like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this is not even reality TV anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this looks so cartoony and feels so over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the top that you just don't even take it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just feel that way about like 99 of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> American trash TV yeah you know which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one the one I hate the most I I hate it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I I used to also watch it a lot </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was like that show is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's so good it's so obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fake but also at the same time you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's just cool just seeing weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] brought in I've driven past uh the </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> introducing story lines like well I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> B plots yeah there would be like B-Line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> plus with their family that would get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> resolved in episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was so big in the UK the American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one played in the on UK television so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] great yeah it was so popular it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was ridiculous yeah I just like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking back on it I used yeah that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the one actually trash TV that came on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Australian TV all the time and my dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was obsessed I just loved it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just they would literally be a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pile of [ __ ] in this room and these guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like so about 50 bucks sell that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 20 bucks like where are you gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sell this to this is a used bed sheet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's five bucks right there it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no it's not you're not selling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever what if though it's like all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> connected like like the trash TV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Universe where like they trash TV like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like in Storage Wars they like they take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the [ __ ] and then they go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> porn stars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course there'll be these ones these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fake ones will be like this guy has a a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lot full of perfect Rarity Charizards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah perfect grain it's like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously we can sell those but other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times there's just Lots or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just all [ __ ] and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you could make a profit selling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this surely the amount of time to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rid of all of this [ __ ] and sell it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just not worth it no like yeah you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sell this the pack of double a batteries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 10 bucks if you really wanted to but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you like where are you going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to sell this to yeah like are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shipping it surely that has to be taken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into account this is this is the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> country where I see that working you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know where you where you can actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sell the stuff and people will buy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they do have storage Lots in Japan I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think they sell them do they when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they when they no I don't I'm pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sure they actually use storage for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> storage purposes but the store is not I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think when if somebody doesn't collect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it I think they just get rid of all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff yeah they just don't think they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sell them to the public which would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> shame because we the Japan Storage Wars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> version </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like I think I know more American </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reality TV shows and I know British </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> reality TV shows I can't think of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> attractions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I went back to the UK like that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on that was still on TV it was still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> airing on Channel Master you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones that actually the one I the what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this reality TV show where you feel bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching it but even if it's I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know how much of it's fake like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the debt collectors won oh yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the one where I'm always like even if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is fake should we really which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one's better watch storylines it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh there's a bunch in the UK we [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love debt collecting shows in the UK for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some reason we love watching debt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> collectors as long as we're not on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bike yeah so what's the premise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so Jeremy over here is gonna go over to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> his house and collect this let's see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what happens in the British one it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like some guy goes to the house hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've come here to get the stuff and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then like [ __ ] off mate no you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] getting my dick [ __ ] right off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like they've got a high high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> magistrates Court notice to collect this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff if they don't they'll start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> collecting things off the property and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they and then the police turn up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it's just it should [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like oh these poor people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who've had some horrible circumstance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we're just we're just shoving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> cameras in their face while their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Apartments being ransacked and so yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're selling the stuff off yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but wouldn't everyone pay their debts if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they could but is it called uh can't pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll take it away that's it what a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stupid thing I have never heard of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> name it's on channel five okay I'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> send you later I don't think I've ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watched a single program I guarantee if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you watch one you'll get hooked it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> channel it's just the trash Channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's so addictive watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this stuff like to me like John I don't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> can't like think of anything oh Channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 4 is good stuff too though yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel four which I think Channel 4 is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like actually one of like the best the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> best channels it has like the widest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> range it seems like to be the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experimental as well BBC is just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very standard here's your like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Doctor Who The Voice here's the voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ITV is just like here's here's X Factor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once again that's a reality TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually yeah I completely forgot that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just like reality TV show just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> times a hundred though right but no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one cares about singing reality like is </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> Island as well love Island that's is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that is that ITV I feel like that's ITV </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> really popular in America as well the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> British one yeah it's really popular </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it is oh the Great British Bake Off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well I completely forgot that can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> be called Bake Off in the U.S </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really they can't uh one of the the US </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> brands has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um the trademark only Easy Bake uh one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of them has the the trademark to take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> off so they it's called something else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in America and they've had to lock off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> something and they've had to actually in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the Netflix I think on Netflix they've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had to like animate over certain parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the show where like the trophy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they've had to like they they did a they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did see CGI where they trade changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the trophy said wow oh it's called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the Great American baking show yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Great American baking show yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they didn't have the rights for the wood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bake Off oh wow because for some reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a company owns the right for the wood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bake off which is weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um so yeah they changed it so that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> popular in the US but it's called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technically something different the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> baking show the Great British baking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show just just doesn't roll off the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tongue's word </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> which one inside did we decide we need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more than one singing reality TV show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when was X Factor just not enough I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's because like shows like X </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Factor in like American an idol where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh a lot of the times there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like contestant of like are they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> judging them on their actual singing or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are they judging them on their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> performance so people were like we want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to know if they can actually sing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks don't matter you know like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whole like [ __ ] like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> inclusive thing yeah how they treat you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> perform that's what they do that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do there I was watching the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with um Chris in the hotel room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was a British got uh Prince Got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Talent person who um was performing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> magic and they served in the military </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah and it was just insulting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how they almost just shoved it down your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> throat it's like this is the guy's only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> re reality as a human being is that he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> served in a war and it's like God can we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not just be people do we have to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like ha do we do we have to just shove </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> down these things how about you follow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the name of your show and just be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do you have a talent yes or no but this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is not about that but how is your story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compelling yeah you're in this magic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> show this guy's doing these tricks and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff and you know not not to to not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minimize it but it was almost beat for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beat predictable and there's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so there's this one trick where he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing and he was like oh look at the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clock and and tell me the time and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right before the the point of this trick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes I was like Chris to Chris I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like because Chris is watching it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like I bet it's the time where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of his friends died or something in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the war yeah no she you not two seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> later he's like that's the time when my </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> stuff but yeah the fact that they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> using this as like bait for almost like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even trivial trivialized okay because if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't feel real it does like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> impact is gone because it feels so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> manufacturing it's just like they might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well have just put up a cue card to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> be like now cry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like I bike again I want to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure I'm not diminishing it or like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know trying to minimize minimize it or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> make it seem like it's not on the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's on the producer yeah probably heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this story or something they're like yo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play that up play that people want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] cry yeah because like because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's been proven plenty of times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that the the auditions that we see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> televised in front of a live audience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't actually like the first audition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they go through like several stages with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the producers I guarantee he was doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that magic trick and like one of The </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Producers like just like heavily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> suggested yo you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speculation but uh I like in my mind I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just like I feel like one of one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> producers just went you know I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you should uh kind of like try to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> integrate that storyline into your magic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> trick somehow you know there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely kind of stuff that those you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know producers are we do like we've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know if you have a look at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people have released the contracts and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff yeah they're pretty predatory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> contracts oh yeah like a lot of the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I can't remember which one it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was either one of these shows one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> British ones is like they were by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> signing the contract they owned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything that you would make that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would self-publish online or something I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it was American Idol one of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was like yeah so if you went to even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> audition and you posted content online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they wanted to they could turn around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like hey that's all we we that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ours bro yeah that's just [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it might have been I think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was like because I saw the YouTube video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um also Susan Boyle didn't mean she lost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out to like diversity that's right the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people we did I remember I remember this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's like a big big like because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think everyone at the time I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when this was happening when I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> younger and everyone was like oh Susan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ball's gonna win so like yeah it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big effort to like make it so that she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't win or like yeah right opinion </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> have you ever thought about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> going on a show like that or that's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great question Julie yeah no economy is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay I saw a guy on YouTube uh I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think I showed you guys he went on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> show playing a character and then like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just making fun of the whole process and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like with secret camera and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> showing it oh really yeah but then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think the show took everything down oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but it was just saying the contract </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he had to sign the contract yeah but a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> part of his thought I wonder if I made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up a storyline and I really committed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it how easy would it be to get on TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I think it would be pretty easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which comedian did this a British one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> did it didn't he did he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> British communities which one was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] he made up like a storyline about I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was um oh which comedian was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh British comedian who went on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Britain's Got Talent and it was there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like I don't want to say the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> storyline in case I'm wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh he saw chaponda </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sure give us that yeah uh British </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comedian he did like he made it so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like his I think his backstory is like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> holocaust Survivor or something really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah something like that or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something like Jewish or something I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> remember it was like that while he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> searching I'll guess I'll get I'll add </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on to the conversation but yeah like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know why people would want to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in reality TV shows now when you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just post yourself up on YouTube I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like that need to like have your five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seconds of Fame it's kind of like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need is like kind of Disappearing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because at any moment in time you post a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tick tock you can get like a few million </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> views I like at a complete chance right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well reality TV is figure this out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why they often recruit people on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> social media yeah they go on social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> media and like DM them like Hey we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from this Prince got town would you be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting auditioning we can guarantee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you to go to like the second judges or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> something sneak him off yes well yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have you have you not watched like clips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the talent shows recently I haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually it feels less like a talent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show and more like hey because there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people who are like from all over the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> world like American and Canadian it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seems like they're just getting anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who does anything interesting right to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come on and who has a compelling story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> supposedly yeah it's more like they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> less so a talent shower of the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and more a talent show to just amused </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people where they just get acts from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> across the world yeah yeah and then just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Loosely tie together a story it's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> real YouTube Rewind now since YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Rewind isn't a thing anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the talented people rewind yeah I'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have to find it after okay but what was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the story then what was so he made up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that he was a holocaust victim can I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have your phone I can try and Google it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember oh here we go yeah Lee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Nelson yeah it was by channel four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what who's this one look at your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thumbnail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god wow I don't think he made up a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fake storyline about being a rabbi and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something and then whatnot and channel 4 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> posted it was part of like balls of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> steel balls of steel yeah oh I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> balls of steel I didn't know I didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even know that was still going on it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not this is from a while back oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> remember he made up some story about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> being a Hebrew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um Rabbi and playing a bunch of generic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sympathy cards yeah and yeah and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really easy for him to get on yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then I think he got to the live show I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't remember what happened exactly I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think he then came out or something yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was yeah but it was just like showing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how easy it is to fake stuff yeah I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I like because I haven't watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much reality TV show not like much like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of these talent shows I should say uh as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much as I used to because before like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like everyone was talking about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when you live it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> inescapable yeah everyone was talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about oh he's going to win Britain's or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Talent OR X Factor now he just feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't I don't know if it's if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just my Social Circle has changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or if the viewership has genuinely just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had a sharp drop off well like I rarely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hear anyone talking about these big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> talent shows anymore no one cares </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because no one really like the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> demographic of watching TV now is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> completely shifting TV is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> background noise now yeah that's it no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one actually gives a [ __ ] about what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on TV yeah like I feel you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well at least people under 40. yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like people nowadays would rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well obviously would rather get on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] Mr Beast video or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah definitely you know it is weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> actually I had this thought the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> day where that's that's the new like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America's Got Talent like yeah I did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have this thought the other day and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> correct me if I've already talked about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this on the podcast because I can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember if I have or not uh but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like YouTube in a sense has like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the Internet moves so fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube has become the new TV and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost like Tick Tock that's become the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new YouTube in a sense where Tick Tock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this like big like this big Rising </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of you know piece of media and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like remember back in the day where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every YouTuber like you you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made it as a YouTuber if you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> appear on TV if you could appear on Old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah nowadays it feels like every tick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tocker is trying to make a name for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> themselves on YouTube and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube that is the established media </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the established platform yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely think so yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> another transition of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just we I don't know but like at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the same time as well it's like almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of YouTubers now doing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opposite where they're like they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to jump onto Tick Tock now and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making a name for themselves there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they think you know it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whole grass is greener on the other side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concept right where it's like which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the real main source of like income now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or how many YouTubers do you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't know many aside from I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think Hank Green's the only one I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen a lot on like Tick Tock and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube shorts it's pretty fun to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moving away from Tick Tock too like he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> going to like Instagram videos or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever the thing now isn't it I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen [ __ ] Ray William Johnson on Tick </SPEAKER_04>
