<SPEAKER_04> sit here and having like what if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to go to the toilet right because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the reason okay the reason i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hate going on flights and sitting on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> window seat is i hate not being able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> access the toilet under my own will oh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did i i know now my limits of my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bladder so now whenever i'm on a long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flight i'm like i'll seat give me a dial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seat immediately i don't have to look at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the view i've seen yeah i know what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of a plane looks like i know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know what sky looks like i don't need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> look at sky i i know what a city looks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like from above i will sacrifice all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right hold up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay this is gonna be our first topic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for fun listen i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i am a firm window seat fan why why i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell you why because right what's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> biggest downside of being in the isle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> gentleman what is it come on there's got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be one downside because there is no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there [ __ ] that you don't you don't see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one there is one glaring gigantic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> annoying issue and that is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people in the window and middle seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanting to get out and and god forbid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're [ __ ] clumsy as [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh like [ __ ] falling over everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they've got like 10 [ __ ] that they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got on their lap they got like the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] family buffet and [ __ ] like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> headphones portable charger it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for [ __ ] sake put it in your [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bag they're trying to shimmy around like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get that [ __ ] away from me i want to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the window because i want to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i don't want to be disturbed i but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're okay with disturbing disturbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that just shows like the difference in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentality because i would rather i'm i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fine with being disturbed i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm going to go to the toilet man i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you need it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's moisture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine with being disturbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listen i don't okay i don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone else sees it the same way as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do because i know that i get annoyed by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minor things my house could burn down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'll be like well that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's really inconvenient that hasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it but if someone moves in the aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seat for [ __ ] sake no because for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like there's like a counter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because i i i know how much i piss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i'm glad that i don't need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worry when i how much i piss on trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste because i piss a lot on trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste yeah but in the confines of an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> airplane you are stuck there and you ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go to the toilet once all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's reasonable right everyone has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows everyone needs to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the toilet yeah but twice okay that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's kind of pushing it you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what if i need to go three times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when everyone's sleeping what if what if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that just happens oh you're more worried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about pissing them off yeah i'm more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worried about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> picture you're only on the isle right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what is the limit before you start to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get annoyed with how many times people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get up to go and pee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't matter because no matter what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to be pissing more yeah these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> two people combine for me for me for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i never get pissed off because i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i get him see that's i i know the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pain that's my i know the trouble you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in i got your brother that's my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mentality right the isle people the isle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chumps are used to being annoyed that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my theory right so i don't really feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bad about disturbing i'm [ __ ] zen on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the all you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the middle c just lose so yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they already knew that they already knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they lost the middle c is just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loser's seat no one ever wants to sit in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the middle see unless i think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a [ __ ] psychopath if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually choose to sit in the middle see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well this is like okay well i mean you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know in your the only time i don't give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] about middle c is if we're on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an hour or two flight i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's fine literally i watch one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> jason statham and i'm there right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i do care on a 12-hour flight but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you've already lost at that point and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should have pre-booked that's your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fault yeah exactly exactly but do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever do that gamble where you're like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want the whole road to myself this plane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> looks just empty enough where i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can pull this off you're like i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> book just the middle seat in a clean row </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of three no i know no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the i like to live life on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> edge because then i know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what what sick [ __ ] is gonna want to sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> next to a a madman that would willingly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choose the ilc in a row of three that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should send dangerous that should like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be like a danger sign no because what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do is that i i get the safe seat of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an aisle seat because i know that no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> matter what even if that aisle is full i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the extra leg room i get immediate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> access to the toilet i don't disturb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anybody and win like like but then the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> moment i get on the plane and i see oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not a lot of people waiting in this in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this waiting room right now right then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's when i go like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so uh how many how many aisles are open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> today how many hours can i can i sneak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into one of those and like i just asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and a lot of the times they're just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's when it's that's when it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> empty and also i don't ask i just go oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay the moment the plane like the seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> belt things come on i'm like that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> free aisle that's mine i i could see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> other people on the plane i see their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eyes looking at the free seats i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no it's mine i'm getting everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well that's the other benefit of being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the aisle right you immediately just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah i mean it's rare that i've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm on a plane where it's like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where there's an aisle there you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm pretty sure the gamble you're making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like it's like [ __ ] gotcha odds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i am talking about when the plane is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like basically like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 70 to 80 percent full right yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because again like i said no one if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're on the booking page of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> plane you get to see the layout as you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you're not going to sit next to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy who picked willingly in the middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that that's a bad sign i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't do that if i saw someone in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle i'm like he's a psychopath that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a psychopath he wants to socialize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm like no no no no no no i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> formed for this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not here to [ __ ] socialize i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to join a cult today i'm sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sure there'll be some cult some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff yeah yeah yeah but then i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mind going okay so okay okay i'll do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that gamble if it doesn't work out i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i might go to the like whoever's next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me like you want to swap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to swap you actually yeah sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like listen i'm going to sleep do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to swap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they're like yeah wait how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> easily do you sleep on planes because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember when i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with great difficulty so like for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleeping on the window seat is actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> less comfortable than sleeping on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aisle seat as well because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because for some reason like you but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like mine you know your nature is you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you can lean on the on the wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah but the wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the plane is i don't know why it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just tilted at such an angle where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can never get a comfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leaning on that ball it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know what engineer designed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make planes especially on the window </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seats the most uncomfortable angle to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lean your head by yeah that is true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it is so weird because i have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trouble sleeping on cars cars trains or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any other kind of moving vehicle i sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a [ __ ] baby put me on a plane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like insomnia like insomnia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> speed running it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i normally wear a hoodie and a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> jacket no matter what the weather yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll use them as padding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because it also gets [ __ ] cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because i like i need to be i need my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hair to be at least like a 45 degree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> angle right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's called privilege right no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no no no like like like how does the how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> does the aisle make this solution better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i can't i can't tilt my neck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough that it's like it's almost like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> horizontal here's how i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of go like the wall is here and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the seat is here i kind of nestled into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this corner yeah because it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because because like like for me like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said my head needs to be like at least a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 45 degree angle so you know not not yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not my entire body but at least my head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know so it feels at least like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lying down even though i'm i wake up i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get [ __ ] neck cramps or whatever like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i just just go business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i am honestly i have no problem just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sleeping like i put my head down and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep on my arms on my lap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i can't do that i could do that i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> attempted to do that as well and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm too tall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that sounds like a short personal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> solution to me this is why you're lower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than six foot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you get you can just the world opens up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to you it's like a [ __ ] origami level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the 511 club over here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly every time i go on a plane now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like damn man i wish i wish i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was a bit shorter i wish i was off the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 511 club oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god how does it feel to be sure oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well that's the other benefit of being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the lc right is that you can stick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your legs out and actually stretch you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know you can't you you do for 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the woman comes over she's like hey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put your [ __ ] legs in oh the cart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes by and you like your legs it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] cool i'm like [ __ ] up right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> up against the seat though yeah like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just slides pause i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know man jackie chan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know if i can do this now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's been fine like two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> since i've been on a long flight yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been a while yeah yeah it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two years but i used to i used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stay up all night working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then my flight would be at like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe midday if i was lucky yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe 8 a.m if i was even luckier yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i'd stay up all night working and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then right before i got on the plane i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would just take like one of those like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over-the-counter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really cheap weak sleeping pills yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk ones yeah they're super they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're not like american melatonin no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no melatonin is the good [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like illegal in the years or you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> need a prescription to get melatonin oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really yeah i think the one that you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from those stores like similar to hay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fever medicine i think uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i swear to god that's your sugar pills </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so very good it doesn't actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do much but it's enough to like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get your head going and you're like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm already sleep deprived i stayed up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all night working yeah and now i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to bed because like when i would when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh what was it two and a half years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe the latin the last con season i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually did before pandemic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i went back and forth from america like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> four times in one month um to the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and the only way i could do it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by sleeping i just like i if if i need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to sleep on a plane and i don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like melatonin or like sleeping pills </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> me sleep i don't know really like to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i never drink alcohol on planes because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alcohol just makes the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fluids run through my body faster so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just gotta pee more so that that's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that just adds an extra layer of stress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for me because i'm sorry i gotta pee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> more now i'm on this plane i cannot pee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i can hold the pin i cannot pee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of oh i i can hold the p for like the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> unleash it and i drink minimal water on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the plane yeah well i'm pretty sure i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty sure i unload as much like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> possibly can i go to p like five times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before i get on the plane on and like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sit down immediately as i know probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> being five times forgetting the plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bladder already sounds like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> failed you before you even got to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gate i'm only peeing like once i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know what it is though it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a pavlovian effect where like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> moment you hear the doom of like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seatbelt sign it's like a [ __ ] i have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time i mean that's what i can hold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and i can sleep so i'm like i tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the people next to me like if they seem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nice if they don't seem nice i won't say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything because you could just tell us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell them what i should be like don't if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the food comes don't work me out i don't </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> anything so you're gonna say don't worry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh don't worry if you have to pee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because uh i'm i'm all for it man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes if you're in like if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> asleep and they ask you do you want food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they think that you're like actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like conked out like completely yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they might think like oh my god he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like he's fainted or something or like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know no i've done i've just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if i'm if you don't wake up if you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wake up yeah if i'm on a plane and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asleep while the food goes past like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never been woken up for food oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god people wake me up so many times dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that is i hate that and i'm like do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know how hard i worked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i waited two hours to get to sleep for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five [ __ ] minutes so you could wake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> me up this is why i also don't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sit in the [ __ ] in the aisle because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment i fall asleep some person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> excuse me can i go to the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you literally waited you waited until i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt fall asleep all right [ __ ] piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of [ __ ] i hate you you're a scum of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> earth i will watch the moment i see them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about to fall asleep i'm like i'm going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to pee if i'm in the thing because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> want to give you something yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like there's only one thing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> annoys me more about getting woken up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just just to eat you know on a plane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which i wasn't even hungry in the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place and that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> babies on a plane i don't know man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> crying babies on a plane just triggers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something in me man i think it should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> legally allowed cancelling headphones i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're a lifesaver literally the what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are they called dude i i i feel like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like a baby's cry pierces any kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of anything dude those sony wx fourth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out whatever the [ __ ] they are the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stupidest name they've ever picked for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them those amazing noise counting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> headphones you won't hear a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thing yeah yeah because i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i don't i don't usually use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noise cancelling headphones that might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> be my problem because right now i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i think it should be legally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> allowed to punch babies if they cry on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plane like that's can we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i never thought i needed noise-canceling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> headphones until i had them and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can't i literally go everywhere with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them like you you see me i'm always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you are yeah i do not go anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> without my noise cancel headphones now i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would only use noise cancelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> headphones for the airplane that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's what you think okay what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in what are the like situations it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice on the train or any form of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> transport walking around just getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isolated and hearing your music and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the music and if you want you can hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> some background noise it doesn't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matter dude it's like living through an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amv it's [ __ ] awesome it's great i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to hear phil defranco when i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking downtown going what's up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> beautiful bastards in my ear right in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like right in my ear all i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hear is fill in my i know i feel like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zone out enough as it is i don't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> noise cancelling headphones like me i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> literally just walk in front of a truck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something i've had noise cancelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you learn to adapt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you take out one sense so you gotta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compensate for it with your other sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something just buy them you'll see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll see yeah they're great because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> always thought like expensive headphones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are like i don't need more than 20 bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or 50 bucks headphones what a scam and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then i'm like i'm such a fool i was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong the whole time the beeps and boobs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sound even better oh they are amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean i i changed everything i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> used to have like really really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> headphones but they were just real happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they were just like a real hassle to uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just lug around well i stopped using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them that's right mine are like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fall in themselves pretty easy to put a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> coat pocket or something i just use the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> airpods yeah that's why that's why i'm i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like i like using like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> earbuds whenever it's daily life if it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on a plane yeah i'll bring the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> headphones yeah no i wear the headphones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everywhere see like especially this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't mind the headphones either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like this time of year when it gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hot as [ __ ] yeah i hate having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> headphones around i need something to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> distract me from the heat so just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> blasting the audio add more heat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take one more insulation take one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sensors away from me so i can just go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another world i don't have to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pay attention to japan anymore no i hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that because i start sweating here like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my ears and then when i take it off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like well you have a lot of hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> though so that might be why because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really have like that much hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around here so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what i mean that's pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll be good i'll be good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shoot enough i'll have no hair and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking forward to getting sunburned on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> your head connor no i'm just going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> become a hat guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> beanie guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're already starting to become a hat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> guy every time i see you in the summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah because i realized that like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hurts to not wear a hat it hurts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the the sun hurts so much i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what the biggest thing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed me i i was i was walking today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh to the train and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when did i just like hate seeing the sun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like when does that happen cause i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember i didn't mind being outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now i hate the thought of having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the sun on my skin at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i loved it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like the most british thing i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ever heard honestly i didn't used to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this way i don't know what happened i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just now i can't the sun wait can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally tan uh no i just burn right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now i actually like if i stay in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sun too long i feel like nauseous real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fast without like a hat or anything yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if that's like a difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is it just because it's too hot i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe here yeah yeah i think cause this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is just way harder than i'm using it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> also yeah it's also because the humidity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i feel like you're just it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more it's not it's not the sun it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the heat because it's both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in like england the sun [ __ ] tickles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like i feel like they play off each </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the sun makes the humidity worse and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> humidity makes the sun yeah absolutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because when the sun's beaming on you in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like la or whatever yeah it's not too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad obviously i don't want to stand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really it hurts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i don't know i'm not saying it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's great but i mean it's better than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is in japan just because the humidity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes it feel ten times worse i mean i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if there's some like ray </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like mimic like you know going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the water droplets in the edge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] the the frogs are making the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horse turn down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if there's some [ __ ] going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i don't know if there's probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some someone smarter than me because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> figured it out it's honestly i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like a preference thing right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like some people are like yeah humidity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is whatever and then there are others </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are like oh yeah my skin is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> physically burning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i like a little bit of humidity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese humidity is like way too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well last summer i could like only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> survive by going around with like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] uv umbrella i felt like an old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's right i would just go around like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this foldable umbrella that i would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go around i'd be like don't talk to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because i could the first time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saw you with that i thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh i was like are you are you waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me to like say a joke or like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> taking a piece i realized it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough to protect my head is this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this a bit it was i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it started like even the hat didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really help that much and i needed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cover like my neck and like my arms and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> shoulders so you need to get those like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like visors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm one step away from being the old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> woman at the supermarket because they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wear like sleeves like shade sleeves and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a full like neck thing for the sun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shout out to those of us who've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> been sunburned in our lives </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> think i'm aging rapidly imagine imagine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sunburning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine sunburning oh god imagine being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hurt by this natural occurring thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's existed since the beginning of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> our planet i feel like my body didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> age and then it decided that everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everything would just kick into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overdrive and start aging rapidly from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> age like 23. i don't know what happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moving to japan just made me feel old i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know why so now now i literally </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> it's a heart attack yeah yeah but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a [ __ ] horrible way to die i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell you honestly after hearing about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this news i'm never gonna make fun of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hiatus ever again yeah honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no like legit like it's scary man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because you know obviously no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really knew as to why he was on hiatus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah no no one knew they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally don't usually give reasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like he's on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are extremely personal yeah he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> she's on hiatus just deal with it kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of yeah um but yeah apparently i guess i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know was he sick at all or was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just completely sudden i don't really i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at the time of recording i haven't read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough about what happened you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a reoccurring health problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it was just a sudden thing but man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like we all know how much pressure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga artists get put through anyway um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much work they have to do on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weekly basis right um i mean it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy to think that most of the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga artists we know about you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know working showing and jump or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever get like two weeks off no less </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than two weeks off for a year right it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like golden week and then like one extra </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> week yeah as well yeah i doubt they take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and they don't really i doubt they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> take it off as well it's just one week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that where they are forced to take a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> break right i mean i wasn't too familiar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with berserk i'd only watch the uh the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 90s anime i mean that's familiar enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which i really enjoyed yeah that's very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good it's great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um but [ __ ] i mean it's kind of sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing like a legend of the industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's kind of influenced a lot of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've done yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember we were filming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another project when the news broke to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> us yeah and it didn't hit me immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was in like work mode i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> filming most obviously i was like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gotta do this this this and then i got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listened to gutz's theme once and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just played continuously for like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire night and i'm just i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sitting there just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my soul part of my soul had died </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i literally went home and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm gonna reread berserk and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i feel like everyone did yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> started reading it yeah i i couldn't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> past volume one without feeling like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] wave of like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause like i i always know that berserk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is one of the greatest manga that has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever been made and then going back home </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and realizing just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remembering everything that was in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> story and in this manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just hit even [ __ ] harder because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just had forgotten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how good it was before i really took the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time to remember what it had achieved </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of its greatest moments um if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you hadn't read berserk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always a there's always a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfect time to read berserk because any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time is the perfect time to read berserk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so please read [ __ ] berserk it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing i mean the manga single-handedly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inspired the dark souls series i mean it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> spied a lot it wasn't just dark souls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah a lot of things wouldn't exist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now if not for berserk oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i don't know what i don't know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is about berserk but it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show or not not even one shirt the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> story or the one manga that seems to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like no matter how tough this person is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how like detached they are from the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world or whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> berserk seems to be that one story that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seems to be able to affect anyone who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> reads it yeah because like fundamentally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's like this whole like dark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fantasy thing with these like mythical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> creatures and it's bloody gory and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know epic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the main themes mostly are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know one person trying to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] they want to do in life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and like that's a theme that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally anyone can get behind right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm kind of in this world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shit's happening around me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't really know what my purpose is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in life yeah i forgot how brutal it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i've what again i watched all the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 90s enemies yeah holy [ __ ] the 90s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obvious brutal as [ __ ] yeah i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] i was like oh my god it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just it just hurts to read yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does it's so uncomfortable at times yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think it's incredible because it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is really really [ __ ] brutal there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are some like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like his art obviously we haven't talked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about his audio it's like some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best art to ever exist in the world of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> manga like some of the horrific imagery </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was managed to conjure up and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of like the creature designs and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything were just something straight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of a nightmare you know oh yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a brutal show and it's an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> action-packed show as well for his guts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like one of the biggest badasses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in anime and manga and yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having said all that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the moments that people remember are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the really intimate moments which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is which isn't what you think if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looked at berserk on a surface level </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right you look at berserk you see these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> horrific creatures you see guts with a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive sword tearing [ __ ] up and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah this is a manly man's show and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you read it and you're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] crying inside because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see he's just trying to see guts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like get through his trauma and find his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> journey and everything like that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's the real intimate moments that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always stand out and it's the real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> serene moments that always stand out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think that's what that's what really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sets berserk apart from like so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other series where it's the serene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moments juxtaposed against all like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horrific moments that make it one of to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me like it's one of my the favor one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my favorite pieces of fiction that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ever been made 100 i got reminded of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> remembering everything that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everything that berserk did it's like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] doom guy had like a a wife </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and family and he just went home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get reminded you get reminded like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh [ __ ] this is good because when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i don't know why someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compared it on twitter and i thought oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would be i guess so but then i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> read because i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it is kind of like you do forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because sometimes it's like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reading it you're like this is like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doom esque where he's just literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just beheading horses yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're like oh it's just like dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but then it's like really sad you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this isn't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is true it's literally that meme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the girls were like i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believe you didn't cry during titanic do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> boys even have feelings and then like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this there's just the boys crying over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guts theme which was literally what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i was doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was playing and i was just like crying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in bed just like oh my god yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's just yeah like every time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> reread it it's just because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time a new volume came out because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was so much time in between like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the later volumes i was like well [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess i have to read it from scratch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again and so i would keep reading it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from scratch over and over again and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just one of those shows where i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how does this not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get like stale yeah because i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> re i probably read it like the first 30 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> volumes probably like a good like maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 20 times yeah i'm just like how does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this keep just getting better like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do i keep finding new things in this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mean you guys know me i don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> re-watch anything and yeah i refuse to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> re-watch but i even just re-reading the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> first uh what was the first art called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ordination golden age that just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rereading that again i'm like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was so good yeah like even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i've i've seen this i i've read it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> earlier like i tried to read it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ages ago for some reason now i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes when i'm bored i just like go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to the eclipse arc and just look at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> art yeah this is something like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] wait how can one person think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this yeah i know this is insane and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dude was like 15 as well when you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first came up with the concept of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> berserk yeah did you see like did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> see the manga he made before berserk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when he was actually 50. he was like 15 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or 16. it's better than most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> modern manga artists you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not the art skill of a 15 year old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly exactly and like he paired that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> talent and he he just kept improving on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it to the point where literally i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know there's only if like a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people in the world who i think can even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> match you know the talent that he put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into the panels that he did i mean i saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this like really interesting interview </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh with him like after you know his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> death was announced um where like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently one of the big reasons as to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why he was on hiatus was because he got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so infatuated with detail that it would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally get to the point where he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> would zoom in and like actually edit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> every [ __ ] pixel oh yeah oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly and like and sounds like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> prisoner to perfect yeah and he kept and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he kept you know getting like on hiatus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over and over again and his you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> editors would be like you can't even see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this detail on paper yeah so like just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop and he was just like no i have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> get this right i have to get this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfect honestly like some of the panels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he's done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> belongs in a museum you know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i cause the the reason for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is because i just remembered like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that night when i went back i just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to look at some of the panels and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just remember staring at them for such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> long time because you know when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reading a story sometimes you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're you wanna you wanna you wanna see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what happens next so you don't read it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't appreciate the arts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um at the moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you first read it but i went back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to look at some of the panels and i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work and amount of detail and the amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of vision that was put into these panels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were [ __ ] amazing and i did not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciate it fully the first time even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though i could like tell these were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing i didn't take the time to fully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciate how [ __ ] amazing these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of these panels are because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are incredible oh hundred percent and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they they you know they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they are just basically the same as any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other painting or any other art i really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wanna you know see if they have like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> berserk art book of some kind because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would [ __ ] purchase that in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heartbeat dude i i i can imagine that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll probably end up doing something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> soon yeah celebrate the legacy right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hope they do like open up an exhibit or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something yeah because that would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely amazing because if there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one you know one manga that deserves an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exhibit that deserves that artwork to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plastered on the wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] berserk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was kind of sad to see that a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of people were just like what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to happen to the story and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like those aren't fans of bizarre yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's frustrating that like when i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the announcement on twitter saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people being like does this mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna finish it's like like yes no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that's to me it's just so it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how about you just give them a chance to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like grieve before you ask these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> questions if anything i'm kind of your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> answer's probably gonna be no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were a lot of people as well being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh but you know they could probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just get like mirror's assistance to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> finish it and like no no no no no i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would rather it just be where it is yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just end it i'm i'm fine with it being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an unfinished masterpiece you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's fine that's fine for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's berserk was it realistically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever gonna finish do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i don't think i don't think like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not not a single one of like the you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know the kings yeah were like killed i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think only one of them was i think one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of them was yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so that was a long there was a long long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> way to go yeah we we were so early in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the story and the pace that the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was progressing i doubt it would have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finished in our lifetime or you know i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it was always going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfinished but i think berserk's already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> achieved enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it doesn't need to be finished yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like what i said when we talked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about i think last time we spoke really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga where i just get to i often get to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a point when reading margaret i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm satisfied i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuinely it would be cool if this ends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nicely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i've read up to a point where i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm happy with what i've been given </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i feel like berserk has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely done that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's been plenty of moments in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> berserk that have felt like a resolution </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment yeah like a big resolution moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though not every plot detail was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resolved even though not every loose end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was tied up i feel like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resolved enough in my heart to make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like impact me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this much already you know and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the berserk you know the journey of guts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is already amazing enough as it is and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some journeys you know some some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> journeys don't need to come to an end on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paper you know that's it's i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> enough of the journey where i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> satisfied it's yeah it's just knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that he's he's out there somewhere still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah looking for the end right exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the biggest [ __ ] sword </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fat [ __ ] sword </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and honestly i don't know what else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to say it was just it's it's a story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that has impacted me if there's anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we can say on this trash days episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's please go read berserk please give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it a go pay respect to the king yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah honestly honestly he he's he's he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a [ __ ] coat man i i hope you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> uh if we find out more about the details </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of uh you know what might have caused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his early death um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that if it is something to do with being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overworked or anything that lifestyle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that i hope it does make a change if it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is yeah we don't know that obviously and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you might never know but if we do find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out more details and it becomes publicly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> available and we you know we know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe being overworked yeah yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be good to at least you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of put into the public discussion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right because you know you know even if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh you know you have because normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with uh heart problems and this kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blood stuff it's normally there is some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hereditary stuff at play yeah but i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> still at 54 is young like that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lifestyle would have to have player i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i just want monkeys to not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not have so much stress on their body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it fails you know yeah i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know i feel bad man it makes you feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shitty yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it sucks because i you know there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's not really much i can add to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that because manga artists work a hell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of a lot we know we know they're getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we we we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or not the deadlines that they set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> themselves or set on them yeah too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it doesn't help that fans are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so demanding and that for some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason the first question that some fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have when an author dies is what happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the story yeah it's like i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels so selfish and it feels that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know because we we as fans also have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something where we're selfish and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> want yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know like surprisingly from what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw there weren't as many of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah every now and then i saw it i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay clearly you don't really give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] but yeah i mean none of that fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are great and yeah i understand yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there were just some of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> insensitive ones yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it reminds me of uh but it's like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's earthquakes and stuff right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> people are always just like oh the manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's uh it's delayed because of an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> earthquake and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you mean like there's people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like people die like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like earthquakes are no [ __ ] joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly and it's like people that most i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean you know obviously with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situation is very sensitive you know and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was very fresh and people a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people care but i i know it's especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like earthquakes and stuff people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are very quick to be like oh who gives a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] it's just an earthquake it happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the time yeah yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i think it plays into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the overall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sentiment of that a lot of anime fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and manga fans are very demanding for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff that they want yeah and i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we as fans need to chill out a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they they care about the product </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not so much about the person making </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i feel like we're just fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generally to chill out about our passion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for anime and manga i'd say external </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> things happen they happen it is what it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is remember that some actual person is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> making your product yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whether it be an earthquake or personal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> stress they're all valid reasons for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work to be delayed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i i just i just want i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> want creators to be able to create the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] to the best of you exactly not have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to worry i mean it kind of reminds me of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hope that's not controversial for me to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sure everyone can agree on it it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> more you know we i'm sure 99 percent of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people watching this don't do that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just that one percent right it's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one percent because i remember this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reminds me of like the game of thrones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing with joara martin where i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like seeing an interview with him and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was he said that he got annoyed that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people were worried about his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> health not because they were worried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about his health but they're worried if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he would be alive to finish game of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thrones right right and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's pretty [ __ ] up yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fans are saying that to you aren't they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> jesus christ yeah and even if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't say it i'm sure he knows that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people are probably thinking yeah he can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read between the lines yeah of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i only care about his well-being in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> terms of the book like he's being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] held hostage by the story yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know what i mean you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] do anything if anyone knows the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> intention of game of thrones fans it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy who made kevin harris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just sad that's just sad i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah it's like this makes me sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for like many reasons you know there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just so much at play this does this this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what i mean it's a sad topic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately it's all about the respect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's all it is respect the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> creators respect the artists yeah give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> them some space if they're feeling sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or need a break yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moving on to light topics though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i heard you've been watching anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recently connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is which is a rare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a rare feat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember i used to do that i know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anime man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what happened did you guys watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> castlevania yeah the new season i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't not season four now but we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't talked about castlevania yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so good it's so good i mean with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how well i mean i watched up to season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if there's one anime i have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of caught up to it's castlevania </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like what did you get up to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> castlevania uh i got up to season three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so i haven't finished season three i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about halfway through season three yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean but i mean it's just been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for me it's been getting better and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better every season because it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on and i just haven't had time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> binge it yet so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um i don't know man everything about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that anime especially the past season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just blew out the waterfall what's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> good about it like i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that was good in previous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasons was at its best this season yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really the story was the best the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animation was just insane like some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fights even though in season three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fights like the final fight was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good even season one had some great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animations yeah it just feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've stepped it up like again like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think one of the strongest points of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> castlevania has been the voice acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's voice acting english is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fantastic it's insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that they have like all the all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the accents on point none of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> accidents feel silly yeah every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> accent that the characters have it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuine every single british accent is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on point yeah and it's like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do they do this this never happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do they get an actual accent it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they hired british actors like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> love the fact that for example that jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the dub like tried to do the accent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i wish they'd got the native people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah because like in jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> part one it's uh johnny and bosh doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a british accent which is yeah it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which isn't bad but i know there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shortage of native english uh british </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> accents in that can work in l.a yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it it feels like the voice actors they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hide for castlevania's were just outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of your usual they were just amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they were just like they felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> general actors that would act in like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tv series or like a live-action movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah because they have like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have such a good variation of british </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accents like they have like the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spectrum and each and they've chosen it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the character has given the accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> based very specifically on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where what it would be in the uk like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're where you were born your wealth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your socio-economic background it sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's so stupid but it it fits every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single character and uh it's just insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i mean i i you we can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciate it i mean i could we can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciate that in the japanese one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they might get regional accents on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point within their own show right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you get like the subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're supposed to be a bit more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh sakura </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah a bit rough i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really appreciate that yeah honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been appreciating japanese voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acting a lot more recently yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i've actually i've actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> started to watch anime without subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on right so i'm like properly forced wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are like listen level 100 we right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> now oh yeah exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're at the final stage before you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> graduate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly exactly so like the final test </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i'm like trying trying to pick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> up more of my japanese and you know part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the exercise i've been putting myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through is like everything i watch now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not subtitled like yeah my enjoyment has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely of anime gone down but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this helps it it helps so much more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's a night and day watching with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subtitles without subtitles when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't understand something that's being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said how do you do you go back and turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> subtitles on or just yeah so normally i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch anime on crunchyroll or netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right so crunchy will also have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opportunity to select no subtitles so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can select no subtitles if there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that i really really want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what they said i just rewind a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn on subtitles like oh okay that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what he said right move on right same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing with netflix as well yeah um i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean it's it it turns anime to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not just like a passive watching thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like actively studying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> material yeah so it is study material </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you're going to have study </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> material at least have study materials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's just it's just a different kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of watching in my eyes but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um since then i like i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recently i've been watching nagatoro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without subtitles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i had like my first emotional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> response to watching an anime and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without having subtitles on it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt it felt nice because i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh i i i get what's going on i'm getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emotional with these japanese people is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this is this one yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly what i found it's like oh i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm feeling some stuff now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese people feel i'm not i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> reading the subtitles and getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feelings i'm actually hearing it i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listening to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't know how to quite describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it because it was it was a new feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for me well gone i do the same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just with hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because they don't have subtitles most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the time so i i just watched it fair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough i feel big brain when i kimochi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i got that one i understand that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember going through my japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> classes and it like i was like uh so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> naka means inside and i was like where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have i heard the term knucker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> center yeah yeah like inside well i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> heard oh that's the way i've heard that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a word you'll hear quite often yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's been many different contexts yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's that's the word i've i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learned from hentai that i can all i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> always go using daily life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the the [ __ ] they're gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drinking with the [ __ ] coffee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching subtitles anime with no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> subtitles watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the voice acting is just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stellar man i i yeah dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like castlevania we would i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> only be watching dubbed out i mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you think it's it played a massive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> part to i i assume it's a big part of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because it was dubbed first in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> english rather than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh rather than dubbed from japanese to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> english is there a japanese top four i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty sure be i've never seen it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if i'll be able to when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch when you watch the dub it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goddamn good it's actually a shame to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it in any other language yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe this is how japanese people feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with something yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'd have a choice but when we have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> choice why would you you know you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pick the one thing that is best right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and uh this is definitely one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> those shows where i'm like it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not even a competition yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like then obviously it was yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because when i watched season one i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right well the default is in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> english yeah because it's an english </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> production all right i'll watch episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one if this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know voice acting is kind of subpar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then whatever i'll change it yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally first five minutes i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right english then all right so this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is this is it's fantastic it's like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime that is written with kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty pretty [ __ ] good american i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would say that's american writers right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i feel like it's it's a lot easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for the actors to because it's like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> scripted yeah because the dialogue is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like very witty and very soft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you hear the dialogue and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't feel like anime dialogue it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] funny it's good it's very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> witty and like facetious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so rare to find an anime dub where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> people actually swear you know like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can count them on one hand you know when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> someone says [ __ ] or [ __ ] i'm like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh this this stuff's going hard no we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not in japan anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so like hearing hearing it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like said so naturally you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like any like talk to any other brit or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aussie you know it's it's it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's like just ingrained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into our speech if you listen to trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste you'd [ __ ] know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um but it's crazy because it doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> feel forced no no yeah because there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of times where they're like we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be a little uh explicit just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you know be like oh edgy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything but in castlevania it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i can imagine that yeah yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> would totally say that because like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you hear it in an anime or like an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> video game because i remember the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recent example i can think of is playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> persona five of dubs and hearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ryuji say [ __ ] i'm just like eugene wash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your mouth sir you want us a child </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> excuse me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when trevor belmont's like oh for [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sake yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so good dude i [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything about that like i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it gets a lot of good good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know people say it's very good i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like it should be way bigger than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is it's genuinely like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my favorite animes that i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched in the past like yeah i i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really it's really it's really yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can't wait to watch season four fully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah i really need to you're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> be like all right okay hold up i mean i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mean for me right now it doesn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like an anime you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i mean it's like it's it's an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> american production obviously it's kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of like we're about to get into that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels in the same area as uh avatar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> avatar yeah yeah then i also consider </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> avatar anime i mean japanese people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consider it anime it's anime like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know i started anime until i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually watched all of avatar and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay i can see where this argument </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> never ends yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know with this we're getting into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> semantics you know it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever because the only thing i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fantastic yeah anime or no it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fantastic i don't give a [ __ ] if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's it's an anime or not it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a fantastic show in general all i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was trying to say is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't think people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more people in the anime community are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about it's just because it feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> different yeah yeah yeah yeah let me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel let me give you an anecdotal story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was talking to a guy and i asked him i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like which animes do you like and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one anime that i watched recently that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like this is all japanese like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recently watched despicable me 2. it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my favorite animes of recent and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that completely hold up maybe it made me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it made me realign this whole argument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like is that is this anime is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not i'm like listen this guy dead ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this otaku self-proclaimed attack who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> told me despicable me is a good anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what why are we arguing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it's like i think it's a stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> argument this is a clown argument yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just killed the argument it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like the west versus the west yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we made this argument out of nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah the japanese are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're not we're not part of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that simpsons picture where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the people are surrounding the two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> monkeys fighting that's that's that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the japanese watching anime fans argue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> about if this is anime i felt like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were like this is how all religious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting started right yeah like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 100th century </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we just made we just made an argument </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because yeah because i mean [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ask a japanese person monster zinc shrek </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all anime it's just crazy to me </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> and the best part about it is that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> waterproof 100 waterproof shoes yes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the best parts about vessi is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it is super easy to clean just toss </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> washing machine and it'll be brand new </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> climate knit that keeps you cool in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> summer and warm in the winter it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like it should be waterproof at all </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> sneaker so you can just wear it every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single day and i'm very lazy and only </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> unique voice actors in their cast are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys excited for eden </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i am actually that is like one that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i saw i saw little bits and pieces i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i knew of it because yeah a boy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> care my boy kevin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's one of those things that wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really on my radar massively it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i know kevin's doing the soundtrack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i'm probably gonna watch so i could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like great job kevin yeah i wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> excited until i saw the clips that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were shown which is by the time this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast comes out the entire series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would have already been released right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but from the clips that we were shown i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was genuinely like surprised how excited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this i was i wasn't that excited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> before because i didn't really know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was about or how you know good it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be all i know were the names </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> involved and what stood out to me was of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course kevin doing the soundtrack so of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course i was always going to watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the cast list got released and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people like david tennant are in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah neil patrick harris yeah i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what is going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sorry my favorite movie my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it looks really good i mean the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clips we saw as well the animation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looked really [ __ ] good yeah like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way they matched uh the 3d with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing 2d backgrounds yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing and again the music we should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] bang it yeah yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what else to say i kind of want to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait till i watch it i don't get too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hyped for it just in case okay but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looked good it's literally out this week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah i feel like it's gonna be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seven out of ten for me really i feel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get that maybe maybe i get that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depends because it depends if it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how it's going to play out whether it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be one long series because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a four episode series so is it going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be only four episodes or is it gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like kind of like a movie mini series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of thing that's what i want to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm hoping it [ __ ] me up you know makes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me very emotional yeah but i have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feeling i'm gonna play it really safe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be quite like a safe story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just got that vibe from the clips we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> watched so we'll see i got that i might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> be pleasantly surprised i got that vibes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i was going to fuel things by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> end of it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the same way i did in the end of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> monsters inc you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that's what are you talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about well when they finally you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they got rid of randall then they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> rascals and they say goodbye to them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> very much is a great match </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a terrible example </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just like if there's anything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> monsters saying i'm gonna be happy as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] i'm only thinking of great movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right now but so i don't say the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> incredibles i'm like no that's fantastic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i feel like they've i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> these are the movies that have just been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> memes so much that you forget but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're actually bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> point the point is is that i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i again i want it to be a super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> emotional [ __ ] me out but i just kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of got the feeling it looked really safe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but again yeah i hope it does yeah i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just wondering watch it i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wondering because it was a netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> adaptation was it cast first in english </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or was it dubbed first in english </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's what i thought it was an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> original story i have a feeling it might </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have been cast first in english yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because these are some big [ __ ] names </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to put behind an anime and you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally see these names unless it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a ghibli movie where disney is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dubbing it right so that's that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what that's what i'm most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interested about because we talked about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know in which order gets dubbed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really does i feel affects how a dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> feels well it depends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well what language is the script written </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly that's the big question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you can't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> write two scripts simultaneously that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are like one to one yeah so it's oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when it comes to like english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan it's like fundamentally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> completely different yeah where the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sentence structure is opposite at times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think the more i learned japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more i appreciate what translators </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to do and especially when it comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to localization a dub by the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the more i understand japanese the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like man this just this just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't give like i i get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> localization thing but there's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes a sentence just doesn't give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me the same feeling when i'm reading in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> english versus hearing it in japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i think this is why when you first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start out as an anime fan you really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start to get into it you got this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're like i only want pure 100 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translation that's all i want don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] don't you dare change any of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meanings of the words right i think when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get when you get into it more and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you start you start watching a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime and then it becomes a bit tedious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch anime and you just kind of want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch it dubbed you kind of start to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciate when they appreciate it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just localize it and they do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah well it's also the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes there are just some you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> phrases and like you know meanings they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't translate at all right again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean like one of the best dabs of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time back in it like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sentences that were just like changed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an extent where it's not even remotely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the guy said yeah but it's but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same it makes sense contextually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's the same kind of feeling but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've instead of playing it super safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like no no we think we could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> improve this for an english audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is a bold thing to do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had a lot of failures yeah we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had a lot of uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> things that have gone wrong questionable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i do really appreciate when it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> done right and i appreciate it more so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than an attempted translation because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like the actors have a way harder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> time because i bring japanese dialogue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially i mean that's what they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because it's really hard to also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perform directly translated to japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dialogue to make it sound natural in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> english because there's sometimes where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that doesn't sound like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something someone would say in english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know like i especially felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that more when i because like when i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bit of translation work during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like school and stuff like that and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like learnt linguistics and stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's where i was like because i also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to be like how hard could it be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like direct translating you know to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get the meaning across but then when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually started doing i was like oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just can't like it's not a matter of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like preference or anything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like you physically can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there were just some japanese like ways </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of saying things that were just like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i did directly translate it it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just be a bunch of words yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think because i don't know if uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even though i spoke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two languages from birth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i always thought as languages as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all just the same thing just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> said in different ways but then like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that makes sense where everything can be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one-to-one translation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone i i can't wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah absolutely and i think because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've been spoiled because things have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been our whole life we've just had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things that haven't been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> read english so we've never known what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the other side is english it's been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> translated for us and even again even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though i spoke two languages i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never wrap my head around this concept </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until i started learning japanese yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i was like oh it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's like another planet where it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hasn't even touched anything i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know how to i don't know how to describe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that describe this like mentality it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so hard to describe for someone who only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speaks one language right because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember the first time i noticed this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was i was watching a thai film with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney right and i you know she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously had english subtitles on and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as someone who you know speaks both and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can read english it was really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distracting one because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it felt like i was hearing something and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing something and they both meant the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same thing but they felt different for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me it's it's it's this it's this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> language dissonance that i can't quite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> describe right but yeah but it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that i think i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having now trying to learn the language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know part of part of a culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and part of like i mean like an entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country's you know way of thinking and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> culture is just ingrained into a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> language just it's just so much deeper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than just i say one thing it means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another thing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would say that depending on what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on what language i speak my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personality kind of shifts as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's it's a different it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different kind of way of thinking when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're speaking another language it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's so hard to describe for anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who only speaks one language but anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who does speak two languages will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably understand that you probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a slightly different personality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speaking one language compared to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> another because i apparently have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely different personality when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> speak japanese compared to english </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a lot softer i'd say yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a lot smaller english japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese really i think so i always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was the opposite i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know yeah but like i i i also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize as well because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you're in you're in class or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever you're asking oh what is how do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i say this in japanese like no you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't say that in japanese it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't exist in japanese yeah it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a concept yeah they've never thought of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah oh god you just [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> flashback to me in school everyone being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how do you say [ __ ] in japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay how do i explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then like i realized because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> welsh and english because although </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they are entirely different languages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone thinks oh they're just oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while she's just another version of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like completely different it's you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know but you're in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like german is closer to english than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> welshes like um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it it's the reason why i think that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never had this realization before was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the culture that you grew up in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and because the countries are have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a similar culture now at least in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> modern day the concepts do sort of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> translate because we've made them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translate like we've made the concept of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt by both and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there isn't there isn't like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cultural gap right right because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cultural gap is like inherently there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just sayings and stuff that will never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever have a meaning no matter how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you try and translate them no because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just an inherent it's a feeling and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a i don't know this is just a weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the concept that we're going down and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seems so obvious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> none of us none of us are linguists this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is this is all just our thoughts from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learning a different language from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speaking multiple languages um but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think the best thought experiment i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think of is like any anyone who speaks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> english like how would you explain the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concept of the word [ __ ] to someone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't speak english and someone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't grow up here yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like it's it's so i did i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know where i would begin to start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if you didn't if you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the you know if you didn't grow up in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the culture if you didn't grow up with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people saying it around you see hearing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that word everywhere i'm just like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do i explain the right way to use the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> word [ __ ] i mean i literally made a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> video with because they made an entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> textbook purely for the word [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like it's like a 70 page textbook </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that goes through all the different ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can use for yeah and like i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a gag at first when i bought it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then when i actually started reading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay that's how you explain it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently there is a way to explain it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it just takes 70 pages and the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it takes 70 pages just shows how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> complicated it is even though for us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just second nature and it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> makes sense right and like the opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can be said for like japanese to english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right like how do you explain to an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> english speaker what yoroshuku means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because like it's it's a purely cultural </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thing that like it makes complete sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japanese but then every time like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time in anime they say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yoroshu there's always a different way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of that i mean it's a different way to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> translate depending on the um context of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the scene right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what he's saying and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like saying i guess so like i guess so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's not a thing in japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right translate it it's not yeah even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even in wash it's not yeah like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such an english thing that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> none of the words mean what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they mean all together yeah it's a weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> concept that we just make up we do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with a lot i find that faster dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i literally just learned that word today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man i can't even keep up with my own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> language how the [ __ ] are japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people meant to keep up with my language </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but going back to anime yeah going back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> again i appreciate exactly so much more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously i don't know if you i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched like two episodes of yasuke that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that was pretty good the voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> acting i really enjoyed i need to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that as well um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from two episodes i wasn't really sold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the story again i knew about the if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't know about yasuke the plot is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about essentially uh nobunaga uh way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back in the edo period uh had single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> period single computer sorry singapore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> period had uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just met a black guy at a market and was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i want him to fight for me yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was based on a real person as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and was one of his closest uh like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> allies i guess he was very and the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of explodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expands on it but i saw a bunch of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on youtube yeah i thought this would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] badass anime [ __ ] you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two weeks later got announced on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> netflix and i was like wow i guess i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should start wishing for things yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it was really it's really there's i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> highly encourage you to go read up about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it it's super interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just wouldn't expect it it's uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's also done by sean thompson </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thomas yeah i don't know who the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animation studio is but oh is it map but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i do think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to learn act this is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the best at explaining at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the first two episodes i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is wildly different uh from because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean you said there was like magic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's magic there's mechs and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like i'm like i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that didn't exist in feudal japan well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean that was literally sean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thomas going [ __ ] it well yeah i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna throw everything in go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in some aspect i'm also like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a [ __ ] badass story by itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that it doesn't need anything at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so goddamn like the best parts of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like again i've only watched two out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six the best parts the first two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes where the parts were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pre because there's a there's a time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skip pre-time skip where there's like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magic or [ __ ] where you're fighting sort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of sword </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah man-to-man combat it's so goddamn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good and the story and it builds on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> although obviously because you know back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then it could be a lot of issues with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> race with that yeah of course yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually of course yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they weren't too happy about it when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nobunaga was like this is my best friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um you know and building on that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so interesting and i thought like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the best parts anime were that and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again yeah i the story is just so cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like don't read up about it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's tons of youtube videos about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i actually i actually like went and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] researched so [ __ ] like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> real life yesterday just because like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had no fun it's a badass story oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's [ __ ] badass yeah yeah it's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's just stupid it could be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fictional like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you feel like the mech and magic aspects </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> added to that story or do you think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> felt out for me personally i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really enjoy it like i wanted i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hoping you just hope you you just wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you liked what i wanted you wanted like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a samurai champagne style like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah yeah but then again like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> historically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i mean there was a break dancing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> samurai but i wanted magic in mexico </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the music in the first two episodes is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty [ __ ] good yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good the voice acting top [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> notch even in the japanese it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good and like uh you know even in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese jazz game is played by a black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese guy which oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's really cool seeing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know why why wouldn't you want that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um yeah i mean everything else about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i was digging everything i i you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't really been motivated to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the rest of it right i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because the next thing is going to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> me off in the magic and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean the short clips i watched of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i didn't realize it was like going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be that [ __ ] bloody and gory as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well oh dude it's good like some of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> scenes like reminded me of like a 90s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> over like ninja scrolls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was like kill build ninja scroll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like levels of like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that's oh that's brutal it's so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i love it yeah yeah i still haven't seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it but i i don't check it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i will definitely check it out you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know if it's for you in the first two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes it's like i really like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sean thomas's work anyway so i was going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just it's just hard to find time with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the [ __ ] anime are in the season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything right which you two don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know about carl i've been meaning to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch a bunch i mean they need to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 86. 86 is actually really yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i probably say that's my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite oh i can't say favorite it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard it's it's definitely top top three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of my favorite anime out this season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just it just feels good to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an original mecca show that just gives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me the same feeling as like some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> og mecha shows that made me really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really like the genre because it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's been so long since we've just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had a non-gundam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> non-code geass or non-big franchise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mecha show that true has actually been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really good because most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mecha shows i remember that's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming out recently have either been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like darling in the franxx where i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> invested and it kind of does [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> falls flat or like i really enjoyed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> great trigger is like let me introduce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well then you've had things like uh sss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> grid man which [ __ ] amazing show but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's a mecca show but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also a bit togesatsu so it's not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's it's like it's like it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a vanilla make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but 86 you know gives me the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feelings of when i was when i will first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch code gas are seven all the mechs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i watched in the mid-2000s that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> really made me love the [ __ ] genre um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's still early days i don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be like 24 episodes or 12 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episodes where there's gonna be a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> complete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> story i'm really hoping so but it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do you know do you know the story of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at all i don't want to know anything oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've heard that that's good yeah i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> going to watch it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just going to a blind is the best way i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think i watched uh the way of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> husband on netflix as well i have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> house husband that's it yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i enjoyed it a lot i thought it was very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> funny i was i haven't had an anime maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> laugh out loud constantly it's fine it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hilarious it's like two hours i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's i thought it was gonna be like 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes 24 minutes but it's like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> episodes of like 12 15 minutes yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only saw three episodes i was like i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rest of the season to binge i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know it was only five episodes yeah okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i kind of it kind of sucked that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally just like it was just ended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like this is less skit bye-bye </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it was like there was no ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything it wasn't right see you next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time or anything and there was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like okay skid over go the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> home get out of here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because because each of the chapters in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the manga are really really short yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like maybe like five six pages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like max well i thought the pacing was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fantastic um i know obviously it caused </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of controversy with the animation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i saw a lot of people claiming on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ah i just couldn't decide i flip-flopped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there were some sketches where i felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they did it really good yeah and there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was somewhere i'm like holy [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was so lazily done right and it depended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the sketch well i think it just went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> down to the classification because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think we've briefly talked about this in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trash days after that like my opinion of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was that it's not so much an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anime in the traditional sense where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's basically just a motion comic it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is just a moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that and advertises that yeah instead of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but i i adapted i do yeah but i feel if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you've labeled it as motion comic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> adaptation then i think less people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have been interested in it right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately unfortunately but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> also you said because i've set this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> expectation that this is going to be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thing that might happen because i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was that and it being on netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well netflix really picking this up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which gave it like people what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> preconceived expectations because to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i watched it i thought it was funny as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] i thought the animation worked for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the jokes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's up there with like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was just as funny as like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sakamoto for me if not funnier yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was so goddamn funny and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scratched that itch that i didn't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was longing for yeah i was every single </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episode i was [ __ ] cackling laughing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out loud it's like that weird like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surrealist comedy right he's so good you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't know what's what he's going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say next yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right and every time you feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you've figured out how absurd he is he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just does something else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah he's [ __ ] funny if you have if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you haven't watched it please go and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch it it's just about like a yakuza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> member who gets married and straightens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> out and has become a housewife yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah it's just really funny but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it would have been like a it would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been a nine or a 10 for me if again like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if i don't really like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the motion comic style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well would you do you think it would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have been funnier with say just mediocre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mediocre animation so really genuinely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because there was so little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animation on it anyway and there's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times i'm like i wish they just did a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit on this just to help sell the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> joke i i feel like the lack of animation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> help sell some jokes if anything i agree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i agree some of them just just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it some of it just looked ridiculous and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that to me just made it more funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but imagine this anime in like nintendo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> style yeah but like name another comedy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anime that's on niche joe level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there isn't but i'm just saying like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you had the choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no if i had the choice between that i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> always go for [ __ ] nietzsche </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animation even like corner super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animation right yeah because connoisseur </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i think a lot of people underestimate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how good the character animation in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> conor super is that really sold so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of the voice acting performance where a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of other comedy anime i feel have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fallen flat because you have amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> voice acting performance you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing source material and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animation is just like the okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay animation everybody does nothing to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enhance these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i was just shocked at how little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there was yeah whereas with where the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> house husband had amazing voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously had amazing source material </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i feel like because they didn't try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of like suited that comedy style </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and and and and i feel like to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you couldn't have amazing animation i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would have preferred to have it have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just not not even like bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animation just like a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unique style of limited animation that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really helps sell some of the weirder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more ridiculous parts of the manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it is a ridiculous manga and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like the animation style helped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> incentuate some of the ridiculous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> moments to me yeah there's some moments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where i was like yeah okay this joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works with this animation there's others </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i'm like yeah this really needed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more to help some of this joke i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know that personally i feel like maybe a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mix could have like really really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> propelled it did you have you seen clips </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of the there's a japanese live-action </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> adaptation have you seen this i've seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it it's so bad it's it's so funny it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's tragic wait what's uh describe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it to me it's just like okay the main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guy it looks like a cosplay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't it is a cosplay yeah like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks like a cosplay not like an actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actor and yeah huh like the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't like built enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he's quite it is like formal alchemist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that and then his friend oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then his friend in the anime who was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really young and supposed to be like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> young gang member yeah looks really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i didn't watch it like fully i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only watched like clips of it on youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's bad because i i there's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a i watch the same ski both of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them compared yeah like the the humor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wasn't nearly as good in uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> live action like the i don't know why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like they didn't like because with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> animation you can really sell the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absurdity and then the like that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah but yeah but they didn't work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very well yeah yeah i feel like also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese acting and tv shows i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know how they are so bad but i've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen japanese acting in a tv show and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been like that's fantastic unless it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like ken watson literally he's the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one yeah i feel bad saying that cause i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like there's such a broad statement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i've i've watched so much japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tv and all the drama acting is appalling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's not it's so bad yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in like the live action like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when a live-action anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> adaptation of a japanese tv show or a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese anime it's it's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so weird seeing live-action actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> try to act like anime characters or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doing like the anime style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because you watch like korean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dramas and korean adaptations of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's so much better korea like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like sweet home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the webtoon uh adaptation okay into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> netflix and the actors were [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing in it was a live action app it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a live action and the actors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every single time i've watched a korean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie or korean drama i'm always so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> impressed at how [ __ ] good not not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that the acting isn't bad but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i just thought for some reason i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh i've seen japanese acting it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be right yeah it's gonna be over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the top dramatic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> all the time it's like i mean i i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like especially in recent years korean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movies and korean dramas and shows have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like they they are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they are way ahead of like japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> j-dramas and dream movies i mean there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many movies where i'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> competitive english like [ __ ] something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like some of the like old boy is like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> love that movie [ __ ] and that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's actually based on a manga did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i didn't yeah oh really yeah oh old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> boy was originally a manga oh i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> adopted into a korean movie and like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's cool that is that that movie is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of my favorite movies of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so goddamn good in that movie i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] said that photography is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fantastic that's one of the greatest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foreign films of all time and it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's so good you know it's up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there as with like parasites is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from to me it's one of the best career </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> korean movies i've seen so i've seen a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot there are so many good korean movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i feel like people are now just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figuring out that man koreans make good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> movies yeah they're very good yeah train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to busan as well i remember the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time fantastic first time watching train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to busan i was like i've seen zombie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movies i know how this works and for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some reason it didn't do like on like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know on paper it doesn't do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much different to every other zombie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> movie but it's just so [ __ ] good yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i can't pinpoint why it was so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know what it is like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch japanese tv i feel like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a pantomime you know what i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it does feel like it feels like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> level of acting where it's like is there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somebody behind me i better not look and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like because i feel i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with japanese acting it's it's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reminiscent to anime or anime acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which anime acting works for anime but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't work for live-action acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at all yeah well i was asking some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends i'm like oh i was like because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was watching with them like oh are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous are they famous they're like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're a famous voice actor it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when you're a famous voice actor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get roles in tv shows yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's kind of strange because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally the other way around yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with uh you know western stuff and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just odd to think because i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know as someone who does voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> acting it does not translate to the like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> irl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's a completely different skill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> set yeah yeah i mean you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you understand the fundamentals of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> acting but you know can you hit the mark </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you're not being told how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walk you're not being told how to act </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physically yeah that's it you do have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> learn that is separate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's a lot you don't think about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah and it's interesting i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just wonder why i sit there and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> confused i'm like why is japanese acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like generally not as good and not not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying that there's no there's zero </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese good actors just saying in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> general the tv production </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is pretty lackluster i think maybe it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't really think of like the outs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like outside of japan movie industry as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much of a competition like they might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's like because you know with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know hollywood films or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> english-speaking films right like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not only competing with hollywood but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're competing with literally every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other english-speaking country right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every other english speaking production </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas i feel the japanese film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> industry is kind of in its own bubble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they're kind of just like no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> driving force there's no like driving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> force like a threat to make them be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got to step up our game or like or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe the fact that like they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably like just unaware right they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably just think like well you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> english-speaking productions and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other productions that aren't japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do this in this way but for us this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> works with our type of audience so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no like they they probably don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even think this is bad acting right i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sure people are going to comment be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many good japanese films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there are a lot of good japanese films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's a lot rarer to find a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> really good japanese they can't find a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> few in between yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in like j dramas i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> even hot holy [ __ ] that's what i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's where you really i i feel like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> feel you see the pinnacle yeah i i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the right way to describe j dramas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from like the majority i've watched is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just they are very campy yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah yeah yeah everything is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] so campy and you know there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's there's an audience for that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a um you know there's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know i do enjoy some j dramas but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's less of i think this is a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show and more just like i i can just get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> behind this show you know i i like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like whatever source material is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> adapting and also i don't frankly i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't give a [ __ ] about cinematography </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i don't really care too much i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not very picky you know well that's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because j drama has zero well that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we're going to say well j dramas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they shoot it like a [ __ ] like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> daytime tv commercial </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why does it look like that like i never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought i would give a [ __ ] about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> until i watched jade </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the point you don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about cinematography until you use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something you see something that has no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cinematography yeah right it's like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you gonna [ __ ] advertise me a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plunger that does four in one any second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now i'm waiting for it so how it's shot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's ridiculous i don't know why it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> looks like that it's so weird yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like i've seen some youtube videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with better cinematography than some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the stuff out there in jade </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> broad in japan channel yeah 100 percent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that'll make christmas day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that'll make up for the lack of his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> signature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean i i hate [ __ ] on it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't really know i don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand why i don't really know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they care i don't really know if there's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> he's a hundred percent japanese yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he looks like george clooney if he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was just like a no-nonsense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attitude guys like i'm coming to get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> information and just like beat this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but with just terrible lighting and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cinematography </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i'm talking about this i was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fascinated by him i was like that meant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so goddamn hot good for him i wish i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that because i've always because i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like the movie experience of wow </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> cinematography yeah unfortunately the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> rest of the movie is [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what was that what was that movie it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the something still water or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was originally supposed to be the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bioshock movie but then they like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> changed it halfway through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah let me look it up yeah i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly what it is but like the movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like the most like amazing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cinematography it looked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] incredible like it was stylized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really creepy photography yeah look it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> up um yeah i mean i remember a cure for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wellness i haven't seen that movie yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was those that's a horror movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the horror movie yeah for wellness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was apparently that was originally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> supposed to be the bioshock movie and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can tell nothing like bioshock no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously they like completely change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the story once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that threw me off when you said it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> meant to be the bioshock movie and his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> supposedly was supposed to be the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bioshock movie but then something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened with lee gal d wise and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like all right time to rewrite the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> story completely but like when you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look at the cinematography and like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sets and stuff like that i'm like okay i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can kind of see what they were going for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this looks cool it's very stylized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cinematography is great unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the story was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what like what the [ __ ] is happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing makes sense characters were all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when i got to the point i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like would i have preferred this movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it had [ __ ] cinematography but a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> story versus great cinematography but a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> shoot story and this is like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animation versus story debate the anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fans go through right like which do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prefer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean if you had to choose story story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> story like has to be well acted you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't tell me on a bad story with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not with actors who don't sell the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment for you right the room is pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean no because like i i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i guess watching a lot of j drums </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> reminds me of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> old thai soap operas i would see my mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching and i'm just like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this mom like what the hell are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching i i feel like the indian shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well yeah i feel like that's just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like that's just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genre of itself where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you got like the campiest most melodrama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] going on you don't know what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on you see out of context clips i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think i think even some korean dramas do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this as well it's just not as well known </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i remember seeing one clip where it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a korean drama and somebody's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> falling down the stairs no that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bollywood one right there i think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> takes this bollywood like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cabbage of kimchi and just slaps this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guy with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i just like i just want to know the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> context of this because context it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> makes no sense we just have to remind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> our audience that this is a korean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> production </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bring out the kimchi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't like uh didn't pewdiepie react to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a bollywood clip and then there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like drama or something about it like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i swear there was draw i don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man if i'm remembering this incorrectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like he there was like a clip that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he reacted to and it was because there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like a reaction image where she was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh and then it was like 20 shots of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like zooming in yeah it's the woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> falling off like the bell straight right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is that oh i've seen that one the guy's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like slow motion trying to catch him but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like going back and forth and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like this woman's been in the air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for five minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the second floor why is this woman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally [ __ ] air bending right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in front of my eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's just like watching it in slow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> motion it's [ __ ] hilarious i love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i swear she got into some spat or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> something because of it you keep talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah no that's what i i would love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to react to indian like soap operas out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of context yeah i feel like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every other soap opera and then there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just indian soap operas oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they take campiness to the next level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so amazing have you ever have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you ever seen like many bollywood movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a period in my life where i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> with it i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god damn they haven't stopped singing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two hours it just feels like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] quick time event like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in a musical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just feels like it doesn't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> end it's like unskippable cut scenes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it's like get the [ __ ] out of here </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> in like leggings which is just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing just conceptually yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i like about rocky hard compared to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like say like les les miserables is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> les miserables just like 90 singing and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then 10 dialogue whereas rocky horror is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 50 50. so it's like you get the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoyment of like an actual movie like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> type of story yeah but when it's every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> now and then it goes into like song but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when i'm watching a musical i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just get to the story </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> with the big plan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yes yes yes that's musical right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i think i like that because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made the thing [ __ ] terrifying when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it started singing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like it sold me on the horror </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because when there's this giant plant </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> experienced this we all felt amazing on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the set well the thing is with cats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the things with cats is that i've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it uh on stage before yeah and like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually thought not my favorite musical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but i was like okay out of all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> musicals i've seen on stage it's pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alright it's pretty decent like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good story the songs are pretty alright </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then when you watch that trailer and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see the horrific things in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trailer you're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well i've you have peaked my interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes [ __ ] green screen like huge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> artists like on these like [ __ ] cat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically these huge actors being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> furries i swear there was like real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> displays i spent those like really funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like cached interviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really well like the cast were like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't [ __ ] know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you want to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i love it when actors like give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interviews and they just [ __ ] [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what they're in all i hope is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's something really cathartic about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it and like they're like yeah it shucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the [ __ ] robert patterson one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah the wrong person is like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't [ __ ] twilight i can't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stand twilight like robert patterson </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please have we spoke about this before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think we're talking about him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friday well like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hated being in twilight and his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> interviews about it are so [ __ ] funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and please as well going uh like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> daniel craig </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in james bond did we talk about this i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't remember literally can't remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we talked about apologies apologies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we said it already sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we must spoke about it on set i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because daniel craig hates being in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> double 07 and james bond yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interviews that he gave were so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> funny well he did he said he did like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quote where he said like i'd rather cut </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> myself than do another bond film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he did another bond </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so funny it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so tragic it's like imagine getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hired back again by the people you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] on yeah i would rather die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than work for you again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like let's get them back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's get this guy back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how out of options must they be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to have to like bring daniel craig back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here they must have thrown so much money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm pretty sure he must have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> signed a contract before otherwise is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like really yeah because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you break contract i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're just like blacklisted from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hollywood right because that's why no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one's like no one really breaks contract </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either that'll they must have given </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> daniel craig a fat [ __ ] paycheck i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure they gave him a lot of money yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm pretty sure they just gave him a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of money didn't they have to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something because he like in the which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which movie was it was it uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what was the most recent film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh there was one the one off the skyfall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah the one up the sky there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> one off the skyfall yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> god i'm so behind on my body well there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was there was one where in the casino </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a casino scene it's knocking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around where he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was about to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whether that one yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> type and daniel craig gloves there was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing where they had to like cgi i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gloves on or off of him because he just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> left them on because he liked them or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so yeah he bought he bought gloves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah before like filming and he really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted he really wanted to wear them and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they had to like cgi the gloves off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he wanted to wear them is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right can you google it it was something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that where he was so [ __ ] done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with this [ __ ] that he impulse bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gloves and was like i'm wearing them on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the film i don't give a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] just cgi them off of them see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jonathan like cracking their necks being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i couldn't do that just out of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling horrible to the people who have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to work on that cgi but oh you've got to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> respect the level of i don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just that's just a new level of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah just you don't give a [ __ ] you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] most passive aggressive way of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like don't call me back please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're literally on like a half a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> billion dollar movie and you just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> give a [ __ ] about wearing your like 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 200 gloves you're like ah who cares </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's also just like the choice of gloves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well of all things you could have put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on it's just like the biggest [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just i don't know what a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hilarious it's just so cathartic to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear this i don't know why it's so funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just hearing individuals be like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you big movie corporation i'm going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do what i want and then they just roll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with it like i i guess we'll fix it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> post yeah i guess we can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get him to take his gloves off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's in the new one as well and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think the new one is supposedly his last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one yeah but it got delayed because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> covered so pretty sure that's what they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said about skyfall as well yeah they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> said that about last like three films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't know who's going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> replace himself well that's so weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right because i remember a time like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know in like the late 90s early 2000s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like i feel i feel every james </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bond movie there was a different james </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bond no they did like two or three i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think each at least but i feel like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like replacing them like quicker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than daniel craig right no i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chris brosnan did a lot here's roswell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah maybe yeah but he probably also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyed it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what else has daniel craig done apart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from james bond he's done a few pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> good films not i can't remember any off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the top of my head he did like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i really liked him in like layer cake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i like him in everything else but james </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bond i think he's really good in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> everything but james bond yeah but i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like in layer cake he also just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played daniel craig right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just kind of played james bond in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> different skin you know it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it it kind of very felt james bond it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was daniel craig playing james blonde </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> playing daniel yeah i feel like james </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bond is just an outdated archetype like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like it is you watch it nowadays </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like they've they've tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their best to kind of introduce it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it still feels like when they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to put like the playboy scenes in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like this is kind of cringe yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know why but just seeing a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just go yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a very stated archetype like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't imagine anyone like imagine if i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like my name's manny tappo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tapper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that outfit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're wearing the turtlenecks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's why i really enjoyed uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> king's name right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> steve steve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> kingston was good until the second movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah that's why i really liked the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> first movie because it completely just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like almost made fun of that like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really good i really liked it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it became the architect and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then it became the archetype yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that was how the [ __ ] did we get on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about james bond films i don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we're talking about musicals oh have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever seen the i was thinking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> musicals i was thinking about musicals i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actually liked the only ones i probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um the south park movie uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> did you guys ever see the book of mormon </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> watch dude that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a [ __ ] amazing musical yeah and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> reason i like those musicals is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> music is funny and it plays offline joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it doesn't it like i don't care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about the story i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't care about the story of south </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parks i i'm there for the jokes and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> helps add on to the jokes that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's the only musical i can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah i'm i'm not really that much of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a broadway or west end guy so i've </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i guess uh yeah i guess by the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time you see us next week we'll be in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hopefully brand new setup yeah it'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a month for us we'll be like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> week for you guys yeah sweet for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guys yeah we want to remodel and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> change the setup a little bit get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> angles down we're not gonna have like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely different setup right off the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bat i think it's it's gonna be similar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to season one where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of grow our set as the season goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on you know i i feel i i like well you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't decided everything yet but we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have no idea what the new set's gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look like i wanna get all new figures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i want that get rid of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> involves having another akihabara </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> special which is going to be pretty hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right now considering yeah everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> locked down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so maybe you'll have to wait a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bit longer compared to season one to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a new akihabara special um but we do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to do one in the future </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um apart from that i don't know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other plans i'm i'm just excited to show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the new set though yeah and having a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> proper trash taste office not just an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apartment that we just remodeled into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> set i mean you'll get you guys will see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it in the after dark vlog i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking of like there'll be way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after content as well yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna have two sets now so the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after dark specials aren't just going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be trash taste 1.5 yeah oh yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the main i think that's one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the big reasons why we want to move is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to allow us to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> more yeah more content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because right now it's you know i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can make content in this room i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure we could but it's one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things where but at what cost well yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're in a room that you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> despise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's too cramped you don't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make like stuff you don't feel creative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't feel like you want to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything like you guys will see when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vlog it but like behind the set is an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> absolute mess and actually i mean the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> set is a mess yeah the entire room is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire place is a mess everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the beauty of camera angles is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything looks bigger but this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is not as neat as you think it is in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fact like i get actually like physically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> embarrassed whenever a guest comes oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's pretty embarrassing yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the one thing the one mutual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that every guest says is wow this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> place is a lot smaller than it looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah we know we know it's it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when your mom comes in and your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> room isn't tidy that's what i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the first thing i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying is apologizing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the second thing is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever has to explain to the guest that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they're going to be sitting here and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first thing you have to explain to them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is how to get here and you're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh you just gotta go around the set i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like you cannot see any of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> desk and we have three desks over there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah at the wall you can't see any of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the desk my desk is a [ __ ] war zone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that melee is turned into which would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you which was the guest that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thought you had to go under again who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was that reyna oh yeah yeah i think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was great enough there was so little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> space reynolds literally thought that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you had to go under the table are they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly there's pretty more room under </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the table yeah honestly probably i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know i can't believe there's less of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> trippy hazard under here i can't fault </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> her for thinking about honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah everything every the way we've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it is all it works but it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the meme of like the cheeto holding the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> door along yeah yeah yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not clean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it can be about like it looks good i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happy with how it look considering what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we've done it's the most scuffed way we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can of it looking as good as it does and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounding as good as it does but yeah we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to we already want to upgrade it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know get a better system in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> general just for everything have more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> guests on you know have guests on after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dark you know just having everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> upgraded everything better you know and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh you know it's because of you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we're even able to [ __ ] move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toward you know yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without the patreon stuff we would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely be able to consider the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> upgrades that we're doing absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically when we started this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we we were just like what's the minimum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we can get away with in case this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast is like zero crashes just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> crashes and burns immediately yeah so we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> planned this on like as much of a budget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as much money as we were willing to put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in yeah essentially yeah how much money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do we want to lose and then also hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do we want to lose yeah exactly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly but like yeah i mean again like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we said this in the previous episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the the trash taste awards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously but we're very we're very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grateful i think for the crazy amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> support i think if you told us that we'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be this close to a million subs after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one year i think we'd have been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> funny that'd be like a thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a hundred thousand subs that's a success </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we only we only pushed this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like once twice on our main channels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah once in a at the end of the start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of a video or end of a video and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the happy and then the academic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially considering it's everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> else is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> driven by like twitter and you guys just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoying the show yes you guys spreading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the good word it's uh it's crazy man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's crazy to see it and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because normally with a lot of podcasts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i see you have like with big names in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them you have like the big announcements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you've got the big trickle of views </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then the view the view just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like drips down which is what i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expecting and i wasn't expecting us to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maintain like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the view count yeah for 50 episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's also intimidating because now i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff the dumb [ __ ] i say will be in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front of more people than ever yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah one thing one thing i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> certainly was surprised by was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just realizing that some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] we say to each other people like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundreds of thousands of people are now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to you yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i forget about everything i [ __ ] say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like same here all the dumb [ __ ] like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got emailed today about baked beans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about one of the semi-baked beans i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> totally forgot i said i like baked beans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone's offering to send me a ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of baked beans and i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flattered you can't say no to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i just can't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why i said this i i've totally think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sounds like a random person wanting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to sing beans i know i went on the rant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about loving baked beans but that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those things where i'm very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> passionate at the moment and then when i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when i leave i totally forget that i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a rant about it exactly yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i did i did talk very passionately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about baked beans that is me i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a lot of moments right i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you just get passionate when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're talking with your mates or when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in like a [ __ ] is it kaya or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> having like an argument where it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really an argument and you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just very passionate in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> moment you reckon we'll get any comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people like men </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i like the old set more there's a better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> vibe to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well the table's gonna be the same i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stopped watching after season one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> season one is when it went downhill yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> two is a real letter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean essentially it's not too much is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to change really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really okay two two two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like bring down expectations really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason we want to change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um change offices is because this is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a convenient office at all um on camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't want too much to change uh we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just want to work more comfortably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of having this like the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jank [ __ ] setup for everything we do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean right now trash chase after dark </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is running off of my laptop okay there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> five three giant ass hdmis going into </SPEAKER_04>
