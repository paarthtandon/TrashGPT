<SPEAKER_02> - The amounts of blisters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've gotten from Mario Party, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This one right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My god, whoever designed the like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sick fuck, sick fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like he just hated humanity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He woke up and he chose violence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (gentle hiphop music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Gamers, welcome to this very
special episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your host for today, gamer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and with me is gamers and gamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How are you doing gamers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't that funny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean seriously, Garnt
says gamer, Man loses it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just was the most forceful,
gamers, that I've ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like oh shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As a gamer I was not prepared for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a gamer you're not prepared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we all play video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're gamers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I thought today that
we could talk about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our tastes in gaming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think we, we've spoke
about what we like to play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and, and all that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we haven't actually sat down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and reviewed each other's gaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Properly talked about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or at least tell each
other our gaming tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've had like the anime episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we've properly broken
down our anime taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though we've talked
about anime before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're going to be doing
something similar today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So we have made three, three
by threes for our games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't, unfortunately we
don't have a, my gaming list, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which probably would have made it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is that not a thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know?
- That should be a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh I'm sure there's like
an equivalent of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure there's a thing of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just not, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just not as prevalent in
the gaming community, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess it's because it
takes longer to finish a game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> than to finish an anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it, I'm going to be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It made this a lot harder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I couldn't remember
like most of the games I play- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt literally can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt's not a gamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just proven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Like I'm not looking
forward to this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm probably
going to have the most, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boring gaming tastes, out of everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look Garnt's literally be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the top selling games of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wii Sports nine times. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tetris, Wii Sports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were making a three by
threes at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they used to finish within 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I, after about half
an hour, I made six, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like are there
nine games I really care about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have I even finished
nine games in my life? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there nine games I care about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What, what are you, a person
in a retirement home, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's more than nine games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I have games that
I played that I enjoyed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like games that like
really meant something to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or games like I think back
and have like a positive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memory of.
- What, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just think like I hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every game I've played.
- This is the 50th time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this has happened now,
where I didn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There were just so many
games where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that was a game I played. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I enjoy-
- Mother, Father, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please stop giving me shitty games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to play any shitty games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I enjoyed my time with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm excited for this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I feel that, you know, with anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys are like definitely
the resident experts, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like gaming this is like, this is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is your time to shine.
- This is my time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reverse, the roles
have been reversed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, look if there's
anything we know about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gaming community is that they love, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to shit on other people's
opinions, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I feel like,
regardless of what we put on here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's going to be at least
one person being like amateur, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking normies right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, definitely, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean depends, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I'm fully prepared for I'm fully, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fully realize I'm a normie
when it comes to games so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm okay with that, to be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you think you're a normie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I am the most normie gamer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time.
- The Normie Lords. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Considering the list of games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've actually completed is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can probably count on my hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, why, why do
you not complete games? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't go, I find it super,
super hard to complete games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It needs to be like a really good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, that's the
thing, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of the game, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I tried to find
the criteria of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I would put on my list, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was anime that I have
at least re watched once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> For gaming I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I complete that, if
I complete the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's like a fucking
STA game in my eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if it's, if, if I
get to the end of the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it must be a truly special game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine if people did
this for like movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like its a good
movie, if I get to the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like normally, I log off.
- Yeah, 10 out of 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like reading an
IGN review being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I finished it nine out of 10," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like, for me, for
me, like the most, most of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most games I get to that 70%
mark of completion, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And at the 70% Mark, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've discovered most of the things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the game can do for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like you've unlocked
most of the abilities- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, there's some
games they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they literally don't end
until they end, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like which games? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno.
- Any on your list, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or just any?
- Some of my games? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, actually.
- You talking about like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like online games? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well if you're doing
story games, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously you can't just quit
70% of the way and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like there are-
- I mean, you'd be surprised. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd be surprised.
- I mean JRP, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not a story, that's,
that's a fucking dictionary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know unusual knowledge.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's why I think for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story's a massive thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if it doesn't have a good story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I ain't finishing the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it don't have a
good enough game play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I ain't even starting the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I, I'm like, I realized,
I'm such a fucking picky gamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If there is just one aspect of a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that just doesn't mesh
with me immediately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then I just end up not playing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there anything that annoys
me more than a picky eater, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a picky gamer. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Finish your game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially now when I just
don't have time to play games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm playing a game, I play like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I play one or two games a year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> New games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's hard not to just
go back to my comfort food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and play games I've played before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've such a bad habit on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where if there's ever like a new game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just comes out, I don't
care, it doesn't matter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just started a new
game three days prior. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just be like, I don't
want to play with you anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just play
that, you know like, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just three days ago as
of us recording this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the new Monster Hunter game came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, well I was
going to play that anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was really busy up
until these last three days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I only just picked it up yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But before that, like right
before Monster Hunter came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had got the new Super
Mario game as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had played that new Super Mario game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like literally four days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, Monster
Hunter's out, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> See ya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do that sometimes.
- I just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately started a new game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if it's like a really, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> highly anticipated game
that you're waiting for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, but I'm like that with, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if there's like a new game on Steam, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like, oh, it's 20% off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I feel like I'm one of those like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we comparing it to like
people who eat food, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm definitely one of those people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who just takes little
bits off of the buffet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but doesn't actually finish
what's on their plate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before they go onto it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas there are some
people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no I'm getting one thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not going to
move on to the next meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until I finished it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay so, you know when
it was like Christmas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or your birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You ever ask for more than one video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you ever do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You never had more than one video? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- I did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but he was like a hail
Mary I'm just like, maybe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe this is the year that will happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe Santa really loves me this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you get like two or
three games in one, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> birhtday or Christmas,
it's like, how do you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whoa, whoa, where, who do I begin with? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I split this time evenly like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like first
world problem to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is the most first world problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my seven year old life peaked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I got a entire game
console for Christmas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got an N 64. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was like, man,
my career's peaked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am, life is never
going to peak after this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I, what am I even living for, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like that when I
got the game boy advance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was like five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, (panting) there's
so much power in my hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Every other, every other
thing I've ever done, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out the window. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like one of
the big problems I had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when making my three by three was that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were games that I
knew I loved as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I don't remember fuck about them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well there's some where if
you asked me to play them now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure I could be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember exactly what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All I know is that I put way
too many hours into this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I, so, yeah I mean,
we just get into that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we can talk about
other gaming stuff after. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, sure, sure,
- Sure, sure, let's get to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, should we get Trash Can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think our names are
still on the ballots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, are they?
- Are they, are they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's figure it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- They are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well let's find out who's
going to be roasted first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wanna go first? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh okay, I can see the names. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me, let me not look. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you like to go first- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can see literally my name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the first one is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's Garnt.
- It's Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, starting things off easy I see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't wait, this is going to be fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there anything you boys
expect on this gaming list? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have a feeling that League
is going to be on there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
- I have a few, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - As far as anything else goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> League, I expect to be on there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what other
games you've played. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You never talk about video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't talk about
video games often, do I? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like hentai, anime- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hentai, anime, video games
what video games do I play? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear to God, if Fate
is on here, I'm gonna be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be so angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If Fate/Grand Order is on here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I didn't put Fate on here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I mean, I play, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you think about
putting Fate on here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did put-
- No! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did think about putting not Fate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but Genshin Impact on there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really fucking into it.
- It made a big Impact, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in your life, you could say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, then you want to go
through the nine games you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, so starting at
the top Mass Effect Three, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tales of Symphonia, Persona
Five, Zelda Wind Waker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> League of Legends, Super Mario Sunshine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Metal Gear Solid Three,
Subnautica, Gears of War Two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I look at this and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the most random fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> list of games.
- I was not expecting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like half of the games you put on here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I honestly, I expected myself
to be more anime games on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just realizing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I haven't really finished any games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the only really anime
games on here is probably, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Symphonia and Persona, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and those are the
only, like I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what other anime type
games series are there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are famous? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when I think of anime video games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like Tales
series, Persona series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Those are the only anime video games that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've actually finished.
- There's like Xeno Saga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like Xenoblade, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So why, 'cause I've only
ever played one Tales game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've played Tales of Berseria.
- Berseria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh that's the, that's the not good one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the not good one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No Berseria wasn't that good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one with the woman, with the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The red and black. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah that's Beseria, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got quite far in, from me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Got like 20 something
hours in and I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 hours into a JRPG? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's impressive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's impressive.
- I was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> God this is so boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally like all the
fights are the fucking same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's, that's, oh
yeah, welcome to JRPGs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like I'm completely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so here's the thing
for the longest time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've really, really
tried to get into JRPGs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like as a kid, the reason,
the reason Tales is on here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that as a kid, I like,
I knew I would love JRPGs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the aesthetic and
the story and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I love anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem is I hated turn-based battles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I couldn't fucking
stand turn-based battles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that would like put me
off getting more than say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five hours to any JRPG, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would just get turned off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the turn-based battles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was like, as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was waiting for a game
that was an anime game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just did not have a
turn-based battle system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also random encounters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking hate random encounters, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Random encounters suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, wait, okay but
you say that though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but Persona Five is literally that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, Persona Five, it doesn't
have random encounters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but Persona Five is literally the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that broke JRPGs for me because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well I mean, even as
someone who hasn't played it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or plays JPGs, it's still
that JRPG that I look at, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I know that's a good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't need to play it
to know, that's a good thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just look at it and you can- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't play it, but it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I can see everything about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is a banger of a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to play it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't own a
console that can play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And honestly, do I want
to get into that shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No, but it's, it looks
like a fucking good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like with Persona Five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the only turn-based battle game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just didn't get
bored of the battle system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know why, it's something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's-
- It's the theme man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, it's a bit of everything, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it just it's really
good at tricking your mind, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into thinking that this
isn't turn-based battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's that's the best way I can describe- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is by the
sexiest animations alive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just got like so many
colors, the music fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can like, you get different
abilities as you go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know, like
it's, it's something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really good at tricking
your mind into thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man this is, this just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels almost like a
rhythm game at points, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, it's, I can't put my words on why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that battle system out of everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just trumped any other JRPG battle system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I can't, I can't think
of any other JRPG I enjoy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though, I say I'm
a JRPG enjoyer, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have the most basic JRPG taste- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then Tales of Symphonia
there specifically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tales of Symphonia, okay so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because for me, if I
were to put a Tales game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've played most
of the Tales games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've played one Tales game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what the fuck was happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you wanna explain
to me what it's about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I legitimately don't know anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm sure the viewers
who haven't played it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause if I were to put a
Tales game on there personally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would put Zestiria on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which one is Zestiria again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Zestira's the one after Symphonia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I would have put, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the only one I can think of Vesperia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is, which is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just throwing out
words for Connor here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They all sound so
similar, Vesteria, Vesperia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it's like Final
Fantasy one, two, three, four, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> five six.
- I can follow along, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with the numbers, I'm pretty good at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've got that down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know six comes after five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty sure I'm aware of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I mean the
best way I can describe it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just basically a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just basically anime
as, anime the video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's, it's really that simple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> JRPGs are just to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I can get into most JRPGs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I like the combat and battle system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's just anime
the video game, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I like anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a Wiebe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Therefore equation equals, you
like the Tales series, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the reason Tales of
Symphonia won there was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was my first experience
with just realizing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whoa, you can play a video game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it feels like you're
watching an anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whoa, this is, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get like, I can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't believe I've just
discovered this in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was so obsessed with
this, right, because it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these are two of the only
JRPGs I've ever finished, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was so obsessed with it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I got to the 80% point
as I do with most video games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just stopped playing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I didn't stop playing
it because I got bored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I stopped playing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't want
that experience to end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't, I didn't want
to see the end credits, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and know that that experience was over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like I stopped playing it for about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I held onto that for
about two fucking years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just so, just so I know that I have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have the ending of Tales of Symphonia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to look forward to in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that, that was, that
was like the peak of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> After the N64.
- Man you must be able to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hold a nut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally blue balls yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Garnt's like, I'm
gonna blue ball myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's that monk control kicking in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God damn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The funny thing is,
so I'm just like after, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after about two years I'm like okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's time to
complete Tales of Symphonia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Start playing-
- I think it's time to nut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think it's time to finally nut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Start playing it again,
and then I realize, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck I don't know anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember anything that's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what did I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just replayed it from the beginning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like 80 hours in already. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I've put like a good 150,
160 hours into this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Persona Five, I actually,
haven't replayed, because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's quite long isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's quite a long,
it's quite a long game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it compared to Tales when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I had plenty of time to
fucking replay games back then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I assume Persona's
probably on your list as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you've played twice, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh I've played Persona Five, four times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You played it more than me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember the reason
Persona's on there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that out of like a lot
of games in my adult life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like for the first time
in a long time, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it felt like I was a kid again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How, how can I, how can
I put this into words. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I experienced Persona Five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know that I could feel this way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like being really excited, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about just being really
excited about game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just discovering this new world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And God, I, I'm-
- I killed my feelings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was an adult, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then Persona Five reminded me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really did, it really did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, yo, this is anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's a video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm enjoying it again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like discovering anime
for the first time again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah like I, I always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always, everyone always told me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, you're like the Persona series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, the Persona series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, I fucking won't, it's got
turn-based battles in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why the fuck would I like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got turn-based battles, and then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But dude, they are
like the worst system, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of any combat system, any
game, like, it's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Far and beyond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> One of the few things I can
agree on donkey with, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's like the big reason
why I haven't, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't get into a lot
of the Final Fantasies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Never played Final Fantasy Seven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll probably start playing
Final Fantasy Seven remake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that doesn't
have turn-based battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I was telling myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna play Final Fantasy Seven, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the past 10
years and I never did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well because it's one of those games like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, of course, I'm going to play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's Final Fantasy Seven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, yeah, then
the time passed, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I mean, I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I did boot up Final Fantasy
Seven, the first time, on Steam, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like-
- Oh the play station, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the original one?
- Yeah I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, it's hideous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah it looks like absolute shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, I can't do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Cloud with the eggbeater hands? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks fucking horrible, now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I, you
talked about, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when a new hype game comes out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you just drop
whatever you're playing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just start playing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have like the opposite problem, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have, I dunno what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if there's an actual term for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, I think I'm going to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just going to coin a term now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get hype fatigue, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, there are times when I see, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see a new game, like
announced at E3, or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see, or I see all like the, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gameplay and like the developers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> showing off gameplay footage and trailers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, I like follow through that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like super, super hype for this game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think I'm really
going to like this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I get so hype that I kind
of hype myself out of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once the game actually comes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've used all your hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was like that with the
Final Fantasy Seven remake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude I can finally enjoy
Final Fantasy Seven, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this removed the shitty part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I hate about Final Fantasy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the turn-based combat and
the random encounters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So in theory, I should love this game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is one of the
greatest JRPGs of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone always talks about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was hyped for it to come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was hyped for it for
years, and then it came out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I just was just like,
maybe I'll play it later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a really good point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that League of Legends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> killed my ability to get hyped for games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I knew that at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the time I would just
return to League of Legends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it didn't matter what
game came out anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I would play it for a week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'd be like,
all right back to League. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, and so now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I don't really
play League anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even when a game that I
probably am excited for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like is announced or
whatever, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well someone's on Twitter going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the fucking, like every letter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is cool,
- I mean yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll play it when it comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind of like that, you
know, whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh like a new restaurant just opened up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone's fucking out
about, I'll go check it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then you go have a meal there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Might be the best fucking
meal of your life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then, you know, you'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right I'm going to
McDonald's tomorrow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, it's just comfort food, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or comfort game versus like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always that like
full back of, yeah you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a cool game and all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like I'm sure I'll love it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just kept going on with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time,
it's like, I'll just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just replay this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wonder as well, if
you're into story games more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which I think the people who
are chasing like the hype, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are more into story games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause when you're a multiplayer
gamer, mainly like me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, well I'm
just gonna keep playing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same fucking game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, why would I
get hyped over anything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When, if there's a new game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll probably end up switching to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's a new multiplayer game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's kind of hard for me to
get hyped about story games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a catch 22 for me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I really value good
stories in video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But also like, especially now as an adult, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I just have
commitment issues with games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, unless I know that
I'm going to be committed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this game for the next week of my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which finding hard, finding
time to commit to a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the next week of my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a big fucking commitment, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is, it is so hard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sometimes I just go
back to my comfort food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just like maybe replaying Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when, when Cyberpunk got released, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was super, super hyped about Cyberpunk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it got released, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really feel
like playing Cyberpunk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just started
playing Mass Effect again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because.
- But you can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> choose your dick size in Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I know the story of Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I'm going to enjoy
the story of Mass Effect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I know, I think
over, pre overexposure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of like gaming
is a big thing for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because a lot of people hype
up games to no, to no end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't think that people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think in anime at least
this is as big of a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or as big of like a thing where people do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, people get hyped
about anime as it's airing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People rarely get hyped about anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or super, super hyped about
anime before it starts airing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But with video games you have years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and years like pump yourself up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for this game to come out.
- Cyberpunk hyping up right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am surprised though
that I wasn't expecting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I was going to
be the only Nintendo symp, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on this, at this table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm glad that you have at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a couple of Nintendo games here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay so let me ask you this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was Wind Waker your first Zelda? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the first Zelda that I finished. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's normally how it goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause my favorite was
like Twilight Princess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know that it's not the best one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think Breath
of the Wild is better, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> than Twilight Princess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but Twilight Prince is
still a fucking solid game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's only cause I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that was the
first one that I finished. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, when you finish a Zelda game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's something about
it that feels like so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you were a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I, it was
like really hard for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to pick between Wind Waker
and Breath of the Wild. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was fucking obsessed
with Breath of the Wild, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it came out, 'cause I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I started getting
into Breath of the Wild, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the first time that I
came to Japan with Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the first time I,
the first time I met you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like I had
a great time in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first time in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course you're gonna have a great time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember no matter how many times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how many times,
I went to Akihabara, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how many times
we hung out and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At the back of my mind, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I kinda just want to go home- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could be playing Breath of the Wild, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could be playing Breath
of the Wild, right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt in the club. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I'm just like, you
know, fuck Joey man like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, come on, Joey, yeah you're good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but are you Breath of the Wild good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could have said that to my face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have been like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I ain't mad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of have to agree with you there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To be fair though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't expecting
Sunshine for some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, out of all the Mario- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't seem like a Sunshine player. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't I seem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a Sunshine player?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You just don't, you two don't
seem like Nintendo game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, I know you're
not, but you definitely, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't seem like that.
- I like Nintendo games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I think the only re, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the only Nintendo games that are on here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like my childhood
Nintendo games, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was definitely a Nintendo kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was such a Nintendo symp when I was kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I didn't, I never
owned any other console, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apart from the NES, Super
NES, N64, Game Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was only after the Game Cube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I finally ventured out, which I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I just didn't own a Wii. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think since then the Switch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the first Nintendo
console I actually owned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I still, I still would like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out of all the Nintendo games,
these two pop out to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as the ones that-
- I think those two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are the most popular.
- Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like most popular 3D Mario, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and most popular 3D Zelda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think Wind Waker is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you could, you
could put Wind Waker, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Breath of the Wild as number one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd be, you know, I
can't hate on both, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I mean, at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like a lot of
people who grew up my age, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put Ocarina of Time, and I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna lie, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Not going to lie, I don't
understand the hype, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for Ocarina of Time.
- No, I played- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I was, I kind of
got bored of Ocarina of Time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well it's like, how like,
I think Wind Waker again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's slightly odd start right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wind Waker aged fucking fantastically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ocarina did not age well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you play that shit now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is like fucking impossible, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to play that-
- Well that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what I'm saying,
like I've always said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like Ocarina of Time
for the Zelda franchise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is a lot like Final Fantasy Seven, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for the Final Fantasy franchise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's like, because
it was the first 3D game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after a long succession of 2D games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously when the 3D
like boom, was starting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was massive, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So people immediately
will like it's in 3D. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Automatically 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also didn't grow up with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you know, I ended up playing it later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even like now, right
to me when I, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who I've played all the games
from Wind Waker onwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think like when I'm
looking at Ocarina of Time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know, Majora's Mask
looks so much more interesting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in like every single way
this game was fucking weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree.
- It's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But like I-
- Did you ever play, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Majora's Mask? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did like about two
hours and then I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck this is so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Majora's Mask is hard as shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I would 100% prefer playing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Majora's Mask over Ocarina of Time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because like, again, like it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well I mean for, for one,
both are hard as shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like playing it on the emulator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something feels wrong about
playing Nintendo 64 games- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I have Majora's mask on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I have like a proper N64, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I have Majora's mask. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the feeling's kind of the same to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want, I want to go back and play them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I, again, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ocarina of Time is the
greatest Zelda game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm sorry, it's not, it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it hasn't, I'm going to get a
whole lot of hate about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's, the look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've publicly said that I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but Final Fantasy Seven is
not the best Final Fantasy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's again, it's what
Cowboy Bebop is to anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, it's like, it's the one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the one you probably watch first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the one that probably
got you into the franchise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or into the medium, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But that doesn't mean it's the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I agree, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because these might be the
ones from my childhood that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I have the fondest memories of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they weren't the first is Zelda, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Mario that I played in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm surprised you didn't
have a Super Mario 64 on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here's, because-
- You're such a boomer, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey where, these aren't
boomer picks, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Where are you're boomer picks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - These are way too new. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the thing is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not like a super massive Mario fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have completed 64, completed Sunshine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> completed, what's the
most recent Mario game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Odyssey?
- Odyssey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I completed them,
not got all the shiny shines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you know, but I got to the end game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beat Bowser the final time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, I have completed them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but out of all the
Marios that I've played, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think there's something
about Sunshine, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know when you think back to a game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just, it just vibes with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the feeling just vibes with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's sunshine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like Sunshine is just clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so goddamn clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally in the
name, Sunshine, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If you couldn't tell I'm a
bit of a summer kid, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've, we've had many
arguments about this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where like, I fucking-
- Does that mean anything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It does!
- Just because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the winter, I'm not
gonna go get fucking Mario, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the fucking Winter Olympics, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's playing fucking Mario 64, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets to the snow level, turns it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, that is exactly who I am, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking can't stand the snow level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But why, you guys call
me the monkey brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this man sees virtual snow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you playing Mario in like 4D. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like.
- No, because like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goes outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your on the snow level, turn on the AC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, there are
some levels out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you hit it and you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh it's this level again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every fucking water
level in any video game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all time,
- No I get that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm not like, oh fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, what's one thing
I hate about the stage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the weather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am literally like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, like when I played Mario Sunshine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, I, I loved it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because every level is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every level gives off that summer feeling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that summer vibe which I fucking love. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like the, the ones that I hated, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the levels that hated the
most in Mario Sunshine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like the Boo levels,
something where it's like dark, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and scary.
- Not the pachinko level, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking sucks.
- Yeah the pachinko level, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like for the most part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it gives off a very summery vibe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think back to that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I fuck with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Imma use Joey's term
here, I fuck with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I just, it just makes me happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It gives me the good feelings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like, it's like so hard to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gonna be such a
boring part of the podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we're just like, damn
Garnt, you have a good taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like, this is categorically,
just two great games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, congratulations Garnt,
you have good taste, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God, oh God, I've become Connor now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But this is super vanilla. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I'll happily say
that this is super vanilla. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's also just interesting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like, I think it's because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just never fucking talk
about the games that we're into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So like I never expected like Subnautica, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like Gears of War to be there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I love fucking Gears of War. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Why, why is it on your list? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so I had a hard
choice putting my, my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my last three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So Gears of War is on there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it is the first
multiplayer game, that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the game, that is on there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's how I
discovered online gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man, Gears of War was a
good fucking online game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No dude, it was clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And honestly, Gears of War two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was probably the first
game where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whoa, video games can like make me sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The story.
- Oh with the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. No, I didn't give
a shit about the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The story's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even think I finished the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait why am I, are we swapping here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bro, the story is so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally put this on here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I had had such a hard time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm just like, I didn't
give a shit about the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there's one thing I
remember about Gears of War two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the story.
- Dude the story is so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember that this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, it doesn't count
as spoilers anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so fucking old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should know by now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was the story again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The locusts are taking over the earth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and your basically stopping
them, et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that's basically like the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. Gee whiz. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the two duo who you're
following, which is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just remember one guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to look for his wife or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but that was the part.
- That was the sad part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was, cause then he like finds it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but then he didn't find,
it was like an illusion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I was like 13. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I'm like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so sad.
- And this like fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive meathead of a character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> breaks down in the battlefield. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm always just like,
this is the first game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm just like, Ooh chainsaw
go (imitates chain saw). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how it gets you in, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So Gears of War gets you in with the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chainsaw go bruh, super manly man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then 10 minutes in
you're fucking crying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, whoa, what happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like chainsaw man, the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me, the one memory I
hold for Gears of War Two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the multiplayer is just the sounds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sound it makes when
you pop a guy's head off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a sniper rifle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I like.
- Did you play Gears of War? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I played two, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that was, I
think that's sole sound, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know why it
was so fucking satisfying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was, it was like
literally cracking an egg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean those, those,
those shotguns are like still, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like no multiplayer experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the online in Gears of War. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just shotguns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And like that's like the meta, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is like you have to run up to
people and shotgun each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, the shotgun was
also really satisfying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you got like a point blank
and the body just explodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My God, like I like,
you're the monkey brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that was like the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, okay, I enjoy this now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was really sad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think Gears of War got plagued, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the fact that there was just like a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, there'd always be like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> two really fucking God
tier players in the game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could just dominate the whole lobby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it just kind of became
not fun after a while, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you weren't like a pro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you'd just get fucking destroyed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the like, good players. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I def, I didn't play online
Gears of War Two a lot- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was really good online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What console was it on again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 360. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't own a 360. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I played it at my
friend's place a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like lan multiplayer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was like really, really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I probably,
from the sounds of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably wouldn't enjoy it online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you probably wouldn't now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it w it was me discovering
what multiplayer meant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and before I started hating, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Gears of War started my
love for multi-player games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> League of Legends killed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yet it's in the middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - League of Legends is in the middle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I think out of,
out of all of these games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have probably played
League of Legends the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not proud to admit it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the reason it's on
there is because I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the honeymoon period of
League of Legends for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was probably the best gaming
experience of my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was really long for me as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Almost like, like two years long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a long honeymoon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, when you're
getting into that game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's going well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so fun to get into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, it's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the problem is now I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer games just aren't fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you are getting into it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately as it's released, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the problem with multiplayer
games I've found now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you have a new game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's, when a new
game just gets released. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the fun part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because nobody really knows
how to be good at the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's just kind of like
really discovering what works, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what doesn't, everyone's
just fucking having fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you get to a
point in multiplayer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people just realize how to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> optimize the fun out of the game- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The sweaty boys come out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what happened with like Fortnite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, like honestly all memes aside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fortnite was so fun
when it first came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a reason why it blew up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when it got to the point where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone would like
build a fucking mortgage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right in front of your
eyes within 10 seconds, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you couldn't do anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, well, this
is just not fun anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I didn't have the
dexterity of like a Chimp, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on like coke right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like how am I supposed to do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I remember like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really, really fucking
enjoyed Overwatch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when it first came out.
- Yeah me too, me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like and I never, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't make the same mistake
of trying to do ranked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'd learned
from League of Legends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but even just playing casually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really, really fucking enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they got to a point,
when even in casual games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you weren't allowed to have fun anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You got the same or the
same, the same heroes- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you change of Hanzo? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I will fully admit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, again, Genji main, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was a dirty Weib, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason I played Gengi was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I fucking sucked at Gengi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the one, the one time out of 10, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I did an ult and
it actually works out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the reason I played Genji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like nine out of 10 times
I would complete flunk it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would fail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll get killed straight away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that one time, that one
time when it worked out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, that's what I live for, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was one of the most toxic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't the most toxic ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was, I was that
one Genji on your team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That probably threw you the match. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was that, I was that person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you talk shit to your teammates? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a toxic gamer funnily enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Oh, come on guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We can, we can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If we all put, all try." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go team! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can, win with the power
of friendship, come on guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In ranked, you had to get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you had to start like shouting at people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get them to shut up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, I'm just like that guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just goes mute all and
just does my own thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do that sometimes too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I play it as closely, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a single player game as I can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because like playing
online games just makes me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes you realize how fucking,
how much I hate people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People are the worst. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially in competitive ones, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why Like in Japan it's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like people just
don't smack talk at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well they don't know how to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah at most you'll
get passive aggression. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like-
- I'd probably, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd probably enjoy Japanese
competitive gaming then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one talks unless you talk to them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I play in the
League serves in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like 90% of them
are just Chinese Smurfs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So of course they're like
toxic as shit, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's why I
don't really play anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's just like you
can't fucking have fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in League of Legends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like a Korean,
Chinese playground, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're like, oh let's go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and fuck, like fuck with
the Japanese players, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who suck at this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's literally just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally, it's just the playground, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the school bullies go to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just like bully like the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like LeBron James
coming down to the elementary, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> man, just to start dunking, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just be like you suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you know what I mean, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, all right, Metal Gear, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't, what can I say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no one can complain
about that, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You can put any Metal Gear in there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it would have been good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, for me, like
do you know the reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I enjoyed Metal Gear?
- Why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I have played all Metal Gears, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> except for Metal Gear Five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently the best one
in terms of gameplay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is the best one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have really no kind
of want to play it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause of the hype fatigue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, not okay.
- I get it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you feel like you've had your fill? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I didn't have my fill,
like I was hype as shit for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is Garnt.
- Then I found out that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the story was kind of like incomplete, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like okay, well that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just takes the reason
for Metal Gear away from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So leave it more
incomplete by not playing it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What that doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not finished and
I haven't finished it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm not going to do anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't deserve my time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay like how how'd you, how'd
you feel about this corner? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when you play, have
you ever played Metal Gear? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- None of them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause I, it was like, I dunno why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I never really
saw it in like the shops, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was growing up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably 'cause it was also
on PlayStation as well, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a PlayStation two growing up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, for some reason I was
probably playing like Shrek, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Spyro and dumb shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Good choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was really like, yeah,
when I was, when I was younger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't attracted at
all to like the FPS art, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like the like military looking stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I always went for the childish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cartoonish looking stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Even when I was like 14,
15, I would still like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the prefer the cartoon anime style over... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I normally avoided those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was playing like fucking
theme park games and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I was like 15. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Rollercoaster Tycoon and shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well the like
PlayStation, had it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's own brand of like
these theme park games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think they're still quite popular, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube occasionally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you could like, you
could build the rides, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then ride them from
like, POV first person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow.
- It was really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> . Do you know the one I'm on about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm, I'm just getting a
flashback of memories, now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I should have put that one there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've spent far too much time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Theme Park or theme, Theme
Park and Theme Hospital. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I think, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rollercoaster Tycoon is
like, (indistinct) love. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh dude, I put way too much time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly it could be on my list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm just like, shit man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I should have pulled down my list. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, in terms of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I never go to got into
Rollercoaster Tycoon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because a Theme Park had
like the voiced person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling you what to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know something
about having someone voiced, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling you what to do was,
was a big selling point for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was that the one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the PlayStation two one I'm on about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno about that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll have to find the
box over winter break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but, but it
definitely had a POV option, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you could build the rides, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you could ride it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could, and there was
like racing games in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So when you built like the racing track, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you built the track yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you could race around it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that sounds cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude it was awesome! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why have I never heard of this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like-
- Shit, I wanna play it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was like-
- Awe fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The normal park, there
was like an alien park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- You remember this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck.
- And they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> each world had like different ride things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could ride. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like you, you couldn't
progress to the next world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> unless your theme park was X successful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That just sounds like
Rollercoaster Tycoon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is Rollercoaster Tycoon.
- It is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rollercoaster Tycoon but like better, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like Rollercoaster
Tycoon is pure like top-down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and this was like, you get in there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can walk around your park. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's POV, like it was so good! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why I'd never heard it.
- This is the box art. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to find it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I know what the box art looks like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they released all
the types of games as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's the one that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally played to death on the PS2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you, you are, you
are reminded me now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't play on PS2, I played it on PC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was on PC as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, it was on PC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck man.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the thing about memories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nostalgia hitting me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because I fucking loved
simulator games like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't, I could
never get into the Sims, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I fucking loved like
Sim City, Theme Hospital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Rollercoaster Tycoon,
not Rollercoaster Tycoon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Theme Park as you said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, I put some many hours into those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just hit him with that nostalgia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aw this is why- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that's why, like I never
really played military games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would always see like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the bright, like boxes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being a fucking 14, 15 year
old, you're like. (panting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I was exactly the same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when like, when like Heavy Rain came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I looked at the box art and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I regret not
playing it back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause much, many years later I played it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, this game's fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like, I loved
like Crash Bandicoot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so much on the PS2. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, that was the kind of art style, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I normally gravitated towards, so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, completely forgot
about Crash Bandicoot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's so many
games that you've like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> even all the spinoffs of Crash Bandicoot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Crash Racing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had like the Mario
Party esque kind of game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called like Crash Bash,
which I really liked as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I heard of that one.
- Even though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a terrible game right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I used to play it a bunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it was like Crash
one, two, and then you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Crash Racing, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit was so good!
- Crash Racing is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only racing game that could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> legit compete against Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Diddy Kong Racing?
- Diddy Kong Racing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Diddy Kong Racing is up there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is up there.
- It's up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got Diddy Kong Racing for the DS? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, no, you need to play the N64 one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The N64 version, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that was when he
could actually compete with- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well it was made by Rare, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So they probably, I could see Rare- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember like 10 year old
me going to my friend's place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he had, Diddy Kong Racing on N64, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, wait, you
can ride on airplanes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and like boats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was really close to putting
Banjo Kazooie on here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, another normie pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Normie.
- Normie, but it's good! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's good, what can I say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, okay so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a big reason why, that I
had so few games to pick on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pick from right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because when I really get into a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really get into a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I wring out, as much content
as I can out of that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Every side quest, every
little piece of dialogue, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I play it to death, so
I can get everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like with let's say, so with Metal Gear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, so there would be
times where, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you familiar with the Codec calls? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh they would like call
you up and be like, "Snake". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, so one, one of the big
criticisms of Metal Gear, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when, you know, I was playing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, when it was
like really, really big was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people hated the cut scenes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long we cut scenes were, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people hated the fact that you had to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go through all of these Codec calls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking love that shit man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm like, holy shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's an hour cut scene? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Be right back getting the popcorn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the most epic game
play I could ever hope for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was Metal Gear Three the
one with like psycho mantis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that the one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No that is, that was the first one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the first, was it really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh I thought the first
one was like the top-down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like NES one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, no, no.
- Oh that's, that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's Metal Gear.
- That's Metal Gear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not Metal Gear Solid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Metal Gear Solid is like the 3D one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like every time I watch it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've watched tons
of videos about Metal Gear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And every time I watched it I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck I wish I like got
this when I was kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it looks bad-ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was fucking bad-ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, but the thing, the
thing is like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there's Metal Gear and
there's Tales as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Tales has this feature, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, you've played the Tales game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you think about the skits feature? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was skits? What was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so.
- Oh wait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is this where you talk with a character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was a fire emblem thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Wait what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where you interact with
characters, is that what it was? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, am I crazy?
- Kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So in, in Tales games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have this thing called skits, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you'd be walking around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you press like the select button, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when they give you a prompt, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it would just be characters
talking to each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And-
- Oh yeah, I'd never, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always skip that, didn't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like I was probably
the one fucking person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just hit every skit button. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't care what, what time I'm in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What like, at what point of the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just like, I
literally played Tales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I literally, like, there
are some skits that are only, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that only happened at
certain areas of the map, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which like some areas of the map, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd literally have to walk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the other side of the map. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was no like quick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, this is a big boulder, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it sure is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally doesn't mean shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah and it
literally doesn't mean shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love that feature. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like, cause here's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I love the characters
and I love the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting every kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting kind of ever-
- You're interacting within- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every interaction I can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Same thing with Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When people talk about how
much they love Mass Effect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they talk about, oh you
know, the character writing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, the, oh not so
much the game play anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the world and
the characters that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was probably, I like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember there was one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mass Effect game play session I had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I literally wasted an hour or two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in Mass Effect they have this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a Codec function, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like a database function. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they literally have
a database of like every, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the history and
lore of like every alien, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every world that you go to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally spent an hour
or two of Mass Effect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going through the entire
database and just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just reading the
whole lore of Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather not, I'd
rather not, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, (laughs), and
(laughs), I fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I absolutely loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't even shake my head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I used to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's wrong with,
- Exact same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - what the fuck is wrong with you guys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys don't want to play a game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> read a book or some shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did, I did that recently actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I played Xenoblade
two for the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's this part where like
every monster you encounter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> has like a full page
about like how it lives, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I read through all of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like the Zephyros
only lives in the swamps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's, that's really interesting to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like to me, that's what
really makes a video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's, especially because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm like really into a video game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna find out everything
I can about that video game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's like, but the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a difference, all right, ' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I like when it's just
fed to me in video games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people have talked about, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lore of Dark Souls
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people have like figured stuff out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the subtle hints, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you get through playing the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, just tell me it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just, just give me exposition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the one time where
I actually want exposition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All I think about is the
I'm the Silent Hill person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's like-
- Hideo Kojima </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's like on Silent Hill forums, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like, where they discuss like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what the game's about and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like a really big thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a big like contra, well
not controversy but like drama, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because one of like the main admins, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who had like some of the most posts on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like convinced that the
main character was circumcised, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was the reason
for his like trauma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that he was like gay or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that he was gay because
of it or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so there's this whole like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude like Whang made like
a 20 minute video about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like this whole thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like a
massive deal on the forums, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're discussing you know, is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the guy was like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was on like a crusade being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one should be circumcised. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It causes trauma and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it turns like a whole thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, this is what people do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In my mind, I'm like, that's
people who read story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They go on forums. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Talk about why the main character's gay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and his circumcision was trauma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like what's wrong with these people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Play a fucking video game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, why are you typing about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not even surprised by that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because yeah I, that's sort of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you said, I'm relieved
when you like it being, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the story being told to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you're like I want to figure it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is my, is my character
actually like gay or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me, let me,
- Is he circumcised? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need to figure it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've left, Hideo Kojima left me hints, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That Metal Gear Solid
Snake is circumcised. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is funny like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm more than happy to watch
anime where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh what's the subtle,
what's the subtext of this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is the author trying to say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But with gaming, I'm just like, nah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No patience, just give me-
- Well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're already focused on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> actually playing the game, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's like, no, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need to, like, I
don't want to like sit here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and fucking guess what the story is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while I'm trying to do this
convoluted input, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's also another thing that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> also like, it's going to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to sound super weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but sometimes I hate
choice in video games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want a linear game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is funny that Mass Effect- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say, you
literally put Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fucking Mass Effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally Mass Effect Persona Five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mass Effect and Persona Five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are the two, like let's say the two- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Choice, heavy games? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two of the most choice, every games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the two exceptions to
exceptions to that rule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I have, I have this thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if I'm the only person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has like gaming FOMO, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm given a choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know that like,
by making this choice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to miss out on a
certain piece of content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate that so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right, because that means, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that means in the back of
my mind, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what if I pick the other choice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, and-
- Well, that's literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason why I replayed
Persona Five, four times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, oh
there's four choices, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I want to see all of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm going to play it four
times to get all the choices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was unfortunate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I, I like swore off JRPGs
after playing Blue Dragon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I mean, I think
I've mentioned this before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah you've talked about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the one that was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the main selling point
that comments were saying is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was, the art was
made by the Dragon Ball guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Toriyama. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never encountered this
before in a video game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is what really pissed me off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I at this point, I
was an achievement hunter guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I would always go in like 100%, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would get all, all the
achievements, no matter what. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the first time
I encountered the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm like, okay so this
story is two hours long, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or some dumb like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's ridiculously long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how do I get these last few achievements? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it'd be like, this achievement is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the forum it would say this like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this achievement is only unlock-able by, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this one option in this one mission. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you pass it, you can
never get this achievement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just they suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's such a JRPG move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's so fucked up
that they would do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what kind of sick fuck does that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are they like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want anyone to be
able to get this achievement, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> make them play the whole fucking
like 200 hour game again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking assholes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no need to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you do that as a game designer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's to get you to-
- Assholes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's to get you to
replay the game, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean, I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking, fucking every time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like the reason I hate it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it takes enough energy
for me to finish a game once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm thinking, fuck if I
need to replay this game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just not going to see this content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and if you want to see
the shitty turn-based combat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should play Blue Dragon, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every time you start a battle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking the muse, the
main song starts playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a guy fucking singing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like the Pokemon intro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it takes like
20 seconds of animations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they all like summon their things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like 20 seconds long
before you can even start, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking turn-based combat.
- Dude don't tempt me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That sounds awesome.
- Don't tempt me like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, I'm excited. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's fucking garbage, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's Toriyama dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like right up my alley. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I also hate in JRPGs, they
give you these characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, what if you hate the characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to use? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like in Pokemon, at least I can swap out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know Bulbasaur- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No but like most JPGs
like it's, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like especially with a
turn-based ones, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you can only
have four in the party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So just pick your four
favorite characters, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This one, it was like,
you only have these guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were shit and
annoying characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it was like what
am I supposed to fucking do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this game sucks.
- Well then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not a good JRPG, is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then like one of
the main enemies was just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a snake coiled in like a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the whole joke was
there was a piece shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, yeah hilarious.
- That sounds hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, it's a piece of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a metaphor for the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm still annoyed about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I completed it and I loved playing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I literally only played it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was like, I bought this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> My mum wouldn't buy me another one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I have to complete this game- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need to play this now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want you to play it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just so you can, like, reaffirm- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you get that game again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what it was is like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know if your
game stores had this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the UK they had
a three for 20 pounds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pre-owned games.
- Oh yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I would basically
just go to the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and buy three games that looked okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I would just
be forced to play them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And most of the time they
were all like super easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you had an absolute
gold, like Blue Dragon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well 'cause there was
Like one of each game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's a whole shelf of Blue Dragons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like, take 'em, take 'em honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like for free, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it comes with the bag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it like, was it like
a well received game at all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like-
- I think it was very, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mid tier, like it very like
five out of 10, six out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This was my first time
ever having to swap disks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to progress with the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that shit pissed me off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I remember that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just remembered something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- All right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I get rid of Gears of War- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that was a good pick! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a good pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get rid of Subnautica, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay,
- Yeah why is Subnautica, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in there?
- I'll get rid of Subnautica. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just remembered something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Put FIFA 09, in terms- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get out, end the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just fucking remembered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was fucking, I got, I was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a period in my life
where I was obsessed with FIFA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am, I am not joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were you also smoking
cigarettes on a corner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing footy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, this is, this is
during the university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, you're, you're
in a British university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone played FIFA-
- I'd refuse, I'd be like no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No I'm gonna play anything else but that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just remembered something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was one of the top 200 players of FIFA, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a point.
- (laughs) Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm
not joking, I'm not joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like just giving me flashbacks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like Connor coming out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that he used to be like a college pro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Garnt used to be a FIFA 09 pro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So how were you, how
you were the top 200. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How did it work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it like rankings or like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like ranking
it's a literal ranking system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it got to the point where I was just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just got myself on the leader boards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a, of FIFA.
- I don't know how I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And because I was just
obsessed with the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like everyone started playing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, oh,
I guess I'll play FIFA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you demolish everyone
in like your uni dorm? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah pretty much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because see, because here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because like my group
mates and my uni dorm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like super, super
competitive over FIFA, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like-
- They were like that in mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and this was how
you get bragging rights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there was two games,
it was COD and FIFA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just, to me, it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> FIFA was not like
watching football at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> FIFA was just like, (laughs)
ball goes, boop, boop, boop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, and yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just got really good at it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know how, because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just the British in you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- Oh yeah there was two games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I fucking, I
feel like it was one game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I got good at
really unintentionally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was probably the only game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've ever played in my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I got good at unintentionally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't really like
football that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's wrong with you Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- Top 200 in the world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally like psyched 'em out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need a worthy opponent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fact is like I had
completely blanked that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from my memory until just now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it's the shameful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the shameful time we don't speak of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, how the
fuck did that happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck did I get top 200 in the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah top 200 in FIFA and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I just played it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just kept ranking up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just got really
bored and I stopped playing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because, and the reason
I stopped playing was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I finished uni, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't have a
reason to play it anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember now how it started, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I got the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally just to blend
in with the normies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I literally got the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I could have something
to talk to people about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at parties, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so.
- I'm one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He literally bought
FIFA as a social gimmick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah so I started playing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could like keep up with
my mates and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just kind of
figured out a meta, I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know, it's football, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone wants to score goals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I quickly realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just learned how
to defend correctly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you just could defend good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You are better than 90% of players, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that ever played that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause everyone already
wants to score goals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then so after that,
so I've, so after that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I figured out the broken teams, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the broken team was Barcelona, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they weren't the best
team in the world at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then so most people
were picking Barcelona. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized that there
was a counter to Barcelona, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was Inter Milan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because Inter Milan
had Zlatan Ibrahimovic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he just completely
destroyed the Barcelona defense, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he couldn't be
shaken off the ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the Swedish guy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the Swedish guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He in the game, he was
completely fucking broken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then in real life
he was completely broken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So then once I realized that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just thought it'd like, just
started beating all my mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I was just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's just, let's just, let's
just limit, test myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how far, how far can I get up with this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you, I said top 200 earlier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not sure if it's top 200 or top 300, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like one of the, one of the top, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Still impressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah one of the top few
hundreds in the game at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just kept, I just
kept playing until, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I stopped climbing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, that's, that's
how far I climbed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, I just
casually told one of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my mates that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Have you ever thought
about entering competitions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "or stuff like that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, no,
I don't think I will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, because, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanted to make anime reviews, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch anime at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I just like had no
interest in playing that game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in my own, in my own time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Takes off Adidas, tracksuit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't think I will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imma hit the showers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And yeah, I just, I
just remember that now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't know what
reminded me of that topic- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like pre the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before the FIFA Ultimate Team, nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That was, that
was before FIFA Ultimate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the
fuck is going right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with FIFA Ultimate.
- Yeah, so like right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think if you want to have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a legitimate competitive team in FIFA, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need a team of a value
of around 27,000 real month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like dollars.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how much you on
average have to spend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have an actual, like
top competitive team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So all the pros have
spent like $30,000 plus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So okay, okay.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just, just to compete, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is, this is
going to sound so weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> after everything I've just said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's FIFA Ultimate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically they, you know,
again, this is 100% like an, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine an alien describing
how humans converse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I've never played
this myself, but obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a gamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I like to keep up with games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah so essentially what
it is, is micro transactions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like imagine anime, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause Fate, can you go
against each other in Fate? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like PvP?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So imagine a PVP Fate
where you can build a team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just so happens that of like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two or three characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a team of like
11 or whatever it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So literally FIFA gotcha. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well yeah, it's like,
they're the ones who like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the reason why it started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it got so bad.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's literally pay to win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a 100% pay to win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so like to even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so to be like to be able
to compete competitively, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to have the stacked team, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get the stack team
you've spent on average, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like $30,000 to even have a chance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of getting the stack team. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, that's, that's fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like you, you hear even
the pros talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there's interviews with
them where they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's not fun at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you have to spend
this amount of money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone's playing the same shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone has the same broken shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everyone has boss players. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so fucked, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, we sit here and
complain about gotcha. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, at the end of the
day, it is 90% of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not, you're not
playing against other people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's where it
starts to get real fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, When, you start
playing against other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where , that's
where I draw the line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, because, because you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I, you know, I could beat this person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could, I could have won this event, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I just had that extra broken cactus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the way I see
it is that with gotcha. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With the gotcha games I play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're playing against a computer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you're playing through to get content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If he comes, if it becomes PVP, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you are kind of making
someone else's day worse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by paying more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's definitely,
- You're making, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're making someone else's
gaming experience worse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you payed more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's, that's where I draw the line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause I used to, I
don't know which game I played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I found it on like
Miniclip or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I first started earning my own money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like a game where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was kind of like one of those, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you are kind of like,
what's that Clash of Clans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the really popular mobile game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one where you build your own fort, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your square, the map. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then people can attack you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it takes like days
for their army to arrive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this was like, before,
even that was out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was playing a game similar to that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like Miniclip or some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, I remember
I was playing this game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought I was doing pretty well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had only spent like 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, oh this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing pretty good for myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then literally like
a guy who had like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just perfect like Putin's
palace worth of shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just came in and just
one shot my entire thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'd spent months building, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because he clearly was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he had like just oil money or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This man had everything in the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which must've been like
50 K worth of stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just killed me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine Peter winning a Miniclip game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I know right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, I felt bad
that I spent 20 bucks on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was like, I was like 18, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, oh my
gosh this' a lot of money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, this asshole wiped out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not only the hours that I put in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the 20 bucks that I
put in were wiped out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I couldn't fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to sit there and watch
his army coming for five days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you can drop down
the menu, see this man's army. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The man had sent like the
equivalent of like everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they fought 300 against me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm literally like-
- Like the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Persian Empire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm literally
there with like my fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Stickmen ready. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm seeing this army
camp like four weeks ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like mom, get the credit card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was so fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lesser man would have been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can win this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lesser man would have thought I could, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could outbid this man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So this is why people
hate microtransaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it, now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I understand games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think from that moment on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as I slowly saw that
man's army approach me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the resentment built everyday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where I was
like, I can't, this is fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And just watching my work be destroyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what, I guess going back
to the FIFA Ultimate thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm curious, like, how do
people even become pros? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does that mean you have like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to legit be good at this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like literally drop
a house deposit, on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have to be good and
also have disposable income, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to become a pro in FIFA
Ultimate then I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it sad that when
you're going to a tournament, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's probably some
people at that tournament, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are like, need that money to recoup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the money they put in just to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't that sad to think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that is, that is fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you know, normally,
you know, if you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're an amazing fighting game player, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all you gotta worry about is
that the hotel getting there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, making sure
you have enough to live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is all, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is difficult enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you add on that of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh sir, I spent 50 K on Peach, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like to enter this match, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, this is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's so bullshit man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel bad for the like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the people playing FIFA, who
like genuinely liked the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but have to deal with this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't, I didn't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it had a competitive scene, at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I mean, I stopped playing
after, after like, '09, 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, okay,
that, that, that is behind me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally blanked it from my memory, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got out, you got out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got out, I got out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's a good choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shall we move on gentlemen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're an hour in, we
should get into another one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let pull or Trash Taste Kuni in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and see who's going second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you want to pick Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, next is Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. We literally did this again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We went in order last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you want to put these two back in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, pull mine up, put it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Check this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm I'm ready for a lot
of toxic gaming right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm ready for a lot of pro gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have reasons behind all my pixels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And also I think some of
them you'll be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of them you'll be like
what the fucks wrong with you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look at this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Check this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Check this shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. (laughs)
- Check this shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Some good games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. There's some here that I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, fully expecting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah fully expected
- Some of them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, I'm going to have
to give you points, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for the the middle three there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, bro, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially the very middle one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was not expecting from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Super Mario Strikers is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you played that game as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, you're in the know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is legit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it is an actual crime-
- FIFA '09 ain't got shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, Garnt was here being pro at FIFA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was here fucking clapping
my friend's cheeks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the super smashes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bro, Super Mario Strikers, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you've played this game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll know exactly why this is on here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This shit is God tier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everyone who's played
this game fucking loves it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the original Game Cube one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's, yeah yeah, it's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's an actual crime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't have this on Switch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you, that it was that
one and also Sluggers as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The baseball one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just hit me with nostalgia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sluggers, Super Mario
Sluggers on GameCube is so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had a fucking ordeal trying
to get Sluggers on the Wii. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- So what happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with was is that I saw
Sluggers somewhere online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, mom, I want this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was only available
from like Taobao, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something on China. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, so my mum bought it from China, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for me for Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like the one game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I really wanted that Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I put it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then obviously the, Wii has that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's it called, region lock, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh the region lock yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I put it in and I was
like, why isn't it working Mum? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously my parents
have no fucking idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like what is this,
- We bought you the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is, it's the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why isn't it working? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they didn't figure it out either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they sent it back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and bought another one from China again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause for some, some reason it didn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't out in Europe, for some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Think either, it hadn't released yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know, back then it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason they
would leave six months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the release and the European- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Europe and Australia were
always the last ones to get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it sucked 'cause
you'd have to see, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all these YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like I know this exists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why can't I buy it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I had an whole ordeal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I never got to play it in the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though we bought
it two or three times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I play sliders at my friend's place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I had the most fun I've ever played, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Mario spinoff game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think.
- What is Sluggers? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the baseball one.
- It's the baseball one, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that Mario Strikers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is the best Mario spinoff game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well Strikers, there's
Strikers, there's Sluggers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's Mario three
on three basketball as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> On the DS, do you know that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I never played that but it looked good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I played that, dude legit- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel, I feel like you're just naming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mario Party mini games, now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, honestly, all of the
sports spinoffs of Mario, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are all such fucking solid games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Mario Tennis, fucking solid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mario Golf, fucking solid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I legit would put like Strikers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like up there with Mario
Kart, like main line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I would too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's that good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like to me it's like, yeah, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course I like Sunshine, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course I like goldens game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like Mario Strikers,
that's when you're woke, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, I'm listening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if your mates like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to play Strikers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, fuck yeah dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it was always like,
you know, are they, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause there was this mechanic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was probably the funnest
mechanic in a Mario game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where like, you, so your team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be made of two
main Mario characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you'd have like, you
could put like Waluigi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you'd have like four Koopas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or four Birdos or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he could pick like Wario. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so there's this mechanic where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could choose to do a super shot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the main character
if they had the ball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was basically
like a quick time event, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he'd just nail it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the perfect, like the, like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like an arm that would swing to hit it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the perfect zone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you've got it perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It would be a guaranteed goal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was always a thing
of like, Holy shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can he do it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was so hard because
the timing is super fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like tiny, it's fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you have to, I think
it's not even guaranteed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you're past the halfway point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you have to be past the
halfway point to do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, it's fucking, it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so fucking good, dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you want to go through
your three by three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure, sure, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta ask first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, I know which one
you're going to ask why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck is Battalion Wars? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never, I've never
heard of that before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never even heard of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, if you look up Battalion Wars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like one of the
highest rated games on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the least this one is on the Wii, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the first one is one
of the highest rated games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude it is like a really
fucking good strategy game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, so I
really liked the online, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got, really hard to explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it like tanks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, so it was basically
like you'd be given, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a set amount of army. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you'd be given maybe like three tanks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four long range tanks, 10 ground units, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there'd be a mission. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the, the way
that it worked is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would have to try and take
over, or take over a base, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or push, push the enemy
out without losing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as many people as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the online was really good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was essentially the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But one person was defending a point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the other person had to
push and it was really fun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I got really fucking good at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was like 15, I
would just keep winning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would like cheese
people with strats and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such a good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I played so fucking much of that game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I've never
heard of this game, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I look at this cover, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like this looks like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some Chinese knockoff game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No dude, dude! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This, this is like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Mom, I want Advance Wars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The mom goes, "We have
Advance Wars at home." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we zoom in, can we zoom in on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, this is the most zoomed in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really, fuck.
- Oh okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, Battalion Wars is legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a good game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can see, you can see
the cover here right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude it's good, dude it's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Checkout game player of it man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I'm just like genuinely curious, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I've never heard of this game before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of like, I don't
know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's like, it plays
somewhat similar to Halo Wars, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but quite different like,
Oh, that's it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I completely forgot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the main mechanics of the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So imagine a real-time
strategy where you can be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> give me first person control of this guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to fucking get on
the ground and do the work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can swap between the units, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're doing first person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So 'cause sometimes obviously
the automation is like good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you can obviously be
way more like in control, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and do more damage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like the, the like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's tanks, there's planes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's whatever, like
the planes were okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you went first person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could really fuck people up with them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you could dodge shit way
easier and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude. It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyone who played Battalion Wars Two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> will know it fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not laughing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just realizing that we went through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my entire three by three
talked about it for an hour, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not once did I use
the term mechanic, at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gameplay mechanic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, oh yeah, gameplay mechanic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a selling point to games right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Didn't, didn't mention that once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout my entire three by three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - One thing that's going to be definitely, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess throughout all
of my nine, is that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really think they have like super, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like strong game mechanics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I, I look at this
and I'm just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of these have really
strong game play loops, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Guitar Hero, fuck of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I, you know, me
music, isn't my thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like, I like beeps and
boops, but Guitar Hero Three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I played the fuck out of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Trying to get like,
- I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everybody who had that game
played the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Legit, I can't remember
the amount of times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I attempted "Through the Fire and Flames", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, just to like
think that I was good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then watch someone on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a 10 year old crush me at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Perfect at it yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that was
always the game as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like no matter what person,
like, if they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not into gaming,
it's like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got Guitar Hero, they're
like all right, I'm down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And so that was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like such a great game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also I really value being a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is so good at getting
people who don't game into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think, that's so underrated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, who doesn't
game nowadays though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I could get my parents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play Guitar Hero with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is like, think of
how many games you could, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm not gonna, my
parents don't wat to play, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking Battalion Wars Two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah dad, okay so what you gotta do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is you gotta take first
person control of this plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you got to push for the base. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No, my dad's gonna be like fuck off son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If he sees me clapping
cheeks with this guitar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's going to be like,
I want to try that out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And he did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the one time
where you could be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents give a shit about my hobby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But they don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're just like, I'll
humor you for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but the thing is, did
you own Guitar Hero Three? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, because like I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only one guitar though, I
couldn't afford a second one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause here's the thing, like
I love playing rhythm games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love playing especially
when we're at the arcade, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love playing rhythm games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always loved the feeling
of playing rhythm games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never like gotten to
the point when I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I'm going to own a rhythm game now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to practice a rhythm game now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, when Guitar Hero was out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man they were like, they
were fucking everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so easy to get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knock off Guitar Hero ones and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it was like, before
Rockband came along, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is when the hype started dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, it was everyone had Rock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Guitar Hero.
- Guitar Hero, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sad, cause like, I feel the fact that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I started learning how
to actually play guitar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of threw me off playing Guitar Hero. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like I would like
watch people play Guitar Hero. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'd play it as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd be like, this is really fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I could also just be playing a guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah well its probably the instrument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for people who don't like instruments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right exactly, so.
- And even now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I still enjoy watching like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch streamer, who plays Guitar Hero, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> custom songs.
- Acai? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like I love like
everything about guitar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just seems so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's great, I mean, I think
it's a banger, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why don't you learn guitar then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fun.
- What? What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Learn guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking hate instruments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, imagine that-
- How do I get points? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where's the score system? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do I get ranked? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, like it's none of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like people who play sports games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hate playing sports, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well you know what
other, other rhythm game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> could have been on here that I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't play the rhythm game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I played the other game
of it was Donkey Konga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically Donkey Kong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Donkey Kong bongos on GameCube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jungle Beat, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jungle beat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was way better than the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the actual rhythm game was game one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause they had the rhythm game one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then they had like a platformer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was using the bongos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you see this.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jungle beat was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You would like platform
and then like you would, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like so if you clap it a certain thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then if you hit both,
it would do a certain thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so fucking cool.
- It was literally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> replacing the controller
with like two bongos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it played so well,
like you think it wouldn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then sometimes the,
the boss fights were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking clapping battles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so cool, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That the game was so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That could be on here as well, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it was like
only that one rich kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who had that game and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wait you have it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> All right I'm coming over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that was cause like I played, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the rhythm game one at my friend's house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, mom, please
get me this for Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I like, at the time I
kind of already regretted it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me, it was like I paid like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three times the price of a video game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But just one game and it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was like oh it's over now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because for me it was a choice between, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jungle Beat or Tyco. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I got Tyco obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was like-
- It has more replay value. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was more for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my problem with rhythm games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I have a hard time looking at it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as anything, but a party game, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because like, I, I
understand people getting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting into rhythm games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I can not play a rhythm game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for more than like a few songs
before I'm just like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can, I can play for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can play for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think one thing that
rhythm games, I quite like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I don't like instruments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or care about music much
is that I really liked the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can always like feel
like you're improving, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you replay a song or like
when you're going through, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you always feel like you're improving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll tell you what,
like rhythm games are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, it's feeling, like
playing an instrument, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> without going through the boring parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, like my God, like imagine, imagine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you could just learn
how to play guitar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without having to do scales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, wait,
there's only five buttons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mean, I don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have to like
practice scales five times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, like five times every time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - One rhythm game, I didn't
put in my three by three, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I could easily put it on there is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Rhythm Heaven, you know that game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> On the DS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I played the fuck, . </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I played that game so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I snapped two DS stylists
while playing that game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit.
- They can snap? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know they snapped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because I was like so
fucking concentrated on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That like, I literally was like, (grunts) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a crack-
- You're DS is impaled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the stick comes out the other side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Legit I played, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the reason why my original DS broke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was because I played
too much Rhythm Heaven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it got to the point where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my touch pad was
like you've damaged me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like so much so that the
inside is just fucked now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And nothing responded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, your DS is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime character who's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gone through hell and just has been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battered and bruised. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No dude, my DS like the touch panel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My DS just looked like Bucky's body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like fucking,
it was just like shattered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like this guy's been
through like a thousand wars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your DS probably had so much gunk in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, ah dude, it was fucking horrible, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but oh my god, I had so much
fun playing Rhythm Heaven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Any other questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, everything.
- Sonic Riders? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Sonic Riders. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen I know this is
going to get flack, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm surprised this isn't
the immediate thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was given flack for, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just shocked, there's
a Sonic game on here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, like I didn't give you flack, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was actually really close, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to putting Sonic Adventure Two, on my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No Sonic Battle Adventure Two? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was, that was that
easily could have been on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Running around at the speed of sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just for like me, like me, like giving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my chows like steroids, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like dog, fuck in there,
drug him up do the race. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I mean like Sonic Riders, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the one game that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause it came with my Game Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So when I bought the
Game Cube it was when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was already dying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were just literally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to sell it with anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I got like a bunch of
free games with my Game Cube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like very cheap, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and Sonic Riders was the
one that I hated most, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that came with this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I was like,
these controls suck dick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is one of the most jank Sonic games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, so fucking jank, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like the, the learning
curve for this game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mechanics seem
completely like overkill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a kid's game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then after like, I actually sat down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like just for like 20 hours,
didn't understand the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like eventually
understood what was happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This game felt so fucking clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it felt so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I felt that way with
Kirby's Air Ride as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like first like
10 hours, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wait it's not just a racing game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to like earn my
ride and then go into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, 'cause there was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this like glide mechanic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When you had to like jump, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the other person's like trail, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was completely janky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it would like throw you out and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was hor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so jank, but it was like probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one game where my
impressions on it completely 180, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I like actually put time
into it and got good at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, wait, this
is a fucking clean game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I played it so god damn much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I played this game so fucking much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just glad to know that
I'm not the only one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has like a 3D Sonic game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like a guilty pleasure game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude yeah, it was a good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me it was Sonic Heroes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know Sonic Heroes, I
could have put Sonic Heroes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I didn't put in my three by three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because like if I did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know people will be like,
you put a 3D Sonic game.- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No dude, dude, I could put Sonic Heroes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'd defend it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no like fond memories
of any 2D Sonic games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the 3D sonic games,
I have fond memories of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I tried to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look there's one reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was Nintendo
kid through and through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So Sonic wasn't available
until the Game Cube, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why, that's why . </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sonic Riders is a good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If you learn it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Listen, like if you watch people
play it for the first time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like, this is fucking garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the worst game ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then you see someone who's good at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like damn, that looks fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No legit, it's a good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it was a good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I played it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I'm glad to know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'm not the only one
who's like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are good Sonic games out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure, Sonic
Heroes, if I replayed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably jank as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, I'd probably
hate the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, I remember that casino level, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hated in that game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I enjoyed Sonic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember you just keep dying randomly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> From stuff in that cavern.
- It was one of the most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a shit game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I played Sonic Heroes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've definitely played
some 3D Sonic games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've actually enjoyed most of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay what else we got? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean Black Ops is self explanatory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Black ops two that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I, even though I played like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't tell you the difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a big, there's
a massive difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. You know, if any, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which one's the one
was literally starts off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with the airport, getting shot up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's Modern Warfare Two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - K, never mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's my extent of
knowledge of Call of Duty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude when that came out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was such a big deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah it was a huge deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My mom, like she'd
already bought me the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she was like, Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard about this thing in this game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can kill a bunch
of people in an airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't buy you that game did I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You didn't buy that, you
didn't buy me that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, okay, good, good, good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I, no Russian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, Modern Warfare
Two is the one that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I probably played the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Modern Warfare Three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is one where I won a bunch of free shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Black Ops Two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was probably the one I had most fun with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that I played competitively
like in teams and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That game, they like optimized it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like the best COD, a
hundred percent hands down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The maps were the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The multiplayer had
like a good rank system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which they'd never had before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think they ever put back in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was legit, good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was such, it was just
a fucking great game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fantastic fucking game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyone who likes COD will tell you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Black Ops Two is the best game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's, that's what
I hear, most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's either Black
Ops Two or Modern Warfare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like, this is all noise to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all pew, pew kill a guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this how it feels
when we talk about music? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, I'm like, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Has it got the pew, pew? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the most (indistinct)
it's just a great game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just (mimics a
machine gun) the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I put way too many hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's what got me into
like competitive gaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I like really, that was
like the first e-sports , </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I started watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just had like a really good tournament. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then all the fucking pro players, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were like weird as fuck at that time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were just like, yeah, it was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was very strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I'm not surprised you have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Time Crisis and Metal Slug in there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because whenever we go
to an arcade together, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have Metal
Gear, or not Metal Gear, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry Metal Slug or Time Crisis, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's like all right, see you later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Metal slug. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've always just been
obsessed with metals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like act like acts is like
the best game overall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you don't know what metal
slug is, it's Neo geo game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was really popular in all K. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you can probably still
find it in a lot of arcades. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's aged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Super, fucking well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It looks so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the Sprite work on it
for its time was like insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it looks amazing.
- It still looks insane, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this day.
- and it's got like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the best fucking sound effects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The rocket launcher. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that fucking effect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Missile.
- I love those things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You always hear those things
at gaming con dot exe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love those grenade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the gameplay is
so clean in that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't overstate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its welcome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like his six levels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Enjoy them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Get the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever enjoy Contra? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Contra was really fucking difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it was that's yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that the
reason why I don't like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think metal slug three
is like pretty one- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's way to hard? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - is that like, it goes
from like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> level one and two of metal
slug, three from being, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fairly challenging game
to like level I think four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> five and six just being
absolutely fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I remember the first time you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I have like game
together, we played all three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the middle slot games
back one game session. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not long it's one and two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially if with two
people who've played the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can easily breeze through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we got the three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. And we were like, this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is, it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you have to play that
game every absurd amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because even if you know what
all the enemies are spawning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and where they're coming from,
it's like, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause there's just so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Literally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's complete. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just did it just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with you and take your money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just realized they should
have been another game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when my three by three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're talking about this, a mega man X. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my now I'm thinking about,
I was thinking like scholars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I, I completely forgot how
much I was obsessed with sites. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was tossing up between mega
man X and make men too, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Just purely man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> X is just them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's like, it still feels like anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? It's got a, it's
got such an anime storyline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my God like the game
plan that is clean as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot how much I loved
hard games as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I really out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, Hey, cause I'm like, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I remember I completed
Contra super contract lease </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the snares without that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Without Contra code. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Without the consequences. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And my cousin I'm call gamer right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I remember
fleeting mega man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was really easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, because I was exactly the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I haven't beaten Contra
without the country code </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like I remember like how easy it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me to beat like mega man two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be going to like
an hour and like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think last year or the
year before I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to stream some retro games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh I'll play mega man too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I played that like crazy dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got like 30 minutes in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I only beat like two like robo balls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, this game is impossible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did I beat this as like
a 10 year old patients? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because go for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like stuff with like country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never played as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when I play now and
like just pull kills you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's a lot of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just immediately
turned off from like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's it's weird
because I I'm just like have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this conversation has
brought back so many memories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how, how much
patience I had as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember another game
that was, people complained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about being super hard and super. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was battle toads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not, I'm not sure it
was the level with the bikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right? Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I, I still remember
that level with the bikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and having to complete that
and completing the battle toes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, man, I
remember, I think I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blanked it out because
there was just so many hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was just some level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just, as a kid, you
would just mind numbingly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like learnt it through,
through muscle memory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would not have the
patience to do that anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you value your time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, if there's some battle toll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - By the belt battle
toads, let's be honest is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Full of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I loved that game as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause you can't, you can't
play that now and be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is fantastic Ninja
Gaiden for me as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That, that game is just
to where it's like, Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I almost
beat that game as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got to like, I think like the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to last level now I kind
of get past level one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And I remember like,
I'm trying to think back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How the did I beat mega man X </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the snares control? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember getting like cramps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and carpal tunnel from like the like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like tapping the jump button
on the wall, like right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's better than mass control. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That thing was awful pointing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I just think for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slug is the best age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just a best overall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I think it's easily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the, one of the games
that's like age is the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at any like any indie
game that comes out now that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a side scroll, a running gun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just, it looks so
inspired by metal work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like identical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, it's like the blueprint
of like, this is how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you make a clean running gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's, you know, metal slug, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three is, but like one, two, an X, X </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just kind of to
like one, two and acts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I would highly recommend getting X. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's on steam one and two also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On steam, but like, don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's such a fun game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like play with someone else, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. It's so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so different to as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's just a great game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean it's clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And I'm wondering crisis, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. I'm like the original one I think is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> such a jam of a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you go to NACA, do you seem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You still think time of crisis is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the only reason I could
never progress too far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in time crisis was because
I never had enough money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes sir. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think once you get
over that point of time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crisis where you've beaten it a few times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can beat the whole game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at least game one on one credit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like pronounce it pretty easily
because you know, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when all the coming and to me when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to play, cause
like, you know, when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you would go to an arcade, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause we, I would stay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like France for like, I
don't know, two weeks at a time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> My parents can be like to yours a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe if I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you complete the
game the first time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is what I want it I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter what I have
always run out of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I feel, I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the first time
you played time, crisis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you only had like two credits, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. You could maybe
get possible, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe up to like stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So this was like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something over like
years where it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would always like see it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in arcades and I would always pick it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then maybe if I have two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would play it like
every day for two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Or I would like,
you know, and as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got to the point where
it, when, when, okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you had your name on the
high school, all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I would go and try and take
all 10 slots when I would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I would go to like a vacation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I would be there
for like two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, Oh, what
I'm going to do is I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to take every
single slot in this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But then, and so
eventually what you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what I would do is that that would be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if someone was going to
play it, I would just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out and I'd be like, Oh,
that's me, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they would be like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, they were, they would be like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to play with me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, hell yeah, give me a credit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they they'd give me a credit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. I could just play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You literally game the system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - . Cause some people, some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the systems when they
pulled out the plug at night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it would wipe all the high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like my worst nightmare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I would, I would get the
high school feel real good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd come back the next day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, where is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereas my high school,
my street cred gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That name was you though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I want to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People just took your word for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How did I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Guess it's just the old system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right? Of just people just took your word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess the old system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I put the coin in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I started just destroying everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'd be like, I think it's him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I see you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the old speed run rules. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? It's like, you don't
need, we don't need video proof. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We trust the juice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like, if you're a
rookie, right time, they'd go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I would just
like, so I would like get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then like flick
it off like that in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> crisis. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause the way I learned, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, wait, the
normal way of shooting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you I'm sure, I'm
assuming most people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are watching this have seen
will play at a time crisis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If you haven't, it's the one
where you put your paddle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down on the thing and
then you pop out to shoot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That should be enough to let you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I assume if you've left
your house binge and arcade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything even been bowling,
you've seen this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please. The best all came arcade game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can play, you don't live in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I realized right after
a while, I'm like right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're doing the whole like holding it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with two hands pointing your
finger, isn't fast enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And the way the time crisis
worked with points is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you had to, like, there would be this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a smash combo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? But when you shot a
character first, there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a split second where
you could keep shooting them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with bullets to get more points and combo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you shot someone
once that's it, you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 10 points. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You could unload like eight
bullets into one person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what you'd have to do is
when they would all pop up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on screen, you have to
get like maximum points </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on each person on screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I wouldn't load the whole
mag into one character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's how you had to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, not just like discover turbo mode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just learned the technique </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of like spanning this thing, like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, switch my
hand suddenly like, Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I would do for
everyone on the screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that we, no one came
close to beating me in school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And then I would remember
the points where I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think a time crisis, one or two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a point where
you get a machine gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you, you could
like juggle the cover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that you could keep your
combo even while going in cover. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you could like juggle
it to get an absurd combo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This man at age 10 is optimizing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I remember this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like literally like age
13 and then like, it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maxing time crisis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It. And then, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you start playing
time, crisis three and four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So two was nice too was when
they introduced like, sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> am I going too in depth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So Tom crushed, this one,
all you had was the pistol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you could just boom, 10 crisis two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They started introducing like weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like machine gun, grenade, shotgun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, all right,
whatever cool time guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's three is where
they start getting weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they start introducing all this dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Now we're on like seven garbage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's game where you just get shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's like, how should the dead? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, you were playing five the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you said five was all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like they introduced,
like they, I feel like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they did what house of the
dead did like warehouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the dad was an amazing arcade game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One was pretty challenging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Two was quite difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they started adding a
few things that were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's cheeky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That and three onwards,
they just start adding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would just kill
you unless you literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like perfect headshot
because you've played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And this time
is a, you're literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hitting everything on how
should the dead and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like just dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, this game sucks, Dick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You just took my money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a good pillow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Literally. You'll literally
that kid him, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in persona five, you know
the kid in the arcade </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like teaches you the gun moves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally, I'm just sitting here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just thinking, I don't
think I've heard Connor talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more passionately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about something like, since I've been here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also had it on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that also helped him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wow. That was the next day job I had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had time gracious too on the PS two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so when I went to the
arcade, I was like, it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the simulations
then waiting to use that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meme. It was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I already know exactly
what is the optimization. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know all the levels off by heart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there's a thing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause you were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were broke and you
didn't have credits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would legit, like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the same thing with metal slug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like, I would
just go up to the kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, Hey, I'm
really good at this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you give me a credit,
I'll help you get ready to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're like, Oh, okay, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause then it was a win-win </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because even though I
was doing all the work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they felt like they were
getting an extra 15 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of fun where they would've got to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's, that's
the thing right away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I mean, I guess arcade games or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whether your original
pay to win because I had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never met a single person who
had completed time, crisis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause how the does any kid,
my age complete timeframes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like, I would like
to have a fit in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I even got hit once in
time, crisis after a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I was like, I knew
where they all should be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Becoming this man's friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No hip time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fun. Cause I, it like,
like you said, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not supposed to
the games weren't designed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for you to play at this much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is also why they
started upping the difficulty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of arcades because people
would just sit there all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and complete games on $1 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get 30 minutes when they should've
been getting two minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so that's why they started upping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, now it's like
all the arcade games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like even the ones that used to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like pretty fad used to feel good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just pull. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the Mario kart arcade game now it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That scheme sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get one race and it's it's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know like if you were doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Daytona back in the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you were good at that
game, you kept together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You kept playing because you
kept getting to the points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. But now it's like,
you get one race off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was $3. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, just, just cause you got to take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Picture with me and
put it on the character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You think that's enough to keep me happy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh off Mario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Although to be
fair, every time I see that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm with like three
other people, I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they always want to play a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then every time you play
it, you're like, all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people want to play it
because it's Mario cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and people please worse
than the actual Mario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's supposed to be better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so passionate about
because arcade games suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Now the fall of arcade
games, there's some good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the rise and fall, absolute state. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You spoke about it on the podcast for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but typing of the dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I hope it, I think I hope it isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the one that closed down
because one of the game centers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in AQI Habra closed down and
only one of them had typing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the debt because you've done
a lot of typing of the net. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's Google it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. That's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Jojo battle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Royales okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's like a, it's
like an unreal engine mod. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no real arcade games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Knacks. Oh we can Mac one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We've been spoken about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - we don't know what it's
called, but here it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So we don't want, it looks like you get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A Mac. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you literally sit in the cockpit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Put a seatbelt on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's like gas pedals drift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And it's like four D cinema. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it would actually, it moves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It moves as you are flying about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you are literally as close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a Mecca pilot as you can possibly be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's got ranked PVP literally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you literally like
you all jump in the mechs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the boys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and PVP against other flare
really captured the flag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like domination for Cod, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And yeah, you
literally like, it's so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause when you smack down thrust and drift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pedal the chat jumps back jumps back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then it's like, yeah, like what's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like when a chain's going
up on the roller coaster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you, did you like drifting,
like drifting in the end? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just flowering myself at
the same time with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever you load the other
one, as you knock it off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this player, come to their pen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've got to chase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like everyone says rhythm games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, this is the best arcade
game I've played in Japan bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> None. I believe it's is it Sega? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've only seen it in a
few are like sort of round </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Sega, but like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's is it $2 or $3 a play? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not enough play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think one play can cost you, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like 15 minutes, 15, 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd happily play like
pay like five pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If it was like in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause my God, you get to pilot a Mecca. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even know
what's going on so I can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read what the the they're
saying like I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I can read what they're saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I didn't give a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not important to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Before we move on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I, I like, I I'm wondering why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Before we get tailored ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm wondering why you put
apex over, over league. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Is this recency bias? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's definitely been a recency bias. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno for me, Leah legends
was fun and I really, really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really enjoyed the time I had with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it could easily be on here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I think apex is on here just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like our apex made
learning Japanese fun for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Like, isn't that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't that fun because
you're actually using it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And like, for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apex has been such a door
opener like right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's just like, everyone's
playing apex right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like it's so easy
to be like, yo play PAX. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just jump in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Like I dunno, just anyone it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially Japanese or like V tubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, yeah, let's play apex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's chill out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like it's, it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I just started
playing it recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have been playing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did stop playing it at launch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the game's only gotten
bigger and better now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's raw for games,
especially battle Royale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I feel like it's more
popular now than ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And I would say that and it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Massive in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> VG was man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They, they just broke the system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, you know, it's,
it's crazy seeing how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when it came out, you know, the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of apex is that they, they
literally announced apex legends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you knew this
a day before it came out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Really? Because what happened
was is that it made was made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the same people it's tightened full. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So EA thought,
it says published by Ja </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's made by respond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The people who made Titanfall,
who made call of duty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> modern warfare two back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you have that, you have that
clean FPS gameplay combined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a naughty movement of Titanfall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what happened was is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they literally were
just like, Oh, by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's a new bottle way out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they thought it was going to bomb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the same people who had made Titanfall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with no Titans in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And everyone was
like, yeah, I'm not playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that where the max the
maximum, the best part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But yeah, no, it was
a surprise hit it blew up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The gameplay is so clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've liked from what I heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apex was just better Royales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just with every mechanic refined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, it's really like weirdly one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the most beginner
friendly battery, I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Well, what I want
to know is, has it gotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a point where
everyone's just really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the game yet there's a
Metta and everything's broken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good. The matchmaking
is surprisingly good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when I play ranked,
I really struggled like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> against people, my own level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I go in like normals, if
I'm like playing with someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's like got a really bad
stats to like, even as out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I can feel like a God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know, so like in other words, yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I play with some
people who are like, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> arguably have no hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they seem to have
the time with that life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I, you know, to me, I
would be like, that's not fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they seem to, you know,
they like, again, people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, cause it's such
a position, heavy game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not about mechanics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more about do like, okay, are you, if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you standing out in the open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone else is on the
high ground shooting at you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll probably going to die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't need to have like aim God CS go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, I hate that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fortnite felt like that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that like, if you
just have like some form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of game knowledge, which you
can easily learn, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's easy and all the
characters are already unique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really think you guys should try it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Try it out with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Apex trash day stress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally every episode,
every episode it keeps saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trash tastes apex when it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, and legit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've made so many new
friends from it and yeah, like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I said, the other day I actually met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up with people who I met up on apex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I met on apex, two Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guys spent the whole night trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Talk. Japanese is
very like taxing my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized I was an hour
into talking only Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta do this for like
another four hours of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not being able to communicate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It will do wonders though for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I definitely
have like the basics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> completely locked down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's all muscle memory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I could just say, just talk nonsense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and big, you know, all the stuff you need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It was fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it was just crazy to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I met these guys from just chatting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a video game, literally just going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> into the lobby and
screaming, broken Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I was hanging
out with them, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. It was just chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's all about the friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I honestly can't
say about league of legends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You made friends from
legal legends, but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it just felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I can't imagine making
a friend from a guy you met </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a lobby and illegal legends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I bought that's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good friendships with
them, like with age with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it was always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were the same rank
we played rank together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's always this
weird thing of like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were like, we, our
friendship was tangential </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the fact that we
were both the same brand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were good enough to play together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in apex it's like, ah,
you know, I, I, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I play with a guy who is called Killshot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like a 45 year old man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Like West Japan, who's awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at the game, but he's, he's really funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so like, that's like,
you know, I like playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with him just like there's
no, it feels chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a really chill game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it can be a really intense
game if you want it to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, perfect because
it has like enough Lowes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in it where you can just talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when the moments
where you're like fighting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's focused on fighting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's why it's on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I legitimately think it's
the best battery I've played. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've played so many of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It deserves to be on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a great game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Play apex legends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And finally halo Wars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll quickly talk about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I played, I've probably put
more hours into any game here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Halo was a part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the game I put most hours
into really why halo Wars? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was ma what made me fall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in love with RTS is that game
was terribly unrefined and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and awfully unbalanced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never played Wars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's all I've heard about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like extremely unbalanced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the case of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was very fortunate that
my, my fault, like I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had three best friends
and we all loved halo Wars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was a case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of every single day we just
went home and played halo Wars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just like the
perfect game to chat to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and also be like, you
know, do this, do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I really liked
the idea of RTS games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I like, I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember playing command
and conquer so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my, that was my RTS game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I like, I've never
got into RTS, like more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than just build a bunch of
soldiers and then click on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> click on anyone who looks at you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Funny. That's like my
tactics when it comes to RTS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the one thing
that I really loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about hail Wars is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it really did two
V two and three B three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I can't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of a single RTS game
that has three V three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the new name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always one V one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I find that like boring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fact that I can be there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with my mates and we
can all back each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up and then like you kill one dude's army. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is his friend's army
is literally coming to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wipe you out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then you're like, bro,
bringing your mommy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And actually sounds really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause that's so I guess that's
the reason I never played PVP </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in any RTS, even though
I know there is there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just played the
campaign and I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can complete the campaign. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, and it's a chill game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the games would never more
than 20 for 20, 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were normally 15, 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was great because what
would happen is, is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, there would just
be moments where you'll meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or there would be like all three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of them would be attacking
your mate and none </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of you are ready and you're
like, yeah, I'll see ya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm, I'm just realizing my, my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my three by three is a lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is red alert? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're not on my come command
and conquer red alert too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a amazing game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And not many people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember it was pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's on a, you play on PC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now the civilization
games, RTS like turn base </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like almost turn base on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - like crazy back in the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's in the category. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The category was like a different style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I play civilization
every now and again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know, when
you get that feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just replaying a game
every now and again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I get that with save
sometimes and I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I play one game and lost
it lost like eight hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, that's that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's that's my one out
the window now I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I see halo Wars is a great game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure if anyone played it,

<SPEAKER_02> - Three. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. Let me ask shocked by any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So you're like a death
below, like completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally then you haven't
gone for final fantasy seven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, no, I think six is like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the second normal choice Terraria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Terraria was like up in your top night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Terraria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've dead us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you go on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My steam, I've played
Terraria for about 500 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so insecure when I first came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out. Like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Yeah, I'm done
talking about the son of five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really need to talk
about breath of the wild. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously. Why should Marywood
out of all of the murders? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Super a wall for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Because a lot of these games, like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> especially the older ones,
like cubbies nightmare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and dreamland and final fantasy
six and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got them as hand-me-downs
from my cousin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like basically all the super Nintendo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Games and like especially
Kirby games, especially. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. All hammy downs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and super Mario Wald was one
of the first like Mario games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like properly sat down
knowing it was a Mario game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, you know, there's like
games when you're like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really young where it's
just like, this is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a video game, but I don't
know like what this is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a fun thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's on my screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Kinda. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But super Mario Wald was the one where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, okay, I'm playing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Knowing fully well that
this is a Mario game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that I love Mario game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally like one of
the best games of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's one of the Fest platforms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it was a tie between
Sumara Walt for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we can only choose
one game per franchise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So obviously for
a Mario game, hottest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me to choose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was a tie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between super Mario
world and Yoshi's Island. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, Yoshi's Island. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, both of them are
like equal number one for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I, I GN top games of all, honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except for Joey's like
individually clarinet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for me was just like, okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what I'm like really
sold me on like animating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of everything on here
that like, well, will I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that will make it known
that it's a Joey list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's clan out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you remove that, she have no idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If you removed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That, it's like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see you were also born in the nineties. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you've typed in top, top, top </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> top game, boy game, top NSN S game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you've been
like, I'll have those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which, which Mario is
it where there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a level where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The sun trying to kill you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's my brother's story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had nightmares of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? That song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't beat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I kept, I kept having nightmares. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm trying to kill that level is hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you guys ever played
the original merrier? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've actually
played every mainline Mark </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - intend to rereleases it every year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just pay me 10 bucks for the same game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Did you play as a kid? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As a kid, did you want to eat the shock? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The bricks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was that just me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As a kid, I remember I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This thing's memory of
just looking at the bricks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just thinking, man,
those look delicious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They kind of looked like shocked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope you didn't say that out loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause your parents were like, Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We should take this game away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just me again, my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. I think my three
by three is a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a lie because there's
a bunch of games on here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me, I was like,
okay, for me through and through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was always a Nintendo SIM Nintendo seem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the moment I got my
first game consult to today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because of that, I feel I've kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of put too many Nintendo
games on my three by three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I mean like it's, it's, it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the first thing that
came to your mind, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But I would, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's one game that I would pull it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on here on the X-Box and a
that's a team called SSX tricky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sixth street. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. For those of you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is extra snowboarding game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And it ha did you
play snowboard kids as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well on the, in 64? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was that just me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I played a little bit of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I played a little bit of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was the first time I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a sixth street because
I think my dad got it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because like my dad was the
one who bought the X-Box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he wanted to play it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bunch of like racing car games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of the racing car games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that me and my dad bonded
over was burnout three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's amazing, which I would also put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my three by three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like he also brought home
this game called SSX tricky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I never cared
about snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know what the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This thing even seen snow
live in Australia Legit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The first time I ever saw snow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't necessary Played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the moment you hear
that title screen music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, hell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like to me, I'm just getting reminded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - SSX tricky is on like the same level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As Tony Hawk in my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In terms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just addictive gameplay
with Tony Hawk's pro skater </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Too. I haven't played
any of these games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the one thing I optimize the out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of SSX because it was
probably the one game where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, no, no, no, this
isn't the perfect score. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I can fit one
more trick into this, Joe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're addicted to a game, it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I could fit like one more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one 80 into this like
trick combo on this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would just keep playing this over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and over and over and over again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I a hundred percent of it actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was probably one of the
first games, a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was close to a
hundred percent in it as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, all of these games,
I have a hundred percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in terms of like Pokemon silver </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the original silver,
it's the one game where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've actually broken
the end game time off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I played so much of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How'd you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The end game time of the
Maxine game time as 999 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's reasonable,
which is reasonable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a thousand hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. But the only way I achieve that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of like, you
know, obviously you play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the game and
then you're like, okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well I finished, I've
gotten all 16 badges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do I do now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Complete the decks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. I'll do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the step after that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get every Pokemon to level a hundred. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. I've done that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. Get all the Chinese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did that to myself
because at the time, right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was borrowing my friend's GameBoy Cola. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. Like we kind of like, this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during the time where
like I had like a couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of childhood friends,
like lived nearby where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we met each other often
enough where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can I borrow you in 64? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or can I borrow your super
Nintendo or whatever? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. So I never actually
owned the game boy color. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, but I had Pokemon silver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't remember where I go to from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I borrowed it
from a friend that again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably like probably
something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like I borrowed the
game book enough times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was like, and
it was the only game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also Silva was the
only game boy color game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, whenever I sold the gamble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of college was sitting at my desk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Oh, I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can just play this,
going to kill some time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And as a kid, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have no concept of time
as you're playing a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So it was like,
so yeah, I just was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well literally got nothing
else to do other than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'll just try and
catch all the Chinese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like torture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I maxed out the in game clock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, Oh, 999 is the max. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now. Jesus Christ, Joey,
I'm telling you, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think you'll like, you
know, God thinks he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, once you're into a
game, you get addicted to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get no, no, no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're you're on another level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like Kirby's a nightmare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And dreamland was the
first ever game I owned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the gateway advance
was the first console. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've played that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never played a single Coby game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This game was the game
that got me to Kirby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I, since then, I love every Kobe game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm telling you, like,
if you're ever feeling sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just play a Kirby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It might be the most like childish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I'm gonna prescribe
you a copy of Covey's dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like literally, like you
might think it's like childish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Dom and like easy or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it is literally
impossible to play a Kirby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And not be happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just the challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Except there is, there's
something about speed running. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it where it's like,
yeah, I might be in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - mood and I'll play it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 30 minutes of any Kirby
game immediately happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And like, I think
that's why I liked playing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I was like, I don't want
to play a game that makes me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, later on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my adult I was like, yes,
heavy rain, metal gear, solid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me all of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yes. I would like a bit of
depression and, and I think again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's another reason
why I like played a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like animal crossing, for
example, or like, you know, again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Pokemon it's like
you put animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the top nine in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in particular while, while we
had honestly wild wild world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Specifically, because I
was obsessed with the DS </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this was one of the few
DSPs, this is the D S one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hit a lot of like,
you know, now that now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people have like calmed
down of an animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first one, I've heard
a lot of people being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, it is good, but
just feel like it's lacking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a lot of ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that they're adding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the functions that were in
the previous ones literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Add-ons that they currently had on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is going to sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So Doug boomer or not, not boomer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like what is the
point of animal crossing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm trying to understand
why there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anti-vaxxers when I'm watching that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like, I hear, I hear what you're saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it, but I'm seeing it and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get it at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally get people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is why I was really shocked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at how popular the newest one got. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because to me, animal crossing
a lot, like harvest moon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always thought was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that one niche series where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you want into it from the beginning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't matter how many
new games they bring out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll never get into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like the more people talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, this is just a pay
your mortgage simulator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - . And I'm like, okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you go hit that rock and
then you get some stones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. And then you go and talk to a guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he gives you a recipe for
something that you didn't want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you go and make that thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like a cabinet
that you might not need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then are confused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't want to, you can sell it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything is just seems so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slow. And of course it's an intender </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so is just unnecessarily
complicated and convoluted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I saw someone going to
like someone else's Island </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it took like a minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like cutscenes to go to
someone's Island or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, everything
just seems slope in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's the entire
point of animal crossing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's supposed to be slow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's not supposed to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh wait, I hate games that make me wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's the slice
of life of video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is crossing Sims harvest moon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> See, I get all like, like
I get the Sims though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Because you're kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're kind of trying, you, you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're kind of like
living a life that maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that maybe you couldn't
like live in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never got into the Sims. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never going to see the
SIM Sims is really boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Now we'll cross this kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of thing is I've really
liked simulation games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've never like never
a life simulator game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always liked, you know,
why I never go into the Sims. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cute. Honestly, I understand
that you will get harvest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Moon. You look at animal crossing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, that's a dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was, I was never into Sims. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But like when I started voice acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a weird tangent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I started seeing Sims voice
acting project, everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People making their own movies in Sims. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was a huge thing like Machinima. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And I was just like, what the? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is ugly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it looks dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like the animations
of Sims, like yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they would, you'd
have to like voice back to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, I'm not
auditioning for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's part of the like old age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the internet campiness to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it has its own charm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oscar worthy drama performed via SIM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, what the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's the whole appeal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? Because when animal
crossing first came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've read this somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and correct me if I'm wrong internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think the whole appeal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of animal crossing was it
was supposed to be marketed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> towards Housewives in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who wanted something to do
as you know, their husbands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or significant others
were out working all day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's literally how they
market it because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a non challenging game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not literally, it was like, it
was a game where it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you tired of being
in the kitchen all day? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, because it's,
it's so not challenging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also it's, non-stressful
either, it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a game that like literally
gets all your stress off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you forget about
everything in the real world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Well you can just focus
on a completely separate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just there are no stressors
or no, I guess like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad things to happen with like
any consequence whatsoever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally Nintendo was
like, I'm a create a distraction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for stressed adults and
call it animal crossing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember my
first and only experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with animal crossing was
the original animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the game cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the only reason I
knew about it right was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't, I think for
the longest time, it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't available in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it was only available. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they translates
there, but it was only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> available in the U S
and I had about it from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like this Nintendo gaming, PC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their gaming magazine, gaming
magazine, gaming magazine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I meant to say,
this Nintendo gaming magazine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, it just
got like super good reviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, Holy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this must be a banger of a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every review is giving us a source. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every review stimulus
five five-hour, five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, Holy, this, this, this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a musket game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is this not available in the UK? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I literally had to like look
up some like impor websites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I seriously, like I
had to import animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the U S by like a
specialized import disc where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because yeah, because old
GameCube games will region loads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you couldn't just put a
U S disc into a UK device. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You needed a special desk
that you needed to insert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the game cube to, to region unlock it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they could put animal crossing into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had to research and do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do that by myself with
a very limited budget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't really have much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a budget to work with
back then, but I, I had saved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up and I brought animal
crossing and I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is going to be an amazing guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is going to be an amazing game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This game, which is
expensive to import a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I bought like extra
hardware on top of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so I could play the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because every review said it was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And then I started playing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, that's
the gameplay kicking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, okay, this
is an awfully long copy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. I was picking apples. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like some, I'm just,
the gameplay is going to kick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in sometime, or I'm going
to have a point to why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I expected it to be on
the same level as like Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or something like that
when I'm catching stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or I'm like, I'm going
one of that adventure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, okay,
surely when I play out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pay off this mortgage,
that's when the game play. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. So I play, I play
animal crossing and I, and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I paid Tom Nick back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever the his name is, I pay off my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I pay off my mortgage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I'm just like, there
must be a reason why every game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every magazine is giving
this five stars pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off my mortgage and then
the game just continues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Because you like
games like banjo Kazooie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like JPGs where
there's like a whole like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> collect like a collecting element to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Linear games, more than
OpenWorld and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, I do like linear
games more than open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I like, I, it's funny because I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I do like the idea
of open-world games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But if I'm going to sit
down and play something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I'd much prefer linear games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because one of my favorite aspects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of animal crossing personally is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the whole like catching fish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and bugs and collecting all the artworks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and collecting all the furniture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, it's basically the
collecting portion of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas a lot of other people
who play the game, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy the whole, like,
you know, DIY, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creating your own amazing looking town </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing looking house kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, that's like second number one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me is definitely like, I needed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> complete my fish index need
to complete my bug index. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why, why do you want to do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I got that from
playing all the JPGs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And like, and obviously
six is up there because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was that for six, for me as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I think the
reason why I picked six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think why final
fantasy six is my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not only final fantasy game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my favorite JPG Evo is because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the first game where I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a work of art, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is not just a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, the gameplay is like, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I've played all
the previous final fantasies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like four and one and like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. This game plays basically the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but six was the first time
where I was like, I didn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> story could be this good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know, game
music could be this good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could have this much
emotion in a game where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I got to like the fake,
like the fact that, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people still talk to this day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about like the final fight scene, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Like final fantasy six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's overshadowed
by final fantasy seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but everyone I know who's
played final fantasy six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> holds it higher than final fantasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I've always said
the true final fantasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like six is the true
final fantasy fans pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's like, you're not persuaded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by like the graphics quote unquote </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this was the
last 2d final fantasies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Aren't seven is roadblocks
or seven is roadblocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but people still put it on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like pedestal of graphics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. It's like, what are you seeing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, you know, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's also a good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I also like seven,
but six was, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's something about
it where it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game could look like absolute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. And the story and
the music and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the emotion of getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this world is so
well done where it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care how this game looks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. And was it like to this day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the battle thing,
the decisive battle thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for final fantasy six gives me a Harlem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I listen to it, it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the Sona five and
final fantasy, six easily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the best battle
theme music, any game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I can't comment already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't played any final
fantasy, so I felt bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't judge yours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of, there's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of final fences that could have put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on hating turn-based battle was yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am regretting not putting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I put ruined scape on my list now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm surprised you just gave
wasn't on your, I forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Played rune scape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That was like the first game
I ever liked had a membership </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for actually maybe club penguin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Called penguin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was the first one for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Penguin on my list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going on those tubes
down the, the snow slope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tipping, the ice becoming the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Asian bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's typically I, Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Greenscape light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Definitely. Like when you
say emotion in the world, man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so into those quests and. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Going to like monkey Island and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I want to be one to
remake my three by three off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to talking to you guys about
it, but honestly make it three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by three of like each console. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you want to talk about tomorrow too? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So Rory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Terraria for me was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so when it came out, I had
already like known Minecraft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because Minecraft obviously came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up before Terraria Minecraft, not on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And Terraria is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you liked
Minecraft more than Troy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Minecraft for me
is kind of like, I like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's a game that I
can always come back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think I was like
as heavily into it as I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with Terraria. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Tara came out when I
was in maybe like middle school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or high school or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the only, ever time
where I would spend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I would not sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and being like a Skype call with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My friends in high school
was playing Terraria. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like there was so many nights
where after school, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd be on the bus home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'd be like, all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we're playing Terraria after dinner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Like seven, 8:00 PM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We all get on a Skype call and we played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for until like 6:00 AM, like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you in school in two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I had so many nights
like that playing Terraria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. I don't know why I
could have easily done that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Minecraft, to be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think it's because I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's something about
like side scrolling games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just, just, just tickle my fancy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I see Terraria, I'm like, yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that looks like fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it's kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is there a point to Minecraft? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like the point of mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, there is actually like a story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's like, you
have to go through and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of story Dungeons kind of thing
that you have to discover. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is an end game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just a bunch of content for free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. But everyone's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Chad Terraria DLC
for free, something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Exactly. And I think I have Terraria. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I paid for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just never played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really, really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's, it's, it's like
Minecraft for me as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, if I
just need like a game to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kind of mindlessly play
and just relaxed too, then I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either put in Minecraft or terrarium. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Other than that, other
than that, it is the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Vanilla three by three I've ever made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I, I mean, I
totally understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three by three, this is very
much a Joey three by three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nine games that I can
always come back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's probably the most amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of time I've ever spent on any. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wrote down a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of other games that I
wish I could have put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on borderlands too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was really good legal legends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gary's mode on here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe portal to Mario party to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I, I I'm, I'm surprised
nobody put Mary party here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I wanted to talk about Mary story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mission challenge, hands down the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the amounts of blisters I've
gotten from Mary parcel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God, whoever designs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the like whoever designed
the end 64 controller </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like he just hated humanity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He woke up and he chose violence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He would like put it
into games where I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there's better solutions rowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> down the rubbing down a like a raft thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the man, just the
managers saw an ergonomics book </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just set it on fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, well, because yeah, like
I said, with the rowing one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The mechanic was to like, go this way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you wanted the boat to go
this way or go the other way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanted to go that way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure if I might
be wrong, I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you could have
just done literally else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why did you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like Ellen Audra? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think my favorite Mario party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to mini game was I think
it was on Mario party too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the one where you
have to, like, there was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like swamps, domino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no, you have to like mash
a, Oh, knock down as many. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I love the one, the
skateboarding one as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The blow up the balloon,
like as full as you think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a good one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a good one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a good, the fact
that like the go-karting one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go cardio on socks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What I love about too is just that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It does not hold your hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, if you up, you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up. Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Good Pokemon Colosseum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one with the story
we could catch other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> People's poke them on the dock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go super into Pokemon snap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, snap was a new one coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. We're recording
on the 30th of March. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait two sports. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> God professor Layton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually really liked those games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I played the first one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mentioned for the
worst game I ever bought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I completely regret it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We music probably you've seen this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you had to buy it
with a controller as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like 90 bucks
when you were a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I asked my parents for it
cause I was like, wow, look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should get on me a Moto on stage, whack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you, you get this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And literally the play, the instruments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like waggle the controller. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it sounds like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like that's the whole day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the whole, I'm
going to show you it later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're gonna be like,
you have to like conduct. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You can conduct a doesn't
work very well at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, this one where you
like can play a trumpet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all you do is press the
button and hold the Weaver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then this one where you play guitar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just gives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, you want to go for me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Horizon zero Dawn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I, I feel that
self-explanatory anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a good story and a good
character is fire emblem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Three houses put fire emblem awakening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The gameplay more than
the story environment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I mean, the reason
I put three houses on is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm air about the gameplay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it's turn base, but
it was just fire emblem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with persona. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, yeah,
literally this is everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this gives me reason
to get you through, get play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Metroid, Metroid prime, incredible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was one of the few
games where I'm totally invested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't again, what
I, when I went again, went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> against what I said
before, because you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of figure it out yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But the game play
with that was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's I, I, I wanted to yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Walking dead season one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean that's the telltale game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wow. That was, I mean, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it became bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it wasn't really a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just a good story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. For me, I Okami
is up there really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously I said rhythm heaven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Linked to the past we sports. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Smash bros melee obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I recently just played
like the two Bayonetta games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Those were really good too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly, this, this too many way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why, why, why do we have
to just confine it to nine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's talk about like a five by five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The Masonic riders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What I've realized after
doing this episode is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that there are so many games that I love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just did not remember because I, I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go back to my comfort
pigs, but man, there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of games there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one game that we're all gonna, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if we have to pick one game off the today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we have that we're going to go back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and play red load too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is tricky for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, you didn't
mention the soundtrack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of SSX tricky just because
the amount of time that game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So good to play man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I realized the reason
I freaked out was because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the longest time,
I couldn't remember why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to learn snowboarding so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had just thoughts that
snow snowboarding seems cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't listen to the theme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> As you were learning to snowball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And let me stop at you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like you had just reminded me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as to say it's tricky
is the sole reason why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to snowboard so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why I'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Tony Hawk's pro
skater two was the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why I wanted to learn how to skate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just blanked out that memory of my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> good, good game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, it wasn't on any of all this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I really want to play theme park. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So many games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The stream boys for halo Wars with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like I, I think, I
think we've gotten a good taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of what our tastes in video games are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - More like viewers, are you
more of a gone Connor or Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wonder, let us know down in the corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who is the best taste and why is it me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Sonic writers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Writers. Battalion was two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is it the best? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll fight anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love the, how this
has probably been the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> civil episode regarding our tastes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like animating your dog, gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sonic riders. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I totally respect more for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought I was going
to get great for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What the? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was because me
and Joey aren't true gamers. </SPEAKER_01>
