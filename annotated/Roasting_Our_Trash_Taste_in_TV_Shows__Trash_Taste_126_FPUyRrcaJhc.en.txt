<SPEAKER_04> I think Breaking Bad epitomizes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everything that I guess does not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> interest me I prefer the later seasons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of Game of Thrones [ __ ] oh God genuinely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> welcome back to this episode of trash </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> taste I'm Connor with the boys Garden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Jay and today with a special episode yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only fit to be viewed on the TV hope you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> are chromecasting this or you have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> built-in Chromecast in your TV Apple TV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the point is it's going to be on your TV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because this is the TV episode we talk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about some of our favorite TV shows of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all time and roast each other's tastes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're going to be picking nine shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> each and then we're both gonna be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> raiding the other persons three by three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> babies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've missed the three by three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> format you know I've missed it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we it's been actually like a long time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since we did our last three bites what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was the last three by three weeks I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> think it was like music right music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that feels like a [ __ ] eternity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I like what's better than just talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about [ __ ] that you like you know and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just not arguing every like five seconds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> about I mean we are gonna be arguing you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had a lot of difficulty picking your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> list yeah yeah yeah because I it wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> until I was making by 3x3 I realized I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't really grow up watching a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of like variety of TV yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um so I really I had to actually text my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> sister to be like what the [ __ ] did we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> watch growing up because I legitimately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> don't remember so how can I see that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good TV if you don't [ __ ] remember it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> well no I remembered it and she reminded </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me because we were both like uh what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] was it what is my favorite TV show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of all time I couldn't tell you I can't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> remember it no no well actually it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's I I had a similar problem to Joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in that I haven't I don't think I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually seen that many TV shows yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah or like seen it down to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the end or have like an emotional </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> attachment yeah like there's lots of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I've seen But like they haven't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really stuck with me or they've I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really feel that strongly about them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because let me tell you the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference between like a TV show and an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> anime anime 24 episodes one season you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> can binge that in a night if you wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to uh you start a TV series and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hey here's nine seasons of 24 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes that's an hour long true and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like that's like a you know a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fairly middle length TV yeah if you talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about some of the most famous TV shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like Breaking Bad or something that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Five Seasons That's so short in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like I mean for Americans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right so so the the rule uh is that we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> decided to not include any anime because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've already done an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um we can do it was like a mix of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically it was like any TV show right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's like a mix between like Western </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cartoons like uh narrative driven like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> TV shows like just TV programming we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> used to watch literally anything series </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yes episodes yeah and so basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> anything that's not anime because it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not anime and a movie I can name off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> more anime that I've watched than whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than the entire broad spectrum of TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shows in every country I feel like my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> list or gaunts List uh could easily have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> been my list I'm pretty sure I know what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> God's gonna put on his and I I could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> have put them on mine but I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> God's gonna put them on his so I'll let </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> go and talk about it mine's gonna be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some weird [ __ ] I hope so when isn't it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joe when is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> this I definitely felt more like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> casual coming into this like than a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of other I watched the most TV out of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the three of us probably probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like I discovered anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> really early I discovered anime really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> early in life so I'm like why would I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to watch TV when I have anime guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> come on I don't know like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes anime is great but sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you need you need like a bit of Jack </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Bauer 24 in your life to like spice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things up yeah I mean like yeah I I get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that as well and I like that one of them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's not one of them that could be on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my list really I love 24. I don't think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've seen a single episode of 24. 24 was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the thing I watched when I was 15 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like this is so [ __ ] I know enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about 24 through osmosis but I've never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sat down on any episode is the uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> movement of uh water particles by the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> way yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's about wow do you mean the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> future did you just come actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I mean like there's a lot of TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> shows that I've watched like I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually seen 24 but I've only like I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> only seen one season of 24. I've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like three four seasons of Lost I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen two seasons of house but like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> takes up so much time I've watched a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of TV but I've been a commitment yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never I've I've really done in my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> student days yeah I've already finished </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> TV shows right up until the end just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's so much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that's why I had a hard time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> choosing fair enough yeah well should we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> leave it to trash station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> space is like almost gone yeah it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a battered Warfare yeah all right who's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> story behind it all yeah that's what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's helped me yeah yeah basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll get a good idea of what that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> person's personality is like based on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their three by three yeah that's mine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's mine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> before starting can I just say this is </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> bottom middle yeah bottom right is Mad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Men okay yes I was I was wondering see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I've seen this image through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> memes let's let's start with custom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> designs you should come really loudly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that triggered a response in me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> um I'm assuming you didn't put it on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your list gone yes I didn't I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah but there's a yes I did yes I did </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> okay yes no there are a few things here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that I very much considered putting on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh I was very close to the funny future </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Futurama very very close come down with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me as well I think is pretty much the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> only I I made my list and I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah you can tell I'm white without </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> looking I was like I felt like I made it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's fine I am right I too enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Television right so let me explain come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down with me to those who don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a British TV show and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fantastic I swear this thing is shot in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a budget like a hundred dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um they they add like one every day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like understand how this works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like they air so many of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goddamn episodes how many episodes have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come down with me in the UK is that so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the the whole concept behind this TV </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> show is you get four strangers yeah who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all are very proud of their cooking and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their house and the idea is is that once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this in this nice uh is it an hour or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 30 minutes uh I think it's about 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes 30 minutes they all go do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get a Womp </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's four people competing against </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> each sometimes five sometimes five okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but most of the time it's four people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and these four people going to take it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in turns to host a dinner party that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better than me yeah yeah yeah I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and within uh within the spin party they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have to impress the guests as much as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possible not just with the food but with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the experience of their home dining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience right right uh so sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they put as much effort into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> personalize their home dining experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as possible and at the end of the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um each contestant rates how good their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience was and how good the night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> was and how good the night was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> atmosphere yeah but obviously right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're is everyone's voting for each </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> other it's kind of a trust system of are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you not going to be a dick yeah give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone else a one because you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> win yeah and so it kind of has a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really fun elements to it a lot of snide </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moments but also the best part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show is the cringe it's so good because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get a bunch of just generic office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> workers just normal people yeah you tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them they're a dinner party for random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> strangers on camera and it's just it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fantastic and then they also decided and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is probably the best part of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> show yeah they decided that they were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna make the narrator just a guy who </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just takes the piss out of everything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they do classic British is just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> completely sarcastic right 24 7. and it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just keeps the show going and it keeps </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you uh keeps you invested this to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> come down to me this to me is Peak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> British reality TV because like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine like a come dine with me in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> America God every time I say come now I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't I can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come down with me oh my God like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I imagine like can you imagine an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> American come down with me it'll be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it would be like the most over the top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's great there's like there's very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minimal editing it's really strong it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really stale it's like the the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that shines about this is just British </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sarcasm and Sass because they never say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that they have a bad experience yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what makes it good right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how would you how would you not insult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the uh the host of this dinner party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> while we're while still insulting the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> host of this dinner party right it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] fantastic and like most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> time it's like four very average or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> below average Cooks just giving each </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> other [ __ ] right for not I feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I've definitely seen Clips yeah it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really good and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things what were they like while the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> person's cooking I'm pretty sure the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> producer's like hey go and Snoop around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> their house and look at things and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> comment and they just like raid each </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other's houses it's so bizarre but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really fun and I do oh my God it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the the amount of bickering and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bitchiness involved which is fantastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just so like surface level yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a concert they don't ever say it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll be like well Timothy's quiche </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was rather cold so I'm gonna have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dock five points for that and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what what do you mean like you're making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] up like you just made it up or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> someone be like the food was all amazing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and one person would be like actually I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hated it it was not the difference it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're right it was it sucked I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think there's one clip where someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually did properly go off like there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was actually drama and it's one of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite like television clips of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> time she's like like because a guy was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really really salty that someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> else had won right and by the way oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've I know this he stands up right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> he stands up what what yeah by the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the winner they only get like a hundred </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quid or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't recover the cost to cook the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] food people are playing for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> pride and there's there's one clip once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one guy gets so [ __ ] salty that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone else wins and it's like one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my favorite moments in TV because he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he just starts like it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> most British insults that he just starts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> throwing out and he just goes well Phil </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> very and this is that which is where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that iconic uh meme comes from where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy puts the the uh The Colony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so gross it's so like revolting but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like it sums up like home cooking I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just do it my way yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what I mean I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um okay so I obviously I know Futurama </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> uh Hannah Montana obviously keep sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you guys talk about I feel like you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> told me about people sick on the British </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> shows then for now let's just go right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to this let's go to Taskmaster okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people should then test match okay yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah okay okay so Peep Show yeah uh I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will explain it poorly you've explained </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it to me before I remember yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um so imagine two British people whose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> life is just not going the way they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> wanted right and instead of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually doing anything about it they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just take it out on each other and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cause the most cringe situations for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone around them and themselves so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this isn't like this is like narrative </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right like it's fiction or it's fiction </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's but it's not like reality TV </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right it is it is one of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intentionally cringe shows in existence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah if you love cringe humor this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this is the king of it right there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no show that even comes close to this I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I think the first episode opens up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh with Jeremy who is one of the two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> main characters of Jeremy and Mark uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mark is played by David Mitchell who is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a fantastic kind of he's really great at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing these Weasley characters yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he's kind of like weasel looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters that are very like and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> plays that amazingly he plays this kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of timid but very like the sky is way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smarter than he is Michael Sierra like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> type or Michael Sierra if what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have to go wrong in Michael's here alive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that bad it's like it's like imagine of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> actually somewhat intelligent 40 year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> old man who just made all the wrong life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> decisions all right and is angry at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> world for it right and so he kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thinks that he's owed more than he gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and so he just takes it out on everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> else in a very British way right and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just takes it out on Jeremy but Jeremy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is also just a giant buffoon yeah he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an idiot right and the first episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opens up I believe with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um Jeremy meets this girl who's wearing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a beanie and he's like oh she's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cute I want to have sex with her and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I think they get together finds out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she has cancer and then doesn't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be with her anymore and tries to kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> break it off in a really weird way and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just so cringe where he's trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he said because he doesn't fully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand like he knows what cancer is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's never met anyone with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's just really [ __ ] awful yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being able to even remotely understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> how to talk to someone with cancer yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so he's just like he's like when did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this come out it's like 2009 okay so I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was going to say this very 2000's human </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah no no this is like this this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> easily air today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at all this is age like perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I still watch it to this day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right me and Sydney still binge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all of the seasons unfortunately one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bad things about British televisions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unlike Americans keeping Seasons yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah every like there's like seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasons of Peep Show but like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> season has six episodes that's and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's six half an hour episodes as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like this is what I really love </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about sunbridge TV shows it really feels </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it earns the six episodes 30 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes each where it's like there is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not a single beat Mist in this show yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like there is no episode that sucks yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no episode that isn't funny and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no episode where there isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like five moments that isn't gonna make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you laugh out loud yeah right right just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I sometimes it's just every almost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every episode I think in Peep Show is an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute Banger there are some lines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that are just like stuck with me for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like my entire life there's okay there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a there's a completely unrelated plot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> line I feel like this sums it up so well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah uh there's a there's a there's an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> episode where Jeremy is one of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters uh Works in a gym and Mark is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to this gym and doesn't really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> want to go to it but it's kind of being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forced to and Jeremy for some why does </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Jeremy want to not go to the gym anymore </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> he does why does he not want to work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there I can't remember why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember what he does I remember oh I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think he joined it to get with a girl or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> something like that yeah so he joins the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gym to get with this attractive uh other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> worker there yeah and meanwhile Mark </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't want to go to the gym anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so he makes up this elaborate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> excuse that one of the masseuses touched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> him yeah and it's like it's this whole </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> awkward ordeal where he has to go to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> office to the manager yeah and awkwardly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> explain that he was touched while the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guy is there the masseuse right it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just this stumbling horrible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> cringe-inducing thing and and he and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> touched me and the guy said what the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] I didn't touch you and then to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fired because Jeremy doesn't want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> work there anymore he like shits in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pool and then tries to blame somebody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> else it's this whole like it's just it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes from zero to a hundred every single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode where everything just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> accumulates and and builds and it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> fantastic it's so good yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cringe humor at its best it's British </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> humor at its best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um if you want to feel like you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> British for some reason why I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what you would watch this TV show tell </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> them to tell the British person you've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> watched this show they'll love you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly I mean Sydney [ __ ] loves this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> show that's you know and that's how I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knew that she could understand British </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> humor if you can get Peep Show because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> show Peep Show to my mum and dad they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like why why is this it's too much for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> my parents as well yeah it's too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cringe it's a lot yeah there is not a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> single episode where you won't be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> uncomfortable yeah the way the best way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can describe it is like just imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two [ __ ] [ __ ] and try not to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] but in the end of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just they're just trying to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on with life but they somehow find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> themselves in the worst [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situations right now it's so good and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's not just even these two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters there's so many like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you've lived in England you've like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recognized who these people are because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like some you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody sometimes you have a show that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you it's a bit it's a bit too close to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> home sometimes yeah because there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some characters that you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> recognize as a person that you've met in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your life before in the UK yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um like one of one character that stands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out to me is like super hands oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I think Super hands who's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that guy who just brings drugs to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything right and and he's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's just lost control of his life right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right why is he called Superhead no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> knows no one knows this guy's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> insane and like there's you know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also shot really interestingly it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> POV yeah I think that's why it's called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Peep Show yeah yeah because yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they shoot the scenes multiple times but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like so the camera keeps swapping </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between the povs in the scenes so it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> never a uh an angle of like okay his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over the shoulder it's like it's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> POV oh which makes for some really good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> moments because a lot of the times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really really awkward moments hit so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard because the person who sees you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the awkward thing happened looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> directly at the camera yeah and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> looking at it like you did it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really good it's so good it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really interesting and it's just amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again it's it's I know the TV show is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of shot like this to my knowledge </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just works yeah oh that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting yeah watch Peep Show it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing I know I know you guys like rave </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> on about it yeah and the POV thing also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> makes it feel very uncomfortable because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're often in the face right there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> lot and it feels like you're there you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of feel like okay this is cool </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> obviously Taskmaster yeah which I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is it's okay so Taskmaster let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explain it before I get into it but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think this shows is is blowing up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna blow up a [ __ ] ton in the US </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well more I know a lot of people have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> recently coming up to him from the US </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like have you heard a single task master </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like yeah yes it's very old in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> UK right uh it's I don't even know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you explain this uh you get a bunch of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> comedians together yeah I actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to do a task master for after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> dark yeah we definitely want to do this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at something yeah the format is just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> gold yes okay so so basically such good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of like a game show but not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really and now that you've put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Taskmaster on I'm like [ __ ] I have so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many shows I should have put on my list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I completely forgot there was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> genre so that that happens a lot yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> wanted to put up a panel or slash kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of thingy type kind of yeah so I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like a very British genre of TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show which is why I completely forgot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it where it's kind of like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> British panel slash game right but the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get but the uh the uh but what you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> try to do in this game show is Win </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> basically they just try to be as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> entertaining as possible right so with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> task master it's basically like a game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> show where you take a bunch of comedians </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on and then you give them the same task </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right it could be anything right could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> range from getting a marble out of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bottle that's been sealed and like full </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of jelly or some [ __ ] right there's some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> really obscure like things that you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like why would you do this like yeah you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know there'll be like 30 shocks and be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like find the orange yeah a sock but all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of them will have something different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're allowed to like sniff three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> or touch two right yeah so so they give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff yeah so they're given like a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're given a very Ambiguously worded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> task right Sometimes some tasks are more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ambiguous than others but it's up to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> contestant to figure out what is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> best way to do this task right and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always like a life hack to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> solving it yeah yeah there's there's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> always a life so it'll be just a house </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you can do anything in the house </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with the challenge so like for one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> challenge it'll be like they'll be in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> room and they'll be like hide three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eggplants in the room okay whoever hides </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their eggplants the longest from the guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> searching wins yeah all right so it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know some some contestants hide </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the eggplant others Smash Up the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eggplant and try to like squish it into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something yeah yeah you know and some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people start eating whole eggplants yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like there's the rules are always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> set so ambiguous where any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> interpretation is correct and it's up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Taskmaster to decide if somebody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deserves the point based on yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know because maybe somebody did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something it's a little a little too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> cheeky in the Taskmaster Yeah by Greg </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Davis who's amazing we'll be like no I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> don't like that yeah that's why it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like perfect for trash days because we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> can't follow the rules oh [ __ ] yes so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the rules are ambiguous and then you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> never follow them and then the guy in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> charge just changed his mind yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so so that's that's that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> point right I'm sure a lot of people be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can't believe he lost this task </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because he didn't follow the rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> correctly well that's not really the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> point of task master the point of task </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> master is just to see the funny ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that different people can get creative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> different people approach the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right oh that sounds fun yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and and you can go as out of the box as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you want the only important thing is you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gotta it's kind of like you kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotta like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> try to not to take the piss but also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take the piss as well right so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember what like one one task I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember recently was there was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> switch in this room and the task was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure out what this switch does right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and so what happens is like nine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people out of ten they start they start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flipping on the switch running out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at every light in the house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at every Appliance in the house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing if anything's changed run back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like flip the switch off and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they they repeat this process right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until they finally figure out that the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> switch rotates a statue or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's what that's what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> switch did yeah one guy just cut the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> power to the switch right and was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like well switch does nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it has no power </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh wow so that's that's the kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking outside the box because it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't necessarily because he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technically right yeah in that this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch does nothing in that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's seriously not breaking the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> rules because there's no rules right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> loose rules yeah that's very very loose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the best things is is that it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> completely available on YouTube for free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yep you can watch all of it nearly all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of it on YouTube for free yeah uh which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is amazing because the clips they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Eclipse Channel which is amazing but you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can just watch the straight up the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes oh cool and the best part is is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's it's structured in a way where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every episode has its own self-contained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing right uh in like a greater season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it'll be the same comedians for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole season and the points will rack up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you could come into any episode and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy an episode like there is nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that requires you to watch the previous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode right right if you want to and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll get more out of it you can go one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two three four up until the end then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can see who the winner is yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's Seasons they have like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Comedians and they change kind of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes it a bit more consistent and makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it have a lot more re-watchability and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more reasons to tune in every week it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really good really really good yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to blow up in the year I highly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recommend it we'll probably do do a task </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Market I think a lot I know it's already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> popular nice because they made a US </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> version that sucked as they always do of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> course but I think a lot more YouTubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff will probably start doing some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff like that oh yeah it's going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> happen I don't think so it's good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Taskmaster is [ __ ] amazing that's all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my British TV shows that I recommend uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what is mind Hunter did any of you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> what mindhunter is no no mind Hunter is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so good so mine hunter unfortunately uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at least it's just my knowledge is not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to continue I think you can Google </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um it had two seasons and then for some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reason Netflix or I think some creative </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> staff involved didn't agree on some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff maybe Kai can fact check for me uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's basically about it's a really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good Netflix like drama but kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> loosely based on real events of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> why the the FBI decided to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> figuring out what psychopaths are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this a drama or like a drama but kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of loosely based on real events very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Loosely because you know they they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the time you know way back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America people were killing people with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> similarly no motive and nobody can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand why certain groups of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people were very very organized would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't seem to care about the killings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would kill like 10 people and then some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people in the FBI are like huh I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we should study these people who have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clearly very intelligent very good at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their crimes and who clearly are not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the other criminals yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right well you know it's basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like this is where it's a story about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> how basically psychopath profiling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> started every true Chrome fan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but dude it's so good like the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> acting the shots the cinematography the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> pacing is amazing do we have info </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's on indefinitely which basically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> means it's done yeah and it's it sucks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so it is they go um in the first season </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they basically you spend a lot of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> seasons with this this FBI guy who's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really dedicated to figuring out this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because he really believes that if if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they can figure out what makes these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Psychopaths tick and why they're doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this that it can help them profile in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> future and figure out how to stop this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happening yeah again this is all based </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like Loosely based on true events and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatnot so the interview a very famous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> serial killer uh over across the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season called Ed camper who is like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yes I know very very famous yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the actor in the series who portrays him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is insane he's so good I think I've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the clips of that the guy who like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> killed his mother and killed his family </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then went on to kill and he killed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so many people and the only reason they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> caught him is because he got bored and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> turned himself in yeah right and he was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really well spoken didn't like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen like interviews of the real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> age really creepy guy really creepy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because he would just be like he would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be willing to admit anything and talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it in full and so a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first season is just them talking to him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going back and forth trying to convince </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the higher-ups this is worth doing going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> back to Ed talking to him the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character getting a little bit too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invested in talking to this serial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> killer right and it's just really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's it's just such a good human </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drama whilst also kind of showcasing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like a really fascinating part of FBI </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of history and this kind of how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they came up to start even doing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right every True Crime fan yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the second season I think they have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some Charles Manson stuff another famous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> serial killer again it's all really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really interesting if you want a really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good kind of crime uh detective not to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> say that like like you know a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unnerving drama okay is this did this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Series start off with some guy blowing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off his head with a shotgun or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you know I watched this when it came out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and I remember that it's just been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of those shows where I always check </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every like month I'm like yeah is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything happening because I really it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was getting so good yeah it's the dad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that went together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but even because because the two seasons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are so good I still feel comfortable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> recommending it being like this is such </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> still worth watching yeah it's so good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because because I remember Sydney was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh I want to watch a show it's on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Netflix and stuff like that and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it about and she was like serial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> killers I'm like great okay all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're from Wisconsin I get it okay I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> remember just like walking in the room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing someone blow the head off of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> shotgun I can't I've had a massive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> spoiler no problem it's like opening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> um and then I just walked out I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the guy with the thing around his neck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and blew up or a shotgun definitely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> shotgun okay that's the other evil but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a drama it wasn't like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> documentary I've seen it I've seen Evil </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Geniuses that's that's good super </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Geniuses game horrifying yeah I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> mindhunter is amazing if you want just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great drama you want to be fascinated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enthralled you've got to watch it it's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> all right let's talk about it yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> mean again look you've talked about you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had a child a crush on Hannah Montana </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like sell me on the show because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've seen oh no it's not good but that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the thing I've seen bits and pieces of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the show it's not good at all I think I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think though in a week is this your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guilty pleasure no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um I feel like this has a lot more uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> impact on me than I'd care to admit it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> does I hate to be like but you know when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a child you're impressionable you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know at the end of the day I'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> afraid to admit that Hannah Montana </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> changed my life then were you how how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did uh the the change that mileage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> affect you what's Hannah Montana about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I've not seen a single episode right so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's it's a great question go on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> fantastic question so there's Hannah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who's from Hannah Montana yeah the stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> name is Hannah Montana it's this girl uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember why she wants to be on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stage I'm sure just because her dad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because her dad is uh Billy Ray Cyrus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's in like actual musician right um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure that I'm sure that helped get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the show Achy Breaky Heart yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally oh so it's about her who she's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to get in school but she doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want people in school to know that she's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a pop star so she lives this dual life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's it's just Hannah she's living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best yeah so that's the way the Best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of Both Worlds come from so she's trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to balance the nobody nobody can know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm Hannah Montana yeah but also I got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to go to school but also I do these hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> performances yeah I don't know what her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> real name is and her name in the show is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh Hannah Smith is it really I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> know I think it's only sometimes but I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know it's just fun and I think I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in a weird way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um I think like the whole Hannah Montana </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and the Disney and all that kind of got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me into like American culture a lot more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right got me into the path of kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liking the idea of maybe performing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> because before that I had I had no no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> desire in my bone to to perform or get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> on a stage so basically you watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Hannah Montana and you went I want the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> best I I did want The Best of Both </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Worlds and now as a social media person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like how about just one world and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll make that the best one you combined </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the world think further Hannah go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> further Beyond yeah so I I don't know in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a weird way the Disney channel has this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weird kind of intoxicating effect on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kids that is like yeah you want to be a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little [ __ ] entertaining little [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in a weird way I think it kind of does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it does it's just basically the you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the show for theater kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone on the Disney show is like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> theater and I hate to admit it because I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think the show sucks in a weird way uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it was fun at the time and I did I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was obsessed with it again it just got </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> me into it and at a time where nobody uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because I find in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're not a theater kid yeah you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never allowed to be a theater kid yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can never join you know what I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a cut-off period if you are not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the theater kid period by like age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> eight you are not allowed in the theater </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the thing the thing is you have to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> born and raised they are a ruthless </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Bunch yeah where they lied to a bed at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> night you can join the football team if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get better you cannot become a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> theater kid no no and that and that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> stays with you oh yeah yeah like a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always a thing have you ever meet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone and then they were like yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was a theater kid I'm like I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knew it I knew it I can sense it from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the aura you know you feel the pressure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it stays with you I swear they never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> drop it but again like in school I I a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of me I had that tiny little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inkling I was like I'd love to try this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but even at 10 I'm like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> window's gone because like you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because the teachers wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't pick you yeah because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would never give you the opportunity to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do anything because they were like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we already know we like these kids yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we know who can these are the kids that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> act yeah you're not the kid that acts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're the kids at times the audition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we make the kids at act feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good because we can pick them you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like and and this is a thing that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt in a weird way I hate Disney with a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> burning passion I think they're a tower </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> company uh but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> predict where credit's due a little bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of it kind of brought out that that I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like [ __ ] you know I kind of wanna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I didn't know how how do you how do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get into it and that's kind of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what kind of maybe planted the seed to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then when I found anime that made me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> think actually I want a voice act did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you did you ever watch like High School </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Musical yeah I didn't really want to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> sing right something about acting kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of spoke to me uh but it doesn't handle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a Tennessee yeah she sings but it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of the acting part of it a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these kid actors I thought they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing yeah yeah props to the kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actors I don't know how the [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> did that yeah I can't act now bro um you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know and I think that planted the seeds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make me want to pursue something and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then discovered voice acting and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like stars aligned right so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> planted the seeds to me but also you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I a lot of people like they can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into theater and I I like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's ways or kind of motivations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pushing us to do it because you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like people like [ __ ] Gerard Butler </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right or uh who we'll talk about later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh uh [ __ ] uh uh Dawn and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um mad man what's his [ __ ] name in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real life Jon Hamm Jon Hamm you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> those two are both School teachers yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just got into acting at like age 40. and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that [ __ ] I want more of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah I hate it when it's like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't act from age 10 get the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the industry you're a joke it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I hate that [ __ ] I think acting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> should be like if you want to try it Go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] ahead if you don't if nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes of it who cares yeah I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a way to express yourself and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a way to perform is so uh just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fulfilling and satisfying I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> why [ __ ] Hannah Montana put that in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my brain but thank you Hannah Montana </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thank you Miley expression Express </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yourself guys yeah all right uh then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's talk about Mad Men I guess all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right I know the name of this show never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> seen a single episode yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like advertising right this is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the Chad show before Chad shows exists </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Jon Hamm plays like a giga chat I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love John Hammond but like it's great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the show it starts out as like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> John uh I think it's all day of Don Don </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the show he you know he's this kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he knows everything he's smart he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> killing it but as the show goes on they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they slowly introduce flaws to him and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> humanize him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and in a way that feels great and and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's about it deals with a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> topics at the time like this is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 1950s it deals with a lot of sexism it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> deals with a lot of misogyny uh it deals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with other cultures not being uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> recognized at the time and how that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interacts Mad Men is about John and and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> the Ad Agency they make ads for people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so a lot of the time the show is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just how do we make this happen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> newspapers and billboards and stuff like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that big Brands they're like the premium </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a grade yeah marketing company in New </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> York Manhattan okay well this this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when like our agencies start to become </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a real world oh yeah oh yeah they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> started realizing oh if you advertise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> correctly you could make like a [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of money oh yeah right yeah so you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of the drama comes from okay we're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> interacting with this client they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these needs and how that character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interacts and it's a great way of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> introducing characters for a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes that have a big impact on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> main cast yeah and then how that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plays out in their life yeah and there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a great scene that I feel like after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've lived in Japan you're like yes I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand this they have like there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scene where they like have a [ __ ] uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they maybe like Toyota or something and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the Japanese car brands right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they made like the Ad Agency compete </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> against another Ad Agency to make the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> best ad and they wouldn't like geek </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows I will not make an ad to compete </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you will buy my services or you are not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> welcome and they go out and it was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this whole thing of I will not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dance for you I was like I feel that so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much now this happens so much in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have to do [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wow no no but it's great it's a great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show if you want what what makes it good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what makes it good characters I think uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like one like like better call song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'll talk about like really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> characters really good writing yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know it's a slow burn nothing crazy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens nothing explosive happens every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every episode it's just if you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people talking you like good dialogue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you like development I like good dialo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's just a great show and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very slow to start with I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the problem with that a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't get into it because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like all right when's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna happen but they're just laying the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> foundation I really love Mad Men because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like I've always found the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> advertising world just uh interesting to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> begin with I feel like I explained it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> poorly by the way yeah it's it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially seeing like the evolution of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the advertising world like you look at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like the old days and like the 60s or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something and like an advertisement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would literally be here's my product </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's what it does let me list off all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the benefits of using this products and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then yeah like I think like somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> along the line I'm not sure if it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like likes must be TV all right you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it was you know this was this was on TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah but somewhere along the line I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think like the most the biggest example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can give off is like I can think of is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the cigarette industry where Marvel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started like they they stopped marketing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> their products and they started like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> marketing a feeling a lifestyle yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah instead of just being like hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here are cigarettes they're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] kill you oh by the way you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> buy our product they're they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> this is the American way yeah it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like Peak 1950s America where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> they're figuring that stuff out wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it like uh was it like Coca-Cola that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> were like one of the first ones to do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> might have been really just like it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the feeling that you get yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is what it's like it's like the how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it feels to chew five guns it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that it's like that [ __ ] you know but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's great it's a long one it's got like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nine Seasons okay right but you slowly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> watched Don's life uh change quite a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's good it's good though it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worth it I got into it and I I couldn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> stop like it was it was enthralling all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah okay uh we also have future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drama I mean need I say much about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> future yeah we were all this I guess we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were all this close to putting Futurama </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on it's like I don't know it's like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> do you make like it's it's like macaroni </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> inside I'm gonna make a show that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> funnier than Simpsons has a storyline </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> has characters that you love more and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just hits every note I feel as well the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> humor is a little more geared towards </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the older generation I think oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah because like because you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Simpsons has a lot of Chloe Simpsons is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very good early symptoms yeah but like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> around like comparing it to The Simpsons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> during the time that Futurama was airing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like alongside I definitely felt like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they cared way more about Futurama yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's kind of like a throwback to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> more than old school Simpsons type of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] right yeah yeah I mean one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I've always loved about Futurama is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they actually gave a [ __ ] about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sci-Fi setting yeah in the world yeah it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't just like a haha here wacky </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> setting haha they're like there are so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many episodes in Futurama that they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> really delved into this like really like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Niche scientific concept or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that it was basically kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Peak Rick and Morty before Rick and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Morty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Rick and Morty could walk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to have any Rick and Morty fans </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna piss off with that yeah I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's especially like when they started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> delving into more of the story aspect oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah drama holy [ __ ] oh some of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> latest some of the later episodes made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me cry yeah like [ __ ] Fry's dog is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna [ __ ] stick with I I mentioned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that you know and everyone everyone has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the exact same reaction just like really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> funny jokes as well like using the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sci-Fi setting to like a huge Advantage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like I just like one of the First </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes right it's like Bender goes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the suicide Booth right yeah tries to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and tries to con it and I feel like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tells you literally everything you need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to know about Bender oh yeah the guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't want to pay even for his own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> suicide we'll try and con it and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gives up immediately like it's like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just it's such good writing and and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can tell that everyone on the team cared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much about making the show as funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as possible yeah and I just love it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much and I love the episode where Fry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> drinks like 100 coffees one of my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> favorite ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> love that episode so much so that's such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> a good [ __ ] everyone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> so much yeah what I love about Futurama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just the cast as well it's just it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's rare that you see such a perfectly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> balanced cast like like Eve I think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like even better than the Simpsons oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah in terms of balance the side </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> characters definitely shine in that shot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and even like even like the every now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then characters that you see in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just some of the concepts that you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know obviously because like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because it's Futurama and like Matt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Rainey show it's like okay we'll throw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in maybe like a couple of like celebrity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> naughties and stuff like that but the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fact that these like celebrity cameos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make their way into few trauma as just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the head yeah in a glass it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's like immediately way more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> funnier than just like here's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> character that you all know and love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just comes into the frame it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's a little more interesting uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then and then I guess the fine uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> two final ones okay sure Arcane yeah I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mean Jerry come on all right so Arcane </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is is fantastic there's like 70 clips of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you guys talking about okay I just think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that Arcane should be watched this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your weekly reminder to watch our can if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you haven't yeah I am I am frothing at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the thought of getting a season two all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right Julie know that you want to talk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about Better Call Saul and I just think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they've released the behind the scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> recently that was fantastic yeah they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> really just showed how much love and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> care went into it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I agree yeah what what you said Connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah what do you say I don't know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> more I can say about Arcane it's a show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that hits the ground running it's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> save me it's uh it's uh Joey's favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> show I love it all right Hunter Hunter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I came my top two favorites so I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> figured that God would would not put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> breaking bad because maybe we're going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about it anyway I don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe God did for Breaking Bad I figured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we're going to talk about breaking bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay Universe spoiler spoiler I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> actually put broken back I've never even </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> seen it but I figured we would want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about it in some capacity okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I mean it's like it's breaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] mad yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my favorite are you putting breaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> battle are you putting benefits the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> universe is the universe the universe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I think like what is that you I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> would put both of them on here but I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like what is that Universal coin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay the metaverse the Vince Gilligan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Universe I don't know like the the whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> world of Breaking Bad and better call </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> soul is fantastic and honestly I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only reason I put medical Souls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it just finished recently and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it was insane it's so good like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the best TV shows I've ever watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like flat out just I mean I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching the show weekly well not weekly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like since it aired weekly uh since I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was in university right because I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching Breaking Bad when that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> airing weekly when I was like 15. and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just think that there's something about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it that I mean it clearly captivates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone online as well yeah people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in love with this world and the show and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's just because of how just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> careful and how meticulous all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character writing is yeah and how you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know there's a lot of twists and turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Breaking Bad and medical soul but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't feel feel like it's done for any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> particular shock value it's like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if a character dies it is a big big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deal and it's dealt with really severely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the show and a character's death has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> such Rippling effects on everyone in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cast and it bothers them and it changes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how they view things and I I can't do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> justice I mean Breaking Bad and medical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> assault you probably know all about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is just amazing and I hate being that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally guys like watch Breaking Bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a good TV show but it just is it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> literally it just is an amazing show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I mean I don't know if I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if this is going to be a hot take or not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but like yeah I've seen breaking bads I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's an amazing show I have zero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emotional attachment to it which is why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't put it on my list right yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I think Breaking Bad epitomizes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> everything that I guess does not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> interest me about TV American TV shows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what what are you wearing where it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just it's what do you mean okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> my perception of Breaking Bad is every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason why I am an anime fan if that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes sense okay where I think Breaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Bad isn't like I look at it as a Critic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right I think it's an amazing show it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got so many moving pieces there's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much care and attention that's been put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the writing and the themes and how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how the uh how the developments of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show evolve and everything like that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's it's polished it's it's to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's it's a show that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> polished to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it's how I don't know how to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it it's polished to a point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it just doesn't interest me is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> weird is that weird bro I never even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> gave it a chance why would you not want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to see the Pinnacle in like TV </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> storytelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh I think one one okay one big thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> again uh is that it's so grounded in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reality right the part of the reason why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so many people are attached to so many </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of these characters because they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like like such well don't want your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters to feel real </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> he's an isakai fan yeah but like I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it is an extremely tall order to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> make characters that feel real and and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> somehow Breaking Bad in medical Soul are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Masters at making you care about these </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters oh yeah who are so well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> written and unbelievable yeah yeah they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are incredibly well written too like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> saw a fault it's so strange I've never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> heard anyone have that complaint yeah I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> know I mean I don't even know if it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> complaint right I'm complaining that the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> show is too good we've studied regards </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> brain yeah yeah I mean I mean here's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> some sometimes you love sometimes I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit of rawness in the expression </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I like a bit of unpolished you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know unpolishness you know sometimes I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like it when something is just is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like this well refined </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's too clean this is such a bizarre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> argument this is going to build on one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> of the shows that I'm going that I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> put on my okay which is okay this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> half of a hot tick right okay I like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think Breaking Bad is an amazing show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I I have zero attachment to Breaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Bad I hear this if you didn't have zero </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> attachment to it but I could understand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just think I I loved it a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it's because I you know when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> first watched it I was like 16. yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've rewatched it since and I still love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it I just think it's just amazing like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just does everything so goddamn well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah exactly well I guess why it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] number two on IMDb yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean do you think that you do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> medical saw is better than Breaking Bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now that it's over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's tough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um I think if you had to pick one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think Breaking Bad offers a more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> complete package of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hitting every kind of emotion soul is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very very slow burn yes that really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> believes that in its storytelling and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its characters to to tell an amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story yes it knows that the characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of in the universe are so strong that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can really slow it down yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know because the first two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seasons it's a very very slow burden not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that much happens and it's like for two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seasons it's very slow it's all just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> setting the stage building up these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters showing you why they're going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be why they are and it's like it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> rare to see a prequel that almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> improves on what the main thing did and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of offers even more reason to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> back and watch the first of the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the Jimmy's character of Saul </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Breaking Bad is is very funny very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> funny loyal man but just make medical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Soul turns him into this amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grounded character where you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> understand why he went down the paths he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> went down yeah just it's just a great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drama it's it but it's slow it's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slow yeah I think that's why Breaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bad might just Edge it out for me right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Breaking Bad just hits the ground </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> running right yeah probably because he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> had to do a pilot and whereas the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> medical Soul could had the had the brand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had more Wiggles Yeah well yeah I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't watch Better Call Saul or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't have got past the first season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> if they didn't know it's part of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Breaking Bad because it is just it it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just trusts that you want to see the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> payoff right yeah I I think I've got a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect analogy of why I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not personally attached to Breaking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so Breaking Bad is like if you built an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AI computer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you programmed it to write the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect TV show that would be Breaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bad okay you know like it feels like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> is the perfect TV show with with correct </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Spanish in it apparently the Spanish is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dreadful I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay apparently the Spanish is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unwatchable Spanish people I'm so sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> especially but at least a medical Soul </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have an actual uh Spanish person uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing a character and he's really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] good yeah no Gustavo is not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remotely Spanish oh and apparently his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Spanish is Dreadful oh really yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently it's [ __ ] unbearable uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he's supposed to be playing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chilean dude yeah but he's uh from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Denmark or something and has African </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> descent oh so there's no Spanish ties </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> remotely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> um so people are like bro his Hispanic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> should yeah yeah that's that's I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's what I mean it's like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like the perfect TV show but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feels so good that it feels like it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> written by a computer and why would you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> not want it so you say so what you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically saying is that like some flaws </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in the show are good because the guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually rotted your brain I mean it has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay I'm not gonna lie but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes okay even watch like sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my favorite things is kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like feeling a connection between the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person who made this particular thing or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this particular piece of fiction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um I like feeling like there is I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understand what they're trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> portray or Express you know with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Breaking Bad I Feel Complete coldness </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel it's just amazing it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfectly written but I don't know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know so there's nothing wrong with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the like a show being like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> inherently perfect in its writing or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like incredibly good in its writing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like you need some kind of thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gives you a connection between you as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> viewer and the person who made it trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to express themselves through the work I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mean I mean that's why Evangeline was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like I was about to say this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like one of my favorite anime of all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time you know it doesn't doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> necessarily have to make sense I wonder </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if that's just a posted my person thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel like I get it oh it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely a person I I feel like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> understand the messages they're trying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to put out and yeah they're trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> portray yeah I feel the same thing with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> music it's like sometimes you just want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to listen to a good song and not give a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] about who it's made by yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you want to be like well I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> need to care about the song Because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want to care about this person yeah who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> made it yeah I know Chris loves medical </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Souls that's a good taste sheep all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> right who's next who is next then </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> because half of these are from your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] childhood yes of course they are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I don't watch TV series Simpsons </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why Simpsons ever say like you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> mentioned okay so I was really debating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at first I put in Futurama but then the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> more I thought about it I have more of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> childhood connection with the Simpsons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um even though Futurama came out what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> year did it come out like uh no not too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> long ago too long after I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> mid-2000s I think or late 2000s okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> look it up but I feel Simpsons was that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like one cartoon that has always been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> around and I have like fond childhood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> memories of watching Simpsons with my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sister more than Futurama so like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only like I guess uh childhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> memory I have of me watching Simpsons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was before uh my my dad inevitably threw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it out he had this like old CRT TV right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was gonna throw it out and I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no no father I want it if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't still work and he's like yeah if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you like get the antenna thing on it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you extend the [ __ ] yeah then it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> still works and I'm like okay can I put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it in my room and so there would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nights where like my dad would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching some kind of [ __ ] TV show I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't give a [ __ ] about and my sister </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would go into my room and we would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take turns holding the antenna on the TV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get good reception enough to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reruns of The Simpsons and so every and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was play it played on channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 10 there were like ad breaks every like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know 10-15 minutes so every time an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ad break came on we'll be like all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your turn to hold the antenna and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would just have like fond childhood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> memories of that and like that would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happen after Futurama came out because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Australia it would be a rerun of The </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Simpsons and then immediately after it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be an episode of Futurama right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> um so it would it would kind of be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a Simpsons Futurama combo for me but I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> still remember more and vividly remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more characters and jokes and stuff like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that from The Simpsons I consumed a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> more Simpsons than Futurama </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there was way more of it yeah and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thought because it like I remember I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> grew up with The Simpsons oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> The Simpsons was The Simpsons existed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since I was born yeah it's like a game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> every year yeah yeah exactly clear it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> came out it came out every day but then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when Futurama first started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> airing it was like a new thing yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Simpsons has just like always been there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when did you try and come out 1999 1999 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> oh okay yeah what what is your do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have a favorite Simpsons episode that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> comes to mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Peak Simpsons for me is the 24 short </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stories about Springfield do you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that one which one's what's the plot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that one again it's basically just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they it's it's basically just like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Quentin Tarantino escalate just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> short stories about different characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Springfield that all coincide with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one another and there's a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie parodies and [ __ ] like that they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parody like Pulp Fiction multiple times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and like just like classic movies and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff but with Simpsons characters yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it's just a really and also like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh we used to have like DVDs of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Treehouse of Horrors I love those are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like classes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like like The Shining Parody episode of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> The Simpsons is like that's Peak I love </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the uh who shot Mr Burns who shot Mr </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Burns and also like the the robot house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of death and stuff like that oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah well it's like this they like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Implement like an AI like house and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> voiced by all the characters who played </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> James Bond yeah oh yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> voiced by Pierce Brosnan I think who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> shot Mr Burns was how I discovered what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cliffhangers were yeah right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly I remember like genuinely good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> stories yeah I remember as a kid I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> watching who the who shot Mr Burns part </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one and then it ends right I'm like what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> do you mean it's ending what where is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> part two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean I have to wait I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> five or something right yeah but like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the writing was so good that you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you got a [ __ ] child invest yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I and I think as well like I had a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really good because like obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Simpsons started way before any of us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were born yeah and so like a lot of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The Simpsons that we saw on that shitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> CR TV were reruns of the older Seasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which anyone who's watched enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Simpsons will agree with Peak Simpsons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah exactly um when did you stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching The Simpsons when did you all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> start watching The Simpsons when I stop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> watching TV yeah pretty much focus on on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in the UK right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> on Sky yeah paid uh broadcasting which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad bought because he wanted to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> football matches yeah so it was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll buy this and then the only reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you know the wife won't get angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at me so it's for the family because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've got other channels as well right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we had we had that and um they used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to play four episodes uh a day from six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to eight pm damn so every single day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after school just chill on the living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> room do whatever I need to do and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watch four episodes of Simpsons yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> every single day I remember I think it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was like on weekends they would do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three or four episode runs yeah this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> crazy yeah it was great yeah I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> remember the exact moment for me that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Simpsons died in my mind it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually like The Simpsons Movie I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> actually yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like oh okay so wow Simpson's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got a movie that's a big [ __ ] deal I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't like at that point I hadn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watched you know I grew up with The </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Simpsons but I wasn't like regularly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watching you don't realize it like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> season like nine or ten is [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you're just like oh this is funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and then I remember like people [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> losing it over [ __ ] spider pig or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> something oh my God I hated that and I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this isn't funny why is yeah white </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> people that was definitely the least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> funniest part of The Simpsons that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like there were many not funny parts of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this yeah that was like I remember back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when that came out people like quoting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it I'm like this is the pickle Rick of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> my time you know it literally was yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like why are people quoting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> spider pig and it's not even spider pig </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ransom pickle Rick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> dude I I [ __ ] love especially like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we were probably getting in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Simpsons when all the best Simpsons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> games were out yeah like hit and run one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> of the arcades the arcade ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my God that was a [ __ ] coin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> guzzler that was Peak Simpsons right but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I mean Simpson's great I mean this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> is great what the [ __ ] is specs and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> specs yeah specs and specs is a TV show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that sounds Australia it looks like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> kid's show it's a quiz show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um it's a music question it's like a gay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> pride show no no no they just happen to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> have a rainbow okay okay now Rainbows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are dope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's named after I think a uh uh a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Beach Boys song I think right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> basically it's this kind of it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like imagine like Qi right but yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> except all of the questions and all of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guests are the musicians okay this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is right up your ass yeah and obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know I'm a [ __ ] music nerd right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's like that show was really cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because not only would they get really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool musicians on as guests but they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also like it was hosted by an Australian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comedian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um called Adam Hills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and he had you know in any in each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> team there would be like different kinds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you know music themed like quizzes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like that would also break into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a talk show where they would like talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about guests and stuff like that I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my one of the weirdest segments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they had was they had this quiz </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> early on in specs and specs called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> musician or serial killer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'll basically what they would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they would show a black and white </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> picture and just by looking at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> picture of the person it's like a mug </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> shot like front face you would have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> guess is this a musician or a serial </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> killer that's also wow yeah and a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> the times I and and as a kid I watched </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that and you know you'd play along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously because you you know there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no [ __ ] prior knowledge or anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is before True Crime [ __ ] was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing right yeah yeah and so like it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really weird that I swear the more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone looked like a serial killer the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> more likely they were more likely they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> were a musician and vice versa I believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah and so there was stuff like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there was another one where it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um they took song lyrics put them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through Google translate it's like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Asian language and then translated it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> back in English and then they would read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that out and you'd have to guess what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the song is and so like it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really cool ideas for quizzes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a great idea for an after dark </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> question honestly I like him Honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though like I came up with like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I came up with so many like quiz ideas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff like that for my videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> through shows like this yeah because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like really interesting and fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ways where you could kind of oh another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one where was like there was like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exercise bike that was connected to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vinyl player like a vinyl record player </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and you had to Pedal the bike at a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> certain speed for the song to be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> play oh that's cool you have to quickly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> guess yeah yeah what the song is for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> example it's just stuff like that sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good yeah it's a really really good show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if you have no idea about music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just the fact that it's like hosted by a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedian who's really funny has a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really cool musical guests and just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the quiz segments are just really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creative yeah which is like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really good show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and then I guess top right is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only Japanese show I put in Goku not Sky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> basically every American uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh punishment game remake remake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> came from this okay so Silent Library is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the most famous ones these guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> came up with the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um another one would explain what silent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> libraries is Silent Library I guess so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> basically everyone yeah Silent Library </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically is just again these guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started first but basically you would go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into a public library sit around a desk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you would hand out uh like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cards you'd flip them over one person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would get the punishment and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> would have to do a punishment but react </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah silently yeah and these punishments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in this show were [ __ ] brutal I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese TV shows is a big history yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> adaptation for being yeah like Takeshi's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Castle is another show that I thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> about putting on here but he definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pushed the line in terms of like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you can get away with it some of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> things that they did on this show were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like actual torture yeah like it's crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh one segment that they did was um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 24 hour no reaction uh pie face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> challenge where basically one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedians in this group would live in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> this like mock house and the entire time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for 24 hours the rest of the cast are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> throwing like pies at his face and he's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not allowed to react for 24 hours what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's just [ __ ] like that it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being Pi boarded you're being High </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> borders for 24 hours straight insane </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's it's insane another one was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 24 hour tag so that would be inside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> of a gymnasium and then randomly a dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would pop up and if you got tagged by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them then you'd have to get punished for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 24 hours it's just crazy I noticed in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Japanese TV when you've done your time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so to say you've done the the brutal </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but uh yeah so that's uh that's like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of my favorite Japanese shows going on </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> Okay so this was assembly okay so this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> was the original Adams Family TV show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the 60s I was wondering why I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in black and white yeah so this is on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the 60s this is this was this was during </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a time where I had this like weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> obsession with watching a lot of old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> films so I would like this was during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the time where I would be like so uh was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Citizen Kane actually a good movie I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna go and check it out right so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would watch like citizen it was okay I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> would I would watch Citizen Kane and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like all the you know the Orville films </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and like all of the [ __ ] this is what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is how you started your altar phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I was yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like I'm not like those other kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> watching Breaking Bad [ __ ] off I'm gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watch Adam's Channel you mean let's cook </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but um yeah I think what really was cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> about Adam's Family like the even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this is [ __ ] what a 60 year old show at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this point yeah it's still [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> hilarious you know whenever you like you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> know you watch Modern TV shows that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popped on the TV you're like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] Whatever Whenever you for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reason in a place and old TV shows come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> on they're always so good yeah they are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if I'm like crazy but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that one's just funny they must be good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in order to have still to still be still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> survive yeah right yeah maybe it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Survivor bias of like well yes because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're seeing the best of the best that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we remember right yeah cherish and made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> sure we kept in HD I'm sure out of every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one Adam's family there was 20 really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> shows but yeah like I mean what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Adam's Family about I I just know the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> name Adam's family is about comedy is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a drama it's a comedy so Adam's family I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's based off a comic book series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or a book or something please confirm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Kai but basically it's about this really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] weird family called The Adams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Family uh like very like Macabre and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like obsessed with like death and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that and they're just like a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird they were like the original like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't like the other families type of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> family right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so like they kind of want to be yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so there's like Gomez and like Morticia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh [ __ ] I don't know Uncle Fester </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and like just characters like that where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like you know there was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was the weirdest cast of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> characters they're human right yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're human but they're but they're so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> weird and so obsessed in the Macabre </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that they're almost not human I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> there is a character that's also not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> human but in other another </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> interpretation of the show they are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like yeah why do I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> they're vampires yeah other in other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> versions of stories like the I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Adam's family is yeah I think it borders </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on like are they human or are they just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weird humans or are they non-humans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to live in a human is he Adams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can you look uh it was based on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cartoon like oh a cartoon okay is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> public domain I can't remember if it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know to be honest but they've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> done re a bunch of remakes of uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> movies from like the 90s Adams Family </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> movie is [ __ ] hilarious and I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> recently uh Adam Sandler one right not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Adam's Family one or is that a Dracula </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> animated cartoon am I crazy am I mixing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so like what I really enjoyed about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this show is that like it because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> characters are just so [ __ ] absurd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it makes for some really really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> unique comedic bits right um so like for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> example like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I don't know like uh Lodge for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> example is this like almost like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Frankenstein's monster type of thing but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's also the he's also the butler of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the family right and then there's also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another character called thing which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just a disembodied hand that just crawls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> around and emotes and there's been so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> many remakes of it I think there's gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be a remake of there's like a new like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Netflix I think TV series based on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wednesday Adams oh uh which is like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> youngest daughter of Adam's family or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> something made by what's his name Adam </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Sandler maybe my brain was Dumb and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thought Adam Sandler was in it because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's The Adams Family yeah that's what I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was about to say but yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought we I thought that was like too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> obvious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but it's a real if you want like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> classic like funny like comedic uh show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I I'd say Adam's family's still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of the episodes I think are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> still really funny yeah did you ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> watch a thing too yeah oh yeah of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what is it you know it oh okay oh okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's it that's it yeah did you ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch the Twilight Zone since yeah oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah Twilight Zone I grew up with as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> well but like I don't think Twilight's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> always one of those shows where that I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would see it every now and then on TV I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wouldn't like religiously watch it like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Simpsons have you ever watched that TV </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> show that was like fact or fiction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and well the memes of that that guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> going like it's it's a lie I made it up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's not true I made enough I lied </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know I think so that sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] dude what God damn it why does such </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> a [ __ ] patch oh no no no no wait wait </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know what you're talking about yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the guy in like in the Smoky room in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Smoky room no I made it up yes okay no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> now I know what you're talking about I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know I think so I thought what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> didn't know that came from like a TV </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's uh uh beyond belief beyond belief </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh Jonathan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Frakes Beyond a belief I thought I don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> know I don't know why I just thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that was like a History Channel show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I thought so too yeah it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like a bunch of oh yeah and realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd forgotten where you parked your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> car ever gone mountain biking what do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to be when you grow up what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the right tip have you called it oh yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this one's good I like that show that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was really good yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> MythBusters I think we spoke about this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> a little while ago yeah I mean I met </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Adam Savage is great MythBusters is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] awesome if you don't know what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> MythBusters is Jerry take it away </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> MythBusters basically Adam and Adam </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Savage and Jamie Hyman uh they basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they used to work in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hollywood as like special effects uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> creators but they basically have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two guys with really long science </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> backgrounds who basically take common </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myths and scientifically prove whether </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's real or just a myth yeah um really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> simple concept but because they go about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it in a scientific way it's really cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to just see them be like all right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's the myths for example that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um there's the myth for example that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like uh enough balloons can pick up a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> human body off yeah so then they go out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and go all right how many balloons would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually take to pick up an average </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> human body off the ground and so they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would go through all this or like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> know another one was like um how many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> layers of uh of glass could stop a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> bullet yes for example there's also like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know can salsa dissolve prison bars </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just like all like a uh floss like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teeth floss yeah can it cut through a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> steel bar for example it's so it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they basically take common myths or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff you see in movies and they go is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like is that Capital fact it's basically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like uh you know the the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> predecessor to crazy YouTube engineering </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Channel yeah obviously I was going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say this did science YouTube before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> science YouTube yeah yeah absolutely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very it's very uh it feels very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nerdy yeah and it feels very you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't care if you don't like the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> or you don't like the style it feels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like they just wanted to make the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and make it for them yeah and make it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the way they wanted it and blow stuff up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was it was one of the few shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that managed to make science cool oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because whenever we think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> science engineering we just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fall asleep because like why why should </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I give a [ __ ] about chemistry or boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or like you know [ __ ] sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the reason we give about chemistry is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Breaking Bad that's right but but now oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're telling me that chemistry can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> blow things up and set things on fire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> okay suddenly I care now just like like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in a lot of in a lot of the episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I really enjoyed is the fact that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just purely Adam and Jamie just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if this would happen or like have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you ever thought about could this be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real like a one that's really good is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like um shell shock from grenades how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> close like it's the uh the myth of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's a grenade about to go off and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone Dives on top of it then that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will save everybody else yeah and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> what they would do is they would like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out of ballistics gel that would create </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a human shaped thing that would put it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on top of a grenade they would put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> another human some distance away and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then they would see if that human being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dies yeah and it was just funny because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just an excuse for them to just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> blow up a bunch of grenades I mean it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's funny because you you started those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the soft being like you know what they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did it for the name of science you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they want to blow [ __ ] off yeah I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like talking to the safety third </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys I'm like I just realized they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> find like the most convoluted reasons to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> find to find a reason to blow [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know that's true and that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> MythBusters basically honestly and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh you know a lot of like I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> watch the show religiously it was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> my favorite thing to watch it's a great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> TV show oh it's fantastic very well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah um editing any [ __ ] goes without </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> saying probably one of the best Cartoon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Network shows to come out I just love </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> edit nitty a lot I love the um I've got </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the name of the uh this art style where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the the every character's lines are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always moving oh that's like like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rubber hose no no rubber hose is more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like Disney like right oh like 30s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> animations yeah it's like it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like boiling lines or something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I love that the color palette oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> nuts I mean and like just it's one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> those shows that where I feel the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> original creators were just like what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> human anatomy yeah that doesn't exist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well tell us about the surgery what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happens Ed and Eddie's basically just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cartoon Network show from the 90s where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just two thousands is it 2000 it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the 90s for sure it's 2000 I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's somewhere around there though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> early 2000s where it's basically just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> based in a cul-de-sac in everyday </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> America and it's just a bunch of kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just [ __ ] doing random [ __ ] in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> cul-de-sac to try and get jawbreakers so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> try and get jawbreakers so they do a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch of schemes to try and money to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they love these draw breakers for some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> reason and they'll do anything yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's great every every character is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great that it's just fun show the voice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> acting is so good yes it aged really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well really really well the animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> style is so good there's a there's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> clip that recently I found on YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've just been obsessed with again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just this one episode where uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Eddie uh this guy in the middle here if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't know Eddie is like he he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dresses up as like a demon uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character to try and convince Ed who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the dumb guy to do a bunch of weird [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that he could like turn him into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a freak to like earn it a freak Show and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's one scene where he's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat your mattress and then edges looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the bed and he's like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it double D this little guy Ed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> comes in and it's just this scene of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just Edge [ __ ] eating this mattress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> hole and it's the most like okay before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it was yeah it was just like good Lord </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man he's just eating this mattress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um it's just the most absurdist humor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ever but it's really really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> funny like one thing that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> re-remembering Ed Edd and Eddie makes me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize is that our cartoons as weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> now no no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> a little bit a little bit different way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because I feel Eden Eddie kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> falls into the same genre of cartoons as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know the remnants team yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're in Stimpy where it's like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> absurdist to the point where it's almost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> gross oh yeah the art style can be gross </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> at times yeah well I was just I'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking about it I'm like man I watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of weird [ __ ] as a kid this era of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Cartoon Network had some of the weirdest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> television yeah it's like the Golden Era </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of course oh yeah like Cow and Chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was another one where I'm just like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Cow and Chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like these shows are [ __ ] weird well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you put this on Adult Swim it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> would totally just blend in oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely and I'm just like how did we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> grow up with these cartoons that's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] weird what yeah like re-watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some scenes of Ed and Nanny I'm like how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did I not get traumatized with some of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] I'm seeing right now like dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I would not show my kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of group Vibe uh yeah I kind of did </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> um I was definitely like the the Eddie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> type of character where I'm just like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was just convincing other people to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dumb [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that makes sense yeah I definitely had a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> friend who was like Ed yeah I was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like anything I told him to do he would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do I think everyone every friend group </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had an edge but that's the thing that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what I think that's what I think was so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good about ednetty was that it was such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> an absurdist like completely just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of the norm type of show but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters fundamentally were characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could recognize whereas like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was at least one character in edin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Eddie where you're like I have a friend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> who's like that or I'm like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> um music as well oh do an intro opening </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> best one so good um do I have to talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> about Arthur we say it's God is Arthur's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> got it if you don't know what Arthur is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just watch Arthur how would you even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> describe our [ __ ] children's TV but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so good that an adult could probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> enjoy it yeah like it is literally made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> for like five-year-olds but it's written </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so well that like again like as an adult </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like this is not it's it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> weird because it kind of hides its very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> adult themes in a very like friendly for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> children type of way like I think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really I think Arthur is one of the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows when it comes to subtle writing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah where it's like before you realize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it this character has been built up to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> be something that you can kind of be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah I I get what you're going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> through this is a really good episodes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah even when I was like 16 yeah come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> back from school if Arthur was on I'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> watch Arthur oh yeah yeah I loved Arthur </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> speaking of Banger openings my life oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> my God one of the most legendary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> cartoons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ingrained in my mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> etched in dude everybody thought they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were roster when they were listening to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] you know but uh very much a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shame that it's gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a legend in our hearts it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> weird because I know I watched so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes of Arthur I don't know if I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just too young no you do yeah but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't like remember much of it it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's only through memes that I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah this kind of happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing the headphones yeah wearing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> headphones on top of the years yeah the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] Arthur fist yeah that's Legend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> what about that uh what was it it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the the meme of um what's the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bulldog looking guy and he's like yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember and he's like and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> puts the headphones in he just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> starts tripping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love that one it's so good it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> really good show okay um the final two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ones are very Australian they look they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> look Australian holy [ __ ] which one do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you want to start with okay uh Russell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coits all Aussie Adventures okay so this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was um do you know the show Katherine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kim no it's like very like one of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most quintessential Australian sitcom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> shows very very funny we're only </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> important neighbors yeah well okay so it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> was it was if if neighbors is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> number one Captain Kinsley number two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like one of the most beloved shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I thought about putting that on there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but this guy uh he's uh I keep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgetting the guy's name the actor's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> name but he's also a comedian Russell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Russell Coit is this character oh so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> basically this is a parody of like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of survival like Steve Owen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> survival in Australia type of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> educational shows except this guy whose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> real name is not Russell Queen he's an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actor he plays this character called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Russell Coit who's like the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stereotypical like yeah I'm a you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a survival expert out in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he tries to give and it's it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sketch comedy show where it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Russell Coit just trying to like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell you about like how this like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is how you build a flyer in Australia or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh I just found a a a red belly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> black snake here's how you like get rid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of it but it always ends up in the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like horrific ways oh that's awesome </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's this one scene where he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking to some indigenous Australian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and uh and and and he's kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting them to like you know teach them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about like how to like pick berries in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the wildlife and stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> learning from them but there's this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reoccurring joke in in Russell Coit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where every time Russell Coit goes up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone and gives him a handshake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this one clip that replays every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> single handshake so it's like it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's almost like this stock image video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just the close-up of the hands right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hand shaking these two white guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> handshaking and it plays every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Russell Coit goes up to a new person and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gives him a handshake so this is one end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of one episode where he's talking to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these like indigenous Australians and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's going up to handshake all of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time he goes into handshake it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just cuts to two white guys handshaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> every and it's like it's this show is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like that sounds like a meme yeah it oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it is it dude like when people go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so like adults or both oh yeah like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there were some there were some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> instances where like it was very like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adult oriented where like he would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually get hurt in the show but in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a comedic kind of way but it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so incredibly funny because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the most perfect examples of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really subtle comedy in like sketch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> comedy shows right I don't know how well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it is aged today uh it might be you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think this is from like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> late 90s I think early 90s okay today's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> falling yeah yeah so some a lot a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> comedies of age Paul a lot of comedies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and another comedy that might have aged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> poorly from that time is this one uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's called fat Pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this is a show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so Kevin right our boy Kevin Kevin yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we [ __ ] bonded over the show again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other day when we were when we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Australia because this is one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those shows where I think everyone in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our age group watched this show all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right um so basically like you guys were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about Peep Show being like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> peak of like British cringe comedy yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is probably the Australian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> equivalent to it right okay so it's this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> show about uh this this guy Paulie uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is this like uh Italian Australian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immigrant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it's basically about his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character he's like a pizza delivery guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and he works at this like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sketch pizza shop right this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really sketch neighborhood of Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it's basically just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> daily shenanigans that he gets up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he has to deal with like these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] horrendous like Bogan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> customers and like uh because uh Paul </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Paulie this actor's name I think his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actual real name is Paul as well right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and uh all of the cast members are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know uh Italian immigrants in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia or like uh like Lebanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immigrants in Australia and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of the it's it's very much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> revolved around like kind of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> European and Middle Eastern immigrants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who migrated to Australia so a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of Comedy exists but you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to be part of that race to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand that comedy because it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ingrained in Australian comedy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um there's a really famous actress now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Hollywood uh Rebel Wilson I think her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> name is she started off in this show wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rebel Wilson she's not in this picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no this is right there oh yeah so she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started off this was like the show that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made her famous in Australia she played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this character called Tula who is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] obese-like girl who like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keeps ordering pizzas from this one okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay and uh and and it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's really [ __ ] difficult to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explain but basically it's hearing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> guys talk about Peep Show is basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the Australian equivalent of that take a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of cringe okay great great I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already interested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's incredibly cringe it can be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> incredibly offensive at times but also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really really funny yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um my Australian Brothers I know you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys get your sarcasm your cringe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> humor oh yes that's why like I would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> very interested to watch this yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] love it I feel this is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect window into what Australian like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you know comedy and like Civilization is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of like super sexy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we live in a civilization because to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> fair I have been to some places in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of outer Australia yeah where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> gives off this Vibe okay like these are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like they're exaggerations I think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people that exist in real life yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is is there a particular scene that uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sticks out oh [ __ ] I don't know so like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh like there's this one scene where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like uh Paulie gets like uh he has like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this uh friend who this Lebanese friend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh called Habib </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and he like pisses off Habib for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing something and then habib's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like don't [ __ ] get in my way bro I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna call up all my cousins and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's just like how many cousins do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have here and then five minutes later </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just like over the hill there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just these like 40 cars just full of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these Lebanese dudes that just like rock </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> up to the pizza shop and just start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> beating the [ __ ] out of Paulie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then and then Habib he he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> this character he plays like this like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stereotypical like Lebanese Australian </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guy so every time he takes off his shirt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like completely just like full </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of hair like you can't see any of his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> skin at all and it just like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plays into those stereotypes yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not in like a way where it's like racist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if that makes sense it's just like a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of like just very you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> tongue-in-cheap like slapstick comedy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah um that's very Australian all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right um and yeah that's uh my I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> watch TV tonight how hard was it to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this to be fair thinking about it now I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would probably replace maybe like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because I completely forgot about Top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Gear yeah yeah I'm like I mean I could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have put that down and I'm like what the </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> know okay so starting from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> these are these are so famous these are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> literally some of the most popular shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> what's this one this is TV show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> except I just framed it right this time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> okay okay so so I guess we don't talk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> about Pete's show yeah but I don't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to talk about teachers Always Sunny Game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of Thrones Peep Show the good place uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the original Justice League cartoon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shinobu uh Chernobyl sorry Battlestar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Galactica Black Mirror and Doctor Who I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> am very surprised by Battlestar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Galactica yeah hold up what okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> why why why Battlestar life you've never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> mentioned an interesting like sci-fi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff actually I I've realized it when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making this list but I've really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> love Sci-Fi TV shows what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you've never talked about yeah why have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you never like hinted at that what do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you mean okay this is the music is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because that I already talked about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> isakaya yeah you literally have never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> given inclination that you give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> about I would take you more seriously if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you stop talking about music you didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> talk about Dune huh you didn't talk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> about doing much I [ __ ] love dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dude's great dude's [ __ ] great I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's weird I think it's weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> right because I [ __ ] love uh sci-fi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just don't like Star Wars in terms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's like that's like that's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um so yeah walk is um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's one of the few sci-fi shows oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry one of the few uh television shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I actually got to complete when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was in universities it's been a while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> since I watched battle started Galactica </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I enjoyed the sternie the journey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from start to end basically if you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a synopsis of the basic plot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Battlestar Galactica it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh humans have colonized the Galaxy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are like 13 colonies or some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that and then they also built AIS </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right AI robots and of course the AIS </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had an uprising where the AIS I believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they destroyed 12 of the 13 colonies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah and the one remaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surviving group of humans they tried to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> find the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mythical 13th colony which is Earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn damn but uh what makes it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting is of course these are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the last 50 or 60 000 humans that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just traveling through space trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find this last Colony uh but of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're on the run from the robots which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like I think I believe they're called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cylons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but the twist is that the robots the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> cylons are so well programmed that there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are some cylons that have invaded this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fleet right of humans but they're so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well programmed that they don't even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know that they're like a sleeper agent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right so and they look and sound and act </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly like humans do and there's no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> real way to detect them so basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> real Blade Runner [ __ ] huh that's a real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Blade Runner Yeah so basically it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] sci-fi Among Us you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Among Us is sci-fi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess it is so it's just Among Us you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> know what Among Us it's just Battlestar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Galactica with the suits on okay how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> many seasons it's battlestock I like to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get the game okay this is what I liked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> about Battlestar galatzuka I believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's only four seasons and it finished </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it up yes it's all finished it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> complete story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but what I found really what one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the one thing I really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liked because that's why I've rarely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rarely finished TV shows yeah uh number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh is that even though they have this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know tension between like oh who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's a human who's a Cylon and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything like that what I really liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the show is how it took this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> group of colonies and really explored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some really interesting ideas about what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would happen if you try to govern these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> group of people right so basically they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of created a mini Nation right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they they draw you in with like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Space Battles and just the pew pew pew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all that stuff like that but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's yeah yeah exactly but what kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me interesting interested was in fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the politics the politics behind behind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the spaceship the space this last space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> colony and like what happened between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you govern all of the humans and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that on and I found that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way more interesting than the PPP and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Among Us part of the uh part of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the show I mean visual services so far </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> visuals can only take you so far </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> um it is just one of the best sci-fi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shows I've question then did you enjoy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Firefly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have not seen Firefly okay because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> feel from if you liked Battlestar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Galactica I think you'd really like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like have you seen Firefly yeah okay all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I know is I didn't finish yeah well they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> made a movie called Serenity afterwards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which was supposed to be like the is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that the sequel is that really like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sequel to it though no because I've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Serenity no it's not it's not a secret </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what okay what is fireflies about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because all I know is like a space </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> spaghetti western or something like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty much I'm trying to also remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> what it was about to be honest what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shouldn't find I just remember it being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> really good because like I fireflies is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that one show that every person tells </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you to watch yeah every every Sci-Fi TV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> fan will be like Firefly best yeah I fly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best and I'm like but it was right by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Joss Whedon is that a good thing or a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bad thing anymore I don't know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's that thing you know okay it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of piss me off anyway but I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> next okay while we're on uh sci-fi then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Doctor Who okay okay because me seeing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that immediately I was like holy [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> forgot this show existed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but more broadly Doctor Who in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Russell T Davis era okay yes so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically I'm okay the thing about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Doctor Who fans is a lot of them are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just [ __ ] insufferable right they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like the they're like the modern </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Star Trek fans of old you know I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> same thing can be said for a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these shows to be honest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean if a Show's good in some way yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> long running it gets insufferable yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I mean but like that's why I like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really talk about Doctor Who but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I.E it's a good show it's a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really [ __ ] show and I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this I I said Battlestar galatzka is one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the best sci-fi shows I've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doctor Who is the best sci-fi shows it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is I I'll agree with that yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is in terms of like TV shows yeah it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> by far the show that tackles the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weirdest ideas you could ever imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it has like what I love about Doctor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who is that every episode is like kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of self-contained right every episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tackles a different idea a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time period a different place in space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and time right that's what that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> makes it so [ __ ] interesting but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it has like an overarching plot as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you don't necessarily need to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the beginning of Doctor Who to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't because no one knows where the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes are because the BBC dumped all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the episodes oh really well because back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in the day they thought why the [ __ ] are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we need to Archive this stuff oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> threw it away so I think a bunch of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> original original original logical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episodes are on you can watch them it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like lost media yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably never going to be found </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like to me like Doctor Who like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> David Tennant's obviously my doctor but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I all I really really he's my doctor oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> God I sound like fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I always like Doctor Who when I watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah but I just never got into it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like I would watch episodes here and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> there you know the Christmas special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah I think I started with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because because David Taylor was the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 10th season yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and I think I started on like season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eight of season nine I don't remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> which one is this after like the who was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the doctor I don't remember whoever it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was before oh bless you whoever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I would know his face if I saw it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whoever it wasn't was it it was whoever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> before it was before David okay that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Christopher okay okay it was uh that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first one I watched where I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh what is this show and then I said and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then David tennan Doctor Who like season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 where I was just like holy [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's great he liked an amazing actor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like like the Christopher Eccleston </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also amazing actor as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I just think that it wasn't Matt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Smith's fault it was like Stephen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moffat's fault was it Stephen Moffat I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's Stephen Moffat I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> which season was the week John left the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> BBC yeah I stopped watching Doctor Who </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> once I left the BBC okay yeah he bad no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> loyalty to it anyway the Weeping Angels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> episode is by far my favorite yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that is probably the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unnerving episode of Television ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because like the the real beauty of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Doctor Who is I remember I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting into dog two through Christopher </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Eccleston and that was like when the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Russell T Davis era started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and I remember watching like a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes and I was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look at the monsters man look that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's literally this is literally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worst CGI I've ever seen in my life so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the CGI would make [ __ ] some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime CJ it would make berserk 2017 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look like [ __ ] God's here man that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how bad the CGI was and I'm like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute garbage why does everyone hype </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> up Doctor Who but then I just like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just keep watching and somehow the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> writing is so compelling that it it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dances the perfect line between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> campiness and you know just epicness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just great television because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's something where if you just step </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out for a minute and just look at it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of context look at like something like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Daleks or something and I'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like and you're just like why uh why is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this guy pointing a light at a talking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> washing machine or extermining why is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> got a [ __ ] suction cup look [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it looks [ __ ] ridiculous right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but that just shows how [ __ ] good the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> writing is and the actors are of this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Doctor Who world right and that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah there's just there's just a certain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> magic where technically it is also a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> children's show but it turns everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who watches it into a child oh yeah well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it turns you it gives it turns you back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into that point in life where you didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> question things too much you just saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something cool on TV and you're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like wow that's that's that's scary you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> know and yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> always go to the [ __ ] Doctor Who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Museum in Cardiff yeah really yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because a lot a lot of uh Doctor Who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shot in Wales oh really sorry I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cardiff they have a ton of like a big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Museum or something I remember oh my God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my school used to drag me and I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] hate this I don't like doctor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> here I I also have a family guy Museum I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> also thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I also thought it was really genius the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> writing that they Incorporated I guess </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for the TV show where like at the end of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> each season like when the doctor dies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quote unquote like he's just like no he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't die it's just another version of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> him dying and that's just like a great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> way to just be like all right next </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> season who who wants to be the doctor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah who wants to be the doctor I also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> think it's a good way to like reset the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> house yeah to one freshen up and it just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> resets the ongoing story because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thing is even though there's like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's one massive ongoing story which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like the doctor tries to find his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> home planet you know but then every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> iteration of a doctor who has their own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of self-contained story with their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own characters their own Side characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> within their own self-contained story uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I just think uh I just think uh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> David sounds amazing David is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing I mean he's just an amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> actor and Jessica Jones he's insane [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you know like I'm has he been in more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> roles aside from Doctor Who and Jessica </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Jones I think he does a lot of theater </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so I think he he doesn't do as much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> TV I think he's theater trainer right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he I think he does a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> theater yeah as much on the side of uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah he's really good yeah uh anyway </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Doctor Who it's worse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> let's talk about Game of Thrones I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to talk about that first okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> going going off the Breaking Bad uh Game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Thrones going off the Breaking Bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Point okay okay this is definitely going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to be a hot take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought season 8 was the best what are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gonna say I prefer the later seasons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of Game of Thrones [ __ ] oh God genuinely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay genuinely do you know how bad oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that is I I was tired right we've been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> filming all day that woke me the [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I will tell you how bad of a take that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was I haven't seen a single episode of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Game of Thrones and I know that was gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that's how I know how much of a bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thing that was like it's like I want the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> one written by uh the people who didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read the book and I want Ed Sheeran in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it and I want people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah Ed Sheeran was in an episode like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it is it is just bad oh my God what do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you like about that what explain </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself okay okay you're on trial right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now okay I'm on trial right now like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> said like I said about breaking bad it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt like tell me the season it got good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first and then tell me why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> um I mean I mean I think it was always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> good okay well it was always good but it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> just got when I really when I really got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invested was around season six my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite season was about season seven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> uh I mean season seven the One season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where like oh everyone got pissed off no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's season eight oh that's season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> eight and even even I'm like okay season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> eight okay that's that was that was that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> was seven that was a little blunder that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a little blunder right there all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but I I okay because here's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thing right going back to my Breaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bad energy I know I got the entire world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching me right now I have got the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> entire [ __ ] world watching me right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now and then people will wonder man why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is the subreddit spiking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after this episode goes live you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> here I can understand the Breaking Bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> take you this one feels irredeemable I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> can't wait to read the comments on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode go on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I said Game of Thrones seasons one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to four is almost perfect television </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] fantastic yeah characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are well written well defined the World </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> building is amazing and everything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um like I said seasons one to four I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't really have any emotional </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> attachment to it it's literally George </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> RR Martin's baby at that point that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's he did everything at that point no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I no no I I agree so how do you how do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you what how do you get more attached </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when [ __ ] HBO takes over with their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> generic Riders because one thing that I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] love one aspect I love in any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> media is when you have different kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> different kind of aspects and cultures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clashing together right that's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like why I've really I'm invested in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> MCU where you have you know Wizards and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> superheroes and now you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cosmic God people all existing within </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same universe and that's that's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that's because that's what drew me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into Game of Thrones originally and what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I [ __ ] my favorite parts of Game of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones was in the later Seasons when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you finally saw this these different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worlds that have been built up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seasons one two and three and four and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that you finally saw all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> these worlds kind of colliding in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> together and having some really really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool moments is the writing as good [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no okay I will fully admit the writing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is not as good but was it [ __ ] badass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing the Dothraki riding over a hill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a [ __ ] Dragon like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burning the Lannisters hell yeah that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> was bad [ __ ] ass and I will like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> defend that [ __ ] all right I think it it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it built it up so well and then just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] unraveled the coil and then just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> threw a bunch of cool battles at us to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> distract our pretty little brains I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think it it squandered everything it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> built up I I think it was about politics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then it suddenly became about Ed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Sheeran and shitty battles and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> rushing it no I will totally agree it it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Seasons you Game of Thrones was two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> completely different shows I mean that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I fully admit it was two completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different shows and technically I should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of like every bone in my body think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that the first four seasons are the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better ones but I'm following my heart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my heart says you cool dragons for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burning stuff oh look at the dragons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burning the ice zombies isn't that so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> cool oh God if you wanted an easy card </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> gun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes okay yes let's get the [ __ ] out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> here with this [ __ ] tape I actually [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take when do you okay when do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Game of Thrones Go Bad season five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> season five yeah season five started </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> falter what was it what was what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> happened in season five again I felt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like season five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't remember exactly I do remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> because I had been watching Game of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones weekly since season three season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three was amazing season four was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] god tier yeah one of the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> iconic moments in the series uh just it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like headies and four season three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> season four as well I had the one fight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> between the two people oh memorable oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah um I love how he just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fully understood no yeah you know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> um I remember that scene actually gave </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> me PTSD like what yeah how seeing a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> character and this happens a lot by the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way but there's there's one particular </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> scene where you saw a character that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really liked I mean you got emotionally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attached to seeing them like get killed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off in such a gruesome way hmm it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> actually gave me like an emotional like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guttural reaction yeah me too yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it was isn't that a good thing though it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was horrible no no that's why it's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though yeah I know I know they managed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get that emotion out of you yeah I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> totally agree it was a different thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't do that yeah I don't know man I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what characters I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] that doesn't [ __ ] do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> again yeah and then like you know end of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> season three as well what happened at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end of season three one of the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> famous one of the most iconic TV moments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of all time yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> no you've heard of it you know you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> heard of it yes don't know anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about it I know you don't but the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> thing I know about Game of Thrones is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's Lord of the Rings with tits yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like like that's what people have told </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> me like people are dumb yeah like I said </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like you sold me like I said perfect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> television </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is a pretty recent one I feel like I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> seen this if you've gone on Netflix </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you've seen this yeah yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> pushed it down everyone yeah this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a Netflix show again only four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> seasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um it passes itself off as a comedy but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really think it's a comedy so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole premise of the good place is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you know the good place is an analogy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for heaven of course okay so all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these people have died and gone to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heaven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except for Kristen Bell who is the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character in the good place uh she wakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up in heaven right but when they tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> her like when I talk about her life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story and identity in person she was and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything she did on Earth she realizes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that she's up in heaven by mistake okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the whole premise initially is her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to convince everyone that yes she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this person who they all believe her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be and she is a good person that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> belongs in heaven right uh and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's how the premise of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> story you know starts off and honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I the good place started off as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show that was just you know I just put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on in the background as background noise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like this isn't bad but this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like good enough where I'm like I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have it on the background just as white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> noise to be like oh it's it's all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all right it's it's a I like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> concept of like them going up to heaven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that it was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice little Chemistry Between all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters and everything like that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and then without spoiling what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens a big twist happens at the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the first season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I like I did not know that it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be that kind of show where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned the good place into just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like wacky sitcom comedy into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these characters have a motive and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're going to try to achieve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something and I have an end goal and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get to see not only the the character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> progression but it kind of just becomes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> an entire Adventure right like Bojack </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right like lulls you in with the funny </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> animals and just hits you with the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> depression yeah yeah exactly but yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one one thing I [ __ ] loved about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good place is one like it is a whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> complete story right when you when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> think of most sitcoms sitcoms don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really have stories you know what I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitcoms are just okay you know you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> self-contained it's it's kind of like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which character's gonna get with which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character oh is Rachel gonna get with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ross oh Rachel go with Ross by the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> end of friends bye-bye I really hope </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that wasn't going to I hope nobody cares </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about that spoiler to be fair I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> close to putting friends on them that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a good show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but the point is there isn't really an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ongoing story yeah this one had comedic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moments right but what it what what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really shines in my eyes is the ongoing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> story and within this ongoing story it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tackles so many issues about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> afterlife about religion about morals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's one of those shows where you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get you get in on the laughs and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know you say Bojack was about depression </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I was surprised you didn't put Bojack on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> by the way I thought I thought someone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> would put Bojack yeah I don't know I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't you know I feel like everything's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been said about it yeah yeah but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the good place is one of those shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you end and it's just like such a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing it leaves you with like such a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> warm feeling where it feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> wholesome yeah it's it's it's I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watched it through osmosis </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's not just it's not just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wholesome but it gives you like a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> life message at the end of it and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like damn you know get sort of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> opposite of Bojack the neutral yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there are two sides of the coin yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly where you know it you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> leave the end of good place and I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> never just like I've never cried over a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> leave in a good good place do I believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in a good place do you leave in a good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> place do you leave in a good place well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I won't spoil oh what the ending of good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> place is thank you but uh but you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's I've I've it's all right yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> rare that I cry over a sitcom okay but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the sick the good place is the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comedy that's ever made me cry at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> end of it just because seeing these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> characters come to the end of their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Journey their adventure and just seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how each character story ended was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so gratifying and I was just genuinely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> happy for everyone in the story amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] shot uh just season one just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> wait till the end of season one uh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you want to talk about now let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> do Black Mirror Black Mirror okay why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Black Mirror why Black Mirror because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> okay okay before before we start talking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about that yeah do you think if let's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> say uh for example like Australia Game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Thrones has three Banger seasons and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like three dog [ __ ] Seasons that it kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of levels it out because like Black </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Mirror is that well I actually prefer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the later Seasons [ __ ] I'm kidding I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kidding okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was about to go bald from the race she </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is great because I have bad enough taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that that would be actually believable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no I wouldn't believe it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> no like okay let's the British ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when it was in our control it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> amazing three was actually pretty good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> as well I will say three three I think I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> only watched up until three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well I mean season one and two I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> season two is just oh Season Two Season </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> three fantastic White Christmas yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean I think uh season one and two and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half the season three is like that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all the Black Mirror that exists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind but to me Black Mirror is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything that I look for in a TV show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think part of that part of that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I just like how much I respect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the original creator of Black Mirror </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah Charlie Brooker yeah one of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest influences of all time seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him seeing him go from like a TV show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where he basically does what I do and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> review movies and events and stuff like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that go and see him do Black Mirror was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just such a I actually didn't know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fine huh I actually didn't know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was by Charlie you didn't you didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah no you don't know he's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> incredibly [ __ ] talented </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and just seeing the [ __ ] wild ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ideas that Black Mirror had in season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one and two and three I mean it kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> just it it so like accurate that it kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of mirrors a lot of things that have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> happened post the uh oh yeah Post Post </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Release right there's a reason why like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Black Mirror is almost like in our </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> vocabulary with explaining like Tech </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that scares us yeah oh yeah everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is described and it's [ __ ] annoying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but anything that is scary and tech oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that's very Black Mirror it's one of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most like perfect commentaries I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah of this generation basically it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's the it's such a perfect meta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> commentary on just the world in general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is now yeah I use meta right this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but uh yeah I don't I don't really know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what else I can say about it I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> anything to meant like if attack the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> scares you that should be it watch it </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> watch anything go into it you'll have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> great time yeah because if I didn't put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Black Mirror on it's like I I I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Charlie Brooker took such inspiration </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from Twilight Zone right because that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only other like goat Anthology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> series that I can think of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> goatsology did I use ghosts right there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't follow me that makes sense yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like I it's I actually really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> really [ __ ] love Anthology series oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah when it's done right like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> love that robots </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> can we put love can we talk about love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> death and robots for a bit because you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> need to watch Love death and robots I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> think we actually spoke about it on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast not too long ago yeah we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely recommended it because it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> so uh because we all watched season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> three oh yeah I'll watch season yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like Joe watch season three oh okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we've talked about too much TV no I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> mean love death and robots season three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Banger season one Banger season two you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> know yeah has has its Sparks yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season three is really fun season three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is great yeah I just love seeing the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thing the thing I love about Anthology </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> series is just seeing so many different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ideas experiments put into one it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experimental you know this is literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the opposite of a show like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Breaking Bad you know where it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is just so many different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ideas that are packed into different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shows and it doesn't need to be a 10 out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of 10 Banger every time sometimes you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have like a little bit of lull but what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I what I appreciate always an anthology </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> series is that someone has something to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say and they have yeah it's always fresh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and they have one chance to say it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so it's it's always like it's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is interesting especially when they have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like when they're like different </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> directives or different cinematographers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for episodes yeah completely unique feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to each one oh yeah yeah exactly I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Black Mirror Has some really iconic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes that I think are like must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> watches yeah like white Christmas being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> one like Christmas amazing yeah uh the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] uh my favorite episode of Black </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Mirror is probably like the American </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Idol parody one the oh that was in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season two I believe yeah [ __ ] I forgot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the name of that episode I forgot the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> name of the episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like that one as well with like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> wife who like gets the uh AI yeah oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> she gets the dead husband and her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> husband dies she got a husband like doll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that's like gets her like memories </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and he like slowly learns like the post </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> memories yeah that one's creepy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can see Japan doing that yeah is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> scary is that scary that I see Japan no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely absolutely that's so Black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Mirror </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the sex toys be like yeah so so uh you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have three left which one do you want to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> talk about all right let's go with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Always Sunny first I mean literally the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> ghost actually I feel like Sunny is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> the most American Comedy sitcom yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Peep Show is the most British yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely oh you wouldn't say Big Bang </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Theory </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you wouldn't say How I Met Your Mother </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> oh Malcolm in the Middle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I I realized like watching things like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always sunny and uh Peep Show and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that maybe I just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to see awful people do awful 100 it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like awful people just funny right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly I mean that's essentially what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like people sure is not to boil it down </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and really like dilute it but like yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the same awful people but just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> British version yeah yeah exactly and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like a lot of a lot of let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> say Peep Show storylines I could easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> see happening in order yeah but just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the the dynamic would be completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah you know what I mean right where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always sunny again is just uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> five most awful people in this world </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just doing awful things and having awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ideas and trying to like win in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this world it's one of the funniest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sitcoms and long running for a reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah the only reason I think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of hard to get into is the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> season first four seasons yeah we're in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like a four by three aspect ratio and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> look a bit weird yeah oh really I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know why also I think the first season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is good but the second season is when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they introduce Danny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's when it goes from a good show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to a [ __ ] great show because I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Danny DeVito adds so much to their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> chemistry yeah and what I love about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Always Sunny is if you look at like any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the outtakes and everything like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you can tell that so much of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> this is just [ __ ] improv yeah right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there are so many lines It's Always </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Sunny that you're like where the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> did this come from and you know that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> they just [ __ ] made it up on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's so good though it's so weird I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> don't think I've actually sat down and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched like a full episode oh my God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen so many Clips because it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] iconic there's like there's so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> many like I could have thought about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> putting this but it felt so wrong in no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> sense because I'm like I think this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my favorite but there's so many American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sitcoms that are like occupy the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> space in my mind like Arrested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Development not the new season it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just really [ __ ] funny uh what are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> some other really good American sitcoms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that are very adult humor they're really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well written communities really good as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well Curb Your enthusiastic because yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really good as well yeah I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Sunny is always always sunny is like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> best it's the best out of all of them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> um yeah I don't know it's just don't be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> sad when it ends up I'm I'm surprised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's gone on for this long honestly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well they renewed it for like what two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more seasons I think at least two more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah do you think they just did 11 or 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so I can't remember so many [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> good meme ball moments as well you dumb </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] I love that one yeah it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like sometimes you have you have a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> moment where you're watching these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people do these awful things and you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like [ __ ] do I kind of relate to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what one of the characters is saying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's like that's the problem is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been a few characters you're they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> are not remotely like but it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> audience alike I actually like this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no you're not supposed to you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> supposed to like them you're like [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can actually like kind of kind of I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like them I mean it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's so it's so awful that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] amazing I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] you have to watch it uh I will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just just watch always watch any </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> episodes out of context and I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll be all right but I think that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the thing is like I've only seen Clips </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> out of context and it's still funny yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly because I think all I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all they do is just like what would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happen if we just put these four or five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> characters into a situation and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they just like let the characters act </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out the situation kind of feels like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> improv class in some ways right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they've worked together so long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they kind of like know each other's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> beats and everything like oh yeah like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do not know how they film some of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> without [ __ ] laughing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right okay two left let's do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Chernobyl I mean I love this series I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> thought about putting it on yeah I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't know is it because it's too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good it's too good you know how like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> said Breaking Bad is too polished like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the most polished and clean TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> show that is just unarguably amazing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> when I first saw this and and I haven't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen this but when I first saw pictures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of this I thought it was like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> documentary series no yeah uh I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I mean I mean it's not a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> documentary series but obviously based </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on real events yeah you actually believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that it's based on real events yeah it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is it is it's one of those stories yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] what happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah bro when when they were writing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Chernobyl in real life bro they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] knew what they did they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make some great television man yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but what I love about shinobu obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's based on real life but it's one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those stories that happened in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is so [ __ ] insane that it's you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of watch this and you're like wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> this is an insane story oh wait this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually [ __ ] reality is strange </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> non-fiction yeah you can't actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe that some of the [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened in Chernobyl actually happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here and yeah it's just like I said it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just such a perfectly crafted TV show I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think the reason I've really liked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Chernobyl uh is because it's only like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a mini series it's so so short yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like how many episodes is it five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> seconds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh wow yeah it is it is not much you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watch it in a day or two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> um two evenings it is just amazing you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> will not regret okay I think yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know I haven't met a single person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> who watched this TV show that didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sing its Praises because like the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing I loved about it is that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one thing that I normally don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about let's say biopics or you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shows about real life events is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's nothing thing there's nothing to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> keep me coming back because I already </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know the ending because it happened </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah because it happened but it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the journey yeah yeah no no no like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it is about the journey you're right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes my brain like my brain is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I need something to keep me coming back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> every week yes but I think with biopics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> what's so like interesting and unique </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about them is that you can give a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more context in a human sense to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> events and the characters involved in a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> sense yeah yeah exactly I also think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the reason why a lot of biopics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are just movies yeah right because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like one clean package because you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know what's going to happen most of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> time right but what what I what like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drew me into Chernobyl immediately and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kept me going to the end that made me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate the journey because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> journey was amazing but the the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> thing I think it did perfectly was it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> set up this mystery right so this power </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> plant spoilers this power plant </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> basically explodes in Ukraine [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> alcohol </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's only the most devastating nuclear </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> disaster exactly history and within like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first episode they set up this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concept of this is impossible it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> impossible for a nuclear explosion to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happen on this scale it is so impossible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that when it actually exploded people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't even believe that you know it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it happened it was because of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nuclear reaction right no that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's that was part of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> incompetence of the uh higher-ups back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then where where they were sending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people to check on the nuclear reactor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to check on what caused this explosion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and people were like oh there's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bits of nuclear debris everywhere and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like I don't believe you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> check yourself and and so of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone who checked would would die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because they would be exposed to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lethal a lethal dose of radiation yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and so he sets off this mystery and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that mystery like continues throughout </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire series and that's what kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me coming back was just not only just to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see what happened but there was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mystery that I wanted to see how they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> resolved this because I genuinely didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know and I genuinely wanted to know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's just something impossible I feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Chernobyl the Chernobyl event is one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> those things where everyone knows the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> name of it and everyone knows what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> happened but very few people actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know how it happened how or why yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's also really eerie the series like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's always really like slow like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of violin eerie music that Creeps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in yeah at no point is it even remotely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> happy it's like depressing all the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> through yeah and like the cinematography </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as well in this isn't sucking fast it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> stunning yeah like watching this is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a treat all of the actors are amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah um I think the only thing that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could do better is that it could be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe it's like a bunch of British </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actors so it could be like Russian to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> make a little more believable I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really need it I felt like it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great like yeah you know it was good it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like and I think I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Chernobyl has made like by itself made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> me just afraid of just the sound of a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> geiger counter there's yeah like the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> they use the Geiger counters sounds you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> know it's it's literally like scarier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than a horror movie yeah right that is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> horror movie yeah exactly where there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think there's a scene where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> um these guys are like in like the sewer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something trying to figure out where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to get in this nuclear power plant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the bottom out yeah from the bottom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up right and you see you just hear the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> geiger counter and all you hear is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> geiger counter and then since they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wearing like full suits you don't hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> them say anything you just hear the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breathing and the guide counter and with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those two elements alone they're able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> create such a [ __ ] tense a terrifying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> atmosphere and it's just it's just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it's insane amazing television you will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> not regret it uh and I just finally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finally Justice League I get to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> about Justice League did not expect this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one I was kind of expecting considering </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you are like a big MCU guy yeah yeah yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so I mean it's not MCU though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I mean this series is a banger I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will admit this straight up as a bank </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you know so I don't think I ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched this dude this [ __ ] whenever it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> got came on TV felt like a [ __ ] treat </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was never on it was it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing and I I agree it was never on TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but every time every time it did come on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK I watched the [ __ ] out of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right and like I like I got a confession </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like not a massive fan of like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> DC Superheroes you know you're a Marvel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guzzling I'm not even like a I wasn't a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fan of like the mark actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I grew up with like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Spider-Man cartoon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you literally eluded the tell us last </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> couple seasons of Game of Thrones to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> MCU earlier because like I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why I just always thought like the DC </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um characters were just kind of boring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know Superman was kind of just two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Spanish boys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Superman's boring Wonder Woman's boring </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Superman is just a dude Green Lantern is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like who Okay Batman's obviously go dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> flashes like like in most iterations of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Batman I was just like this is this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of just boring he's just like he's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just edgy he's dark he's good in this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's uh the reason I [ __ ] love this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Justice League is every character who I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> normally hate in their own individual </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> media every character in this is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] Banger like they they they made </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Batman like Batman by himself I never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> found interesting Batman in a squad of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> superheroes where everyone's got [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> super powers and yeah Batman's the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> badass out of all of this group [ __ ] yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay I bet I became a Batman Sim because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the Justice League right uh because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the Justice League cartoon and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think like Superman is a like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way more interesting character in here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in most of what most of like the films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen betrayed because he's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what I love about him here is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he feels like the father of the group </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know he really cares about everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deeply and like he's he's like he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Batman's like the Rogue right in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> group but he's still like really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good friends with Batman as well and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can see a lot of a lot of The Chemistry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Between the group really grow and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> develop as characters as from the series </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beginning to the series then because I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember I was like I really liked the </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> all the [ __ ] powers to the girls yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> one of them no that's more that's my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> smaller but actually one of my favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> arcs involved like Hall girl which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what basically I I really is it Hawkeye </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or am I just like making [ __ ] out I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really hope it's a girl and she's a hawk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's when her species actually like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invades earth right that's one of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> favorite movie arcs uh sorry Justice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> League's like where her entire species </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> invades Earth and basically just takes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over and creates this dystopian Society </SPEAKER_04>
