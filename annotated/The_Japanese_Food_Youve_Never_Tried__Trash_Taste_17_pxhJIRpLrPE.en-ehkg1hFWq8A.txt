<SPEAKER_03> - You good? You good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You good? You good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just doing my hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, we're just gonna wait here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just let Connor do his hair, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't even see what I'm
doing, I'm just bullshitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (gentle electronic jingle) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am your host for today, Gigguk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and with me today, I do not have a guest! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the first time! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This feels so refreshing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, for like, the past two
times we've had guests on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just haven't been
able to sit in the center </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I deserve to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love how the, as well
the subreddit has come up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this controversy
or like conspiracy that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, Garnt is the one that always hosts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the guest episodes
because he's the most social </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the three." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, no,
- No, there is no conspiracy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just a coincidence that both times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was my scheduled time to be a guest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But this is my time now, I get this side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Finally, you're sitting by yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get the entire camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to yourself.
- Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're meeting again
with the boys, as per usual. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was that drop in energy, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You just got like, sad, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know! And there's the boys there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Gigguk! And the
boys, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I should be the tired one,
I've been up since 4:00 AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why were you up since four? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was doing fucking
Carson's pool tournament. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you for inviting all
of us by the way, Carson. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there was only one madman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between our group who
was willing to wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at like, 3:30 AM? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 3:30 AM, and then I had
Japanese school after, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I had to go into Tokyo and then I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to come back here and do the podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But Carson, fuck you for kicking
me out of the tournament! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As you, I don't know if you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys probably didn't see this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was crushing my opponent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, do you wanna
explain the tournament? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was an eight ball
pool tournament, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and 64 bracket, and I was first to play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I didn't have any
knowledge of what the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this fucking pool table looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an eight bit Windows kind of game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He kept saying, "No, it's
great" on the stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was fucking awful, Carson. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like you, Carson, by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like you, Carson, but I
don't like your pool table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This pool sucked, Carson! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyway, immediately, I was against Botez </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just started clapping her, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting all of these
balls in, no problem whatsoever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was down to the eight ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like, something weird happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the fucking, in the pool thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Carson, what is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "Oh, don't worry.
Just click, just click." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I just clicked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I shouldn't have believed Carson, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of course he's gonna troll me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the first game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I just ignored it, potted
the black, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Right, see you guys in the next round." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was about to leave the call, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they were like,
"Wait, you lost, Connor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "What do you mean, I lost?!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, oh, you picked the wrong hole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "It didn't give me-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my god, Carson fucking played me, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Carson, why?! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because in eight ball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to select which pocket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna put the eight ball in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you put it in a different hole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then you automatically lose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel so lied to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because on Miniclip, on
the eight ball pool game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (in high-pitched voice) Miniclip! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going way back! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's from Miniclip, right? The game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This game, which is the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I know he plays all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't have to select a fucking pocket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you just hit it in any of them! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt lied to.
- That's normie rules though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bro, that aint competition rules. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Justice for CDawg,
man, that's all I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me my 20K cash prize. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing I noticed
about playing pool is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear, every country I play pool in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with a different person, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone has their own fucking rules. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what happens half the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like Uno and Monopoly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like the free
parking spot in Monopoly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone just makes up
their own fucking rules, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no one knows what the actual rule is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just, no, no, the
actual rule is nothing happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just, that's genuine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- That's the actual rule, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because in my house,
- nothing happens! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - what you would do is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know how you have to pay- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The taxes!
- Pay taxes and 50 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's bullshit.
- to get out of jail? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All of that money goes into the middle, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then if you land on free
parking, you get the pot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's hopeless optimism. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, y'know, we like to
think our taxes go somewhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perhaps to someone else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't, they just
get sucked into a hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't get, nothing
comes of your taxes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not happy about it, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what happens,
I remember I saw this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That makes more sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, nothing happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- And it's just sad! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just taxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how this
one rule in Monopoly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just got spread around like, globally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it was not on
any rule books, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like pity rules. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think because it's so depressing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to do a roll in Monopoly, and
it's like, "Wait, nothing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like nothing, like not even a bad thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no just nothing.
- Especially when it's already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a game when nothing
fucking happens sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Oh, I landed
on my own property." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could you imagine if
there was a white circle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on Mario Party, and it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my god, what's gonna happen?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just nothing, nothing,
nothing's gonna happen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's white. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, have you guys ever
completed a game of Monopoly? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I have never completed a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I just
don't have that patience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I would like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am so competitive that I will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trap everyone.
- Of course you are! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course you are! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will trap everyone in the
room until the game is over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This just calls for
a Monopoly episode now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We need to play Monopoly for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long is a game of
Monopoly meant to last? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Depends how much you suck (laughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I've been in Monopoly games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've lost like two, three hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a short game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, this is the thing,
some people don't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you let auctions happen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think in the rules, auctions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> aw fuck, are they allowed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they're allowed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought they were
allowed, I could be wrong now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just get to a point in Monopoly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where just the money is just circular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Where people are just passing
the cans to each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's exactly what it feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> playing a game of
Monopoly that I'm used to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like to do the mind games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just let my opponents know immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the get-go how I'm playing them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe they give up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe it would end faster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it wasn't for the free parking rule. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably why,
- Probably why nothing happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Oh, shit,
I've got 50 bucks left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank god I landed on free parking." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> $2,000 comes to me and then it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keeps repeating over and over again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There shouldn't be a way for someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who has no properties
to get back in the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They should be out, they
deserve to be out for their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> poor financial decisions.
- So maybe if we do play it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the podcast or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then we should just completely
get rid of that rule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And free parking is just a white spot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll get Maylene on as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we can play Monopoly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maylene, do you wanna play Monopoly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with us for an episode? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, She says yes.
- She said yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> She said, "Absolutely, boys!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Going back to pool though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what are the rules when you foul? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I swear there's a different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking rule in every country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> When you do a foul, do you
get control of the white ball? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you get two shots? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is the rule? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So my understanding, I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the official rules
are, but my understanding is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you sink the white
ball, then you can place- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put it wherever you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can place it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wherever you want.
- But is wherever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> past a certain line? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or is it whenever you want- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I thought it was! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But apparently it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that snooker? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's a different gamer form. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck, dude, I don't wanna say anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm gonna be wrong
no matter what I say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're probably wrong here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's gonna be someone
in the comments that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I know the
international rules of pool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You are all wrong." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you pot two in a row,
multiball happens, where there's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm chatting shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you were serious there! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "Multiball? What's that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just sweating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like pinball, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> When all the, it's like
the best part, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I think, like yeah,
because every single person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gone to Baggis with to play pool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're just like, "Oh,
it's two shots, right?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's behind this white line </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you have to shoot it forward." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> No, you can place it anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's different every single time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - People just make up their own rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always house
rules, and I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America works in its own system, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Asia works on another system, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Europe works on its own system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking know,
I just go with the flow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because recently
I found out with Uno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you stack the plus two cards? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's a rule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not a rule? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The official rule is you can't stack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plus two.
- That's so fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so lame.
- I looked it up because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were so many people who were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "No you can't stack plus two,"
or "You can stack plus two." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everybody thought yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of course you can stack plus two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That makes the game so
much more interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I looked up the official rules, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't stack plus twos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's not fun! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also Joey, fuck it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember this pissed me off, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a 30 minute game of Uno </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just wanted it to end, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And what I normally do in
Uno is that I will save </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the all color cards until the
end so that I can just win </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I get Uno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Joey was like, "Oh,
no, you can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't put down, it
has to be a solid color." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is an official rule. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the Uno game on
the PC, you can do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Explain that, Joey, yeah, yeah, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - PC's not canon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, what do you mean?
- We were also very drunk then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were playing that game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were also shouting
out a different Stand name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the different colors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just asleep by the end of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Joey was the only one who wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to drag on the suffering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, 2:00 AM or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we were all heavily drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was struggling to keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my eyes open.
- I wanted to go home, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to sleep.
- And when you ended the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was secretly like, "Yes,
yes! It's finally over." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Then Joey goes, "Um, excuse
me, that is not a rule. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You cannot end the game like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, if you're gonna put me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> through a 30 minute fucking
Uno game, I wanna win! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna win on the proper rules! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Uno, who gives a fuck, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not even a skill-based game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] It's not, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just had fun, just every
time there was a red card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just being like fucking, what was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like Magician's
Red every single time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The people in the other room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> must've though what the
fuck is happening in there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just screaming,
"Magician's Red every two seconds." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hierophant Green every
time we dropped a green card. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before we move on to the
actual topic of this podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> though, you were talking
about what was it, Miniclip? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just reminded me of like, all
the, did you guys ever play- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I spent my whole life on
Miniclip when I was growing up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys remember the
good old-fashioned flash games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to play
on your school internet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because actual games wouldn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember being in the
lunch break, being like, yo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "I know which website
Bloons Tower Defense is on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come, come on, I'll show you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Type in this code. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Bloons Tower Defense Two is available </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this URL, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all about helicopter game, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember that helicopter game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which was like pre-Angry Birds? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, I remember that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the most difficult gameplay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with just the space bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When that, when what,
somehow one of those websites </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with all of the games
got through the filter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like opening the flood gates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you were like, "Holy shit!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah because I remember
in my primary school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Miniclip was immediately banned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Miniclip was banned.
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then someone was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I know a website called Albino Sheep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not blocked on the firewall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But don't tell the teachers! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's got all the games!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever have someone like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause in the schools, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All the PCs are hooked up
to like, the main admin one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One of the kids in my school changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the background of all the things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was the funniest fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause the teacher left
the room for one moment, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he changed all the
backgrounds to Alien vs. Predator. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the predator was just like, a priest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, a bunch of 13 year old kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are just doing their thing
and then they minimize like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Word document or the fucking PowerPoint, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just see like,
fucking one of the popes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holding hands with the predator, uh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the alien, or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just the
funniest fucking thing ever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember being so amused by this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That, that is just
peak 12 year old comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember just 12 year old me thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, nothing's ever gonna
live up to this moment, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was the funniest shit ever." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the best prank of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just giga-brain,
bro, I can't imagine it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember like, IT
class back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> In school, IT class was just
like a second playground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, dude, everyone just fucked around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was, it was, nobody
actually did the work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember like, if
you had to do the work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a five minute job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because they
were teaching you stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you were probably already using. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, They used to teach us
Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not even like Excel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone, everyone at age 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already knows how to use PowerPoint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least, at our age they did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know about now, it
might just be different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But when I was growing up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone knew how to use PowerPoint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone had made a PowerPoint </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like, every other class that they had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they had to go above
and beyond by being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Do you know a thing called transitions?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll really spice up a presentation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Word art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, Word art. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Clip art.
- Oh, god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I remember first
discovering transitions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on PowerPoint and you would just use that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for every fucking slide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you thought you were the fucking shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every single letter had a transition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was that one kid
who would just do, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, bear in mind, this
transition is 30 seconds long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just watching each single
letter just bouncing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into the screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The star shaking the middle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the last little moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> would take fucking forever to lock in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember that one, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember this one time in my IT class, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we had to create a website, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we could choose a
website on whatever topic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we wanted to create. So, at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why aren't we sponsored by Squarespace? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, this would be
perfect for Squarespace, but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I chose to make a website
on the original Nintendo DS. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, very specific. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I was a Nintendo kid back then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember I was
doing a really good job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My teacher was, at the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really impressed at the
website I had created </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was actually putting effort in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unlike the other kids who
were just dicking around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you do in IT class. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he was asking me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, so what are you gonna name it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 10-year-old me, I was
nine or 10 years old, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was trying to think of
the coolest name possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, how about DS Dominator? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, I got a better one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How about DS Dominatrix? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was like dominator, domina, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like dominatrix for a nine year old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who doesn't know what it means sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a cool fucking word! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like dominator and "The Matrix." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like, exactly my mindset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just remember the the
teacher's face being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Um, probably sh-
- That's great, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably shouldn't call it that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's such a cool word! Dominatrix! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell me why!
- I'm gonna call it Dominatrix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and he refused to let
me call it dominatrix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And nine year old me was so fucking pissed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I thought of a
fucking brilliant name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't understand me! The genius! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you seen "The Matrix?" It's epic! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, that's going
back to GCSE IT class </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever, whatever it was back then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had a similar thing where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I also had to make a website
as well for my IT class. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You didn't have to do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay, because I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even think my teacher
knew how to make a website. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I don't think he was gonna teach us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I had to make a website, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was when I was like 16 years old, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so I wasn't 10 years old. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I was like, "Okay, I gotta think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a cool name for my website. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How about The Anime Man?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, does this still exist? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it does exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the domain? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's theanimeman.wordpress.com </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we used WordPress back then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you like, do anime
reviews and all that shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and that's how I got started. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how I got started,
and then I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we can still go on this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah it should be up there still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt, pull it up, pull it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I went on there like, a year ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I did a video where
I was just basically roasting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my own horrible reviews, and
they were absolutely garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was your very first review? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, "Serial Experiments Lain." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's a Herculean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I wasn't like,
"'Fairy Tail' review! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'One Piece' review!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I feel bad for just
for reviewing "Bleach" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for my first video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but I gained so much of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how the fuck
people like, came back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude, I got to the point
where people were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I would like to request
a review from you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can you review this particular series?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were there many anime reviews </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at that time though, in English? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There were a lot of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there weren't a lot of people on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who were doing it, but there
were lots and lots of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime blogging websites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause that's
probably around 2000s, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, it was probably,
- Yeah, it was like, 2010's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When blogs actually got
views and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the 2010s, but then,
then it got to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where someone was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, you should uh, you
should do some video reviews." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I did that, and then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the origin story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's the origin story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking, dusted off that chopper hat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You were like, "It's time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The giant rainbow beanie
as well that I used to wear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - God, it's so hideous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you guys have that one
really cool teacher in school? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, For me it was the IT teacher. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He didn't give a shit about what we did, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but every other teacher,
in my school at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was a fucking asshole, but there was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one IT teach for me
that was really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had that uh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was our physics
teacher in high school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He was such a fucking character, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't know if he did it on purpose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to be entertaining
because maybe he thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that not a lot of kids would
take physics as a major, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I took physics as I just
found physics interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Imagine this middle-aged,
just completely bald dude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and him trying to teach you
about like, how electrons move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he's carrying around this giant stick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I'm talking twice the
size of a cricket bat, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just as thick as a cricket bat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and in like marker on it, it's
called the gentle persuader. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he would just
swing this thing around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and whenever there was a kid
who was asleep at his desk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he would just get the gentle persuader </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just whack it on the table
to get the kids to wake up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always the physics teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like, the fucking nuttiest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're always either the
most passionate about it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the absolute clap of a sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that this thing would make, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could hear it probably
from across the school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just this giant piece of wood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> clapping against another
giant piece of wood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the kids after a while,
like after two weeks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no kid would fall would
asleep in his class </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just 'cause he's just
swinging this thing around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's asserting dominance as a teacher. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The dominatrix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The dominatrix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Asserting dominatrix right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No but he was really cool, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he made physics really fun for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel that if I didn't
have him as a teacher, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably would have
found like, the whole, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the sciences and physics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just really fucking tedious and boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember the first time I
read "Great Teacher Onizuka", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking one of my favorite
manga of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good.
- I haven't read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should.
- Yeah, to give you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a synopsis, it's about this teacher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who is a 22 year old delinquent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Never finished college, I don't think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like, was a dropout to college, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and basically he takes over
this delinquent classroom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just kind of reforms them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He doesn't teach them the curriculum, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he teaches them life lessons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's, you know, it's
a pretty simple premise, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but what sells it is how
good of a teacher Onizuka is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just, I wish I had a
teacher like that in my own life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that was just, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mr. Sullivan, IT teacher,
I'm never gonna forget you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know, you were no Onizuka. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You ain't Great Teacher Sullivan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The coolest thing he
did was let us call him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> by his first name a few times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how you know.
- Damn, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a special moment
when you're in your senior year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of high school where your teacher's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just call me by my name." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, "Yeah,
all right, all right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're the real one, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you're the real one.
- We're real bros now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're friends, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we're friends,
we're friends, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My biology teacher was really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I did so many dumb stuff
that she had my back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was, "No, no, no, I got
this," 'cause of other teachers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause one time when I got
in a fight a different time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the other stories- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Out of a million fights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She was pregnant and
she was teaching a class. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So one of the guys, I was
having a fight with him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I fucking rammed him
through her class door, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the door slammed open, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely smacked her
whiteboard and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and made so much noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, she didn't tell me off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> She was like, "It's okay, I understand." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She was like, "I know
he's a piece of shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got you bro, I got you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This kid drove all the teachers insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was the worst bro and
he always got away with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the teachers just stopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, did you ever have that kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the teachers just gave up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause they were like,
"He's such a piece of shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no point even
trying to discipline him." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was that kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure you guys know him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think we all have
that one kid in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, when my phone
went off in an exam, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which it's just normally an auto fail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so what happened was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I was super into
Enter Shikari at this age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course you were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My second name is C on the exam, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I was right at the front always. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'd turned my phone off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't realize my
phone could turn itself on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to turn the alarm on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that true?
- Some phones could do this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some phones could do- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What kind of sentient shit is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this is back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the phones had the the
batteries you could take out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, so flip phone, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so my other friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember distinctly for the exam, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like, I'm taking the
battery out too, just in case. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like that's dumb, I'm
just leaving mine in, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then obviously, I was
sitting down in my history exam, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I heard some mumble
in the back and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fucking idiot, whose phone is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What a fucking loser." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I finished the exam comfortably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It kept getting louder
and I was like whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I go to the back to get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you put all your bags in the back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] In the back, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, where's my bag? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where the fuck's my bag? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like,
"Fuck, was that my phone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no, it's not right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got fucking grilled by
the headmaster who was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're trying to cheat? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Trying to cheat?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, you know this alarm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was fucking Enter Shikari going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mimics shouting) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In fucking whatever room it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while I was doing this two hour exam, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was in the reception
area they were keeping it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, "You
know it kept going off?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Alarms
tend to do that, yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of every ringtone
you could have chosen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you choose Enter Shikari. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that shit woke you up, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would never, I've tried putting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my favorite song as an alarm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you realize after about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A month,
- You begin to hate the song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You hate the song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember in university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did exactly the same with The Killers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or sometimes Muse, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well I hate this song now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not why I picked the alarm." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because this Enter
Shikari song at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was their most popular and
it just started off with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (mimics intense drumbeat) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know this one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they were just
immediately screaming and, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was fucking tearing up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "No, I'm not trying to cheat!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just really like Enter Shikari! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just an alarm, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they were like, "Can you prove it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "It says nine o'clock, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a little alarm bell and everything!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Bear in mind, this school
has 200 kids total. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a high school with 200 kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a very small school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have my bag on the
table like at an airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, "Open it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Open it up, what's inside?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like TSA.
- Yeah, literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a bomb, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Open it up, what's inside bro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What's inside?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I pull it out, and
it's the phone doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, yeah, they asked me what was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and can you prove it's an alarm? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I show them it's an alarm and
then they're like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then just let me go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well imagined if they grilled you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, "It's a shit song." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Enter Shikari? What are you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I stopped listening
to Enter Shikari after that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think every time
I got, 'cause bear in mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as a 16 year old thinking
that you're possibly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna be kicked out of
exams is traumatic as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like "Fuck, dude,
my mum's gonna kill me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be destroyed for life." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But luckily they gave
me a slap on the wrist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> although I'm pretty sure
they should've disqualified </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that exam result, but they didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I purposely chose a song that I knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was going to hate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, that just,
especially if it was an alarm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to wake me up, because you
can't listen to an alarm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a song that you hate for too long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's actually really clever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It further incites me to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I gotta turn this shit off immediately." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I chose fucking "Nyan Cat." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I like "Nyan Cat." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could not listen to that
for more than five seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's exactly why I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is perfect alarm material", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the moment, imagine 8:00 AM, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just having a nice sleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just from
downstairs you just hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (mimics song in high-pitched voice) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, shit, I gotta (laughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Songs like that help me
get in the zone, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when I'm gaming, it's repetitive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, "Nyan Cat?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I got four hours in- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's his is fucking brain, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the fucking brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the "Dance
till You're Dead" song? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know the one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ♪ Dance till You're Dead ♪ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, the 10 hour compilation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In one gaming session,
I got six hours into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the Deku "Dance till You're Dead" thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, that song is sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have gone through a few
hours of that 10-hour mix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That song, when you're gaming, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you're in the fucking zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you check over,
you see Deku head banging, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "Nice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause that song is
just like audible crack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You, you just, especially
when you're gaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's hacking your brain, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just hacks, it just
properly gets you in the zone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Nyan Cat", on the other hand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is just the complete opposite of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just this really annoying noise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you just can't pinpoint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, "Nyan Cat" is like audible heroin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It just doesn't do anything for you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it just makes you feel sluggish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Audible heroin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does heroin not do anything for you, Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What are taking bro?
- It's more just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the more you take, the
more you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I can't function." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is obviously coming from an analogy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from three people who have
never taken heroin before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like that "Office"
joke where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why do they always talk
about it's like crack? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've never tried crack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's actually one of the few jokes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I love from "The Office." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one time I was hanging out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with Geoff from Mother's Basement. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sorry, Geoff, I'm gonna
call you out for this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I remember we were, I
think it was an AX party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we were talking about how much, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some crazy shit that we've done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was talking about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, it's like
downing a pint of cocaine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Geoff, that's
not you do cocaine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just the blinking
meme, it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Geoff that's not how cocaine is done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't down a pint of cocaine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you downed a pint of anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, thank you for that, Geoff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm definitely gonna be
using that in the future. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the subreddit's definitely
gonna be using that too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guarantee it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like downing a pint of cocaine! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Talking about downing things- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Snorting a line of heroin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To get to the actual topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we were gonna talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before we went on this massive tangent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as we always do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess we wanted to talk
about food, right guys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love food, who doesn't love food? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I only exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the next meal.
- I love consuming things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in my mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That came out really wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad you prefaced where you do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Perhaps a pint of cocaine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love when a pint of
cocaine is in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess the reason I
wanted to bring this up is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey, you recently chose
to become a pescatarian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, but let me explain- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pescatarian in inverted commas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, I didn't decide
to fully transition, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I like meat too
much, but I figured just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for about a month, Aki and I were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Let's see if we can be pescatarian", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel if there's any country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is perfect to be a
pescatarian, it would be Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because pescatarian, if you don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> means it's basically vegetarian,
but you can also eat fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fish aren't animals,
they don't have souls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, that's not real meat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fish aren't real meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I figured just as, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not so much as a morality thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but more just to better my diet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just eat a little bit healthier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, "Okay, let's
try and be pescatarian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for one month." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's gonna be the last, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically, my last
month of my 25th year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be me as a pescatarian, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then on my 26th birthday
at the end of September, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna be like, "Give me all the meat!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give me every meat!
- Give me everything meat! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to see a piece
of greenery on my plate! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, when I was like,
I feel like was raised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where if the meal didn't have
meat in it, it's not a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's, that's how I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe that's a, is that
a British thing maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think so, I think
it's an Asian thing as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember, still to this day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I cannot get full unless
I have some kind of meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give me a crumb of
chicken, a crumb of chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do count fish as meat,
but if I just have no meat- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There needs to be
something dead on my plate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's how it is though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need something dead on my plate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless like, 'cause I've
tried having vegetarian meals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I get filled up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I get hungry an
hour later, without fail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know if that's a mental thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where my body's like, bruh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's probably some diet expert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> watching us who can explain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're just gonna go off
all anecdotal evidence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So don't take anything we say seriously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so basically, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I figured I like fish a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Japan is such a seafood-heavy country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can walk down
the road and get some sushi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or go to the supermarket
and buy pre-cooked fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or stuff that, and all of
it tastes so fucking good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also you don't have to
worry about it here, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I, dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever someone ordered
like, oysters or shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a not-extremely
expensive place in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like bro, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, oysters are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you never order oysters unless you trust </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the place you're ordering oysters from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, if the curry place,
the Indian curry place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't fuck with shrimp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's always a coin
flip, no matter what. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least in the UK,
that is a fucking gamble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you have a place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and even if you have a place you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "But do they treat the seafood correctly?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've probably got it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need to have seen
this fish die in my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like there's
some certain cuisines, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like Indian cuisines.
- In the UK especially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not just in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In Thailand, especially
street food in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tastes amazing, but would you trust it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like, to pass hygienic tests? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Not exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it doesn't stop it from tasting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you take that risk and some
of the dirtiest-looking places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> taste the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's true, it's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's like at AX when
you're walking down AX </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and those hotdog stands are there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they've had these hotdog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this cardboard packaging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's been out there all fucking day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they just
chuck them on the grill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sure, it looks amazing on the grill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but those have been soggy for eight hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Dude, they smell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking amazing.
- They do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they smell amazing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But what is it, it's like the
succubuses on all the stories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They look amazing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too good to be true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't, your stomach's gonna hate you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The only people, every
time someone gets sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at a convention, it's always 'cause- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always the hotdog!
- It's always the hotdog! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause they always one of
those things, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why did you do it?", and they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It just looked so good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't help myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, you dumb
fuck, there is a Denny's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there is everything around here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not saying actually- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's literally
Chick-fil-A down the road. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I say that, but Denny's
is probably a gamble as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in the US, I'll be honest.
- In America, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I kinda had a similar
thing in the Philippines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with street food because, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause the one time I
went to the Philippines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go see Aki's family, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's all this
amazing-looking street food, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel if I don't
make the right choice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm probably just gonna die on the road. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's really weird, I did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like get, not food poisoning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I definitely got some bad diarrhea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> from one of the street foods, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was from a mango. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is weird, you wouldn't expect- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - A fruit really do you like that, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like of all the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just why I wanna eat meat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I wanna eat meat, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I had fucking
balut that I just bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> off a random woman on the street. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Balut is a duck fetus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, dude, that shit looks nasty, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You would think that
that would get me sick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no, it wasn't the fetus,
it was a fucking mango. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can understand if you've
grown up with food like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but can you, as an
Australian-Japanese dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see a fucking bird and just be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, fucking that looks
tasty, give me two of those." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey man, Aki's dad was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, that shit tastes good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "All right, I trust you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I bought two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that the weirdest thing you've eaten? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's probably the weirdest
thing I've eaten, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I trust people when they say that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm looking at them the whole time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like I do not expect anything from this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna eat it just to entertain you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm expecting this to taste like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, yeah, I've filmed
a video on it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's on my second channel,
because apparently Aki told me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is one of the, you
know "Fear Factor", right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- The American show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently she said that this balut stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is one of the last foods that
they eat on "Fear Factor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you can eat this then
you can eat anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, but it's just a duck fetus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll eat it, I'm just not
gonna be happy about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I looked at that
motherfucker dead in the eyes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> while eating it, so I was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wake up, wake up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "Yes, you
are going into my stomach!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like in Japan, they have this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at the sushi restaurant,
normally fish restaurants, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they have the sperm sack
and this shit is disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, shirako? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, dude,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And even when you speak
to Japanese, they're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you either just despise
that shit or you love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's an acquired taste.
- It is acquired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks like a brain
that has lost all the water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's fallen apart,
it's all untangled, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when someone's
like, "Oh, what is it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, no, just try it, hee-hee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you try and like,
oh, it's a sperm sack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, with sperm in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it tastes like how you would imagine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a sperm sac would taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does feel like you just
got jizzed in the mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It totally does, 'cause I
remember the weirdest thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would say I'd had was
in China where it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was with a friend and their family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if this is an Asian thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but whenever they see a foreigner trying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they always ordered the most exotic food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then try to get them to try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My parents do exactly the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and their family did
exactly the same to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they were ordering all this weird shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they ordered this soup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they told me, "Oh, try the
soup, it's just beef soup." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I started chowing
down on this beef soup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Mm, this is all right,
this is all right", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I get to this really chewy parts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I have to really- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I know what it is.
- Bite my way through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh, what is this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it had the most awful
after taste you can imagine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just stayed in your mouth forever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I asked them, "What
the hell was that chewy bit?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my friend asked their family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they translate to me, and they said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, that's probably
the bull's testicles." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bruh.
- I'm like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hold on a second, what is this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, this is a bull's penis soup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like why did
you not lead with that?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This feels like information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I should've been told at
the start of this meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They knew exactly what they were doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, oh, this is
beef soup, this is beef soup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can have this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I'm one of those
people who would not be mad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at that kind of stuff,
just because I want- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Free dick, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna try all the weird shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do as well, I do as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because I know if I
went to a restaurant like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by myself and I looked at the menu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw bull's penis,
testicle, bull's penis soup- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god, Joe, that
was a fountain, bro! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's salivating at the thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bull, bull, bull penis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry, that was like let's
just taste this one meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, people like that, I'm
like, yeah, order it, order it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna look you in the
eye, I'm gonna eat this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want you to know that I'm gonna eat it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm gonna tell you
it tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna give you the
satisfaction of going like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, if I saw that on the menu, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I probably wouldn't order it myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you're gonna go for like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - the beef burger.
- There's no way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I'll get something
that I'm familiar with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would rather someone
just order me some weird shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then trick me into eating
it so that could be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I may not- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anthrax, yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, well, I
may not have enjoyed it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but hey, now I can say that
I've eaten bull's testicles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I'd be very
happy if someone had been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, that's a dick",
and I'm like (sighs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, they disguised it very well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, sometimes-
- Is it gay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Am I gay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It didn't look like a dick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was all minced up into a ball- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think they
would just chop it off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like there we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a full dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like a full dick on a plate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, it's just bull meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What kind of bull meat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That looks very much like a testicle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the problem is
with stuff like this for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm sure a lot people
can relate to this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want my fucking meals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be a fucking adventure
game for someone, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanna eat, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I just wanna enjoy
my meal, have a nice time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just wanna skip the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And not turn it into a
fucking Bear Grylls TV show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of this restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate it when people try and do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, try this, try this awful thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Why would I
try that awful thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've just told me it's awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you trying to make me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> eat something awful?"
- Oh, no I'm the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> complete opposite, I will
happily be like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Joey's that guy in the restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who just orders the weirdest shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you and Aki both do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We're sitting down, they'll be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "So who ordered the slime
shit? Who ordered that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, Aki will go, "Oh, I like that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "That's a
lie, you don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just ordering it
to make yourself look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're fucking Bear
Grylls at this izakaya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just admit it, okay? Admit
it, no-one likes it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the fact that every
time we get to that moment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time without fail, you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you guys wanna try some?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every time we just say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, Joey, that doesn't look appetizing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I want you guys to try it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then Joey finishes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this goop shit you
always get, what is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know the goop- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, takowasa? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like octopus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and wasabi, and you put it in a blender. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never seen any Japanese
person order it around me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? I know
plenty of Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who eat it! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do you think it's a
staple menu at izakaya? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nah, it's on the bottom dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then after that,
there's just other fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I don't know how they prepare it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just got the
consistency of a tire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with no taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, the fish-
- It's like a toenail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
like the toenail thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It tastes and looks like a toenail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it feels a toenail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's ray, it's stingray. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stingray fin, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the kind of thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, sure, when I'm drunk enough, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll chew on it and
I'll have no complaints. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when it's like I wanna have a meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why would I fill myself up with something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't taste like anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and takes me 10 minutes to eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just frustrates me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You had that the other day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when we went to a
restaurant and I ordered, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I ordered tokoroten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, the rubbery stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey was like, "It's zero calories." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "So what
if it's zero calories?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, because you're always on about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many calories does this have? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just thinking sometimes,
in a meal you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I don't wanna kill myself." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - My dad described that at
once as eating an eraser. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like that.
- That's pretty much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what it looks like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like sometimes when
you hear zero calories, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, "Oh, that's gonna taste bad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause celery has zero calories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if you've
eaten celery on its own, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course I have, I love celery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On its own?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, bro, celery tastes
like shit on its own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No!
- Yeah, it does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> taste like shit.
- What the fuck?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It tastes like paint- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not even an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just tastes like paint
remover in vegetable form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Brussels sprouts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I love Brussels sprouts.
- I love Brussels sprouts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get the fuck out! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Brussels sprouts is like F-tier vegetable! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why do people put it on roasts? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone's just, it's a massive
lie, it's a massive lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love Brussels sprouts,
man, they're great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get rid of those fucking
Brussels sprouts on my roast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause they have such a really nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> distinct flavor to them- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it tastes awful, it's bitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, anti-umami. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, do you like broccoli? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you like broccoli? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Broccoli's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you have to keep in mind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're talking to someone
who doesn't like ketchup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, before we go into
more in-depth food discussion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt doesn't like condiments, basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like the way
things are meant to taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So barbecue sauce, no?
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ketchup?
- I just, I just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we're gonna go through
all the condiments here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just to make sure.
- Mustard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, mustard, no?
- Mustard, if it's not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's just like, the beans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mayo? You don't like any mayo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't like mayo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tabasco or anything like that, maybe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tabasco, I don't really
see that as a condiment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's something like if
I need an extra kick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to make it more spicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So when you eat fries, it's just plain? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's just salt and pepper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so sad. That's so sad
- Just salt and pepper fries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, that's why I like my thin fries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it absorbs the spices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just oil. It's
literally just oil, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We said that the other day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we were talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how we like the thick cut fries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the thin fries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but then Garnt was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I don't like the thick fries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I taste the potato." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what a chip is!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I want to taste you know, the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) this is gonna sound so bad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's the oil flavor or the salt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all the salt and pepper flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's too much potato,
you're just eating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just feels like you're
eating starch with no flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but sometimes
if it's done perfectly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that starch is just fluffy and beautiful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it works so well when
you put it with ketchup </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or mayonnaise or whatever you put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with chips, right?
- Yeah, when you mix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ketchup and mayo together, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get a nice burger sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's a fries
sauce, oh, it's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That makes me gag so bad, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hate ketchup and
mayo, like ketchup and mayo- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go eat your dick, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
- Go eat your dick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ketchup and mayo by themselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are disgusting enough to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but to mix them together and
they form this pink color, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "Get that
shit out of my face, man!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, fries sauce is so good! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you go into- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't be the only one here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't be the only fucking one here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I think with this
case, you are the only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you go into any
normal chain in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't get it 'cause
called burger sauce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's called Thousand Island Sauce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it Thousand Island Sauce? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I love Thousand Island Sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but they don't do it
in McDonald's, KFC or wherever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like ranch with ketchup, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so, but mayo with ketchup mixed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just burger sauce in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, it's called fries sauce in US. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can't get it unless you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to those dirty chicken shops in London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to them and you gotta
fucking haggle with them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just to get the fucking ketchup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're so stingy bro, they
won't give you anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I used to go into
mine all the time, dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I felt like I was getting mugged off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was the only
white guy in this area </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would always go in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yes, I would like um,
five wings, a burger", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the people would come in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo, what's up bossman?
I'll have the wings set." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Fuck dude, Jesus Christ." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt so out of place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I just didn't know how to talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Do I say bossman to the guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I say bossman? Is that weird? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel weird going, "Yes,
I'll just take a fry please, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and a Tango." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll take a fry, bossman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I just felt bad
when there was 12 year olds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting in the area next to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just trying to order the chicken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I just want the (mumbling). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I have burger sauce, please? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While the other guys are fucking jumping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over the counter to grab it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They would do that, they
would put their hands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over the counter and grab the shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and the fucking owners- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking audacity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, the audacity of these bitches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, there is
one sauce that I do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's very specific,
but it's peri-peri, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or Nando's sauce. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But are they in the same category? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a marinade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like if it's
more on the marinade side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of things, I love marinade.
- That's like teriyaki, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have Nando's in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah we do, but it's fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So no one goes to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking I miss Nando's here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I miss it so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cheeky Nando's for the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, to be fair, I feel UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried Nando's in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's infinitely better
than the one in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People will always chat shit about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but the thing is, is that it's the perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in between a fast food
place and a restaurant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where sometimes you just want the chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you wanna get out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You also don't wanna feel like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's one of the few places in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we can be proud of in terms of food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you think
of British cuisines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "Well, what
can we be proud about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah, beans on toast." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's British cuisine, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's with British people
getting bullied online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the time now, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Remember when it used to be
British people were cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in 2012 and Harry Potter was in full steam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Tumblr loved British people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then now it's just like,
"Haha, he said Chewsday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He said Chewsday, innit?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wa-er </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [All] Wa-er, wa-er. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He likes beans on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yes, I like beans on toast, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can eat it as many times
as I need to, goddammit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a limit with me with beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Baked beans? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you say beans like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's a funny word! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I love accentuating the B in beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can imagine if I
wasn't born in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would think baked beans are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you ever eat baked beans? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, 'cause in Australia
we eat baked beans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> quite often as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I would eat it on toast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I would just
fucking crack open a can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in university,
I basically lived off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just beans in cans and I
would just heat them up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and eat them for dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds disgusting to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, it was.
- I wouldn't be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to live off it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't know how to cook, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so I would just boil
pasta and put salt on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and eat the pasta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love how the cooking
experience at university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just how many ways can I cook pasta? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It took me a year to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you could just pour the pot sauces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on top of the pasta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was so content and
I didn't wanna look stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of my uni mates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember my mum offered
to teach me how to cook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "I don't need that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How hard can it be?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got this.
- How hard can it be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, I was eating plain
pasta and beans for a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's pretty depressing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like cup ramen, cup ramen- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, cup, the first
day of university I went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and bought a crate of pot
noodles and lived off them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That was beautiful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't go wrong
with pot noodles, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should probably get
back onto Japanese food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> shouldn't we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, going back to Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recently, funnily enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just went to the cup ramen
museum in Yokohama this week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which, the only reason we
went to the cup ramen museum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was just because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just there.
- It was just there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, whatever,
it's something to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was actually really
interesting and really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was not someplace I thought to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would be a fun, exciting place to go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was fun to learn about cup ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had no idea that basically, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> cup ramen exists because of Americans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because instant noodle was invented </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the usual packeted way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they tried to sell it to America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And Americans were just
like, "How do we eat this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, you're gonna have
to use a fucking chopstick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with bowls, like, that's too inefficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they just started putting
it in their soda cans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or no, not the soda cans, the soda cups, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just put the ramen
in and put hot water in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's how cup ramen was invented! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So cup ramen is an American invention? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was invented in Japan,
the method of doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the noodles- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it was when they tried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to sell it to Americans that
he saw Americans doing that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, "Let's just
put it in the fucking cup." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, thank you, America, for cup ramen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and if you're in prison, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's your currency. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cup ramen currency.
- So you don't want Vox video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's actually currency in
most prisons, that's so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, in terms of Japanese food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what are some Japanese
food you want more people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to know about or that you have discovered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since moving to Japan that maybe
not many people know about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you know my answer, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I already know your answer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we've talked about this before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Go on, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Simp for your dish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm simping for a little
dish called tsukemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not ramen, it's tsukemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So basically, tsukemen, oversimplified. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Think of ramen but separate
the noodles from the broth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and make that broth thick as a bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will say when I first- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I was first, I saw it
on the menu, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why the fuck would I want my noodles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> separated from the broth?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds like it's
demarinating the noodles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, an extra step. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it sounded like it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> making the noodles less flavorful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just didn't make any logical sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But somehow, it makes the
noodles even more flavorful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you dip them into
this and you basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have the broth on the noodles (mumbling). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the thing with ramen broth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's very liquidy
because the noodle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so diluted.
- is gonna be sitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this broth for a long, long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can drink it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can drink it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But tsukemen broths, they
have to make it thick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because when you put the noodles in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you take it
out again, as you said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the broth has to stick to the noodles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that shit is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the flavor of that is so fucking powerful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then when you're
done eating the noodles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can pour a soup into
the broth to dilute it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make it drinkable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically like concentrated ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's basically the first time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't know, because I
feel no matter what we say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or how much we try to sell it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't sell it in words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it just doesn't
look as pretty as ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Ramen is so pretty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you explain it logically,
and you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just sounds like
ramen with extra steps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What makes it so amazing?
- That's exactly what you guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> said when I tried to sell it
to you guys, and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Trust me, let's go to one of
my favorite tsukemen places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in Ikebukuro and you can
just eat it and tell me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I took them- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember we were chatting
the biggest, maddest shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were like, "Sure Joey, sure, whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then we got the dish
and we just sat there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in silence for a good 10 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as we were just eating this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember the second
place you took me to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear, I had an existential
crisis eating the tsukemen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember you both were eating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just staring at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just looking at his bowl of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just eating this bowl
of tsukemen being just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It's perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll tell you what it felt like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it felt like that meme
in "Ratatouille" where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I had one bite
and it just took me back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my childhood or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was having a flashback to
this dish grandma made me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> My grandma's never made me tsukemen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it gave me that same homely feeling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I had when eating a home
cooked meal, back as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "What
is happening right now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never seen anyone
have a "Food Wars" moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in real life, but that was legitimately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the closest I've ever seen to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was this close to fucking crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I stopped to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you were sitting
opposite me and I was eating, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I looked over and you were kinda just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> silently staring at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember I said to him, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Are your eyes watering? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you really about to cry over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this bowl of tsukemen?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That, that is uh, that definitely did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile, I was just there in my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking Tyler Wall, like "Yes!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just fucking eating it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I remember the next day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were talking about whatever the fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were talking about,
and Garnt just texted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fully serious, being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I had a dream about
that tsukemen last night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually had a dream
about that tsukemen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's that fucking good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - As well because they have the meat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all the veg in the broth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you bite into the veg or the meat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've absorbed this intense
broth and it just bursts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so fucking good.
- And the meat is so soft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just breaks apart.
- Yeah, it's so tender, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so tender. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I'm not
gonna say that the ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan is bad or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some fucking
fantastic ramen out there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I just feel that
tsukemen is such an underdog </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because people just, as you say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> people just think that it's
just an inferior ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, that's what I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I didn't even know about
tsukemen until I moved here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you told me about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like people only come here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they only know ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when I came here,
I only knew ramen as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I totally don't blame
people who are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, I just wanna eat sushi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just wanna eat ramen." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it just frustrates me when there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to a ramen shop,
and they usually have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tsukemen on the menu as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And yet they just completely ignore that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and just go for the basic veg ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I feel like you do
get a better ramen experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here than you do anywhere
else in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just frustrates me
when people are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm gonna go to Ichiran Ramen", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, you can
have an Ichiran in America! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why did you fly all the way to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to have something you can have in America? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not understand
why people come to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they try, what's the curry place? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - CoCo curry.
- Is it CoCo curry that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the international one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, CoCo Ichiban. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why they come here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just try the CoCo curry here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In defense of both those chains, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be devil's advocate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to Ichiran Ramen maybe a month ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just mid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you don't live here, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you don't wanna fuck around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with going down these alleyways,
looking on Google Maps </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to find shit, I can
understand where you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I want a good ramen that delivers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't have to talk to anyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They have an English menu." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get that, 'cause sometimes
these ramen places, bro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no pictures, only Kanji. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You've gotta give your ticket to the guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've gotta hope that he calls you out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know that it's you, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a little, you know, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've gotta figure
out if he's asking you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you want extra veg or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you hand it to
him and he'll ask what size </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you'll be like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or, do you want rice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Rice they ask some and sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and 'cause the word for rice
and meal is the same, gohan- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gohan.
- And so one time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they asked me "Gohan?", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just completely forgot that it was rice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Yeah, I want a meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just gave you my tickets you dumb fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Take my ticket!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know that's Goku's son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing drowns out speaker) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I get it with Ichiran Ramen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, it was a little expensive though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll give you that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The, the noodles were
thin though, it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna start a series where I go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around reviewing ramen chains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's the
problem I have with Ichiran </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it is the thin noodles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't have a problem
with the thin noodles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I like my noodles
like I like my women. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like them thick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was wondering where
you're going with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's like the inappropriate uncle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that has to mention something
sexual every 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the only way people relate to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, that's what I
love about tsukemen though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that those noodles
are so fucking thick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's, so there's like, okay- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I remember the first
place you took me to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like trying to go to
an all-you-can-eat buffet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with this one little noodle dish, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was so thick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I saw you guys finishing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wasn't even halfway through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like (slurps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do more, I can do this, guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't take all the thickness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - With tsukemen, you cannot pause. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to keep going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> If you stop for a moment, you
will think, "Shit, I'm full." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't let your brain catch up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to your stomach.
- No, don't let it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like doing the
big bang burger challenge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in Persona 5, do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was kind of what I felt like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the main character felt.
- You didn't have enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> determination points, man.
- No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I needed to upgrade more points. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, in Japan there's what,
three main types of noodles? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There's the soba noodles,
the udon, and the ramen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, and the difference
between these are the soba ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are typically healthy, quite thin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soba is buckwheat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Buckwheat, so quite healthy for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's definitely the healthiest, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is ramen the least healthy for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ramen? I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot of calories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in ramen.
- Yeah, ramen I'd say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is probably the least, the most unhealthy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's udon, so ramen's
kinda like in the middle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Soba's really thin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It tastes healthy, so make
of that what you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then udon is the
real fucking thick boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thick white one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why does soba taste healthy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it is healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it is, but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is the big difference
between soba and ramen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm trying to put it into words now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's maybe
because a lot of soba dishes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't sitting in this very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oily broth.
- Soba doesn't hit back, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Soba just goes down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ramen fights you as it's
going down your stomach, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a challenge, you gotta
beat that shit in your stomach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Also, I've noticed- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ramen is soba with attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's soba with attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think because ramen
is so heavy in calories, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even the shitty cup ramen's
taste fucking good here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you go and get
the supermarket soba, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that shit tastes awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It tastes really bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You need to go to a good soba place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to really appreciate it.
- Yes, soba restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are amazing! </SPEAKER_02>

link in the description below </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and thank you to Grand Summoners </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for sponsoring today's episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, in soba restaurants, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they give you the choice
of cold soba and hot soba. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And as someone who's grown up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with noodles my entire life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've grown up with the idea that you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have noodles as a hot dish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I don't know, is
it weird for you guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> especially you, Connor, the
idea of eating a cold main dish? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there's options,
I'm always gonna go hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I went out the other day and it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is from two weeks
ago I went to a place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the AC wasn't working, it
was 35 degrees, feels like 40, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the person asked me, "Do
you want hot or cold?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one else in this restaurant- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The absolute mad lad! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one else in this restaurant had hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I could easily see that,
'cause it comes in a bowl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it's hot and when
you get the cold it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on this little bamboo thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And dude, I'm sweating my
ass off in this restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but still, I was like,
"I'm glad I got hot." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hot soba has its place though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I first moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like hot soba,
hot soba, only hot soba. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I tried cold once and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, this is really refreshing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It tastes so totally different, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it still gives me a good feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had it cold, it's not bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To me, cold thing, cold
noodles don't feel like a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like a leftover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hot noodles feel like a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kinda get what you're saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but its' also very monkey brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It feels like you
found it in your fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, (sighs)
"Okay, let's eat it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the logic then that
you can't be bothered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to eat it after that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you order cold or hot soba as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so when you get hot soba,
you just get the noodles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the broth that it comes in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I always feel jealous
of the cold people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who get the little dipping sauce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so with the cold soba, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a tiny little bowl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is the sauce? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a shoyu base. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought so, like a
soy, and it's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not a broth, it's just
like a sauce, and then you- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You dip it in.
- You take out the soba, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just dip it in,
whip some wasabi in it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, cold soba is just
the tsukemen of hot soba. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is just the tsukemen, oh my god! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that further proves my point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that tsukemen is superior! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Figured it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanna, and then
there's the final noodle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is udon, my least favorite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not like udon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like udon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It genuinely feels like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in a tentacle hentai every
time you're eating that shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you gotta, dude, you
can have two in your mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like (gags), trying
to force that shit down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's awful, you can't, it's so heavy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like swallowing a brick, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is.
- It feels like the vanilla </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the noodle world where it just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it hit the same every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What can I say, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also because ramen
is somewhat thin, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the sauce that it takes
on to the ratio of noodle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm eating is perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Udon, it's this thick in my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how thick it feels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a coating of sauce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't get into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But here's the question though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you guys like mochi? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I like mochi.
- Yeah, I like mochi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm not talking about fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mochi ice-cream bullshit,
I'm talking about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no,
- Yeah, like actual mochi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, because it's like,
I feel a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who don't like udon are the
same people who don't like mochi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the exact reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because when you eat a block of mochi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like eating a brick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's hard to get that shit down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Udon is just like the noodle equivalent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I like that
because it's kinda like a sweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I like mochi sweets, 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, so you've never
had savory mochi, then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had savory mochi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- I probably wouldn't like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was very like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking like a brick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was prepared for it to be a brick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's still dessert, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I was different, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but when we went to that
soba place a while ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, no, udon place, sorry; </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like we had this broth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the udon just didn't
stick any of the broth to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, what's the fucking point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, because it's
supposed to be a light taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's supposed to be a
really thin, flavorful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> umami taste.
- Nah, dude, it aint it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it aint it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna say it's an acquired, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't think udon was
gonna be an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think udon is
the worst of the three? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I like soba and udon equally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But ramen, or rather tsukemen
is definitely above the two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I like udon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna opt for
udon every single time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if I went to an udon place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna fucking complain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I had the choice, I would never go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the udon place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would always be more in
the mood for soba or ramen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There would never be point where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> udon's where I go to where
there's no other places around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I guess I'll settle for udon." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are just some
winter days where I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Man, I could really go for a hot udon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really just want
bricks in my stomach, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want warm bricks in my stomach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the sauce not sticking to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then you drink the soup afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but sometimes it's too rich then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? Like, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, udon broths are never rich. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always really watery.
- They're way too light, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what I don't like about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a thick noodle with a light broth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like my ramen and tsukemen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that have a really thick flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It just completely sticks
to you no matter what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but some days I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna feel like I'm getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> all this sticky flavor on me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes I just wanna get
something down that'll warm me up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and is nice and light and will fill me up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but won't make me feel like shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because sometimes when you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as I love tsukemen,
it's like Five Guys, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, man, this
flavor is so powerful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it sticks to me the entire time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but then the moment it starts to settle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your stomach, you're
just like "Kill me!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Five Guys is that thing
where you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm out for the count
for the rest of the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't talk to me, don't
expect me to do anything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never thought food could knock you out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> until I had Five Guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The opposite of that I
feel is sushi and sashimi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I also had no fucking
clue what sashimi was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I first came here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of people don't.
- Seriously? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of people don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I didn't know
if there was a choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where you could just get rid of the rice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess it's like a
steak without the sides. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you could just have a steak, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I thought, oh, I mean, yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I will admit, I wanted to be that guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who immediately loved sashimi
and sushi and was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Dude, I fucking love this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it took me a while to get used to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and really get into it and
appreciate the taste of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because when I first
had sashimi, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, it doesn't taste good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was definitely
something that grew on me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I remember I went most
of my childhood hating sushi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and hating sashimi 'cause I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Raw fish? Why do I wanna eat raw stuff?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And in the UK, they
do that shit dirty, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Your sushi sucks dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - True.
- Fucking awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had this one day where I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, that kinda looks appetizing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me, let me give that shot." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after the first
time when I was an adult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I tried sushi again I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I fucking love this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love the taste of raw
fish, tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And having sushi in
Japan is just the quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of the fish is just so damn good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that even if you go to
one of those dollar places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can order a small
plate of sushi for a dollar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that still tastes way better than some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the best restaurants
that you can find in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, the quality of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because most of the fish that they serve, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we obviously don't have in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but even when you get
the salmon, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Holy shit, I didn't know salmon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could just fall apart like
this when you bite into it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Normally in the UK, you know,
you get something salmon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta fucking tug away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta Bear Grylls that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had salmon where
I'm literally fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to sever it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But in Japan, you eat it
and it just falls apart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it works so good with the rice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But man, if I ever have a workout, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sushi is what I'm always craving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the best post-workout meal, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's like it's
just filling enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like I don't wanna go too hard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but so healthy and so good for you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, "Man, I really,
I feel healthy doing this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I remember you were once saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can't have sushi for dinner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is weird because
I'll take any excuse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to take sushi for dinner.
- Yeah, same here, same here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, whenever these guys
when we're out, they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You guys wanna get sushi for dinner?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, it's always "What
do you guys wanna eat?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Connor's like, "I'm easy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I go, "Do you feel like sushi?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No sushi.
- No, no don't want sushi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then you're not easy.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are not!
- That is not easy! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a fucking lie! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, okay, I'm easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you wanna go to sushi, we'll go sushi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna be like,
"It's not it, chief." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, then we don't wanna
do that to you, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For dinner, 'cause
for dinner I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, sushi is great, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But for lunch, I don't
mind having one flavor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But for sushi I feel
like 'cause it all tastes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like fish still at the end of the day; </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes, the fish are different
and they taste different, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it still feels I'm
just eating fish and rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is fine, but for some
reason it's sushi to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't feel like a full meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you know you can get- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Other stuff, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, when you order fried
chicken at a sushi place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that shit is so fucking awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the fucking chicken
has been abused and beaten up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all muscular and shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's been in a fucking
fight club before it was killed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You maybe get one ounce of chicken breast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the rest is this
black bone with veins. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, "Holy shit, what
did they do to this chicken?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're like, what's the point? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 'roided up chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, and I'm
hitting up the miso soup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no tomorrow and I'm stocking up on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's normally free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Not that I care, I mean, it
just normally tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause sometimes they leave
some of the fish in there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they let it cook and
it's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't know, it doesn't
feel like a proper meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, 'cause
I fill up so fast on sushi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then 30 minutes later
when I've left the restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Shit, I'm hungry again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I get that with
sushi as well sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you feel like your
stomach's about to explode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then somehow, an hour or two later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't get hungry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just like, you get, you get peckish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can eat a little more,
I can eat a little more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's just the rice that expands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in your stomach.
- Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then once it finally settles down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like, "Oh, all
right, time for more food." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. I never
understood why you can eat sushi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for lunch, and yet you can't eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi for dinner.
- Breakfast, lunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, normally- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can eat it for breakfast! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Normally my lunch or breakfast is sushi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, I can't eat sushi for breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why not?
- I can't eat sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for breakfast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't eat fish for breakfast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But why is it weird? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're Japanese, bro! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can we talk about
the Japanese breakfast? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not just the Japanese breakfast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very specifically, the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ryokan breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ryokan breakfast.
- But that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the traditional Japanese breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is the traditional
Japanese breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My first time hearing
this was Chris Broad saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't ever ask for the Japanese breakfast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought, oh, he's just
being pessimistic Chris. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was a fool, I should've
listened to you, Chris. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking garbage! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, it's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I think the problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's the complete
opposite of garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too much, it's too good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's, there's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get about 50 different
dishes, I swear to god, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Dude, it's breakfast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just give me a bowl of the cereal." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a worthy contender
with an American breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Where it's just like
that's just too much food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's actually even more
than the American breakfast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's way more than
an American breakfast! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, because there's,
with an American breakfast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can fit everything on
one fucking plate, at least. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With Japanese breakfast, you have like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It covers like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It covers this entire table. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then as you're eating,
they bring out more dishes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more small dishes in between the fish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the tofu, the soup, the,
I can't even name it all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There'll be like a
salad, there'll be a potato </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's been marinated in
a different fucking way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There'll be two different types of salad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> probably a plate of
just single tiny things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have no idea what the they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're probably gonna be radish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everything seems to be radish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like everything is a fucking
radish in these ryokans! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I see a Japanese
breakfast in front of me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why am I
eating an art exhibition?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just what it feels like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just like this looks really pretty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks really pretty, but man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for one, I've never finished
a Japanese breakfast- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then rice as well,
they give you rice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course, yeah, they give you rice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like a five course meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm having just as I've woken up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've never, ever
finished Japanese breakfast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't mind the fish, the cooked mackerel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they normally bring
you, I don't mind that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mackerel doesn't really
taste like anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know about that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I disagree about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Mackerel has probably the most taste- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's my favorite fish, mackerel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just so clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You never get any like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no aftertaste to mackerel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a pure, it's like the chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I get an after taste with mackerel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mackerel is the chicken of fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's salmon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's salmon.
- Salmon! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Salmon is the chicken of fish! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Salmon's the pork, salmon's the pork. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can do so much with salmon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people do do so.
- And that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the pork! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's the chicken! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mackerel's just salmon with attitude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I'm just recalling
all the food items </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they might make you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'd probably give you eggs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then you'd probably want fried egg, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> scrambled eggs, maybe a poached egg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They give you some fucking egg roll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's been rolled up and
steamed, and I'm like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, tamagoyaki? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and it's fucking cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Why is it cold?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me a hot egg, please!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Most of the dishes are actually cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're all cold, and I don't
know if it's a Western thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I want something hot to wake me up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the worst part is you're
eating this and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, it's filling and
something's missing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can I have coffee, perhaps? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do they have an espresso
machine back there, please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I bring my own pods, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just give me a fucking coffee, please! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's what the green tea's for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the hot green tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the hot, that's the
only heat you're gonna get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of a Japanese breakfast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Or the miso soup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would kill for a coffee, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and even when we're here
with Japanese friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes they're like,
"Man, I just want a coffee." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japanese breakfasts are way
too extra for my own liking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, I mean, I guess that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a very infrequent occurrence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's that special thing that you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's for the ryokans.
- At a ryokan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you go to a hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be the shitty
continental breakfast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that you reluctantly eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you don't have
really got much choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my god, those are depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno, I like that
for the first two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause, I don't know, it's
just a recognizable meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have it for
two days and afterwards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like, "Okay, this
is getting really boring now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I want something different." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's like one Japanese dish that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really not recommend it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't really recommend it either, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is when people come here
and they try the curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I don't know about you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but no matter where I've had curry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether it's home cooked,
abroad, whatever chain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it all tastes as good as each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I've never had a bad curry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've never had a curry
that just blows me away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I can agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every single time I
have a curry I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "This would be great if
it was an Indian curry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> An Indian curry could do this better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it would taste better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, it's too one noted, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And they put curry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in so much fucking things here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many side dishes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the one place we had ramen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and the side dish was
just curry with rice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah!
- It's like why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is this a side? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because curry goes with everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's their logic, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "curry goes with everything!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone likes curry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll be happy to eat it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, are you talking
shit about CoCo Ichiban? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I do like CoCo Ichiban, because
I know what I'm gonna get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like such a sterilized process. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is, you get the
same thing every time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it really is no different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whether you have CoCo
Ichiban abroad or here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never had it
abroad, so I can't comment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had it in America, I've had it in- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it the exact same? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the exact same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, it's one of the only
places where I can get spice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that actually makes me feel alive, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, except you
choose the level of spice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is YouTuber material. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno if this is the same abroad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in CoCo Ichiban here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can choose the spice
level of the curry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and 10, as a certified Thai
man who loves Thai food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and spicy food, it is
fucking insanely spicy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except you willingly are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yes, I will have the 10",
and every time we've gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to CoCo Ichiban together and you say, yes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll have a level 10- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're like blinking me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you, sure, 10? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the spiciest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But one thing I don't
like about the spice level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in CoCo Ichiban is it
feels like fake spice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, like there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It tastes real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, when I was having it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm crying there, so I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are those fake tears, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I mean by fake spice
is that it just feels like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's added, it's artificial,
- It's just artificial spice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not truly a dish that
was meant to be spicy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you have an Indian curry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you have a Thai dish
and you remove the spice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you feel like it's missing something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I think that in a
normal CoCo Ichiban spice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's mainly a throat thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But in a normal curry, it's
a whole mouth meltdown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Those chilies get all over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, CoCo Ichiban </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like my throat is on fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I love pain when I'm eating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love pain when I'm
eating things as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are like, "Oh,
it ruins the flavor!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, you don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you're like, in severe pain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's euphoric, it's euphoric, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The pain makes the flavor
so much more prominent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a different
kind of pervert, isn't this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the pain, so
I don't understand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it's not an
attractive thing to be around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not something you do
on a date or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm there and I'm
like fucking (sniffles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So tasteful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember the very first
time I felt euphoric from spice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's on camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you watch my Domestic Girlfriend video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I eat a ghost pepper, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's a point in there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm explaining it,
I'm trying to be a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explaining it in a funny way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there's a point
where I'm just lying there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a good few seconds,
and I'm just like (gasps). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And at that point, my brain
was just rushed with endorphins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was literally high at that point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that literally, I couldn't think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it was painful, but it
was a good kind of painful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so difficult to explain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like downing a
pint of cocaine, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, that's exactly what it was like! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, it's so, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it euphoric.
- I don't understand it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't understand it at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you freak out when you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause Joey will try, he'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay I'll try it, I'll try it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He'll put an inch on
his spoon, he'll try it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like (coughing). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't like, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you stop freaking out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just accept it, it's so nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, but to be fair
I used to not be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to handle spice at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if we're talking Coco
Ichiban levels of curry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel that's the
easiest way to quantify it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I would always used to just
pick zero, like no spice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lemon and herb Nando's sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The real- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What dressing would you like? Water? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, water, please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I used to be
just zero spice at all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but then the more I would try to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more, because I will always be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that one guy who'd be like,
"Oh yeah, I'll try this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm probably gonna hate" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and spicy stuff was always one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yeah, I know I'm
probably gonna die from this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'll just eat it because why not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And spicy stuff, I
think that's how I built </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my spice tolerance now, so now I can do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a level two Coco Ichi and be like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Real man shit now! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And be like, "All right,
I can still eat this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and enjoy it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But I've once tried a level
three, I was like, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is to the point where the spiciness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the pain just completely
negates all flavors for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause for me, moving to
Japan, the one thing I miss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the most is spicy food.
- Spice, spice man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you get a CoCo Ichiban 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you can't get any
other spicy food anywhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause wasabi? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They have hot on the
menu and it's never hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's never hot.
- It's hot for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, go on wasabi, I have
a whole rant about wasabi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, wasabi is the closest
thing you get to spice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a totally different feeling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's in the nose.
- 'Cause it's the spice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in the nose, and I really
like that feeling, I do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just not the same
as the burning sensation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the burning, tingling sensation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around your mouth.
- Yeah, whereas normal spice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is pleasant, I feel like
eating too much wasabi is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're in a fucking trench in World War II </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the chlorine gas has just landed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do feel like you're being gassed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not spicy or like, "Ooh, it tingles." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like (coughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (screams) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, it's so weird because I can't do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a level three CoCo
Ichi, but I love wasabi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think people saying
wasabi is spicy is wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like it is suffocating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not spicy, it's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> painful.
- It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it's p- (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> A tiny bit, a tiny bit
mixed in with the soy sauce, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay. We're good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the moment you put
a little bit too much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on your sushi- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, I love just dumping
a whole load of wasabi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> into my soy sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've stopped putting
wasabi in the soy sauce, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and now sometimes, if I'm having a mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi,
- Right up the nose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like ball of wasabi
on the sushi, let's fucking go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I take that directly now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need it diluted by soy sauce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Next "Trash Taste" in the
veins, directly in the veins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Brings his the needle to the restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and heats up the spoon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like downing a pint of cocaine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know how I became to like spice? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause obviously if you haven't
noticed guys, I'm white. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I can see that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It might not be a
surprise to some of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm very white and my mum
cannot handle any spice at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum will have like, something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has actually zero spice in it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she'll be at the dinner table like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, it's kind of spicy, isn't it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mum, it's paprika. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's paprika, mum! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not spicy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's paprika, for fuck's
sake, it's a spice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, this water's a little spicy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So naturally, I was never
raised with spicy food ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And what ended up happening was is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I started doing those
fucking YouTuber challenges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would start with a ghost pepper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I saw Rhett and
Link do it when I was 15. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "I want a
ghost pepper, that sounds fun." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So we started doing it in school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We'd all do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You ate a ghost pepper at school? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could buy it at the
Tesco's and bring it in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so we used to buy them
and just (chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess torture each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I got into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then when I started doing live streams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kept making donation goals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll eat a Carolina Reaper, which is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is it still the world's hottest one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably isn't,
- Probably someone's made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some giga chad pepper.
- Yeah, this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> spiciest one now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some abomination that's just pure gas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I must've done it
seven or eight times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and by the end of doing it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause every single 24 hour stream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would at least do it twice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I started just being like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's actually kinda fun now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would actually look forward to doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so then I noticed after doing that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was just pure pain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I went back to eating
normal curry, I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't go back.
- There's no spice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no spice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Once you hit that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spice level
- it's 'cause you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> desensitizing yourself to it, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is how people get into dominatrix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers talking over one another) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It hurts at first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's kinda starting to feel good now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally like drugs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is drugs! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a drug, spice is a drug! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I remember when I
first started dating Sidney, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she could not handle spice at all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember what got
her to start liking spice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was basically when I
introduced her to my parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and every time we'd have a family meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mum would be like, "Oh, I didn't
make it so spicy for you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in Thai, what less spice means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just they take one chili </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of the fucking the 50
they put in this curry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what less spicy means. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've had the exact same experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was when we stayed
over at Garnt's place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause Aki can't take spice at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was like, "Oh no, I'm gonna die." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause your mom was making
Thai noodles or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which is usually hella spicy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to make a really weird
request to your mom to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you just take all the spice out?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she-
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way your mum looked at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like I was
speaking another language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, "What? No,
that doesn't make any sense." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, can you take all the spice out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay, so you want one less chili? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no.
- No, all, all chili's gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just does not compute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like "This is the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm ever doing this for anybody." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like I offended the
Thai people by saying that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She was just confused,
'cause she was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you mean no spice?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Less spice? More less spice? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what does no spice mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That does not make sense to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, because Sydney would always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to eat this Thai food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at first she was crying every meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, as the more she ate,
the more she got used to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then now she can handle spice better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than a lot of Thai people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have this dish called
in Thailand called pakimao, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which translates to drunken noodle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the reason it's called drunken noodle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you have to be truly pissed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be able to handle the
spice, how much spice this has. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she eats that on the daily, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, because I'm sure that if I was put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the same position as you or Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would probably get used to it too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I don't want to! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna enjoy my meals.
- It's good, man, it's good! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get some spice in your
life, it makes the meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gives this extra kick to the meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you just can't get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the problem, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that because I grew
up eating Japanese food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there isn't any Japanese dishes
that have spice like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because wasabi is, as we've established, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a completely different type of spice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we don't really use chilies
in a lot of Japanese food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So there isn't, I
guarantee there's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of Japanese people who can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not handle spice whatsoever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I definitely feel that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Should we open the wine? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before we move on guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've had this bottle of
wine just sitting down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we were going to open this podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we've hit a new
milestone, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've hit three milestones, technically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, three milestones at
almost the same time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we reached 100-
- Wait, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) wait, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are the three milestones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, let me tell you, first of all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we hit half a million subs- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the time of recording
- at the time of recording, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's probably more by this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We hit a 100,000 followers on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and we hit 50,000
followers on the subreddit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All on the like, it's all on the same day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All on the same, within
a few days of each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yay!
- Thank you, guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you for fucking supporting us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and watching what we do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And now we have a Drops of God wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, this is a Drops of God wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know which Drops
of God Wine this is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, that's fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm just gonna pour that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He swooshed it around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know.
- Can you believe that, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The gall of this man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There we go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would to talk about
Japanese bread for a moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japanese bread! Okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we've already talked about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, I would
like to add something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I would like to add something
to my Japanese bread rant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from the previous time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, Japanese bread doesn't
serve the same purpose here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as it does in European countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kidding, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you're not kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bread is a staple in European countries. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's something I need, I
need it, I just need it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughing) I knead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And in Japan, it's like
a fucking dessert project. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a fourth grader's
like, ooh, let's spice it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's put custard in the bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's do all this weird shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's put hotdogs in the croissant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, "What? Stop." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, to be fair though,
they're all pretty bomb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't want custard, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like I, okay,
so, I like this bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't get me wrong, I like this bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel like something's gone wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So next to our house, there's this bakery </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they sell this really
fucking good bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's amazing, it's bread that is so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can just eat
it with nothing on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I put stuff on it, like
I put tuna and toasted it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it made the bread taste worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like,
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're in the way of the bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the bread's time to shine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I ate this whole loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Problem was the loaf costed a thousand yen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like $10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> $10 for a loaf of bread?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy shit, dude! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This better be diamond
encrusted, Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's the main star
of whatever you're eating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can see why it cost $10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, I've never been, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> personally, you know, I've
never been blown away by breads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You ever been to Germany, bro? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, there you go that's why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> German people, man, say what you will, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they've got bread figured out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All the Germans watching this
are like, "Hell yeah, we do." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to Germany, you get
anything in their bakeries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fresh as fuck and it's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well then it just makes
me want to go to Germany. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm gonna move to Germany
when I'm done with Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Hi Germany, please welcome me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just to eat the bread? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretzels alone, holy shit,
their pretzels are good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, German food's fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck!
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel pretzels and uh, bread, for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> always need to be, they
are like the side dish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to whatever the main
thing is between them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, he said it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to have something with my bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You haven't had a good pretzel, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> A good pretzel will change your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A good, fat, hot German
pretzel with mustard... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, mustard's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, you don't like mustard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can put cheese on
it if you want, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's exactly it, I need cheese on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was about to finish
my sentence, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me finish! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A pretzel on its own,
just salted lightly, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with little salt chunks in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Man, you get a nice, ooh, you
get a nice bite of that salt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it goes perfect with your beer, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And even in the morning, it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's it's light, you can
have half the pretzel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Leave it, it's gonna be great later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just, pretzels, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing.
- We're not talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the tiny fucking principles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The big boy ones.
- We're talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the big German pretzels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tiny pretzels fucking suck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They suck, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's airplanes food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shitty cookie, is what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It all hits the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen a lot on YouTube, at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bread is a huge, it's
becoming a huge culture here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like, experimenting
with it and pushing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it more dessert-like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what you can do with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've noticed there
are a ton of bakeries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that none of them do normal bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like what weird fucking thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can we do with bread? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no, no, I put
life on the edge, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna do that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think someone said that on
one of the episodes as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, every time I see it-
- Now I've noticed it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't not notice it, I'm just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fine, I'll put it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I spilt some, are you happy, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I spilled some when I moved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - For fuck's sake, near the TV as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's by your feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you put it by your feet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't, I can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - One thing though that I will say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I think a lot of people
are gonna find controversial </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is that the Asian bakeries in America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> usually the ones that are
owned by Koreans or Japanese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel that the bread
there is way too sweet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's so sweet! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Way too sweet, but they
don't really do that here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like everything is a brioche. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every normal bread you get
tastes halfway to a brioche. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It shouldn't, it tastes too sweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's way too sugary, I don't
even taste the bread anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I've had a
lot of Japanese people say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you think that Japanese
food is too sweet?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Yes, it is too sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have too much sugar in this shit." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you eat a melonpan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't get me wrong, shit's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you look on the back, you
have a fucking heart attack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you see the sugar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's 80 grams of sugar in that melonpan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's like what?
Like two Cokes and a half? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Holy shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I would rather eat a melonpan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> than two Cokes and a half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's like they make this bread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's as amazing as it looks
in the anime, it totally is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In the first week here I
used to eat it non-stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I was like
- Of course you did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm never gonna get fat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I had a scare when I looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at the back and I'm like,
"That's sugar, isn't it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't tell me that's sugar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Google translate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, shit, it's sugar, fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fuck you expecting? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who knew that a sweet
thing would have sugar in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't think when it said 82- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Surprised Pikachu face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 82 grams? Maybe it was protein. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, maybe it was protein. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) Maybe it was protein. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe the bread was very heavy in proteins </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - All these Japanese
waifus are getting swole, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by the melonpan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I start thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had this bread and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "The bread tastes awfully sweet", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I did think it's kinda weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that the topping is just sugar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who would've fucking thought, hey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's awfully weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Talking about taking the
bread away from things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's talk about Japanese
hamburgers or hambagus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a hamburger, it's a hambagu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - An abomination to burgers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking love them! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't fucking stand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you order that shit.
- So to explain Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hambagus is literally just
a hamburger or a burger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Patty.
- patty without the bun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?! What?! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's good, I love it! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The best part of a hamburger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm gonna go on one
of those rants again, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the pizza thing, dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the synergy
- Synergy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the synergy, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There is a way to a burger, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all the accumulation of
the tastes that come together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they strike slightly moderately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because for 90% of burgers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't give a shit about the synergy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're there for the fucking patty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Uncultured, uncultured.
- You have a brioche bun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with lettuce, tomatoes, and some bacon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking amazing, but
you get a McDonald's burger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Who gives a shit, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The McDonald's burger has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more engineered than any
burger in the world, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That thing has been scientifically proven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to be the perfect-
- And it's been optimized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well.
- That is why you will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never say no to a double
cheeseburger at McDonald's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guarantee it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do because it's got ketchup on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Without ketchup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Regardless of the point,
it's a fucking dry-ass patty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a shit about that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is literal junk! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I love my gourmet burgers, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love every kind of burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The McDonald's burger has its place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why, no matter
what hamburger you get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a gourmet patty
or what what would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a gourmet patty on a gourmet burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You always order the
shitty patties though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in these places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You order like the, the shitty hamburger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that was made in a factory
probably 10 miles away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's still 10 times
better than anything you order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from fucking McDonald's
or even Burger King, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or most burger joints. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna have to
agree with Garnt on that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing)
- what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't get me wrong, sometimes I'll wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're clowns,
- and just be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're fucking clowns. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll never say no to a double cheeseburger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or a whopper right on some days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A Whopper burger here is great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll take it over any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of those shitty burgers.
- Sometimes you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I just wanna eat some shit today." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then other times you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "I really just want meat." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just want a hamburger,
I just want the patty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just the patty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck the synergy, I just want the patty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In my eyes, if you're going
to just order a hamburger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just with veg and maybe fries,
just get a fucking steak. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's totally different from steak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's hitting me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will never eat a fucking
steak over a hamburger, never. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just don't like steak! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will take the inferior, worst-tasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> piece of the cow.
- I don't like steak! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think steak is fucking mid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No man, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think steak is like eating cardboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a fucking piece of meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, eating a hambagu, right- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is going on?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What are these takes right now?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll let him freak out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Eating a hambagu, it's like a kid's meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't look right, it looks like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] What
are you talking about?! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's like, "Oh,
little Garnt can't handle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the tomatoes and the bread? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, we'll just take the
burger out for you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a different way
to enjoy a part of the meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you get the veg in a bag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with your little milk and your juice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a different way to have it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You talked about pizza,
it's like, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can only eat cheese when it's on pizza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who said that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh?
- Who said that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's, that's
- There's probably someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the same logic, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can't have mozzarella by itself." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you have mozzarella by itself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's fucking great! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it tastes good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great with a salad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not by itself, Garnt! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> By itself means on its own! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - A hambagu is not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what by itself means?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A hambagu is not a patty by itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You got like, potatoes,
you got vegetables. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got eggs, you got sauce,
- You can put some cheese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You put it on a fucking curry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you can put it on so many things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just is not bread
and lettuce and tomatoes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you have a steak
and it comes with fries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the steak by itself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? Say that again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you order a steak
and it comes with fries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it by itself? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's with the fries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't give a shit about the steak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You, but what you're saying is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that because it's taken out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not by itself or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The patty's not by itself
- Whoa, Whoa, what I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I'm trying to say is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to have steak with fries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can have steak with
a lot of other things! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If the patty is just a singular thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's veg next to
it, the patty's by itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just a fact, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, right, that is not
part of, a burger, it's a meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all put in one.
- The patty is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking ingredient to a bigger whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you can take the ingredients </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can do other things
with the ingredients. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you have all the
ingredients of a soup, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to each other, it's
not a fucking, it's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it's not by itself, it's
a soup. What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're chatting out of your ass, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a burger on its own, just left there! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's depressing! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Put some fucking lettuce and tomatoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and bread on that shit, man! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's on the side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's on the side! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can have other stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You can eat a burger in more than one way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can eat the hambagu, you take a bite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of that shit.
- You uncultured fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can eat the burger on the side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't you just go
to fucking McDonald's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> order a burger and just pry it apart, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take the hamburger out and eat it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt, you fucking animal! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the patty is shit! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is why! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The patty is garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] The patty is garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but so is this
burger that you get- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] No, it's not! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The beef that they give you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The beef that they give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that isn't A5 beef here is pathetic beef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's not!
- It's so sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking great burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As I was informed by a friend of mine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whose whole job is to manage
exports of meat into Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he informed me that all the beef </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that isn't the top grade
stuff is just imported </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from other countries.
- Well, then fuck him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it tastes like shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck him! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're acting like
that Reddit comment now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am, I am, I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt, excuse me, I am a beef expert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - My dad works for Nintendo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard from a friend
who works in the industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, listen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you grow up,
basically, next to farms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get that beef,
you get it fresh, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't give me this
shit of this air-sealed bag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a beef carcass flown across a country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, what if I didn't grow
up up next to a fucking farm? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that sucks to be you, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go and eat your hamburger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But by that same logic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why can you still enjoy McDonald's patties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or burgers then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that as a
burger is a great burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a fucking great- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not! It's trash! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even the best
burger in the fast food joint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you take a fucking Burger
King over a McDonald's burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> any day of the week- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It depends on the mood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're such a liar! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What fucking mood?
- Who would actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Explain to me the mood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you need to be in.
- Who would we take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a McDonald's burger over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a Burger King?
- When I am absolutely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> plastered, there's nothing more I want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than double cheeseburgers from McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have this- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That just sounds like
your fucking prerogative. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But also, I just think that McDonald's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the UK at least, was
the best fast food chain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, probably, but there
weren't many to pick from, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I would say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Bu there's way more to pick from here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like, okay,
- At the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you could take a Burger King burger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with McDonald's fries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would be the perfect
fast food restaurant for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As it stands, I either have to pick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between a shitty burger and good fries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a less shitty burger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and worse fries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm convinced all the fast food places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have an agreement of who's
gonna have the best what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because why does not one
of them just figured out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, those are the good fries? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why don't we get those fries?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But I guarantee if I blindfolded you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I made you eat both of them- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fries? I could
tell, a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't think-
- We're doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter drowns out Connor) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I reckon you could do
that with a burger as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you wouldn't be able to tell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dude, with fast food chains? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Hundred percent I can tell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll bet my life on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We gotta do it now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We gotta fucking do that.
- Order Uber Eats right now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We gotta do it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Talking about beef though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let's talk about actual Japanese beef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and Japanese steaks because like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A5 or nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A5-
- or nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A5 is like, I thought- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not that much more expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so weird living in a country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can go to your
local local supermarket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get A5 beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is the type of beef </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that gets shipped over
and you pay 50 bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for a fucking hundred
grams of something abroad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you can just get
it here at your supermarket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> As much as I don't rate steaks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> A5 steaks, they do the
striking comparatively. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had a Wagyu burger yesterday
and it was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm so glad that there was bread, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lettuce, and tomatoes and cheese, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't start this again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just steered away from it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just saying, I just felt good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean a burger and a steak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are two different things in my mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But okay, Wagyu steak is amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when they
fry that shit in butter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, so much that it absorbs it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you bite into it, it's like (gasps). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't know though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like for me, steak is just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how often do you have a steak? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not often, that's why I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't have steak often, it gets old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would understand, coming
from your perspective, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why you hate steak, but to
me, steak is the best meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the best meats you can get if it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - False,
- prepared well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is false. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's better than a good steak? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think pork is the best meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get the fuck out of here! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a pork steak? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, not a pork steak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think, well, pork steaks are good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Gammon chops are fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, here's how the tier list goes, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here's how the fucking tier list goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, it goes like an
amazing steak at top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't eat a steak every day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but as a one off meal, steak is my- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I admit, it's up there,
it's up there, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then after that comes chicken, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause chicken you can do so much with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can never get bored of chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could eat fried chicken
every day of the week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then below that is pork. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
- Below that is pork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would never, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything you cook with pork, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you can do
something similar with chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I feel like pork has, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the in-between, whereas
beef is really heavy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> pork is the in-between, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like you can
do so much with pork. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love sausages, man! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Sausages are amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you can also
have beef sausage as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never had a beef sausage in our life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's nothing you can do with pork </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't do with
either chicken or beef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have it taste better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, do you like hotdogs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He acts like a guy who
doesn't like hotdogs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you not like hotdogs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the dude who's talking about- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's because you don't
like fucking condiments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also, the people who talk so highly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about steak are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, no, no, hotdog are for
peasants. I couldn't possibly." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love a good hotdog. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hotdog, does this have dog in it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love hotdogs, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know they're absolute
garbage and probably cancerous- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you have to have a
beef sausage hotdog though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you've never had
a beef sausage, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, tell me the
difference between a hotdog- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And a sausage? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And a sausage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, if you're ever gonna
take a hotdog over a sausage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think we can be friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know when you're at a barbecue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people are being kinda cheap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't wanna bring the
big sausages, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fine, I'll eat four hotdogs, fine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would never pick a
hotdog over a sausage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a double cheeseburger, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If it's there, I'll eat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, with a sausage
hotdog like a thick boy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can only put one of those away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With a hotdog, I feel like you
can put three or four away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, 'cause
they're so fucking thin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they just taste like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A sausage, a good sausage is heavy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason I don't like hotdogs is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the reason I would never
take it over the sausage, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it just tastes so processed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's 'cause it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's something about
highly processed food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that my brain is (laughs goofily) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Question, do you like spam? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, you're gonna laugh now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my mum's gonna feel so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My mom used to make this meal
and I fucking loved it, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would always ask my mum to make it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was literally mashed
potatoes and spam, just mashed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I fucking loved this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, with no flavoring on top of it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, just mashed potato in spam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine a giant fucking
pan of mashed potato, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would just take a
giant plate full of this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would gobble that shit up, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would eat that for days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like cancer in a plate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because spam is one of those things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like if I'm
offered spam on its own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can see it, I'm like,
"Get that away from me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get that shit away from me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But when it's in something,
disguised, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, this shit claps, what is it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, it's spam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Spam fried rice is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spam fired rice is pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to fucking hate spam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Ew, get
that shit away from me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me real meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't there a spam in Hawaii? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They make a spam sushi or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's either Hawaii or Okinawa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's an Okinawa
dish with spam nigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fuck with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Spam nigiri is fucking dope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fuck with spam, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to not fuck with it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but spam is such a huge
thing in the Philippines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So going to Aki's parents' place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every second meal had spam in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so I couldn't avoid the shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spam is what I eat to remind me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what good meat tastes like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do the peasants eat nowadays? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I must know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, spam, is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hotdog and spam? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I suppose I could give a
hotdog and spam a trial too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, rather distasteful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna know, when you go to the combini, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's the top three
food items that you get? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends on the combini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always get, yeah it
depends on the combini, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but say if it's Family Mart, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I always get the fucking tuna bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know the brand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The long boy, yeah.
- Yeah, that shit's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That shit's good.
- The long boy tuna bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that shit always claps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, anything with mayo in here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan is so much better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so the tuna bread- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mayo is god tier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The tuna bread with the mayo on top- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As someone who hates
mayo, I gotta admit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan is the only place where
I can kind of be okay with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's saying a lot,
that's saying a lot! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will never eat mayo by itself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but when it's in a nice
potato salad or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought that egg sandwiches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were the most depressing
fucking thing in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the UK, they're like this white mush </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that looks disgusting, it
smells vile, it's just gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have it in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this yellow,
bright color, it's inviting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, oh, eat me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eat me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just might
- Eat me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just might, and I had it and I had it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had it and my mind was blown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I cannot stop eating the
egg sandwiches here, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The egg sandwiches
are fucking godly here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can never eat an egg
sandwich anywhere else now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm gonna be thinking, dude- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan has ruined eggs for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Eggs and mayo are just god tier here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I remember the concept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just going to my first yakiniku place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just having the dips,
for some dipping sauce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in yakiniku, which is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do I explain yakiniku? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like grilled meats basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like Korean barbecue- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do I explain it? It's meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Korean barbecue, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but replace Korean with Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's on a skewer basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So for some dishes, they
give you just an egg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as a dipping sauce, the
egg yolk, a raw egg yolk; </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which firstly, the
concept of eating raw eggs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was really, really weird for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I tried it for the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And raw egg here tastes fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Our producer, Maylene,
is obsessed with eggs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't get salmonella
here from the eggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty impossible, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I did one of my videos,
I drank a bunch of egg, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all the comments were
like, "Oh my god, Connor- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's gonna die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "You're gonna get
salmonella, you dumb fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know more, I got told
eggs give salmonella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like reverse Uno card in this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, hit me up with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think it's a
hundred percent unlikely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have heard of a couple of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's worth the risks,
it's worth the risk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard of a couple of my friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get very mild salmonella
from the eggs here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's really, really rare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's not as easy to get
salmonella like in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because I think in America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and the UK and most of Europe,
I think we wash the eggs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we get rid of the
protective film, or the coat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think it's also something
to do with how we feed them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> certain drugs to make
them immune to diseases. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, 'cause like, what is
it, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sukiyaki. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's one of my favorites, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sukiyaki, is like, yeah,
I put you onto that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that shit's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sukiyaki's the best fucking hotpot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shabu-shabu is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they boil this meat and veg in this broth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's kinda weak, it's like (sighs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't rate shabu-shabu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like they always
advertise themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as shabu-shabu places,
and then they might have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sukiyaki on the menu,
but they never advertise it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always yo, we got shabu-shabu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it tastes like shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like bathwater for your meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still think the best hotpot for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Chinese hotpot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Chinese hotpot, it's way more flavorful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's a heavy broth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you had sukiyaki though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you had it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have, I have had it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so sukiyaki, if
you don't know at home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the broth that they cook it in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a rich... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's soy based with a little
bit of, fuck, what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like dashi, it's dashi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how to explain dashi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's this really rich broth, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and to mellow it out
and enhance the flavors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you dunk it in egg yolk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so you crack a
raw egg, you whip it up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you dip that shit in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you cook everything in the broth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's all covered in soy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the veg has absorbed
it, you dunk it in the egg, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you eat it and
it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So good.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And Chinese hotpot is good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think sukiyaki's better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I rave Chinese hotpot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every time I've had a Chinese
hotpot, I'm like, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, Japanese hotpot's pretty good too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We've had it at our place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Abe, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had like a, I
don't know which hotpot- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had that on Christmas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Connor didn't want a fucking roast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - None of us have an oven! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What are we gonna roast, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How are we gonna fucking roast a chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in a tiny little fish grill? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You get a grill in your
stove top, oven top, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oven top, and you get this grill for fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like this wide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pull it out.
- It can literally fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just one fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- You wanna roast a potato? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Good fucking luck, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gotta cut that bitch in the third. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're gonna have to pan fry the potato. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, I want a roast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How are we gonna have a roast, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Explain the logistics behind this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The logistics, Garnt,
I'm bringing it back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I have an oven and I think you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I have an oven as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, next time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry that we can afford an oven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would I need an oven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I eat out every fucking day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor, you're so lazy,
why do you eat out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes, I meal prep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meal prep, this sounds so fucking lame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I meal prep, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll make a curry for five days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll eat the curry over
five days, like a Thai curry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's about it, that's as
far as cooking goes for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the thing,
I'm pretty sure we touched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upon this on a previous episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But people got so pissed when we said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That they were like, "It's
not cheaper to eat out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you do X and X and X." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's, yeah, if I ate pasta and sauce, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course it's gonna be cheaper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you want to have
something that tastes different, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes, it's gonna maybe be a 100- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you want a different
meal every day, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you can't be fucked
to go shopping every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the expire date on
shit is like two days to go! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And more often than not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you buy stuff, it's too
much portions that I can't use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like veg here is normally portioned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for more than one person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like family portion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I wanted, what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the small onions,
like the green onions? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are they called? Is it green onions? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shallots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's shallots in America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spring onion? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spring onion for us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You cannot just get two spring onions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It has to be a whole fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's either a whole fucking one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or a giant tub of cut-up ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm talking more than any one person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could ever use in a week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like that big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a tub this thick
just filled with these cuts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, I'm not gonna use this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel bad 'cause I throw
all the ingredients away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I can't use them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, it's because cut shallots are used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in literally every Japanese dish, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And if I get tomatoes, they
always come in packs of six. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Tomatoes are fucking big! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need six most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And 'cause of how we do,
say we record on Tuesdays, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna eat out,
and then maybe on Monday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to meet someone for a meeting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or maybe I've got a shoot on Thursday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm gonna eat out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's more like one day a week I eat in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And even then I'll just go to the combini </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and get the 500 Yen ramen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is, sure, I could make my own- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is technically the top tier ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I could make my own ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it'd be more expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like, yeah, of course some people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you want to be picky about
it, yeah, you can save money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> The same way if you eat pasta in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll save a shit ton of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> live like a human being,
- If you actually wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoy your food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, if you wanna not be depressed 24/7 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while you're eating, like, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause going back to the combini thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about foods that we buy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I go less to the combini now to get meals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when I first moved here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would go to get a combini
meal every fucking day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And the combini fried chicken
here is fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, with an asterisk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - With an asterisk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> FamilyMart fried chicken
fucking sucks, okay?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's way too greasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a layer of like, fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You feel like you're eating
death as you're taking a bite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I see YouTubers,
I think Chris Broad says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that his favorite's FamilyMart chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you eat into this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's the most depressed
things you can eat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's as depressed as he is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You take a bite into this thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it is pure water and oil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That chicken was probably
anemic in its real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they pumped that
shit with water and oil </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, dude do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Lawson's fried chicken on the other hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, nah, nah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Seven fried chicken at the top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seven fried chicken.
- I think Seven fried chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is in the middle, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Lawson's do this sweet and sour, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's salty and sweet, like
teriyaki fried chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking good,
dude, it's fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It hits different, it
hits back. It hits back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You bite into this thing,
it's fighting you, bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the good way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, damn, there's so
much flavor in this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, oh shit, oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy shit, I just wanted the
fired chicken, not a fight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Also when you first come to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like onigiri, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Jelly-filled donuts immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it's new, it's
exciting, it tastes good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then when I moved here,
I was eating it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "This kind of tastes
boring, really boring." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I thought who would
have a sandwich in Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want a, I can get a
better sandwich in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you start
experimenting a little bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had the egg and
my go-to sandwich combo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I cry if this isn't available. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> In Lawson's they have a god
tier tuna mayo sandwich, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the other one is the egg one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The egg and ham? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's beautiful, it's beautiful, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I cry every time I eat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that is definitely my
favorite sandwich combination. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so good because you
have the tuna and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ooh, a little salty, a little fishy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have the egg and
mayo one, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, dude, this is good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm actually the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I'm first moved here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like why would I
want a fucking onigiri? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now it's just like
a very nice casual snack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you don't want a
full meal, you just want- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Onigiri's quite filling though, I find. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have that as a snack
and it fills you up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you don't need anything else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - For a while.
- I guess, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I always, when I go to the
combini in the morning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes I can't be
bothered to make a breakfast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I go to the combini in the morning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I always get my breakfast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then some kind of onigiri. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I know the breakfast
is gonna fill me up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I know a couple of hours later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be feeling a little bit peckish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the onigiri is just perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to fill in that little spot it creates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - My problem with onigiri is sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a coin toss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You might get one where they're
generous with the fillings, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and sometimes you bite into that shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's one shred of tuna in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, "Where's the flavor, bro? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just ate into to seaweed and rice." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There was one piece of tuna
with a slap of mayo on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sucks, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If it was consistent, maybe I'd like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you only eat the tuna onigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I like the salmon
and the cod roe one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the cod roe one's fine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but cod roe is kind of intense, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you tried some
of the other flavors, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the flavored rice flavors? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you mean like the fried rice ones? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The fried rice ones are fine, but again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm always thinking like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're situational for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would rather them warm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Got back to this shit again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want it warm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can warm it up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just put that bitch in the microwave! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't feel right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna microwave
rice, that's depressing, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, would you rather cold rice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or microwave rice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cold.
- Well, then stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking complaining (laughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I would rather it be freshly- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that aint gonna
happen at a fucking combini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For you, as a white person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) who grew up- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's really situational. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As a white person.
- As a white person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As a white person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The point I was trying to make here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is how did it feel going from eating rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every now and again to eating
rice for almost every meal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I've had a
conversation with people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who grew up grew up in
America, grew up in England, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they've moved to an Asian
country and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Man, I really it at first
and then I just got bored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of eating rice for every meal." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I grew up with this
shit, so I'm used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wears you down a little bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like you
really do get used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, maybe some
people, they like it at first, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, like you said, they start to hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for me it was like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rice has just always been there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like bread, but in a
different format for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like if bread is the hard drive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then rice is the SD card in my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They all do the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They just fill you up and they're carbs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think most of the time
here, it's not just plain rice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes it is, like
when you go to ryokan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just plain fucking rice in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's so starchy and
sticky, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck, dude, I'm eating
fucking Play-Doh here." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when you go to my
favorite place in the world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Matsuya, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here we go again. Here we go again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I must look like a freak when I do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So when they cook the pork, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pork, by the way, Garnt, not beef. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Beef tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They cook the pork, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like juices, and
normally you just kinda </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pick up the pork and put in the rice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put some mayo on it and then eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In the restaurant, I hold
up my plate and pour all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fats and stuff on the rice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I can agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tastes so fucking good, dude,
'cause it makes it so rich. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's just the fucking the audacity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go into a beef bowl place
and order pork (laughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, you go to Matsuya, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm telling you, man,
that pork and ginger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, I've had it, it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were smashed one time and I was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's like vanilla beef. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would I have a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Vanilla beef! Are you out of your mind?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't start this again! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Vanilla beef, really?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my god, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I walk into a Matsuya,
I'm ordering a beef bowl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's beef without attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What can I say? That's pork, that's pork. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, pork is like beta beef. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing)
- Nah man, I don't know man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I already know this is gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest comment war
in the comments section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Out of any shitty opinion on anime- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have mainly Americans watching us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I feel that Americans
will side with beef, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause beef is way more prevalent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, they're not right, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what's an underrated meat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Lamb, lamb is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, here's the thing about lamb, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is that has to be really
good quality lamb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because if it's not,
the after taste in lamb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can be so overpowering that
it just tastes horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, lamb fucking sucks here, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, sometimes it's like
eating leather, essentially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we went to a restaurant once, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like a roulette
wheel on this lamb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> For some reason, some of these lamb chops </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were perfectly cooked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You had another one, it's like trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Eating a boot.
- Chew through a tire, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like (breathes loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like when do I
just swallow it and give up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> When do I just admit- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I had a chiseled
jawline by the end of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause from all the fucking
chewing I was doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's either my jaw
dislocates or I'm done, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or I'm choking on this
fucking tire piece of lamb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's just some meats like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And especially coming from
Wales where, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they fuck sheep, that's the stereotype, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what everyone does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, lamb is fucking
great, you get great lamb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess another question I have for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is a conversation I've
had with a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have never been to Asia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who have never been to
Asia or lived in Asia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this concept of cooking your own meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like going to a Korean barbecue
or going to a shabu-shabu, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and having to cook your own
meal and cook your own meats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's your opinion of that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a colonial white man? I'm joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a upper class white man.
- Because I really like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I really like the social part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, the first time I
went to a Korean barbecue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was with you and I was like,
"I'ma just let Garnt do this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Let the Brown boy do it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I really like
the social aspect of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one, being able to
control how, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how cooked your steak
is, to do that yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have Gordon Ramsey, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's a white man who can
cook, that's an anomaly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> White people can't cook, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give it to every other culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause there's cause there's
a chain of pubs in Australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where inside of the pub there's
literally just a butcher </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just rows and rows of
steaks and meats and whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you pick out whatever
steak you want, you pay for it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they give it to you, and
then you have to take that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> over to the barbecue and
just make it yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason why I don't like
cooking it myself is, one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna pay the other
person to do that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna pay you so I
can fuck up this piece of meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll go and do that at home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll go and fuck this up- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna embarrass
myself in public. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the worst part is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is when you go to a Korean barbecue, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you take someone there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you take someone to Korean barbecue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or any kind of barbecue like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're the one who has to cook,
'cause you took them there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's on you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they just sit back and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Go ahead, go ahead." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck dude, how do I know this is cooked?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the worst part is they're
like, "Let's get chicken." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> When is chicken cooked? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause personally, I will just
let the chicken get black. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, all right, it's safe to eat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's safe to eat, dig in kids! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like you're okay
with going to a barbecue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and having someone cook for you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so why, why can't you put that
in a restaurant experience? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? What's the difference? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, 'cause it's like we're
all bringing our own meats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or you can just order
good quality meat, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would I do that in a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I can just do that at home? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You get the exact same experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then why do you go to a barbecue? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do people do barbecues? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's 'cause it's a social experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the exact same
thing with a Korean barbecue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly the same thing with going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to a shabu-shabu or going
to a Korean barbecue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you gave me the choice, you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Connor, you can have Korean
barbecue where you cook it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Korean barbecue where
the guy who works here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and often comes on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they see you fucking
burning the meat anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they come in like no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they start like, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they come and fix it for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So, just save the embarrassment
and just do it for me right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's just like an activity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then go and do an activity! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why you gotta make your fucking meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into an adventure, bro? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like, okay, here's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when, I
remember going to America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the only reason you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially hanging out
with Sydney's family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deep in the Midwest, they only
go to a restaurant to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's how it should be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The only exception to me is hotpot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you can't fuck a hotpot up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You just throw everything in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just throw it all in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno man, I've seen
people fuck up a hotpot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can fuck up a hotpot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But to me, a restaurant can be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an entire experience
where you catch up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with friends and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like in the West,
you don't go to a restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for anything else but the purpose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just having a meal and eating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I disagree, I think it's
changing a little bit now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> At least it was the UK, before I left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was very much becoming
an experience kind of thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> over whatever the restaurant was serving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some of the quietest
restaurants I've ever been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to have been in America
where no-one is talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're just silently eating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, you could do this at home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like to make my meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I look forward to all
day into a stressful thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If every time I took a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to put in the input
code and it's flashing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the bidet, dude, that's
gonna, I don't wanna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, it's a fun activity at first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's gonna get
old real fucking fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you're adding steps- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if that's the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I just feel
like you're adding steps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to something which doesn't require steps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it does, that's where
the enjoyment comes in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- It's like a group activity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, shout out to the
people who get anxiety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with cooking, I'm sure you can relate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Why would
I wanna fuck this up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when I can just pay someone to do it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - In my defense, I can't
cook to save my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I fuck up a toast,
that's the kind of like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the kind of like fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you will cook your own
food in those restaurants? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yet, I love going to a yakiniku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and being the one to be
like, "I'll cook the meat." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's the one and only time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm in front of food where I have control. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a power move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a power move. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me fucking handle
this. Let me cook the meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me show you how it's done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you get impressed by
someone putting meat on a grill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean fair play to you, man,
I'm not really buying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Go and work in the kitchen." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Get out of my seat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I love about
yakiniku and Korean barbecues </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that it's literally you
just have a fucking meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of just grilled meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like having the
burger without the bun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's my main problem- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cut out the fucking middle man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just give me the good shit, man! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love yakiniku,
don't get me wrong, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love yakiniku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There is a fundamental
problem with yakiniku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate the loading times for the meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't skip the loading time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't skip the loading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, at a good restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what would a good restaurant do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They prepare all the foods so
it comes out at the same time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Sign of a good restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because everyone can start
eating immediately, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With a yakiniku place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially if you go with fucking Maylene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna chuck all the
meat on straight away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that we can start eating everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we have a constant
stream of meat coming in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maylene, when I went with her, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> she wanted to put one tiny
fucking piece of beef on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and wait five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that's Maylene's problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why you don't go to
a restaurant with Maylene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I like to eat, I wanna keep eating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's why you
gotta fucking optimize it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you have- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's got the strats now!
- You can fucking optimize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this because you have the meats on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as the meats getting
done, you put more meat on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you put this on the side, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speed run yakiniku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then as you're eating the meat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then the other meat is cooking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's never a down period. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, that's not
true, that doesn't happen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> In a realistic world,
Garnt, that doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is how it happens.
- That is how it happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've just not optimized your Korean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> barbecue experience.
- You don't like yakiniku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because you've just been to shit yakinikus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, right, here's
another awkward scenario. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Four of you go to a yakiniku restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> The A5 beef comes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's in six pieces. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do you do, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who decides who gets how many A5? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the A5 beef, Garnt, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is 8,000 Yen for these six slabs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who gets what, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause personally, I'm
not gonna lie, I want two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do I argue? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just goes down
to the Asian experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of sharing your meals
and sharing your dishes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck do we turn
six into eight, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because someone- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cut one of them in half? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's depressing,
that's depressing, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't do that, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's already precut. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Asian families can do it no problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to do Monopoly mind games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at my fucking family dinner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make sure I'm getting the most meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me tell you how to solve this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Go, go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because this happens every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have the four pieces, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you have the two pieces left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And the Connor's like, "Is
nobody gonna eat these? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, I'll just take them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That is the experience
hanging out with Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He is that guy who's just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, you know what's more stressful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than when you're hungry
and there's one piece left </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and nobody seems to give a fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that there's one piece left on the table? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, are we gonna eat this or not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because if no-one's gonna
do it, I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then just do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because I also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, with you guys, I don't
give a fuck, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But maybe when we're first
getting to know each other, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't want you guys
to go home and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why's Connor always fucking
talking all our food, man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's always going for it straight away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's going for the kill." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? This is a real social problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if I'm getting dinner, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single time I have my
peace, I'll chat a little bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I look to go and get my next piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the fucking fat ass over
there is taking it every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to know that there's
at least a cool-down period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between him eating one piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's at least a
two-minute cool down to wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so stressful, there's
so many social issues </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with meat being cooked on its own! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just let us all order </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> our own shit!
- I feel like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> way too over complicating this, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, because you
don't realize it, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're creating problems out of nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, 'cause
Joey, your social skills </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are perfectly normal human beings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just glide through it,
you don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey just dances through, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For me it's like a science, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a science. Social situations, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta make sure you don't do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for a new person that
could make you seem weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right.
- So that includes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not eating too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you go home, they
think you're a fat ass, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, get a load of this
guy eating all our meat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that we split the bill on! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He ate the most! Connor
should've paid the money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my mind, if you're not gonna eat it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys know we're splitting this meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you're not gonna eat it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna just fucking take it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But sometimes that
hasn't been made clear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's splitting? Are we
splitting this, are we not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the awkward social situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you encounter often, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this opportunity of taking
this last piece of meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is here right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a fuck about what percentage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are we gonna split this
based on how many pieces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of meat we ate.
- I'm jealous of you, Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can throw caution
to the wind like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just take the meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If people think I'm a fat ass, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, then that's their problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have the full stomach, not you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You missed the opportunity,
I take that opportunity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am an opportunist in that sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You say that like you're the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who always takes the
last piece, when it's me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in my head I'm just like,
"Look at fucking fat ass!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I do is I wait, you gotta wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> until you're pretty
confident that everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has just decided they
don't want this anymore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you go in for the kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, I've been in
way too many situations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's such a Japanese thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when you go to
a business dinner in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always, it's like a
rule, it's like a social rule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to leave one piece of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever the fuck it is.
- Why? Why?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so annoying! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's this whole idea of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Japanese culture
of "You go, no, you go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, you go." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the crowd before me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the whole collective mentality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I've been in so many
of those situations where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the end, no one takes the piece at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they just take the food back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they just take the food back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, no dude, take me back to the kitchen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me all the one piece leftovers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna eat them, bro.
- So that's why, now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've been in so many
situations where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why is he taking that away? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's still one piece left on it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, let me use my gaijin card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for a second hand here and
just give me that piece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Think of all the
wasted food that happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because of socially awkward situations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wasn't it better if we all
just figured out a system? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a piece of meat, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not just a piece of meat, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's A5 beef you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about.
- She meant something to me! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if it's A5 beef, fair enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get a load of this guy,
this guy doesn't eat hotdogs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's like a piece
of pork or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See what I mean? This
guy's is so fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Those are fighting words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy gets two million subs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he changes, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No more hotdogs!
- You used to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> humble, Garnt.
- No more spam for Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can I talk about one
thing that I'm not a fan of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japanese cooking culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not really widespread? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, we're in a ryokan, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we have this mini grill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we have this mini grill next to us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they put a shell fish on the grill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Abalone.
- Abalone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They put the shellfish on this grill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're all sitting next to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the fish, the shellfish
starts dancing and turning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, hmm, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are shellfish meant to do
that when they're dead? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it, it looks like it's trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to crawl off this grill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it goes from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I slowly start to realize
that shit's alive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm watching something being burned alive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of my eyes, and you
expect me to eat this shit?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because you
know this shit's fresh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That shit was amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't it like $50 apiece?
- Yeah, do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> why it was amazing? Because
it was alive two minutes ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's fresh food, and
then there's witnessing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a fucking murder before I'm about to eat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking abalone, who cares? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like you knew this abalone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not like watching a friend die. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man's a meat eater and
now he's fucking complaining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that a shellfish dies in front of him? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, I'm like, I'm fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Would you kill every animal that you eat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Would you kill a cow? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a fucking lie! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're sitting here, being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh no, this shellfish died."
- This poor abalone! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You telling me that you'll
kill a cow and eat it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You would kill a cow? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to be mentally prepared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mentally prepared?
- Yes, yes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For a fucking shellfish?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You eat all of this meat
like it's nothing, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You never think about it, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't just sit here
and then pick and choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you see a little thing squirming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of you, being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, well, I guess now I
have a problem with this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone should do something about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know an animal needs to be killed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in order for me to eat and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I need to kill an animal
to eat it, I'll fucking do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I need to be in the mental headspace, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when I'm sitting down at a restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck it, we're getting the chicken, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna see him kill it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not the only time it's happened, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause a few weeks ago, I
went to this teppanyaki place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which, teppanyaki is like a flat grill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a chef cooks the food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, I like that, I like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Great that someone
else cooks it for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I remember I was
sitting there with Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and on the opposite side, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other people had
just ordered lobsters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so what happens is that
they get the freshest lobster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They have the tank with
just lobsters in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they pick a lobster </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the chef puts the
lobster in front of them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's fucking trying to crawl around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, this is a fresh fucking lobster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I've seen lobsters being prepared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by fucking Gordon Ramsey and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He puts the knife in the spinal
cord and kills it instantly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But not at this fucking restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This fucking restaurant
presents the lobster, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's crawling around,
and the customer's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes, this is a fresh
lobster, this looks amazing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the chef goes like, "Okay, brilliant." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Puts the lobster on the grill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just see it being fucking cooked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's trying to fucking crawl away! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, I'd rather see that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than when you go in
those shitty restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with those obviously dead
lobsters in the tank, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are barely fucking alive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they've been
suffocated in their own shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I would rather the lobster probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have quite a painful death, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's over and pretty fast, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It probably tastes better too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not poisoning its friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause when a lobster
dies in that tank, bro, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all those lobsters are contaminated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see the lobster
squirming really rapidly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Okay, this is
a healthy, young lobster." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a healthy boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking take it out back and
put a bullet in its head? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt, what do you want? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, please! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No!
- Kill it first, kill it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! Who cares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kill it before you
fucking burn it to death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and give it a few minutes of agony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is how vegans are born. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This really is how vegans are born. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This guy is the same guy who
would sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It doesn't taste fresh enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me murder the cow myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me grab the meat
from inside its loins." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I know that I'm just
gonna witness a murder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before a meal, I'm like,
okay, let me prepare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> myself for this.
- I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they can't feel pain though, or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure they can't feel pain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if they
can feel pain or not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's beside the point
that I'm trying to make. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if they feel pain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'll still always remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more than the flavor
of that abalone we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that ryokan, is his face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like you witnessed
a box of kittens die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a fucking abalone! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I have never seen
any fucking living being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just squirm right in front of my face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I'm about to eat it, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can see the realization
on my face when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ha-ha, we're grilling meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it's moving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? Why is it moving?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember asking you guys,
"Why is this thing moving? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this alive?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I straight up
said, "Yeah, it's alive." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, "Oh, it's alive." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just watching something being killed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It didn't look very
appetizing, I will say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause isn't it referred to as a pussy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it looks like one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does look like a
bit of a vagina, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does, yeah, 'cause they- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Abalone just does look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a pussy.
- They have a nickname </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for in Japan where like,
men call it something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, really?
- Yeah, I think some Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> told me that, yeah, it's
famous for looking like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it doesn't look appetizing enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it dies in front of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine a squirming vagina on- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a grill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna get monetized, Joey, goddammit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're the one that brought
up the fucking vagina, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't even know that shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But two of those words together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in combination sound disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, squirming vagina? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey, stop! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Sabrina, can you fucking
sensor that shit, please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do we have any other food
topics? Anything else? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm trying to think of,
there's gotta be something else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> before we end this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a lot of Japanese food out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I feel just gets
completely swept under the rug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, again, the
whole Western perception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is ramen and sushi, that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all Japan has to offer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okonomiyaki is okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okonomiyaki is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You take that back, motherfucker! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You fucking take that shit back! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okonomiyaki is like a
good pasta in Elsewhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a carb, filling and it's very, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't really get mad
at pasta most of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's okonomiyaki. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're saying a lot of shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for someone in slap distance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least Garnt is on the
other side of the table, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I can just fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okonomiyaki, which is, how
do I explain okonomiyaki? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a savory pancake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly my point,
it's just a savory pancake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it looks better than it tastes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you see okonomiyaki </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like the fucking
"Shokugeki" food porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could, you could watch this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and jack off to it, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you actually
eat it, it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ah, this is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This should be up on a fucking painting." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm offended, I quit this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because I've never heard anyone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every time I've taken
someone from overseas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to an okonomiyaki place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've had the "Food Wars" experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just street food though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is a street food, but it's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the best street food you can have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will happily take an
okonomiyaki over a yakisoba. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> In my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe...
- No, I'd take a yakisoba. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As much as I love yakisoba as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get me wrong, all
street food is great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so then, I will- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all kind of meh-tier for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because it's B-grade food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's street food, of course
it's not gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my god, this is the
best meal I've ever had." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just there to fill your stomach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In no world, if a Matsuya is nearby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> am I not gonna choose- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Matsuya is the
definition of B-grade food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the king of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> B-grade.
- The only difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Matsuya and street food is
that Matsuya has a logo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the only difference! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's comfortable, man, it's comfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, sure, I saw a cockroach run </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> across the floor one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a fuck,
the food tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so then if Matsuya
started making yakisoba </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and okonomiyaki, would you eat it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well then what the
fuck's the difference? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause dude, the beef bowls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If we're talking B-grade food in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beef bowls and pork bowls are the king. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you're not gonna get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a beef bowl-
- I rest my case, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you're not gonna get
a beef bowl and a pork bowl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at a fucking summer festival. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're gonna get an okonomiyaki </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or a yakisoba or teppenyaki. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I get to summer festival, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yo, this is sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Google maps, where's the nearest Matsuya?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never want to go to a
summer festival with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're just gonna end up
in a fucking Matsuya. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when we went, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think Aki got all the
fucking weird seafood? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh, that's cool, that's cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go to a restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - As the certified
Japanese person here, Joey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I am now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm the certified Japanese
person of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why is anyone taking
my opinion on food, I'm white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are the Japanese
dishes that people should know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of just ramen and sushi and, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now we've mentioned tsukemen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel that,
again, it's a lot of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we've already
touched upon a lot of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like tsukemen is one, sukiyaki
is definitely another one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yakitori? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yakitori, just a lot of, oh
shit, a lot of street food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just B-grade street food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, as much as you
guys say that it's mid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I reckon not enough
people try okonomiyaki- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the thing
- Oh, I will, I will, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will destroy an
okonomiyaki, don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm not gonna feel happy about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's the thing, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like moving to
Japan has just completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> shifted my perception
of what good food is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you gave me this shit
when I come from England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything's S-tier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything in Japan is S-tier compared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to what you can get England,
and then you live here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "Man, there's
different tiers of S-tier." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's like a single S-tier,
there's a triple S-tier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw an article
shared around on Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was basically why does
Japan and Switzerland </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have such a high baseline
for what should be standard? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In terms of just everything in life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially food, just public
transport, daily living. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just everything in life has
such a high minimum requirement </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In the UK, it's like I
could pay a 100 pounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get a fucking garbage meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Japan, it's just not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- If you pay more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than normal here, you will
just get something good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll get an experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never gone to a restaurant here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where I paid more than the
baseline and been disappointed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And even then, like I said,
the Matsuyas and the chains </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the really average stuff, it's so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that anywhere you go in Japan
if you're not from here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll probably be
really satisfied with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And fuck, it must be awful being Japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and traveling overseas and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Wait, this restaurant was shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just paid a 100 pounds
and it was garbage." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How is this legal? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They know it's shit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, of course they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't give a shit though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't give a shit, they don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know, it's
just really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, that is the
baseline I think of why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when anyone asks you what
is your favorite thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about Japan?, I'm sure
we can all agree that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably top three of food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The food, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The food is amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew I was gonna like
the anime or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, is hambagu on its own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a devastation to hamburgers worldwide? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it is, but is it
still gonna be better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than any other country that does it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Honestly, yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gonna be better,
I'll admit that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the thing is that
I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who haven't come to
Japan will know nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the Japanese food culture here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think that when people say the
food is just better in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think people just quick to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, they think Japanese
food is better in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, every food is better in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me just tell you like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It just don't miss, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No matter where you go in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter where you go
in Japan, you don't miss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And even foreign foods, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Italian food has such
a unique flavor here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in a really good way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The way I see it is Italian food in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the way that New
York pizza is to pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a totally different take on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's still really good.
- It still works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it still works.
- It's really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like it's the same way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with a lot of the food
that they have here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so when people ask,
"Oh, can you get authentic?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It might not be authentic,
but who the fuck gives a shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's authentic? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If it tastes good, it's
amazing, who cares? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, we've recently found
an Indian curry restaurant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very authentic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's authentic and it was
also still really fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Destroyed my fucking stomach, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a proper Indian should. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The naan was perfect naan, amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I'm waking up the next day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not destroying my fucking toilet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not a proper Indian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a good curry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a proper Indian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna be doubting
it every single moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> til it's in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I'm like, I made the right decision. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, if I wake up in the morning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know if
it's a fart or a shart, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's how you know it's
a good curry, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's been that episode of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Hey, let's say
thank you to all the patrons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who help make this show come to life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will say if you ever do come to Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please get a hambagu, just so
you can finish this debate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Honestly, just
give anything a go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maylene pointed something
out to us before we end, unagi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unagi is god tier.
- Eel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god, oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Something we all agree on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Do we all agree on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, eat the unagi, eat the unagi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unagi is, you explain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unagi is like a boiled
eel and then it's grilled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in this beautiful sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know how to describe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they just serve it on the rice and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get me wrong, it's
very expensive, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it is worth the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a summer food and it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you eat it and you feel clean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you feel happy, but you're
getting that fillingness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you get from other stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so weird, 'cause eating Unagi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is in the middle of eating fish and meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't explain it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It feels like a fish, but
it is filling like a meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sits like a meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sits like a meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Eel sounds like something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think a lot of Westerners,
I know if you told me eel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, "I don't wanna eat eel." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it, it falls apart, it
doesn't taste fishy at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good and yeah,
okay, it's expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think when we went to one- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We went to a really fancy one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where you paid 60 bucks for one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I paid fucking 68 bucks for an eel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that's too much,
I know that's a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But my brain just turned off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't look at the price, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted the large one,
give me the large one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was two and a half eels
of this and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (moans)
- It was really fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this rush is so fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you come here during the summer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I highly recommend it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it is by far the
best summer food in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Easily.
- I don't think there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything close to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Winter food, a lot of
heavyweight contenders, bro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in the summer, I
think unagi's the king. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I agree.
- So in summation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you ever come to Japan,
apart from the usual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of ramen and sushi that
you're gonna try anyway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regardless of what we said- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can still get it in the winter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get unagi, you can never
go wrong with that; tsukemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need more people
in the cult of tsukemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to build this cult! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The cult of tsukemen! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sashimi, get sashimi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the only cult that
you'll thank me later for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, don't get curry, no
matter where you get curry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can get curry.
- Try it, try it, just try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you've never tried
curry before, try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japanese curry.
- Japanese curry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you've have tried Curry before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to me, it's gonna taste exactly
the same as everywhere else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Soba, try soba, some health noodles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Try soba. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Udon, just to confirm you don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bottom line, there's
way more to Japanese food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> than ramen and sushi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so much more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I guarantee everything you'll try here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is either gonna be some
kind of positive experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or just something life changing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, before we end it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna say that when you eat food here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you almost wanna cry because you just feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like someone cares. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You feel like someone really cared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I almost did cry when
I fucking ate tsukemen! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've already talked about that! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the food you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck man, someone really fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cared about the quality here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if that doesn't make you
tear up every single time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have a bite of food, I
don't know what will, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never thought I fucking
almost cry over fucking noodles, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but here I was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's the
same thing like fruit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They have that saying of the
reason why it's so expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because so much love is put into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You do really feel, I
know it's cheesy as fuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think it's dumb as
fuck when they say it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but when you eat that food, you do feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every single step of
the process, everyone cares. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For some reason it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a marketing ploy everywhere else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but in Japan, you actually
genuinely feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, yeah, it might be." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You feel the love. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you feel like it's pride. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so much pride in
every single piece of food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you eat and you can just taste it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And just honestly, when you
come here, go on Google Maps, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's over four stars,
it's gonna be amazing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guarantee it, just go
everywhere, trust me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they are fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> strict with their ratings.
- 'Cause when you compliment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the chefs, they actually appreciate that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the only place
where I've actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to be like do the
meme where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> can you call the chef over? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need to shake his hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something.
- I gotta shake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this mans' hand, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This man's done a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like if I ever
get the opportunity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thank the chef, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's everything
we wanted to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe the most
heated podcast we've ever had- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was about fucking meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was about meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember how this conversation started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with me being pescatarian? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This made the school days debate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like baby mode, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just feel like it should
never have been a debate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's just not even a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can start the debate
over in the comments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're gonna love looking through those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or you can do it on our
Twitter or subreddit, which is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as always, down in the description below. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So meme the fuck out of
our heated meat argument. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Will you beat our meat argument? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was awful, I feel bad for laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you for all the
Patreons, you are amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This guy is my favorite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you for 500K and all
the fucking milestones we hit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this has been "Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we'll see you guys later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's go smash a tsukemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (speakers talking over one another) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm ready to fucking cry again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (gentle electronic jingle) </SPEAKER_00>
