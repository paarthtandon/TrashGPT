<SPEAKER_01> just i just found it funny that uh after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all this time you actually go out your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way to watch anime again i think one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time i tweet about anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> joey has the first anime take in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what like six months and then uh what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was the take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remind me okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me let me bring you up to speed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right because this is a multi-layered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay okay this is like a multi-layered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> meme multimedia angles to cancel okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it started off the the layer first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> starts at the caisson episode right that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is of us recording it just went up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and yeah you know thankfully a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of people loved it it was a great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode right yeah but on one segment of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that show and there's a highlight clip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it uh is where we talk about the jews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of kaisen anime yeah i think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we were talking to caisson about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what anime she's watched recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weeks ago for us um and so i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after me finally having seen it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know a while back i was like oh i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you know i think this might be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect time right now since we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> already talking about the anime to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know kind of go into it a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about it right give our thoughts on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it how hot takes if you will yeah uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my hot take of dudes to kaisen was me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying i thought it was okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh and then followed by i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> preferred demon slayer yeah that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> show right and there's a [ __ ] high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> likelihood i mean you are a clown for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that opinion i gotta admit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i don't know a new season though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of tough right right maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah okay at the time of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> recording that was clown take but now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay maybe not i mean it was a clown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take those because it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because in the clip i'm pretty sure i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said something along the lines of jesus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kaisen had everything that you know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought i was going to like but for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason whatever it was i can't even give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a like a proper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> viable like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason for it to just say that for some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason it just didn't really click in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> head yeah never did i say that the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like mid or that the show was bad in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> any way i just said i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay yeah yeah twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ballistic over that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there were like a couple of how how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ballistic we talking i mean after a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> angry people or like i mean yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know twitter does what's what it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does best right it gets [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just overblows everything out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> proportion but like i even had a couple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of people tweeting at me like videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like small and youtubers being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> joe you're getting canceled and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh god what now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it for something i liked on twitter i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know and i went to look at it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like joey's hottest take on jews </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and kyson and on the thumbnail it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> says he thought it was okay and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh my god i can't even call a show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay anymore without being cancelled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] is this and then so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's layer one yeah okay okay layer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when i started watching demon slave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> season two recently right and i made a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tweet you know first tweet in six months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about anime where i say something along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the lines of uh i started watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season two of demon slayer happy to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zany is still the worst character in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all the zenitsu fans went ballistic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as they do of course they do as they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know calling your best boy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they stand up wearing those diapers yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then and then but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then some people took it back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know recent [ __ ] clip of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about jesus christ and saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that demons better than jesus christ and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had the audacity to be like oh now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's backpedaling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now he's backpedaling now he said he he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> hyped up demon slayer so much even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comparing it to jesus christ and saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was better than jesus christ and now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's saying that oh it's it's the demon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slayer is not a good show which i never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mind you i just said zany to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sucks because he does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right he does and it's like and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like if anything i'm [ __ ] enjoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season two right now season two has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great i feel season two's like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> brought back the hype for demon slayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for a long time yeah right i wasn't that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hype but season two is made yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely like the like the movie you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know as moon oh god is this going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another [ __ ] hot take as as okay as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thought the movie was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no okay okay i'll agree with you i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought the season two has blown the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> movie yeah out of the way you know i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say because like i recently just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finished my anime with the you know man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made of the year video i feel like anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> has gotten uh so much better now that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just saying something is okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is now detrimental to the anime right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's not even bad anymore yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like calling something mid is an insult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone calling something okay is an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> insult i feel like it's a copy pastor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now where everyone is like attack on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> titan is mid it's basically a copyright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right like everyone everyone that keeps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that exact phrase yeah not no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> elaboration no attack on titan is mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's such easy bait yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally fake but everyone does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the thing is i didn't even say jesus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and kaisen is okay for bait i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legitimately think it's just okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i really like jesus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and and that's fine right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were parts of jesus christ i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really enjoyed but i don't i personally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't enjoy it as much as other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or as i thought i was going to well do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you feel like saying something is okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or mid is even more of an insult than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying something is bad nowadays because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like maybe i i feel like i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like at least in like discussing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows or anime or whatever or manga i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like you you don't see as many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people just saying something is straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up bad anymore right people just say oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's mid it's just mid yes okay look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i get the word mid mid is insulting yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he's admitted so little effort to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> articulate how you feel about a show you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can't even you can't even like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get the energy to even describe what you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't like about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like the the word average when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about a show there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a a contention between like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay being like you know taking more in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a positive way yeah and then mid being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taken in like a negative way right but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they both mean the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> technically speaking mid is just short </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah neither good or bad just okay right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like i feel now people take the word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay and put like a negative spin on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like if uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's say uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you had a wedding right yeah and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like mom did you like the wedding she's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would be annoyed i would be like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you mean my wedding was just uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invited you i put on a spread right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel okay but i feel it's free but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel but i feel it's kind of on you to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> compare your own wedding to jesus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how strongly i feel how about my best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> friend okay yeah i was like how did we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get from jiu-jitsu guys into a wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm just thinking like let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just say you are you you put your heart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and soul out of the sub that you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna go to sydney today and be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney i know we're getting married this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year but like justin tyson right i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's kind of it's kind of more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> important </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i pulled my heart into jiu-jitsu i said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> more than i did the wedding i hope so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know there's someone out there that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would say that i hope somebody asked me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how was god's wedding because i know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know what i'm going to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i already know what i'm going to say i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prefer jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know just uh so so my uh my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> advice to all of you who perhaps want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> share your opinion about anime don't use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the word okay from now on it can get you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> canceled no it's just because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because of who we are right it's cause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like now we we have this little show we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do this little thing this little show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> show you know and uh it's all it's i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think there's a lot more eyes on us yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> want to want to get angry uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know because a lot of the times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people are getting annoyed at this stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't the people who like actually like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch trash taste yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of trash taste maybe have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some followers who've watched trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> taste maybe say some of the clips or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever and they're like you won't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> believe what they these these guys who i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't already watch or engage with said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't know how we we behave or how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we like go towards the topic or how we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tackle it it's just like he just said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this thing i disagree with it i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get angry what's what's like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird especially about my jewish kaisen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hot take hot take is the fact that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> called usually kyson okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> months ago on my own channel yeah no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] batted a knife </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's weird because like i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've got to that point now where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh like not super small twitter accounts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but some twitter accounts with some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> decent followings will be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this clown take on trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also kind of cool i'm like oh that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> awesome that people feel like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're big like we're big enough where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they can just openly like criticize us i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mean yeah like go ahead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is it is humbling to think that my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> offhand comment about an anime has like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stirred up this much controversy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of cool but at the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like can you not cancel me for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that a show is okay i could at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> least sleep over here if someone gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sleeping over and i just think it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> little like you know i'm glad i you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back four or five years ago if i'd said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the same [ __ ] no no one would give up oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i think like i'm glad that people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> care sometimes it's annoying it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> little too much i love it thank you for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> caring about my dumb opinion about a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show i don't care about joe's opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't even care about my opinion i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just said it well i i think the argument </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you know we are you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creators who have a platform and an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> influence i mean that's why they call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like us influencers right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i mean i'm i have the i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that evil voice going for me so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like it works yeah someone calls me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> an influencer yeah it's just like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing i don't like about that word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it can apply to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so many things you know like a cult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leader is technically an influencer as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well those are the influences yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're the og influencers right like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if i want to be bunched up in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> those games i'm kidding by the way i i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like the word i like to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i make something that's somewhat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> entertaining and good yeah i'm just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dude on the internet no no yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm with a bunch of hot days yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i mean i i feel like you know i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get it to a certain extent where we do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to you know be careful about some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the stuff we say right because we you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know there are some topics that i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we do have to like navigate it's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know very careful of course because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are other creators out there who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do have a platform and uh their word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they say [ __ ] and uh their words have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tangible effect on the real world and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the community they talk to but at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there there are some things that i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like i it blows my mind that people care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this much about right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know like one of one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest things that i don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is you know people take this people will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people will take this you know one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minute two minute clip from trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or from one of our streams because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened to me a bunch of times right uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i will see this clip being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> circulated where it's like a one or two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minute clip from the podcast on my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stream that's like not scripted it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just in a conversation that's most of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the time doesn't even have anything to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do with the take that i'm saying in that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one clip because it's like one or two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes yeah yeah yeah and they will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take this clip and then spin it to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a whole new level of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you've planned it all out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like it's a [ __ ] mastermind move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and like and like i think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this in context right and i'm thinking i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think people who watch our show or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people who are super fans of the show is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to be influenced by a one minute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clip of us talking about this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subject right that most of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't even have to do with the overall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation it's just like it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time just like an offhand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comment or something yeah i don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's gonna [ __ ] influence anybody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like on that on that segment where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joe you you spoke about jesus christ and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like no you're you're a clown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's good you know how if you're a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> viewer it's like how can you argue that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're being influenced to be like juju </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kaisen is mitt or okay because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's an active argument going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're saying no it's it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're wrong so like what do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well right you take away from that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not oh i'm going to think to carson's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mid even if you're like a super fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's so stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i think i like about you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know those kinds of discussions on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> show especially when like you know to to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or all of us are like arguing against </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> each other right is that like it gives </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many different points of views where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's up to the viewers now who you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to agree with right and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not so much it's not so much me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying hey because i think jesus christ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is okay you should also think that way i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean if you want to think that way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's on you right but it's not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm coming out here you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> starting a demo of being like everybody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stand up and rise jesus christ is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i just don't get it like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's fine to be influenced by certain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things but at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a sharp well i think it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> good problem to have in our job of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> course of course people would uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spend a lot lot many years trying to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the point where we're very fortunate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you know people watch trash tanks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and people care i feel very lucky that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people want to get angry about small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> things like jokes yeah that's fine is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it you know is it a contention for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cancellation though i'm not sure about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know it goes back to like online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hate day as well i mean i've gone to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point now where it doesn't really bother </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> me that much at all really it's got it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting i don't i think this is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i've been online for so long now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where now i'm just kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> at equilibrium with it i'm like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah it's it's i wouldn't even say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because like i'm okay with it now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or i'm like numb to it i guess it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i think jessica negri said it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh she said when someone asked her about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like how do you deal with like internet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hate yeah like how do you get over it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and she said like you never get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> over it it still hurts but you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> learn to live with it like to to me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me because we have talked about this a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> few times but to me like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without getting to like the online hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing the thing that like the one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that annoys me then just people actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually just like hating on me and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hating on my content for example is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when when people are like trying to put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> words in my mouth yeah to be like to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gant said this or god said this and that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> means x you know or that means x y z and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that that to me there's nothing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wants to make me reply more than people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are spreading this idea that i you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know maybe others </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it is right it is it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because at that point like it's i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seen some like instances where like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i say one thing right and then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like spirals out into this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insane story about like how i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> killed a child or some [ __ ] right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that level of like how did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take this one little piece of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> information and spin it in a way that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just couldn't be further from the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trip like you're basically writing a fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fiction at that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like it's like what and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are people who look at that and be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah that's that sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something he'd say i'm like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i've been thinking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i swear to god i don't know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like i i don't know if the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> community was always like this because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like to me there are there are some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are some topics that i always like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to love arguing about you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i felt like to me you know there are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some things where you really have to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> careful about what you say in terms like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> religion politics and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that's the reason why we never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about that we've spoken about a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little bit yeah yeah yeah and uh we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never actually try and avoid it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you just want to have like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun argument on someone where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you can just [ __ ] on your opinion and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have to worry about about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know that at the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day the topic doesn't really matter that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much right and to me like as as an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fan anime was always one of those topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me until like quite recently and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if that's just my perception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like another topic i would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is you can easily argue with anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about is food everyone loves arguing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about food we do it all the [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's fun and it's fun because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people understand that people have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different tastes and opinions right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me like anime was always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that same level as i can easily argue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about anyone with anime and not have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> worry about you know hurting their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feelings too much because i i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> assume we all everyone in our community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like an understanding that dude you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can have your own taste you can have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your own it's mutual agreement that at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of the day even if this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> random internet person doesn't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that your favorite show is as good as it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it's like well that's not going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> deter me from the fact that i still like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the show it's just changed just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the scale of trash taste right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know there's nothing like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back in the day you know back in podtaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what was the like average viewer count </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i think our most viewed podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever was like 100k </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which you know back then was crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy yeah you know obviously the scale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is completely different now yeah anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has also been somewhat more democratized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in a way like democratized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah definitely more it's more available </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to more eyes it's a lot easier to get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hold of yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know and discourse about it is way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more open and people are way more open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk about it so i think that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's some of the reasons why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so the problem is it's getting popular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well essentially i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you could almost say it's becoming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mainstream insider because i i was i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always had this like image that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the anime community felt like it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about like 10 5 10 years behind what we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saw with the gaming community right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it felt like maybe gaming the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gaming industry also had this shift </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where games used to be just this fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things you numb your numb your brain out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to didn't really matter that much you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you could just have your fun with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and then now games mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> games are a big business </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's the same yeah i know that some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people gave zelda breath the while like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a seven out of ten when it came out and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they got controversy for that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because they didn't give it a nine or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> ten or something so basically they got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> canceled for saying breath of the wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've had the same thing it's the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing again isn't it incredible how one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> word can completely change everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's such a huge difference in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like insinuation between calling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something good and calling something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just good it could be the attitude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towards it as well you know sometimes i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i can understand sometimes the way you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about anime could definitely like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're so like you're like yeah it's mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i can understand why why you piss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people off because you sound like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> won't even entertain the conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like i [ __ ] hate the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you even brought this up to me it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mid stop talking to me about it so i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand why sometimes people can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyed by that yeah because they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i wish joey just even listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me it's like me trying to get approval </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from my parents it's like i wish my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents just gave it a chance it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no it's like you're like [ __ ] you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's mid you know i think maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what annoys people i yeah and and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> look i can completely get that as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and that is my bad to be fair but at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> same time it's like you know sometimes i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't even bother engaging in these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> conversations because i already know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to end i i i i get you i get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you because it's just it's just happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many times that i've done this for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> almost nine years yeah i know how a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation like this is gonna end i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i've known you for ages so yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could say i know how you are with these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> conversations yeah i could say i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give out all these like well thought out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> constructed arguments about why i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the show was okay and people will be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like but but but but but but i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> agree with that and i'm like oh my gosh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what more can i say so what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying is if trash day started six years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ago you might have got more enthusiastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> debate oh yeah dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this would actually be an anime podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no no no i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know going back to the hate thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's uh because you always get asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right by new creators or something or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone uh how do you deal with online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hey what's what's the advice that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give someone because i've been i've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mulling this over a lot recently because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think my opinion on it has changed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quite a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since the last time we talked about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think so i think i had this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective shift uh recently and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know why um but i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i the whole thing of uh living with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff is totally valid advice and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's also good but i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what happened but now i look at it and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really care at all when i see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because to me in my head i they're never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> angry at like me as a individual person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i read that it's like they're angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at like what they think is me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right they're not angry at if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sat with me and spoke with me they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably wouldn't feel that way right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah but they angry at the idea of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me and and more often than not it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were never going to give me a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chance anyway because i'm just i must be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a personality they don't like yeah see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like i feel that way of thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about things is only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was has only been constructed because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you've been doing this for so long yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely and like i don't think there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are very very few people who can come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right into this industry from the jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and have this like enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> self-confidence in themselves and their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> content and their self-image on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> internet to be like well that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about me that's just about their image </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me right and i feel like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when i started off like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't have that kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> confidence right now sure a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people didn't where you know so like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like the moment your name gets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mentioned in something and even if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> not exactly the most like detrimental </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thing you know jab at your personality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think people just not used to this and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having this like random amount of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming up to you and being like by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way your kind of [ __ ] you know is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that we're not really used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because the human wasn't involved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how many people just walk down the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> street and have a random person be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> excuse me you're [ __ ] like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't happen right but on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> internet that's normal and i think new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> york yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that said like people on the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have internet have gotten way too used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to saying things not getting punched in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the face for it yeah they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely there's no repercussions so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like you know they they just think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's just free range to say the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was about to say like you know and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes in a sense it is kind of free range </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to say whatever you want but you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the repercussions you know like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can say whatever you want as long as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're willing to pay for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> repercussions if they come back to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right and they're very well might you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah because like i actually had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like train my mom up for this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recently because she she's not getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hate but sometimes she goes through like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> what you're going through everyone who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a content creator goes through this at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the beginning but you just gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> understand that people are gonna get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just gonna stay stuff and actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't be more the opposite of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my parents would be like oh you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> just waiting for the day where i wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on twitter one day and then i wake up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a screenshot that's been spread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> viral about my mum replying to like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my haters comments be like yo have </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> comments from your mom i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah definitely i think that'd be good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we should have a segment we read out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your mum's required comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have your parents ever like look through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your comments or look through your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> videos to see what people are saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about you i think so i think my mom one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> time was like really sad about it she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like why are they saying mean things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's on this one thing about you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right she's like don't worry about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a big deal she's like it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cute though yeah she was way more upset </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it than i was yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't give a [ __ ] you know uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously because it's not normal to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> people bad-mouth your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> son yeah of course it's not a normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thing you get to experience yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> quite a visceral emotion i mean i i'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lying if i said if if my kid was in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situation i wouldn't do the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right oh yeah i'd probably want to punch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> punch someone yeah i'd be like don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> worry you made my kids they're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dicks yeah yeah like honestly i i kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of get it i'm the same i guess because i </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> because it's better to rent to another </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> right i got a i got a question have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys ever like tried to explain when </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> someone who just does not understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube and it's just really involved oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it doesn't work </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> credit they tried their hardest to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand what's going on but like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i remember i had to like pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> early on in my career when like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was getting that like you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> first initial wave of like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're you're you're notable enough in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the community now where people outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of your community will find you yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> corpse party was made something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you know when you when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first start to get that first wave and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like oh [ __ ] i don't know who to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about i don't know i'm getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cancelled blah blah blah even though it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like barely nothing right i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was talking to one of my schoolmates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it being like yeah so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these bunch of people like coming into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my you know comment section saying that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i suck and blah blah blah i remember one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of them was just straight up like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell them the [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not an option unfortunately when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's with one of me and uh many others </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know who i'm up against not not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really that easy is it yeah because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really was that easy if if only because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i remember like every time i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tried to explain something that's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on in this in like the youtube's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> field some controversy you're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay so um this person said this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it piss is pissing a bunch of people off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like holy [ __ ] twitter is getting angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you talk to the person they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh why why people getting angry and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um i said this anime was bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this person said this anime was bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and these group of people got pissed off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it and then they go so why they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pissed why why were they pissed off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it and then you keep going layers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and layers deep until you get to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you they just forget what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> original like people are getting angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for now or to the point where you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more arguments come through and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more layers down it goes you just start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to realize wait it's not a problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no problem to begin with i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just making it yeah i mean like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember back in the day where drama </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> could be addressed with like one just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one short twit longer and now it's got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a point where you need like a four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour breakdown to like to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understand like the full depth of some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this drama and i like i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when that shift happened when it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just like okay now now you need a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] thesis like it's a full-on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dissertation to like to like break down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the like a play-by-play of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire month leading up to this one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tweet except instead of one professor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like marking it down it's the entirety </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the internet being like but did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> use correct citations for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no marx do we have the receipts do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have the receipts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's uh it's it's crazy it's crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how especially that side of this the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> internet has evolved especially like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i think drama culture is kind of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing now where oh it's definitely well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i see some content creators who you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know start off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start off doing their own thing and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know how or why but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of a lot of people i've seen have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just slowly shifted into just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drama channels you know maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intentionally maybe not intentionally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it seems like every other upload </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seems to be talking about some kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> drama or some kind of consciousness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very good for business though oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of those things where if you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> drama that isn't really drama like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something you you let's say yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you said you have a bad take on anime or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something right those kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drama are just generally just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's no real downside because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody nobody who actually watches you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gives a [ __ ] that you said a show is bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i you know like when i said 86 i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 86 right there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mad about that yeah but i doubt there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was many people who are like i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch trash taste or connor ever again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he said my favorite show is bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right but maybe other people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like maybe some people who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching you or some people outside of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it see this drama and think this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really [ __ ] stupid uh i might go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> check them out or i'm more familiar with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their name through this drama because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because drama has a really good way of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like a click on a drama video is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like much more engaging than a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> class oh yeah so when you get like a a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> million views on a drama video yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> million views on that drama video and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe that's a generic gaming video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not equal like the drama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> engagement and how much people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invested is so much more yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if it's something that paints </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you in a good light or paints you in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way that makes it look like you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really do anything yeah then it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's great for you because that now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just gonna get people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more invested in you people who think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've been done wrong and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're gonna support you more yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when these people do this [ __ ] and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try and drag you in the drama this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of big twitch streamers get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this kind of drama very often because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is really good for solid solidifying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your bass viewership they they want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> support you they will they will help you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then people who see it and think oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they weren't really in the wrong they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might come and check you out and feel a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit more strongly about you because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to support you because they feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is some [ __ ] that was done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you i feel like drama videos like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in like multiple successions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right on the same drama like every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's almost like the world's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> most engaging let's play yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in a sense where it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're more likely if you're really into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a drama video you're more likely to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> come back to that part than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i think it's just the modern day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reality tv show oh definitely because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like here's the thing do you think do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you think people actually care about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drama do you think people like no only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like you know clearly like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a wrong person who did a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing right but like like 90 percent of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube drama is not yeah i think there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is a there will be a core audience that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does feel betrayed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but i think the majority people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there just for the popcorn yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i remember like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> recent drama i can remember happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the top of my head right now uh is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that involved pokemane and ninja </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right oh yeah and like obviously that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> got like a lot of views um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of views when it came out and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of people were discussing it but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like my first initial reaction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to hearing about this drama that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay what the [ __ ] happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so hard as a content creator i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like trying to like [ __ ] piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> together who was mad at who who did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong to who how did it lead to this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> situation and they were like like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took philly d five minutes to explain it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's a lot for philly d </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like i'm just like one minute russia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is invading one minute for that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes of pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like that i was like oh my god it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the majority of the video it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was crazy like i had i had like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easier time understanding some of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the world situation going on right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the world politics then then then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how this drama started and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> evolution of this drama it was like so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surreal like trying to trying to figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out why like what was going on right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if me as a content creator who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knows the content creators within this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drama was like having trouble figuring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out because i wasn't there right at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beginning yeah i can't imagine how a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> general audience feels you know where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just feats where like it seems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like people are just seeing people talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about this on their timeline and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't even like they don't even know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that you get to a point where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of are waiting for someone to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you who you should be angry at right or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who who's in the wrong and that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is that i feel 90 of drama is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not so much about like trying to uncover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the details and you know like gathering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the receipts and doing like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> criminal investigation into who started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and who's the culprit who's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> victim it's literally just you see a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> piece of drama like the pokemon in ninja </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one right yeah and 90 of the audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so who am i rooting for yeah give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me give me two people to root for give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> me two people to fight for all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's ninja and pokeman all right uh well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like that person better just from the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing i've heard about them so i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just root for them yeah because that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not always the case but yeah a lot of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is like that though you have to admit a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of it's like that it's basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially if you're not in that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> community or don't give a [ __ ] about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that community yeah you know like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know like if a bunch of like you know uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fashion youtubers right get into some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drama right like that's what they want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though yeah but that's what they write </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right but like i'm not going to care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the details all i'm going to care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about is okay so who are the two people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in question yeah and what is the general </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> consensus on these two people who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting right like that's all it is to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> me like other than that i don't give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] personally yeah yeah i i don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know even though it's good for business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think a lot of these uh twitch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> streamers try to get into this stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some of them some of them maybe do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i know that i don't try to but i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh brash uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with my words and also not very good at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming like explaining my arguments on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the spot as we all know from trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah sign up getting into these things a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of people aren't good at explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> their arguments on the spot which i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think is where the problem stems from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you know i i would like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think that we're all like very well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spoken and you know on the ball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when i want to be yeah you can be you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can be but like it's hard it's hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you have so many hours of content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around yourself just talking and just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not just trash taste but twitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streamers as well and especially with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch streamers where they are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on camera live in an audience like eight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hours a day plus you know there's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be a time where someone where you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not as careful with your words where you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slip up a bit and that's just going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happen you know it's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's it it would happen to anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in the same situation you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you know something that uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twitch streaming is uh made me feel a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot more i feel like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> again going back to the hate stuff as </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> we're very fortunate that uh you know on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube it's hard to have uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not hard but it can be quite difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to be friends have a good friendship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with other youtubers for a long period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of time because of the nature of the job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely they're just uh you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things change people get busy people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> move people get on with their life do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different content fall off ratio all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of stuff you know like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work so you know very very lucky there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were some good friends and we've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friends for very long time we all happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to kind of be around the same kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sphere and do the same thing same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it all kind of worked out very lucky and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i think yeah that's like another thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well is that like i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like if we're going back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] helpful advice for like people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting off right like another one that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i get often as well is that like oh what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do i do about like collabing and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know because like you know i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like the easiest way to grow out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your channel from an early stage and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yes in a sense if you do it right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you shouldn't be like a channel with 200 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subs and [ __ ] dming felix to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> collab with you right like that's you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you got to know your boundaries and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that and also like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piece of advice that i saw uh on twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other day which i thought was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true was that um you know i think a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like youtubers have this like weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> especially those starting off have this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like weird misunderstanding that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think everyone who collabs with them is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> also a friend of theirs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that is just unfortunately not true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people who just see it as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> business who just want to do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one-time thing or just to do this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to benefit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> themselves but also you know the person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're collabing with yeah and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's almost unhealthy to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a person who you collab with as just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your mate yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a very big difference between a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> collaborator and an actual friend yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think like once you've like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fully started to understand that at an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> early stage and really gone and thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to yourself okay who is actually my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like someone who will hang out with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the cameras are not rolling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and who is someone that is just there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the clout do you have a hard time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drawing that line like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've done this for long enough now i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i know just like being an adult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right you just kind of god forbid i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be an adult uh you know you kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn just uh you you know you vibe with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people sometimes you don't vibe with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people sometimes someone is really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you really love what they make and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how they go about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and sometimes you hang out with them and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just didn't it didn't click you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's kind of weird the conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a little like oh okay and other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> times it's like holy [ __ ] like i i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on so well with this person but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe you feel that way and they don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is then this is an experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing we have to learn all right okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if i really like that person i like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out with them i want to talk to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> them again it's like all right you got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like normal about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> let's hang out next day let's do it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah yeah yeah yeah i spaced it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know how we got to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that uh i don't know how we became super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> close but i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember there was definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a time when i was like yeah these guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are cool but i don't want to like burden </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't want to like text them too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember like when i met gom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't really talk in between hanging </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out it was kind of like we'd hang out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it was like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thing i don't really know i mean you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sent me a [ __ ] email </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know how that worked i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have put that right in the trash yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i i'm the type of guy who really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> connects with someone hanging out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i'm saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like personally or physically you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i i need to touch your face you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> should lick your sweat suck your gadgets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're a jojo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't know what you were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was sexually harassing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are not a friend of mine until i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> suck your dick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god is harvey wyatt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i i was i was i was going to mention i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the type of guy who might not talk so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> much like online or wrong no no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like joking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> does not sexually harass people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> why it was just like like visual like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whiplash for me because i was trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make this poignant point and kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just goes god sucks dick he's like sweat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what did i say what did i say confirm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a weird time at the onsen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty sure i was told that's how you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i remember we you know we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't message too much but we had a fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time hanging out whenever we did hang </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out in person and uh we just ended up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hanging more times in person and i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just happened naturally right but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean yeah going off going from what you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said about you know being friends versus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collaborators i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like even me as someone who doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collab too much i mean i barely clap at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all um but even me as a content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can already i you know there are some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content creators who you enjoy their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content and you really respect the work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they do but you know there are some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people that you just think yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably wouldn't get along with you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i love the work you do but i probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would not get along with you and on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> opposite end there are also other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who you don't like their content but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like maybe i can get along with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely seems seems like it seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a chill dude or something yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely and you know it's that whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing of like separating the artist from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the odd right which is you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> way easier said than done in a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cases yeah it's just tough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i also it just feels like it's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so long since i've been able to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meet a lot of new content creators who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've watched because of the past two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years you know because we've only been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> able to meet people in japan right and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like now normally like you get you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get a point every year where you get to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this opportunity to fly out to america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or fly out to somewhere to conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and actually meet fellow content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> creators and i just feel like i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgotten what i've forgotten what that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels like now yeah i've forgotten what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels like just to like just to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like first people just just have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the first awkward meeting of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh hey i i watch your stuff yeah i like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what you do you know i mean like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like thanks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i miss just getting to speak english to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i just want to speak english to someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> do you remember the first time you met </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> someone online who you knew online but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd never like met in real life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you remember what that feeling's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's always like i i know like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of the biggest things i first notice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always height always hype oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they are never the height you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expect them to be oh yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's that's true on my end as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well because every time someone meets me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the fir that's the first comment every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time it's either height or depending on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're a content creator who shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their face or not it's also like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they look as well yeah i definitely got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that when uh when i first met john super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eye patchwolf because you know he's in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost all his videos he never shows his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> face yeah so for the longest time people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know what he looked like yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you know obviously when he first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blew up everyone was like all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> antitubers were like this guy's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> content's [ __ ] amazing it's great i </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> might be super impactful right but you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know who right because you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> never seen his face yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you meet him finally </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> goddamn time and i'm like i never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thought that would be a weird thing yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you ever meet up with people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> online often like before youtube was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything you ever used to do no not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i feel like i got into i made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> online friends because of youtube yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same yeah and like not not the other way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around um so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're now with more especially during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the pandemic with more people making </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> friends online i'm sure a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people are going to be experiencing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience but yeah but like yeah it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like an alien experience to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first times the first time i did and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's still it's still weird you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never i never get used to meeting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone who i know online and maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially if they're like a content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creator you know and it feels so weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now because i'm a content creator and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've been on the other side of it and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> still like sometimes i just don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to approach someone who i whoms i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's it's so weird it's like it's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling of meeting that content creator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you've only seen in video yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and and the first thing that pops into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your mind is i've only ever seen you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> behind a screen like like that mentality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> never dies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so weird even though i'm also in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that same position now to that other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> person it's so weird to say with the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of my first thoughts is oh that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the back of their head looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know why why is that because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just not an angle you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ever seen so it's just it's just weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just so surreal seeing like just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just this angle i'm just like is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that person and she's like oh wait no it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that person oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of get one remember this uh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> should remember this really painful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cringe thing i did right right i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> group of people like maybe like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh content creators influencers whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna call yeah uh that i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really know but there's one person who i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saw them and i was like oh i i know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person i spoke to them in the uk so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> went over to go say hi right and i was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> you think yourself i didn't do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video i didn't do that video my favorite </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> if we're like having more than a five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minute conversation </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> slayer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if i should be an offender </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i remember i remember like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember having this one conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once with a fan you know sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get into like pretty intense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation with fans about some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your videos or something when you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you get when you have the time to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i remember this one fan at like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it was like ax or one of the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> conventions and we got we got into this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation about bleach right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and at this point i've said my takes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about bleach a lot whether on my videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my first video was a bleach video in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other videos and um and podcasts or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turkeys just okay huh did you say it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just okay i mean i i uh i've i've i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not gonna i'm not gonna open that box of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> worms right now but like i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of worms i'm not gonna open that kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worms right now but remember we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having this like this [ __ ] intense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation about bleach and he kept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying things like i remember when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said this about the mundo arc and uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this about tte kubo like like can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you like expand that because like i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't agree with this and we all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having this full debate about this right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and i remember thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't remember saying this about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bleach but i might have said that about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bleach so i'm just going to entertain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea right right of this argument </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like of this debate that he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having about me and so we go into this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 minute [ __ ] debate about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bleach right and then at the end i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yeah i finally understand your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fall of bleach video now and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was john's video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and at that point i just i just i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even have the heart to tell him because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like we've been talking about a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video that i didn't make for 10 [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and having a fun debate about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did he not realize that your voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and john's voice is like completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> different i how did i not realize that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was talking about a video that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't make because the thing is i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talked so much [ __ ] about bleach now i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like that sounds like something i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might have said i've talked a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things about police i might have said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that if it wasn't it wasn't you arguing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> europeans it was you agreeing with john </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i was arguing john's opinion without me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> step aside john i got this i got your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bag bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i hope john appreciate it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no i've only showed that guy a lesson i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did i did uh john i'm fighting the good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fight john i'm fighting the [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fight he's got his boxing gloves on for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you man like he's fighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god it's also that thing where like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have said so much stuff in my years of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being online yeah that i have forgotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a good chunk of any jokes or anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i've made and i've had those awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moments where someone will make a uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll reference a video of mine yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> from like five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four years ago and i'll be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what did you say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like i said they said the thing and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no the worst is when they ask you to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> being like i love this video that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made can you say that one line and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i know i say it uh no but it's when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't remember what they're talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about when it's like a video from like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from a let's play from like six years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ago it's like say that one thing you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> said in corpse party episode 42 and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remind me how it goes again that's oddly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> specific why would someone ask you that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've had that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last year i mean i've made over a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousand videos earlier i don't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every single one i made yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotten like it's been extrapolated even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] more with trash taste now oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well i will get comments or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll get like people i'm so excited to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have people bring up my opinion that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> totally forgot because i've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversations with people i've met here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um who obviously watched trash taste and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like i'm like remember and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they say to me remember when you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this and i'm just like did i say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean that kind of sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something i said uh i don't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i said it but uh like like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bleach video i'm just going to assume </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're right and i did say that so </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> because you guys were [ __ ] laughing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at me because they called me sebastian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because it was it was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment of like we all turned around and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we were like oh i wonder which the bat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> connor's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like in the period where i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying my goddamn hardest to get away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from this like a reminder i mean yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't care if someone did it you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> call me sebastian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't give a [ __ ] i think for me the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it happened early on where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of course people at first were calling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me anime man or whatever but like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think i from really early on because too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> many people were getting my usernames </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong yeah and also the fact that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't like my username what were they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> calling you then if it was wrong oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was anime guy anime dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not that hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like every time i hang out like i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> next to joey i swear he would get like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime man maybe only like seventy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> percent of the time if that there's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many variations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but there but there were people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would like get my actual name wrong as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well like i've been called john i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been called the one that the one that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't [ __ ] believe and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remembered to this day was adorable taco </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thon some dude legit came up to me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> said hey josh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like 100 confidence 100 confidence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like respect to that guy i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i couldn't even like be you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't be like it's it's joey because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was actually just dumbfounded i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you did not just [ __ ] call me that do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you not like josh do you have a vendetta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> against strong oh nothing against josh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've got mates called josh but i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> josh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why did the name josh specifically annoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you more than john </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's because there's only ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been that one guy who called me josh </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> a different derivative of the word man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because it's a pretty you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a pretty generic name right the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime is pretty [ __ ] easy well i i'd </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> i've gotten my like people have gotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my name like my my my internet handle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like wrong almost as much times if </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> in terms of but like i i honestly think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like in terms of like the actual like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vibe of the con and stuff like that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't really see it as that much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different to like a us con or any other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like english speaking convention because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like everyone can't experience yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just yeah yeah i mean not actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cut switches yeah not actually we're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like so we're not throwing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> as that much more different to like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standard like american con i guess like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the people i feel just like weebs in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> general or like anime fans in general </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> didn't really have at least not a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> people didn't really have problems you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> you know every now and then you will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> meet those like very stereotypical loud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> aussies who you know are just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah you know like that's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> level right but that's good that sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds like a laugh yeah i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though those kinds of people you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't really find in a lot of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime cons you'll you'll see them at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pub right but you know i very rarely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have i seen an anime fan dude it's my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> convention do you love going to the pub </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after that it's close yeah you just yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like kirito </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> downing like a stella you're like what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on i don't remember this part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like you know chicken like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arsenal cosplay is like doing a shoei </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like that people who like to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't unfortunately see that but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wish i did do a lot of people get drunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at aussie conventions because that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> big thing about british conventions way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more than like so much it is like it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like all they do it's it's more than the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actual convention itself it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are just like oh there's anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> here cool let's get a [ __ ] pint i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's hard to say at least in sydney i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think it's would be as much as in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk just because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like drinking or eating out in sydney is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] expensive like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a pint of beer is like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ten dollars australian and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of like places in sydney right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the city um ten aussie dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or yeah like ten real dollars ten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dollars ten dollars for real currency </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah ten dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so you know and i think to like a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kids who come to these conventions you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know like ten dollars is a lot of money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like that's cool that's ten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dollars you can spend on anime emoji at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the corner yeah of course um so i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see as many drunk people as i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was gonna be yeah but a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents were getting drunk that's for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know they were like hey they've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a hard day yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an hour to get into the city and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like all right kids have fun at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> your japanese convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> daddy and i are gonna go over to the pub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and get shit-faced while we wait for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so like i'm taking care of the kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like in between like signings and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff you know i'd take a step outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know you look over at the like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the terrace of some of these like pubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like on the water and you know there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just a lot of parents clearly just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for their kids just being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> another people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly i'd probably do the same uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i have kids you know yeah like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i'm like an only child so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never had this experience but i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like sydney talking about it all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time where you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your parents would just take you to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> events and then you would just give all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the responsibility to the older sibling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to take care of the [ __ ] taking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the younger siblings and just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's a bunch of money [ __ ] off have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun you know yeah i definitely have that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i can't remember really maybe i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was a little [ __ ] so yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i think i've very rarely had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> experiences like that because i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like me and my sister didn't really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> share a lot of like the same like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interests when it like when we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> growing up i feel like as adults now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like starting to like share more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the same likes on things but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't really like remember going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like a lot of events with my sister </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we maybe went to like a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> concerts but did your parents ever take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you to an event that you just didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> want to [ __ ] go to but you had to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to because your parents were going oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> football matches my dad used to drag me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in football matches he's going to love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this bit now he's like i didn't drag you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanted to go no he would bribe me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with chocolate he would he would be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll get i'll buy you a like a galaxy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bar which is like this is chocolate in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the uk not like the small bars yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the this sized block one you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got some serious chocolate mileage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here he's like i'll buy it for you and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then i had to then this is the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my dad will laugh at this is that when i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like eight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he would take me to like the pub before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right right where where it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally like it's like a football club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah it's cheap it's dirty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's absolutely rammed it stinks it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like everyone is eating like pork </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scratchings and downing like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheap pints i actually remember just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sitting there just like not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understanding anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> although that they would just ask me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes stuff about football and i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wayne rooney yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she remember i never understood anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and uh one time i went to a match </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> with like everton family and stuff and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember they'd won because i was there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my dad was like convinced that i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the good luck charm yeah that's why we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> won so i got dragged to more even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i told them i hate it i do not want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go i i absolutely despise this because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just stand there i mean it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cold and it was so loud and i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to play my game boy yeah and i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> sell those like stupidly long hot dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at these football events yeah i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one time i i had one and uh my dad let </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me like just hold on to it for like two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seconds and someone bumped into me and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dropped it all right and then i just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was just so mortified and i remember i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think that ruined football for me right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't even need a whole 20 videos this </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah but i was like eight i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> articulate all i remember was i was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really sad that i dropped this hot dog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right and you couldn't buy a new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one because it worked so my dad had just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> given me like enough money to buy it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like i couldn't you know i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know he'd like let me have it and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh my god no and then all the other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> food was like oh it's really there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like steak and kidney pies yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like this thing called pucker pies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the uk that's so bad they're really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really bad right but no i remember i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember that like yeah i sort of liked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it but just remember being like totally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> confused and not really understanding it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and i never really liked football yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my brothers did though they liked going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh and my older brother liked it a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i just never liked it and i felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i was a failure to my dad because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like i just want you to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sports why can't you like sports why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't you be a normal person and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sports i'm like the only kid in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that didn't like football i was like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember like because my my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> were like really into like looking at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> property right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and for the longest time i was like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna are we gonna move house like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i would get excited i'm like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no it's like no we're just looking what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we're literally window shopping houses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like yeah and i was like two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or two like a 10 year old i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] is like the most privileged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> non-privileged thing i've ever heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> well because it's like you know because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad is like you know heavily into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like stocks and like investing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's an investor i'm watching i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching a home in the sun because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> an investment yeah he was an investor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and also like my parents used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go a lot as well so that they could get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inspirations for like interior design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that because you know my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad loved doing like renovations into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the house and stuff so he would get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of like good ideas from that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes more sense um yeah but like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a 10 year old i don't know what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like all that [ __ ] is right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you would think if your parents came up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to you and said son we're gonna go check </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> out some houses today the first thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would think of as a ten-year-old is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yay we're moving right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my sister who's like three years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> younger than me was like oh we're moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> house that's so exciting yay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> naturally for the first couple of times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we'd go along with them right yeah until </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we're not moving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we're just looking at we're him looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at them i have a question actually this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just came out you can't answer it rip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately it's about brothers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know obviously let's say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's two two siblings or three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> siblings in my house how was it decided </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who gets which bedroom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in your house that's a good question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well did you ever ask battle royale </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> squid game because i squid game i am the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> middle son </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and i got the tiniest room oh okay right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well i think for us we got lucky because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the house that i grew up in or i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> born in was like bought just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the same time as they got that house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i basically got first dibs right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my sister wasn't born yet oh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got to choose i wasn't well i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i wasn't like a three-year-old being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like father this room is a little larger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than the other one well you know what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> funny that's exactly what my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] did really they asked me when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like two or whatever which room i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted when you were two i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to at an age where i can i cannot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> comprehend what i am doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a big space either way right for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kid yeah like this is fine this is great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i literally chose like the harry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> potter club </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm like i'm like mum yeah don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] believe what what two or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three-year-old connor cho why would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do that his mom comes out with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> contract is this this you that's your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did you sign my blog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is this i would never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> choose it you know i would have never i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> got the room which was right next to my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> parents room because obviously i was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> firstborn child right yeah and then my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sister got the last room which just so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened to be next to the toilet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right so i remember she would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> complain being like you know because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> think our rooms were pretty much the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same size like it might have been minor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> differences but it didn't really matter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was it was roughly the same size but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember my sister used to complain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like you know well at least you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> not [ __ ] in a room where like every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time someone has to take a [ __ ] in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle of the night you get woken up by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and i was like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah okay well that sounds like you but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> also you're closest to the toilet so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah exactly that's what i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have brothers and sisters or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever whatever how was it decided </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which room was given to you can't relate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or were you all just shoved into one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> room can't relate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well actually yeah when my when we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like really really little my sister and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i like you know obviously just slept in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same room in the same bed right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then yeah it's probably maybe when i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i don't know six or seven that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> finally got to pick one of the rooms but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't remember there being like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ritualistic [ __ ] squid game of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well wasn't it fight to the death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you remember choosing the room no of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> course not i don't know i asked my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> parents later on last night i chose it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like why would you listen to me why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't i am not in the right mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> make good decisions yeah i mean it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably massive to you when you chose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it you know yeah yeah it was tiny yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you could like there was no place to put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> more than like a single bed not that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would ever need more than a year yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> even if i wanted bigger there's actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no space to put it anywhere yeah and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like but of course you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about that right like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously remember it different to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parents right so i guarantee your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parents are gonna remember it and recall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it differently being like oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specifically remember connor [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> volunteering as tribute you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like yes i will take the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smallest room for the family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> going back to like weird events your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parents are taking you to so i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i think the weirdest thing well not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the weirdest but the thing that sticks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> out to my mind right now is my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or my mom once me once took me to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meditation meet-up okay i think it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> meditation meet-up okay so i think what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> happened is so my mom's like buddhist so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know as a buddhist this was before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i became like a monk or a kid monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you uh you pray or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meditate for good karma and all that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff so sometimes my mom would go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like these buddhist meetups or these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meditation meets up uh what you do at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this meetup is you go there and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meditate for about an hour in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> darkness right okay um with a bunch of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> other people or a bunch of other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so like i was about seven years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> old when this happened right so i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like at that at that time like there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one to take care of me at home or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something i don't know why but my mom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> god you're coming with me uh we're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meditate and shift i remember her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> framing it in a way where we're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna meditate for a little bit like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like like like five minutes something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what it was in my head right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know how long i would be sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still for yeah at this meet-up i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i she told me how to meditate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we do it for like 10 to like 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes at most right that's what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought i was getting into so we get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there i remember like the guy the head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy was just like hey thank you all for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming um so we're going to be uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sitting here i'm going to hit the gong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh we're going to turn off the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lights and we're going to just sit here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for an hour and after the hours on i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to hit the gong again android game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything lights up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and so i remember thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got to sit here in silence for an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what i was seven years old i could i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't like sit still for five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let alone let alone the [ __ ] hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like solving the god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i remember so i remember like sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down i'm like i'm like [ __ ] panicking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to figure out how the [ __ ] i am </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to sit here for an hour i look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over to my mom my mom's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already like [ __ ] in the zone yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's she's already she's long gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's done it she's long gone she's in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another [ __ ] dimension right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so and so he hits and so hits the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gong luckily they have a clock in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> room so you can see how much time goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> past now what you're meant to do during </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meditation is like you are meant to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clear your mind right the point of an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour is that it shouldn't feel like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour because to your mind it should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as empty as possible so you shouldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really feel the passage of time or you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should feel it less than usual right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's that's the entire like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zone you're supposed to get in with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meditation um so i remember all right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember thinking all right you got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've meditated for 15 minutes you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do an hour um and i remember sitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there and to me i'm like i think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 40 minutes has passed let me sneak over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the clock i look over five minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has gone by i'm just like oh [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> start [ __ ] sweating i look i look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around are you seeing the clock in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dark huh it was like one of the glow in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the dark oh yeah with like uh with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a luminescence that makes it even harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not to look as a kid yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm just like so i come up with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five-head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five-head strategy right because i'm at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that point i was [ __ ] obsessed with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pokemon right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah who wasn't so like i i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back in the day i had like recorded like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an entire season of pokemon and that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my entire my only entertainment so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i had like watched this vhs this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recording of pokemon like [ __ ] 10 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> times right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 20 times so i think to myself how am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i going to get through an hour i got a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> five hit idea what if i just watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three episodes of pokemon in my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just and if i watch three episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of pokemon in my mind an hour would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> passed right so it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember so i remember this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> serial experiments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i like i like escape into the castle </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately i think some gaps were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> missed off because i i remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching in my mind yeah three episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking at the clock and then and half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an hour had gone by so i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay maybe time moves differently in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i think i think i watched an entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> season of pokemon in my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your mind was just like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cutting out all the filler right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> only the important influence i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> got through an entire [ __ ] season and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i finally hear the gong and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm like thank [ __ ] and i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> afterwards like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of my mom's friends comes over to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> her and be like well i'm like so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impressed with your son like how do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sit there for an hour like my son can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concentrate anything for five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i'm so impressed with your son </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't know i just got they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know i just watched pokemon for an hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> while you are drenching and sweating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like how does that just what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does that say again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh ash was about to get to the indigo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> league you and you stopped at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] good point man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the [ __ ] did you do that that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> insane this man literally opened up his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> third eye by reciting pokemon in his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime companies hate this one trick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to letting you re-watch the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to recite pokemon that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> real secret to like reaching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enlightenment you don't empty your mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you just watch an entire season you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch one piece in your mind and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just reach enlightenment could you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that now i could not do that now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i could watch a show and then couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do that immediately after that well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was back in the day when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you were a kid and you had like that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that you watched over and over oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah you could just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> recite it like i remember i could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably like recite the entire movie of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> toy story or something in my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i've watched it so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i have some movies like that too i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> probably recite the entirety of pulp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fiction that's because i've seen it so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many [ __ ] times but right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> three and a half hour movie let's go if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to meditate for that long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when i need to meditate i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like say what again say what again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i dare you i'm double d [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what they call quarter pound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with cheese in france </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> did you never have that on the kids as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kid just like some a game or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you played so many times that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could just like recite it from memory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no never not recite here i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> probably played stuff a bunch but never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying i could recite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from memory but are you the kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person who remembers song lyrics easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no not at all i i actually cannot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember song lyrics without looking at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the sheet right and even then it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll last like a day yeah because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really interesting there's like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two types of people where there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's ones who are like you can listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to a song once and you just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> miraculously just remember how the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lyrics go and then there are people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just like i could listen to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> song 50 times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like i'll recognize the lyrics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if someone tells me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but i can't recite it okay so i had just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i had this like realization the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other day um because you know i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously i've obviously given connor a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of [ __ ] for like hearing the beeps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the boobs yeah um and then i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had this realization that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i listen to this i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listen to music like beeps and boobs as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well right because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay like lyrics mean nothing to me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's it's so it's so weird yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so weird right where i i listen to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a song and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if lyrics aren't there right i i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like something's missing because i do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think lyrics need is a part of the song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but to me lyrics are almost like another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instrument instrument to me it's it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> weird it's so weird where where like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't listen to what they're saying and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even like even if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can take a song that i love and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lay the lyrics out in front of me and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like i've never heard this song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life like what is what is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> song well i would argue that the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artists and the best singers and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best bands i guess can yeah as you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> use their voice as an instrument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then if you want to read into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lyrics the lyrics are also profound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where unfortunately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very few artists can do that right where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's either like you either concentrate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fully on the lyrics to be like here's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> deep poetic meaning behind understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this are you saying the voice is a part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the song is that what you're saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah well yeah no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like another but but you know there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are a lot of artists who don't see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that way and they just like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it also depends on how the songs mix but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like some artists you hear and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i wish i could hear the instruments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's just being drowned out by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the singing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like have you ever like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> properly listened to the lyrics of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> song and it's like change the way you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think about a song because you probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually read into it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the the new weekend album is really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> good but like if you just actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to what you're saying it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depressing as [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that rarely ever you're like vibing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like dude this song is so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like i'm [ __ ] depressed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] is going wrong and it's like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] this is so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wait what do you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i can't i can't even get to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment because it like it it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> weird but like sometimes if there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a disconnect between how the song makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me feel versus what the lyrics are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> saying i always like go i always go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> towards what the song makes me feel yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and and it's it's so it's so weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i don't know how much of this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] well actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's that that's it i hear the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beeps in the boobs the beeps and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boobs make me feel something and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what i feel towards the song that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hardly ever listen to lyrics at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because it never changes how i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> towards the song it's it's so weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys are literally that type of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who would make a [ __ ] art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buzzfeed article being like top 10 songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have a dark meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> engineering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know you you i hear the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the music it comes in and it just comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a like a like a i don't know like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] graph in my head it comes out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing is i get that i totally get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that but i feel it like i i do have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> emotions towards it yeah of course but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't give a [ __ ] what he's talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about right i'm like i'm just in taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the noise and the noisy that makes me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feel something or it doesn't yeah which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is why i think for a lot of songs where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there is like a stark contrast between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how the song makes you feel versus how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lyrics make you feel yeah is what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a bigger whiplash for people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys right where it's like oh what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the hell live i don't know how i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preface live it is different there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely is a lot more to it whenever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recorded album yeah i feel like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why i find it so easy to you know listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a lot of japanese music or a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like music in a language that i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand yeah because it's they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably you know i i have no idea what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lyrics they are spitting most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time but you know this part of me is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i feel i feel the emotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i feel the emotion that they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> singing right now oh yeah i kind of get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it even though i probably don't get it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i get it you know i can't tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you like like i'd say 90 of anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> openings the lyrics are depressing as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but but like just weaves that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is you know fine it's it's cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what i find really interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though about people who can do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and it's like you know it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason why i feel that in and of itself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that discovery of like when people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> find out this really like bright and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like colorful and like very positive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounding song actually has a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] dark meaning and then you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's that realization of like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i just got played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i wasn't listening to the lyrics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right like that's why i'm like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we've we like had this idea to do a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> music three by three for like ages and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've like loki actually been [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the things one of the mediums i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> find hardest to [ __ ] explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is music because i literally are just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like um i mean this song this sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good this this song made me feel things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and i just really like it um and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people are like oh did you know the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meaning of that song i'm like i have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> idea the meaning of that song yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but it made me feel things yeah things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> welcome to the beeps and the boobs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ladies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i thought you were on my team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel betrayed welcome to the beeps and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> boots oh glass glass vehicle and i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely betrayed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> god dammit the music episode would just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> be joey talking for two hours yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i like this one yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why i almost don't want to do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because i think i'd probably just make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> video on my own you're gonna carry the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode yeah exactly which might be the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shortest trash days episode of all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah probably like 40 minutes in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's it yeah all right thanks for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> joining us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you have an example of like a song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where the lyrics um where you where the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you found more like reading into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lyrics and the deeper meaning of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that song as opposed to just listening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you know the initial beats the beeps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and the boobs the beeps and the boobs i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mean like like i'll go into pink floyd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also like yeah i think there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of like artists that you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again it's like it's it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> brilliance of you know using the lead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> singer as just like an instrument where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like if you're not listening to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lyrics or anything like that it still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds great and it's still like sticky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your head but then you but then one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day you're like you know i've listened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to this song like three or four times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i never actually read the lyrics let </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> me read into the lyrics and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> read into it you know a lot of it's very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like poetic and you know it completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> changes the way you view that song like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know [ __ ] like great like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know [ __ ] you know you know turning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese you know that song yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turning japanese i think i'm doing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i know that song's about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> masturbation oh yeah but no one knows it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because no one [ __ ] reads into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lyrics they just see they just hear that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like oh yeah i love that song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what turning japanese is about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's about masturbation i i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> never heard of these songs well like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pumped up kicks is about school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> shootings right i know that one i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like when people first discovered that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like oh my god i've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] debated right but it's catchy as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it's catchy as [ __ ] it's crazy it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a jam of a song right it's like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know i find that to be like as someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who also writes music that is so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] harder than it looks yeah i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can imagine and i feel bad that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't or i have the inability to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciate it because like but i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's fine because like i feel with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those kinds of songs they're taking into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> account how it sounds first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they think about the meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> afterwards right yeah i think the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exception is with like rap music you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know where it is just like basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just lyrical poems to a beat right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's where i actually have more of an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> understanding or like or like an image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head of oh man these lyrics go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hard but right yeah they do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> listen to the lyrics yeah but try it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah but like most of the times i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually see the lyric sheets and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> almost like it almost like transforms it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that to a point where i don't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recognize the song anymore it's always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like separate from the song itself it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so weird if someone can explain this to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me like i'm like super curious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i've just i i think i just i i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> incapable of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like getting the meaning of lyrics as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm listening to the song at the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time i recognize anything to do with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that i'm the only musical trained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one out of the three of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> probably you probably appreciate it more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah maybe to me it's all noise right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but it's noise i mean i i i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> play musical instruments but i've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> been like professionally trained right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right you know i think that's just what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is right like i feel it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because you've been trained to listen to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> music in a different way yeah that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> can just perceive these smaller points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that other people would just perceive as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just the beeps and the boobs right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean to me like it's like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who you know go to a gallery and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at art right it's like you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly just been like a lot of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have just been trained to look at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing in a completely different way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you otherwise would have a very hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time grasping right like you know you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to an art gallery with an art critic and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd be like yes i love the the flow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the the texture and the feelings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i get from it it's making me feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this way and the average person looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like oh yeah i like the color red </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just i think it's just based on how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're trained yeah like like to me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i can play musical instruments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and um stuff like that but i've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've i've never thought i was i've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like studied music theory or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that so like when i like wrote </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> songs before it was more like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> c major sound nice or something or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that i don't like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know her her chords sound nice that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like my process you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> musically trained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> musically trained </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> god damn but yeah at this rate i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know if we'll ever actually end up doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a music three by three i'm down i just </SPEAKER_03>
