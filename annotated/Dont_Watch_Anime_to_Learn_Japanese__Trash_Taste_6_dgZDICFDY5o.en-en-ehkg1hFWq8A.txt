<SPEAKER_00> - I guess because you're
used to the normal dynamics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in anime where they're like,
"Oh a hot girl turns up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he wants to have sex with her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But then he actually just starts her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he just starts fucking her, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Who is this chad?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never seen such a big
chad in animated before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Welcome to trash taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm your host Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm tired of smiling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Great intro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all just had a very strong coffee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm again with Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No nicknames today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just didn't think to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're keeping it simple today, are we? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's who we are, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm very tired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every, every day before we do an episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wake up at 7:00 AM to
go to a Japanese class </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for two hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How's that going for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's going forward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes you're too
tired to learn things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember being this in university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be asleep basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then they make you talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I kind of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, how's it going for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause me and Connor have
gone very different routes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in terms of how we've
approached learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause you've taken
classes and I'm completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> self-taught because I
realized in university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how classes really slowed me down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of my learning process. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just the biggest problem I've encountered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is self discipline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly why I wanted lessons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause, the way I see it, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Lessons are okay, if I'm
keeping up with these lessons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> these are the bare minimum that someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at any mental capacity can learn Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if I'm learning it
at this structured course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that anyone can do, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I should learn X amount of Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because we know that
everyone who's homeschooled, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't actually do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also I'm a liar, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I lie to myself a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I say I'm gonna learn Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will do everything in my power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to think that I'm learning
Japanese, but not do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - During the quarantine,
because at this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the episode, it's pretty much done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty much open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But during the quarantine,
because you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor you didn't go to
Japanese lessons right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You had to do zoom lessons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hated Zoom lessons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you were telling
me that most of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you were just playing Arknights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You were just like, "Yes,
I am listening teacher." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, new unit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Problem was right, is that I was in a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> My class is mainly like housewives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people who are much older than me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, a lot of them weren't tech-savvy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, they were all spending
10 minutes saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hello, hello, can you hear me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Hello." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meanwhile, I'm already set up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got my whole
YouTube is set up, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've got two monitors,
three mobile phones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You got the green screen in the back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The pro stream is set up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like when I'm at my PC, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm doing everything but what
I'm supposed to be doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I got two monitors, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I can also put my webcam
wherever the fuck I want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so when they're like, "Are you looking?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm doing work on the other
monitor [indistinct] else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, Connor you're
paying for those lessons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you not do it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I paid to be in class, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's that's university
in a nutshell though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you're, you're paying to be here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're paying to learn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, why do I have to
get a classes though?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't have to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can just study from home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate going to the class and having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to do that and be back
in that environment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you know, I
wanted to get out of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the same time I am learning stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is slow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I do a lot of study on
my own time, mainly Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they don't teach
us Kanji in my class. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't teach you Kanji? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's practical Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's all supposed to be for speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting by. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because to reiterate, when I say classes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think most people will assume every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I do classes two times a week
for two hours, that's it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So not a lot of time to
learn a language really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's better than nothing I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's much better than doing nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because for me, I've tried to focus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> less on the reading and just
pure conversational for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And actually one thing
that's really helped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with that is not watching
anime actually, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But watching virtual YouTubers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I've I've really gotten
into watching virtual YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the last few months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who are you into? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Asa Coco is probably my
favorite one at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> She just had her 3D debut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sounding like a
total fucking degenerate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that the one you
simped over in [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I saw that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - All over Twitter was, Garnt was simping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was very drunk at the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I saw she was having
her first 3D debut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm, "I'll just fucking throw her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like 30 bucks, whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then as soon as I did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my Twitter notification fucking exploded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gigguk is simping over VTuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imagine getting caught simping,
but over virtual YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because it's actually
really helped my Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way more than watching anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because with watching anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno what the anime watching experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has been for you Connor since
you've started learning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for me I found it a lot more difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch anime now that
I'm learning Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know when
you read the subtitles, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you kind of
understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you wanna try to listen in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to what's what's being said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But because you do that,
you kind of just miss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's on the subtitles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's been my anime watching
experience recently and well- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I imagine Joey is just
on his throne here being, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yes, tell me more about your struggles." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are these Subtitles you speak of? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, one thing that
I noticed that bugs me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that now that I know,
I'd say a very basic amount. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very minimal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not, enough to watch
an episode and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yup, I understood, all that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But enough to get some sentences, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that when I read the subtitles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and obviously because in Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes the subject at the
end of the sentence in English, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's normally at the start in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So sometimes you'll see a subtitle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that comes with the other
half of the sentence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you're hearing the
sentence that's gonna come up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, you're Johnson Joestar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor And Garnt] I
know what you're gonna say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're next line is gonna be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it kinda messes with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just watching any hentai,
it's really frustrating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I realized two minutes in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm starting to be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, what are they
saying, just a minute." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Means feels good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess though it makes
sense to watch VTubers though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you know, these are real people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who are speaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just look anime, but their mannerisms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and their phrasing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though they might be
playing a character, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's still a real person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it feels like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're having an actual conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you know watching an anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you hear a conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "I've never actually... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This isn't a real conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This isn't a real conversation
that's happening right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm zoning most of it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas when I'm watching a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like a genuine... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a Japanese conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you're actually hearing a story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the way any person you talk
to Japan would talk like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's been way more useful
for me in learning Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> than it has been watching anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also because I guess with VTubers again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're real people, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So the speed that they talk
at as well is very real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's not overly accentuated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it actually makes more sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get used to that kind
of speech, speed, than like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No one talks like that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, cause you're not it's
the anime voice acting voice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is not how real people talk like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is true in I'd say dub as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know you hear a dub voice actor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a dub performance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, "This
isn't how real people talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't how people talk." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's more watching a live streamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's been... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna say that's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna say that's the only reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm getting into VTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're trying to learn Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say VTubing is much
more useful than learning- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's educational, I swear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Than watching anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because watching anime now for
me has become a lot harder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you get the joy of finding
that one VTuber you can simp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like, "Oh yeah, that's my one." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a little bit annoying
to watch anime sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then also now
sometimes I can look away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just for a second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can still understand
what they said roughly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I'll know, three of
the five words that they say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and that after that I can
kind of piece together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was being said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that such a
gratifying moment though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really is, I was
going to say as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing that I found really helpful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> than I thought I would
dread is learning Kanji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think Lennon Kanji is so interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know you love your Kanji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But learning has been so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because when it slowly
starts to make sense, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels like an RPG, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're unlocking
the world where you live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I can slowly start to read stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's multiple different ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to read a Kanji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when you know both,
it's like, "Yeah, I'm kinda- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like that one Isekai protai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who just comes in is
like, "What does this say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're 12 episodes it, his like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I get it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's been really
helpful for just learning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Speaking in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of the words
have the same pronunciation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then obviously Kanji is
the way to differentiate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Kanji holds the meaning, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And sometimes reading a
whole sentence in Hiragana </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is a nightmare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And weirdly enough for
people who'd have no idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about Japanese it might
be hot to think about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a full on Hiragana
or Katakana sentence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is so difficult to read sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas Kanji is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, I know exactly what that means. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know exactly how to read it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The way I see it, is that in English, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that how we don't
need to read the word, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we know the shape of the word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can see a word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know the shape of the
word, I can read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's how
Kanji is to Japanese people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where they don't necessarily read it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they recognize that the shape. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they just know what's
being said in the sentence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because have you seen that video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can read an entire paragraph? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where if the word the
first letter is the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last letter is the
same and then you swap </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all the letters in the middle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can still read what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because of how your fluency works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel it would be the
same with Kanji as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But instead of the first and last letters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like does this have
one line in it or two? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's that but just squinting really hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there are some
where there's so many lines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm like, "How the fuck do people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just read it this fast?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean the more difficult
is when you start to write it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when it starts to get difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I have an app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it vibrates my phone if
you do the wrong stroke order. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor grunting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "That's not how you do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been good though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because whenever write
a Kanji out in my class </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the right stroke order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The teacher is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor grunting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in the TV shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you never really think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like strike order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which stroke order is basically
the order you write it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I write my
Ss the wrong way in English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and people freaking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've seen you write your S. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell people how you write your Ss? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're supposed to do
it top to bottom right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, most people do it like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do it from top to bottom up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then swish down with the cursive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you learn that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I was so bad at English in school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So to clarify, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, I'll just start the story with this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll start strong, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so bad at English that
they put me with the kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who you know we're not
good at anything, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in the English class for one year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with kids with learning disabilities. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember being dude, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always been really good
at most subjects in school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and, okay to clarify the reason
why my English was so bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because the only reading
and writing I ever did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was in Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because my school was Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything I spoke in school,
and read was in Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I obviously knew how to spell English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Speak English obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then yeah, I remember we
did an English spelling test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I got everything wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But bear in mind I was like eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember they said like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, can you smell the woods said for us?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Yeah sure." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - S-E-D. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - S-E-D. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I put like Z-E-D. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then my parents were like, "Oh no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bear in mind, I never
read anything in English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Reading at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just always video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I forgot why was I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why did this story come up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot why I was saying this now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I think I
learned how to write... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because in English as well, in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they teach you the stroke order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I learnt it when we had to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if this is only in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think I was in
fourth grade or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because you have those
papers which are half width </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and full width. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you have to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I learned how to do it when
we learned to write cursive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I
remember learning cursive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it kind of became a
thing where I for some reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just started writing
some of them weirdly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and no one ever stopped me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so I've always done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll go into the A and then I'll go down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then do the S up and then slash down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you write the number five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you go from the bottom
or do you go from the top? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Whatever the situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean it depends? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does that work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's only one way to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Most of the time I
would do it from the top, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember distinctively </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was doing it from the bottom for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I stopped that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I also used to write my fours like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The correct way of doing... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you learn to
wright fours in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do it this way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do it that way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the way I learned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I remember I was
playing brain training </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they wouldn't accept
that way of writing four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is when I was like 11. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So then I started having to write fours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the Americanized way,
which is doing that way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the Americanized way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It looks a a kind of spiky nine, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've
write any letters starting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from the bottom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm always- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, how do you do your fours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do it the opposite way, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you do it from the bottom? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, from the bottom, and then I go- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck do you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this feels so weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So in school, did you have to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> English literature and language? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they were two different
subjects for us in school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, we just had English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shit, cause see, I had
to learn English literature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> English language, Welsh
literature and Welsh language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hated doing that many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, cause I think for us,
maybe it's just my school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it depended on the day of the week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like on Mondays we
go through a literature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the term that we have to study. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then on Wednesdays we
got to do something else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch a movie or study a
different text for a certain thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or how to read an essay and
write an essay on Fridays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, we didn't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's because my school
was just very small as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they probably wasn't
enough English teachers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in our school to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're the literature one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're the comprehension one." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How does it feel learning a
new language as your older now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though, compared to when you were a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I remember we had
to learn a lot of the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> languages when were in school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We had to learn Spanish, French. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Didn't take any of that shit- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's been a really
different challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learning Japanese as a grown adult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I don't know, has the fact that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you are very much into Japanese culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and watching anime helped you
at all from your perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's made it easier, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but easy with an asterisk, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Easier to understand
some concepts culturally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that might explain some of the language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the end of the
day it doesn't help me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a crazy amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it just helps me understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why certain things are the
way they are in a language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, why you can't
be direct to someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why it's always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess because sometimes
when you're learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the language you're, "Why
can't I just be direct? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not a thing you can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's too aggressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think learning Japanese from me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't realize how much I kind of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> zoned out Japanese when
I'm watched anime before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You filter it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're that's nonsense to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm focusing on this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just absorbing the subtitles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you kind of just
mute out the Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize that
until I started learning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I actually picked out individual, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the sentence works and how
the language actually works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That I realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh this didn't help me a lot at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I find it really hard in my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to recommend learning
a language to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel if you're
not going to actually do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of a waste of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, it takes commitment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I said to
people though, about Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's one of those
things where learning Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you're not
going to do it full time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like at least a five-year thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to commit to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you quit two half years in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So many people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get fucking emails about
it all the time goddamn time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being like. "What's the
easiest way to learn Japanese?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is no easy way to learn Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just have to sit
down and just be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm I about to commit
five to 10 years of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn this shit?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like any skill chart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Where it's the first getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over the first real difficult bump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is the hardest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And once you get past that,
you've gone through a challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've overcome it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Normally you could keep going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the same with any craft, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Voice acting as well,
photography, anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's always gonna be that first point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you think you're
starting to understand it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you get to that
point where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck, I know nothing about
what I'm getting into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's that point
where if you keep going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and actually start to
really put in the work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll probably see some results. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But a lot of people quit at that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'm always really paranoid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is true in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And whenever I'm doing a
play through of a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I'm doing something
and it's just sub-optimized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes I paralyze myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm just like,
what if I'm not doing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most optimal way? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this a waste of time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so scared of wasting my time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So when I first started learning Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I spent more time trying to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best way to learn Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than actually learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's usually like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess you're the
opposite to me in that sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm definitely that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll maximize the shit out of video games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but everything else in my life like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "That's good enough." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kind of the
opposite with video games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just video games video games... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Video games are just made
to be fun and time wasting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I'll
talk to Joey about videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're both playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll be like, "Do you
know, this is 2% more efficient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to do this method, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Joey is like, "Bro,
I don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, "I've
already put 60L in this game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how with you
learning a language though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like as long as I'm learning something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the language that I can view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as somewhat useful I'm
sure it's not a waste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like there's no
route to learning a language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Any bit you learn of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's putting the jigsaw together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends on the person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> At the end of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, some people are crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone has a different path. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone learns differently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're not gonna discover
the best way you learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you actually just go
out and fail at something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would waste a month on Duolingo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wasted a lot of time on Duolingo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Other languages, European languages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure it's pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I took Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was not very useful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [indistinct] you right from the get-go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and not explaining why
you need to learn it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or what this is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds efficient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was teaching me the Kanji for window. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> One of the first things- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That a difficult one too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And see Kanji for see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought, "Why are
you teaching me this shit?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know the Kanji from Monday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you teach me window? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need to know this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even think
window is in the top 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most used Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So why you teaching me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's pretty uncommon to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel that the way
Duolingo went about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're never gonna get a
Duolingo sponsorship by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it was, yeah, not good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we do, you can call us out on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Duolingo is a way... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It tricks you into
thinking you're learning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know a lot of just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Useless shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pieces of information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can never piece together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as a whole to use anywhere basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's a shame, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel you don't really realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're being mugged off by Duolingo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until you actually start
learning it properly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you're like,
"I literally have no use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for anything I learned on Duolingo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was such a,
it was such a mess." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember distinctively. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even know how
to say any sentences. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they were teaching
me how to read the Kanji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Kyoto in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "That's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't need to know this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely don't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you go to Tokyo and Kyoto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's written in fucking English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is something that
I don't need to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What I would to know is how do I say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh I recommend this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I think." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know how to say,
I think or anything that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Duolingo, I don't need
to know if this is a pen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what an Apple is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have to ask what an apple is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, there's some good stuff there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not saying it's all bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just felt the structure
was all over the place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When we first moved... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Before we moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Me and Connor were on
Duolingo for a good month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Month and a half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Before moving to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we got here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were "Oh, we don't know shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we needed to start off by
learning hiragana and Katakana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember I sat down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I Googled what the best
memorization techniques were. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I found this
memorization technique. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll link it in the description. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like mnemonics or mnemonics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember the
exact pronunciation of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I learnt all of
hiragana and Katakana in one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I told Connor,
"Yo, this shit works." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor was like, "Nah, I
don't know about this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I linked him then same article. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he comes back to me
three, four hours later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm, "Bruh." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hurrah moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I said earlier, when you go outside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you've unlocked the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause you can start suddenly
reading McDonald's menus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is the pneumonics thing where you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's shape based. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would make you assign... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And to be fair, this is how
memory champions, memorize stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they assign stories and shapes
and objects to the memory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And that way they can
recall them much easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it would say [indistinct]
which is the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "It's a chef's hat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Think of a chef's hat when you
see this symbol for cooking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [indistinct] Look like a chef's hat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was yeah, it was a sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because then you remember
that's kind of dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's telling you to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then you remember when you see it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it's that dumb thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You remember the dumb shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it's really stupid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it made you remember it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's Counter-intuitive right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because by remembering more stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember one stuff better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as opposed to just repeating
the same thing over and over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the best way I've
heard an explanation for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that your memory is kind
of a filing cabinet, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you just have one
random piece of information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just randomly file. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very hard to just find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that random piece of information. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If that information is got a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of other information that relates to that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's much easier for you
to find it in your memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's why you can just
recall things a lot easier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely feel that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I find that learning symbols for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is way easier than learning anything else? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why Kanji has
been pretty fun so far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you're definitely a person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who remembers stuff visually, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if you give me a set of numbers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can normally remember
the numbers decently well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Learning Kanji is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I love just putting
100 symbols in a program </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just making it test me over and over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'll do that for hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> until I can remember all 100, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I do, and
I find that pretty easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - At the end of the day, that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably the most effective, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you literally just need to force </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that shit in your head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> By just doing it, doing it, doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And at least the good thing
about doing that here in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that if you then
force yourself to learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all those symbols, is
that you just walk outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Oh, oh." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can use it practically, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, somewhere, I'm like
I'm never going to fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would I need to know this Kanji? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then two seconds
later, I'm on the train </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and the place has one of
the Kanjis in their name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Bruh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I get it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My question for you, Joey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is, I have always been curious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How much studying have you done? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of people
assume that Joey's Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a second language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's completely wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey has a second first language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of people would don't know this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but Joey's Japanese is better
than most Japanese people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had no idea how
good your Japanese was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just kinda thought that
you were decent at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I came here, and
then you were teaching Kanji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to 40 year old people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they were like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was in the studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were doing a party
and we had three people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from our company, all Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was teaching them about
different Kanji structures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I've never heard of the shit before." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm have you heard of it before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so simple. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I did a lot, a lot, a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I say I've said it in videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but when I've said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've studied my entire
life, I'm not joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've studied my entire life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just to put it in perspective </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was maybe 10 years old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I used to do for fun? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to read the Kanji dictionary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seriously? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was that one kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> My parents probably thought
I was borderline autistic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would sit in
my room as a 10 year old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "I've got
nothing better to do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would just go to my mom's bookshelf </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just take out this massive, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2000 page Kanji dictionary
and just open it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to a random page and just
read it for hours on end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I dunno, maybe I don't know how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually helped me in the long run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but definitely it kind of got me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> familiarize myself with
different shapes and you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that sense I'm
definitely a lot like Connor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm very good at
learning things with visually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I need visuals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Learning sentences and stuff,
doesn't do anything for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but another huge
thing for me was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that my mom had this
kind of this unspoken rule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where if I spoke to her in English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I would usually get ignored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's really cruel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially when a four
year old is trying to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to their mom about something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I quickly picked up on it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was four or five years
old and I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, mom can I do, you know, blah, blah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> She just straight up ignore me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "All right,
she's in a pissed off mood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then the more times you
experienced it, I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I have to ask her in Japanese." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The moment I asked her in Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like, "Yes son, what- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a genius way to make
you kid learn your language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mum was exactly the same actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, "You're gonna appreciate this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're older. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're getting this now, mom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I appreciate it now that I'm older. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mom, I also appreciate it, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if she didn't do that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then I wouldn't have just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't have forced
myself to learn Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or to use Thai in a practical setting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is very hard when you're not living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the country that you're using it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, you know, everybody
around me spoke English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was living in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had a few childhood
friends who spoke Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but because all my childhood friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were also halfies like me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes we just spoke
in English to one another. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I needed a way... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess my mom was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, I need to find
a consistent way for my son </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to keep speaking the
language, just keep improving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it really helped as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because my mum was exceedingly
good at Japanese and Kanji </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff that, especially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So whenever I had a question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or I learned a new word,
I always went to my mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I tried to force
myself to use that new word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she would either say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh that's not how you use that word." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is how you use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You dumb little shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me tell you how to use this word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She could immediately know
when I was trying to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where I was oh yeah, you just
learnt that word didn't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because she'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, that's not quite how you use it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is how you use it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'd use it
again and she'd be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, perfect." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just how I
learn from practicality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know one big reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've really want to learn Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is one specific series
I want to experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after having learned Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've really, really wanna
experience The Monogatari Series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I love the Monogatari Series now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like I'm getting
maybe half the enjoyment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I could be getting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the appreciation I could be getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's this video
I've been trying to write </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for the longest time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called You'll Never Understand Nisio Isin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where, because as you
said, The Monogatari Series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything Nisio Isin
writes is fucking phenomenal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He's an amazing author. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of it translates
pretty well into English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the thing that makes
Nisio Isin so amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the subtleties and the
way that he plays around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the Japanese language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that shit is fucking
impossible to translate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've wanted to make that video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I fucking love Nisio
Isin and the Monogatari Series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more than anybody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like how do I explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my English speaking audience about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll never understand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're an English speaker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is so hard to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need to have a basic
understanding of Kanji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> To understand- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not just Kanji, it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He does word play in a
way that I've never seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any Japanese author do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's the whole reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many people love him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow I didn't know that you could... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He makes Japanese people's
Japanese look dumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only way to describe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> A Japanese person will
read that and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wow, it's like, I don't
know this language." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, have you ever
seen The Monogatari Series? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was learning Kanji the other day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I came across Monogatari Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For, is it Hanase or [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which Kanji is it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one where you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like to speak or to
tell a tale is like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [indistinct] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [indistinct] one of the
meetings is to tell a tale. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is to tell a tale. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so it's like a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Monogatari just means thing tale. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw it and I was like,
"That's pretty cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, cause that's the thing
with the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That even the titles
are a play on the words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Bakemono, and Monogatari
is two different words. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he just mashes
those two words together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just turn it into one thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the brilliant
subtlety of Nisio Isin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna say the whole thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I wanna save them for our video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna ask, how is it
reading the lighting novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to watching the anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause that's something I've
always been curious about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How well the anime has been
able to translate his writing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into a visual a format. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's the one
thing I love about Shaft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that they do hold this
really weird appreciation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Nisio Isin's writing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why Anadagi's
monologues are way longer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> than any anime monologue should be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There were so much... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That why its so dialogy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just remember being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck, can we just end." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a standard Monogatari episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like 95% dialogue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it needs to be because everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Nisio Isin writes is
so important to the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is really convoluted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it does add a lot of character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And and you know if you've
seen Monogatari episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know how every now and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there were just these
flashing images of texts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all texts ripped
straight out of the novels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was really
confused that would happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was confused a lot during
every series of the Monogatari. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it is confusing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm very surprised how big Monogatari got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I first watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "This breaks basically
every rule of filmmaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convention that I know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like oh show don't
tell, and Monogatari </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like, "How about we tell everything." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And show basically nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just gonna enjoy
this 20 minute long dialogue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it turns out amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Why does this work?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have never seen something
work so eloquently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And what surprised me
is that it just became </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for the Otaku culture back then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it kind of became a cultural phenomenon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It did, especially in Japan because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just unlike anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I mean, Katanagatari
in a sense as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was gonna say, if I was a betting man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have put them on
Katanagatari being way bigger than- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kind of weird that in the West, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the other way around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People still don't really
watch I think Katanagatari </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of maybe it's like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why you can
watch it other than illegally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've no idea how- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to buy a $400 Blue Ray I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Such a shame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's an absolute banger of a show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's got nothing to do
with the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just so you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a good thing, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Recently there was an OVA adaptation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the first novel that
Nisio Isin ever wrote. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot what it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its Kubikiri Cycle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a four episode
OVA of it that came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was okay, it's Nisio Isin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's essentially the series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that inspired the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, "This has to be big." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course every morning
guitar fan is gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> No one fucking watched that OVA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was really sad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it is screaming Monogatari vibes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I liked the Monogatari Series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know which part I got up to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched a lot of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like eight, nine seasons right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just so fucking many bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like a monkey when I watch Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I don't wanna
have to think about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> order and shit and what I'm
doing, just put something on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes I don't know what happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in between the series sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's so confusing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There were so many times
where I would start a season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of one of that franchise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know which fucking one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Am I on the right one,
or am I just confused, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this series?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is easily the most... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That is the number one question I get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the order? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What order should I watch
the Monogatari episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not even that complicated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, but even though if you're watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the right order, it's
such a confusing show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that normally you can get
halfway into the first episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of season two, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, "Is this season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I really, I really don't
know what's going on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I guess I didn't have any idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what was going on the whole time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the Monogatari Series, one season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is already confusing enough as it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in an enclosed story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when you look at it on
the grand scale of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's even more confusing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically Nisio Isin
pulled a Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pulp Fiction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where everything is out of order, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's in the same universe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I don't think it
matters that much, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As long as you just get the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just Google with the release order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't really go wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's stressful though, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've somehow fucked it up many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I watch the [indistinct] Kishibe OVAs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason Araki, when he wrote them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gave them episode numbers in the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you're watching the OVAs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't do them in order and Araki </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> never did them in order anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I remember correctly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you'll turn on episode
one, there'll be episode six. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What? What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Araki please stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're like, "Space
bar. Fucking Google, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Which episode is episode one?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Episode one is episode six,
episode two is episode nine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Episode three is episode four. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you're like, "Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would you do this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They pulled a George
Lucas Star Wars right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Episode four is the first one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It goes episode four, five,
six, then it goes one, two- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not even that, it's
just four, nine, two, seven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Why". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No it's like the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> No, just Haruhi Suzumiya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you watch Haruhi
Suzumiya when it was airing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So Haruhi Suzumiya had
this broadcast order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was, it was for
absolutely no reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just broadcasted
in this random order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people were like.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when it was when it was airing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people were like, "Oh
this is a genius move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's kind of like you're
piecing together the puzzle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each episode." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now that it's all aired now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure that
they edit out the order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the fucking last
episode chronologically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just the most anticlimactic episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the entire series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they're like, the best
episode is episode six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mix it up, mix up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just mix up the order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people are gonna
call that genius move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It wasn't genius, Tanigawa
Nagaru was just on crack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, was this the
original Japanese broadcast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of order? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because Tanigawa Nagaru was on crack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> See, I only watched it years after now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we mentioned this before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I watched the movie first by accident. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a dumb mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This, this guy, I think you
mentioned in episode zero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So most people have seen it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This person watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Disappearance of
Haruhi Suzumiya first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like, how do you do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was still less confused
watching that movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than I was watching
most Monogatari series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you don't know they made a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the thing that tied
the whole Haruhi Suzumiya. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was The disappearance
of Suzumiya Haruhi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the fourth- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why novel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All I was is like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had just gotten into anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to watch the best
rated anime movie you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one told me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it still is the best move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one told me that I
needed a backstory, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I went into it, I watched
it all and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did you think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you think it was a good movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought it was shit,
cause I didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck is happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How can I think it's a good movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when I don't know anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember being really annoyed with... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I bet Connor just watched
this, right after School Days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think School Days was
what broke the camel's back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was definitely the
Haruhi Suzumiya movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> watching thing that
definitely made me think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> reviews sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you gone back to watch
the movie since then or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No I haven't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You haven't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you've seen the TV series now right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched watched the first
season of this TV series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I got two episodes into
the second TV series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they were repeating everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, "No, not doing this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would say that Haruhi still
is very much worth watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this day and age
because of Disappearance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Disappearance is still my- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Such a good movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably my favorite
anime franchise film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And up there as one of
my favorite anime films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this guy apparently fucking hates it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that the whole
series is kind of mediocre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first season was just fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was watching it and I was okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know this is a terrible comparison </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was just man this just
feels Toradora, but worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's zero romance in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the whole
setting reminded me so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of Toradora and the
way that it was set up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That it was et in a school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like every anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know this is a completely
stupid opinion on my part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I recognize this is a garbage opinion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the whole time I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess cause it was just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I was very bored a lot of time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching Haruhi Suzumiya. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only thing that made me wanna watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was the fact that Crispin
Freeman, voiced Kyon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No that's the best part of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was a treat watching him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What you said is like saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, Anohana was kind of Another, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause they have ghosts
in there or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a fair comparison Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I don't know cause... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They both start with A-N. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What show can you
compare Haruhi Suzumiya to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you had to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The closest comparison. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here's the thing, Haruhi
Suzumiya inspired a lot of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I came after that huge... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I became an anime fan
after that huge thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had had its impact. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think I came into it
with zero attachment to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> In any sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I think the thing with Haruhi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I find really interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the fact that it's one of those anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that is really weirdly tied to the period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it came out in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Much like Lucky Star I feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel that's why I don't give a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about either of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the thing is, I
fucking love both Lucky Star, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially Lucky Star. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think [indistinct] was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But the problem is that the
references in Lucky Star </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and the whole fact that
it really reflected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the Otaku culture of the 2000s, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is what made that show really funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the mid 2000s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, as much as I love Lucky Star, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't really recommend
it to people today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the scene has
just completely changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But does that mean you can recommend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Haruhi Suzumiya today? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I ruined it for myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You basically just watched the climax. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You watched the climax before
watching any of the buildup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So now you just kind of
ruined it for yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I don't
feel bad for being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I think it's not that good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I'm like, "I know
I ruined it for myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it might've been good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The only way to top that experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is if you committed to reading
all of the light novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll be dead if I read a light novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never reading a light novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did that, and the final,
final volume of Haruhi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You just have to sit down
and read nine volumes man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have no interest in
reading a light novel, ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, I remember a lot
of the elements in Haruhi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been done in other places now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause there's a lot of
self-referential humor in Haruhi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how he, I remember what
that was an innovative thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Remember when every fucking light novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't trying to parody
every other light novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now it's just gotten so fucking lazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with it's self-referential humor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again that's the whole
thing where it comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to the time period. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, you guys because
sound anime boomers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had it better back then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You should have seen the animes we had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - In '06 when Haruhi
and Lucky Star came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> As you said, the whole
self-referential thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think the whole
meta aspect of anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was just so new. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was such post-modernist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so post-modern at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I remember at the end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of every Lucky Star episode
while the credits were rolling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was no ending song for Lucky Star. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What it was was it was the scenes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all of the Lucky Star
characters in a karaoke booth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But you were outside of the karaoke booth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you could only hear them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the conversations
that they were having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the karaoke booth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weren't characters having a
conversation with characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was voice actresses
having a conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with voice actresses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people were like of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're voiced by voice actresses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> These aren't just characters on a screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're real people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And that meta was like,
that was fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause no other anime did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're laughing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He is laughing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're gonna sit down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're gonna respect this culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're gonna respect this Conner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was cool back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back in the day, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still think Meta
anime peaked Monogatari. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In terms of light novel shows, adaptations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it kind of peaked with Monogatari. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's been other good
light novel shows as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has been meta. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'd say, you know, Haruhi
really was the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I noticed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was Haruhi and Lucky Star. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then Monogatari was the
one that came afterwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it kind of nothing out did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now you see a lot
of lazy fucking attempts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at meta humor and meta jokes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was one anime I saw recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was such an eye-rolling moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the the MILF Isekai
that aired last year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone's favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It kind of marketed itself as a parody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the Isekai genre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's like, it's the Isekai genre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there's mom this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's different now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's different cause
there's a mom this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember there was one joke, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were in a hot Springs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's this one sindorei
that's in the hot springs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then she stands up and she's naked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of the main character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the main
character literally says, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ah, this is the scene where
you're about to hit me, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the sindorei goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ah, but how about if I don't hit you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bet you weren't
expecting that were you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the main character
goes, "Ah, you're right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't expecting that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the sindorei just goes off crying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was the joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember we had this
exact same conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the Isekai [indistinct] Video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You were fucking fuming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "This is not how
you write a meta joke." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You basically explained the
meta before you told the meta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - First of all, I want all
my anime scenes acted out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by Garnt like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Second of all, I just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas you said you tend
to watch the trash Isekai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could give less of a
fuck about the Isekai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm right there with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just iterates on itself
and then changes one thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't be surprised if
there's another slime one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except he's a green slime next. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, that's
gonna be the next thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just season two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's green. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just struggle to give a
fuck about any of the Isekai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to watch the mum
one just for the memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't even muster up to type it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing is, it wasn't
even that good for the memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was you saw the title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "Haha I can
make a meme out of this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I watched two
episodes and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, I'm done." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I wanna watch these shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can talk about them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I realized now
maybe, I don't even know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that six months after that show has aired </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that meme is long dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And no one's going to mention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like by the time the
next season comes around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in three months time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No one is fucking talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then maybe it would
be a factoid one day like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "You watched the mom Isekai?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean you don't need to
watch it for any reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause for me watching trashy Isekai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or just trash anime in general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause apparently that's
my brand or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the reason I do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is because it's just
like, it's just the easy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn your brain off show of the season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to be in a certain
mood to watch something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like Monogatari </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't just casually sit down
having my lunch or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, "I'm gonna... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Monogatari is the antithesis of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm just going to put something on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't put Monogatari on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas whereas with the trash Isekai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just sit down for lunch and
I just put it on, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just don't have to
think, I watch it every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And those are the shows I end up watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they're the easiest watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I know what I'm getting into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not being challenged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This character's going
to do that, whatever." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much of a brain dead
show can we make this season? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why I can watch them
because they are brain dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I don't have to think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you know, sometimes
where you watch a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes you just really
wanna be in that right mood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For something good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But with some, with the trash shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never have to be in a certain mood- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is why I've found I've watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more trash shows because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I get anxiety sometimes when- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it's a good show,
but I'm not in the mood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Dude, what was the show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Keep Your Hands Off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eizouken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was one of those
shows where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I can't just watch this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to commit to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It seems such a passionate
thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can't just, half-ass this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched one episode,
and I liked what I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But because of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just never watched episode two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I had to be in
that mood to watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I never was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sucked because it
was really hard to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then get back into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and it sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I know that was a good show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it was, but I
just, I didn't care enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to find that time to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna keep watching this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel bad cause everyone was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is the best show of the season." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just sitting there watching the 100th </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> documentary on Netflix, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have no time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had that problem a lot
more with animate recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the fucking reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still haven't watched
Fullmetal Alchemist, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because here's the thing, I can go years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without watching or
reading a manga of a series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know I'm going to love. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But I want to be in the right mood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it might take years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It might take a fucking decade. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Last year, I finally
read 20th century boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it went from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I was gonna read this since </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I basically started getting into manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is I thought, one of my
favorite mangas of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I had to wait, so many years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to experience it because
I just wanted to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that perfect zone to read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm so glad I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there are some shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have some shows that
you think if you re-watch it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you won't enjoy it as much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you're not in the same head space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 90%, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like,
I can never get behind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching anime weekly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I'm always in a
different head space sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm watching a show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, okay, because there's some shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that transcend that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such as? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Watching that weekly was hype as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every single week, no matter what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that one day it came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was hyped as shit for that show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I binged that whole series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was such a good episode by episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that even though it sucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sucked to have to wait a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause that one day in the
week you've got a treat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it didn't matter how bad your mood was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or where your head space was at. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For 25 minutes, shut your brain off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just have a fucking time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man, I used to be able
to do that so easily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was in high school in uni. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As well, joining in,
in the discourse online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that's a different side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I never got growing up with anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is the social aspects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because for me, it was just I watch a show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "That was an amazing show." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I have no one to talk to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, same, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The social aspect has quickly become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my favorite
parts of watching anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's why, I caught up to
Demon Slayer on episode 19, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I wanted to get involved
with the social discourse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause the memes are great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The memes are great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's made us so, if a show
has a bad ending or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I still enjoy it because. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The shit storm on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just the shit storm that follows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when
Darling the Franxx ended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this shift at episode 18 or 20. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember the exact episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then everyone lost their shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's not a good ending
but I had a blast watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just realized something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when Big Ed was a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Bear with me, this is gonna make sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Big Ed from 90 Day Fiance was the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was great memes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to start watching 90
Day Fiance because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "It's just not the same." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was watching it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Oh, it's cause
I need the YouTube comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's one thing to
have a clip, it's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when there's just the perfect YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thread roasting the shit out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also when someone's an in a TV show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Everyone else thinks this
guy's an asshole, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me go check the comments real quick." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you get this now where
you watch some YouTube videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or clips from shows or YouTube video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where they do something in the clip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's the moment when
you open up the comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope everyone's talking about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's what I love
about watching anime weekly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you get that kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's gonna be
talking about that thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that just happened on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's gonna be fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love joining in on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then you said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, go on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you ever get personally offended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go on a YouTube video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the comments are disabled? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if it's something you'd never wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to comment on or you never... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Most of it is anime trailers
of anime repeat sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I see the comments are disabled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I don't know
why, but I feel offended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, "You fucking pussies." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I turn American for five seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Free speech is dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Where's my second- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going back to what you said earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you re-watch the show
not in the right head space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, for some reason I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm pretty sure if I re
watched Darker Than Black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't think it's that good of a show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember really liking that show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm happy to leave that memory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of shows like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There a lot of shows like that.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Ergo Proxy for me is one of those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I re watched a proxy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I'd like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I'd it as much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when I watched it,
I was in that perfect- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Angsty, big brain boy mode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's just like, yep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a lot of shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm just leaving in that bubble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where I'm, I'm happy to
talk about these shows, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I never want to re-watch them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, cause for me the one big
show for me is Katana Kyoukai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched it when I was like
in a really dark head space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched this one with the blood sword. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's that's Beyond the Boundary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a different one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I thought we were talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Beyond the Boundary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are we talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He said Beyond the Boundary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's Katana Kyoukai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's Kyoukai no Katana
is Beyond the Boundary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What the fuck is the
Japanese title of that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the one with the pink
haired girl in the glasses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with the sword. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's about it's the
one with the assassin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who has death eyes or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was in a really dark head space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've become a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was one of those series that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna be that guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was kind of life-changing for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, now we need to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Please explain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How has that changed your life? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please elaborate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna get in
too much in the detail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was in a head space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I was like kind of the lowest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever been in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I watched this series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it connected with me on a level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that nothing else could at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it kind of really
changed my perception </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the world and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because of it, it's
one of my favorite anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because I'm not in the same head space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I am now that I was back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so fucking terrified
of re watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause if I re watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just don't get that same connection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'm like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna lose that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna lose what
that series gave to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that time of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the one
series, that I really hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really close to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And another series is actually Evangelion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because Evangelion, I think is one show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is just infinitely re watchable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, very time that
I've watched Evangelion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got a different experience out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I 100% agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched it first time
when it came out on Netflix. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> First time ever watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How'd you find it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I think because
it was the mega hype show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you go in expecting too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I was always
happy with what I got. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just very confusing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's on Anno Hideaki for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I liked how he built the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as a very, very terrifying one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like a lot of
animators struggle to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And a truly terrifying one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have that one
anime, that as Garnt said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is life-changing for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, we spoke about it last episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which fucked up the recording by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But Bokurano is definitely
one of those shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think definitely changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because again, I think
it was a similar thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was at a point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I was really confused
with what I wanted in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it really helped ground me a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and really understand a lot of emotions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was perhaps feeling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can we re-talk about Bokurano, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I want the audience
to know about Bokurano. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not enough people have
seen Bokurano unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of those shows where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not the best show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a very important one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think people should watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know how to
describe that eloquently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very disturbing but not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the conventional
reason for being disturbed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What Bokurano is about is,
there's these group of kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is going to sound
awesome by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it sounds like
an Evangelion rip off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It really does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's these group of kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, I think they were
on a school trip or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're on a school trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I remember is they find his cave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a talking head or something that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, so there's a guy in a cave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's a middle-aged man
working on a PC in a cave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really weird set up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And he basically asked them,
"Do you wanna play a game?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you to play a game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which, you know, anyone
asking you that ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a bunch of kids is
an immediate no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I think they all
get on a scale or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They all take turns, he measures them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then whatever happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then suddenly they go outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or happens later on in that evening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they were all... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We get to know these
characters a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's how many kids is there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 12. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like 12, 13. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Something that around that many kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they get teleported
into this huge mech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's a scary floating
head that's talking to them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And one of the children
has to pilot the Mech. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now we're going to go
into spoil this, a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, it's it's episode one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm going to spoil the
premise a little bit to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So one of the kids, pilots, the mech, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're finding another mech. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's to save the
world that they're told </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before this floating head character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A very intimidating character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They win the battle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hooray, they all win they all
celebrate and they go outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They stand on the mech </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then one of the kids just drops dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and falls off the mech. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Then they find out that each
time this mech comes back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're summoned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the kids has to pilots the mech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when they do, they're
gonna, die immediately after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's to save the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and what the
real beauty of this show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't really the mech
battles or the make fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more of the fact that these kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who have to pilot the
mech to save the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically kind of
a monster that we show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every week a new monster comes along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the new kid, another
kid from that group </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has to pilot the mech. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's about the backstory
of each of the kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And just having to deal with the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they're gonna die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're just going to die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And in really realistic ways as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These characters are very believable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes me uncomfortable,
even thinking back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to the emotions it brought out to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get very... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a really, really brutally honest look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the human condition and life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And especially how, you
know, a lot of these kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from a lot of different backgrounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Some of them have it easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember there's a one
kid who's the stereotypical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piece of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> His that spoiled.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there's some of the kids who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's one kid
who's 16 or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's looking after his two siblings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's brutal, because he's
the one who's raising </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his two sisters, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's horrible, seeing
him after come to terms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with that he's not gonna be
able to look after his sister. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really brutal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something that just
disturbs you on a level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can't really describe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so raw, it's so realistic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No filters whatsoever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's something that
really was not many people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have watched. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's something that was
really glossed over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really uncomfortable
to have to sit down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and sit through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I admit, I definitely did not watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it first came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely gave it some time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It'd definitely not a, "Yo,
you watched the last episode?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause I think the problem with Bokurano, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many people didn't
watch it when it came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because the way that they marketed it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was not that good, not that accurate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's a mecha. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Must just being Evangelion rip off." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no world where
it's the number one anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's just too uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It also came out in the time period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I think it was
the early to mid 2000s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - where there was just so
many Evangelion rip offs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They they're of varying quality as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's another show that
I fucking love as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is Rahxephon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just an Evangelion rip off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no idea what that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an Evangelion rip off
but it's still really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's totally rips off,
but it goes about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in a totally different
way from Evangelion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bokurano also sits in this
category of just shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that people have really looked over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause the premise alone
sounds an Evangelion rip off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does, it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the way they go about it
is just absolutely harrowing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just seeing these stories of these kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who have to come to terms
with their own mortality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it's a fucking tragedy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's different from Evangelion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Evangelion to me is just
Anno's raw cry for help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone's analyzed last
two episodes of Evangelion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's going back to that meme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the blue curtain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking sure that
Ano had no fucking clue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what he was doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone is like, "Oh, okay,
the way that these lines move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the way that it's very sketchy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like really reflective
on Shinji's mental state." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meanwhile, Ano is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "We didn't have much of a budget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just wanna put that out there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I love about Evangelion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because everyone comes out of Evangelion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with something different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because his message was so raw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he puts so much of
himself into the series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That it's impossible
not to come out with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how with Evangelion
especially that I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's just Anno is
just trolling like crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But there were moments where
the Evangelion fan base </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the super hardcore
analysts, Evangelion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are just so committed to this idea of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything in Evangelion,
every piece of imagery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything has to have a meaning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I remember when Anno
finally came out in an interview </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the meaning behind Evangelion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just straight up
said, there is no meaning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just the show I wanted to make. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people were like, "But
what about the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time the angels die
it turns into a cross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "I just
thought that looked cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And all the analysts are
like, "No, no he's lying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There has to be a meaning behind it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if the creator says there's no meaning, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no meaning, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's Occam's razor
where the simplest solution- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The simplest solution
is the best solution. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is normally the actual solution. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And even though he indefinitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> made me uncomfortable and feel bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a lot of the characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Bokurano just went way deeper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say Evangelion isn't from a story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're not even remotely similar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even remotely similar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bokurano, I feel like
has more of a structure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around its plots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where Evangelion just ended on this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I said, raw cry for help from Anno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But Bokurano was definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> here's a group of kids
dealing with something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's very very uncomfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're going to feel
fucking awful watching the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not even the worst part
that kids are gonna die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, sometimes it's
their backstories are horrific. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm not gonna say it,
because I don't wanna spoil it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's a really good one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there was one episode in particular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And after I finished it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was one of the things
where I had to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just sit there for five minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Fuck, fuck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you can
remember all the episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's one or two plots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of the stories, where I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck, Jesus Christ." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was right at the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you think that you
expected everything, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I love though
about these human drama shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that sometimes they may
just be the simplest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just a story between
two people or one person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's done really well, it can be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the most powerful storytelling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's more
relatable than most things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's really uncomfortable to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could be in a situation where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to come to terms with your death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I'll say this
till the end of time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like that's the whole
reason why my favorite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [indistinct] of all time is Inio Asano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna say, the one series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one manga series
that I'm still waiting on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be in the right head space
to read is Oyasumi Punpun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I've read that, I've
re-read that two or three times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the way through, and
every time, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only way it's just, "Oh, no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's just so... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not just Punpun as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Inio Asano is just so good
at writing these characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just so believable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's really disturbing
when you see these characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these very believable characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Run into these very believable
and horrifying situations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're just ah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If this isn't based off
a real person's life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then that's just scary in it of itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this guy can
just think of stuff this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And present it in a way
that is just so terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man Danganrompa is really despairful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Please shut the fuck up." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's called pink blood for fuck sake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Real despair is uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Danganronpa is not fucking uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, I know that I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For my wife who died. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You probably pissed off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so many Danganronpa fans about now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you see these characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're about to die in
Danganronpa, it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who the fuck gives a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that there are certain levels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause everything the series
that we've talked about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It hits you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna say it
but it hits different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - A reason why you should watch this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you're like me, I'm a person who avoids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these kinds of shows the plague. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I cry at anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I cry at Dekuo when he
says anything [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When Dekuo screams even a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm in tears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, it's a human reaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll cry at anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I normally just watch shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can turn my brain
off to, because I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to have to get into, "Oh
fuck sake, I'm feeling it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm really scared
now, I really just want- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Now that you've said that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I really want you to read an Inio Asano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will, I know it's gonna ruin me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why I stay away from it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but please watch Bokurano
you will not regret it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, if you're in
the right head space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for that kind of show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause you know, when you
have social barriers up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you see something
that's sad or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's yeah, you feel sad, you cry whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there are some shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't know whether
you wanna cry or just lie down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and just disappear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [All] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there's plenty of romance shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have really left me kind of very sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's a different feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a different feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Golden Week made me very
sad a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what it's called the Golden Week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Golden Time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Golden time, whatever yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Golden Time, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry, I'm an ape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked Golden Time a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it made me very sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Very upset a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't leave that feeling like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh man, there's no hope anymore." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt the same way when
I watched Sakurasou as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that seems like all like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, you know, cute kids in
a room just rolling stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But some of the backstories
of some of these characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Fuck man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only way I can describe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, "Fuck man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just sad dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, as you said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's sadness and despair, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just two totally different emotions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause it's kind of those
kinds of shows where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I use those, it changed my life kind of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is really corny when you say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's just one of those
shows where you finish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just sit down and you
just stare at a blank wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Whoa." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's the big sigh, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the big sigh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the big sigh of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't even listen
to the ending song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Shit, I can't even listen to this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to be in silence right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember being very sad
and having a similar feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching BoJack Horseman. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it taps in the same areas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you're laughing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> By the way last time we recorded this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said an analogy where Bokurano, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most amazing analogy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bokurano to sum it up to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're familiar with BoJack Horseman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Bokurano is imagine if
BoJack Horseman had 12 kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were all equally as
fucked up as BoJack Horseman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then they all had to get sacrificed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you slowly got to hear the
backstory of these fucked up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> BoJack Horseman, children. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's different because in
BoJack it's his own fault right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its all that and whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very, very sad, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It hits differently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode of Trash Taste
is sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, we've changed shirts, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm here to tell you
today about Express VPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Connor, I use incognito mode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The FBI can't see me, and you'd be wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in thinking that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, call me out this Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought incognito mode is safe me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't save. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You only Express VPN can save
you and your browsing history. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As a lot of these websites can still see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your browsing history, or
your internet service provider </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can see what websites you're visiting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of your IP address. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And honestly, that's
why I never get online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Without Express VPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also the good thing
about Express VPN is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can bypass geo restrictions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So say for example, I
wanna go onto Netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watch I don't know Harry Potter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not available
on Japanese Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So what do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I tap on Express VPN. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I reroute it to the US
Netflix and boom, there it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All of Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because sometimes I don't
want to watch anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna watch some goddamn Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Good thing is, if it doesn't
matter if you're on Verizon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or Comcast or whatever ISP you're on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Express VPN will hide all the information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and all the traffic that routes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> through your router from them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So even the ISPs can't
see your browsing history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the thing is, it runs so
smoothly that most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't even realize that
you have to Express VPN on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And the best thing is
express VPN is available </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on all devices. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course, the computer, mobile phones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tablets, you name it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you can predict your
online internet safety today </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by using the number one
rated VPN service out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by going to expressvpn.com/trashtaste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get three months free
off of your subscription. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S vpn.com/trashtaste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yes, I'm reading this from my phone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just in case I get the spelling wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Expressvpn.com/trashtaste to learn more, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> links in the description below. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I think one of
the series that I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just hit really deep is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> four episodes OVA based on this novel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called No Longer Human. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is a classic
Japanese novel, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is probably one
of the most harrowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things that I've watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never heard about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What does it about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's written by this
guy called Dazai Osamu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who is considered one of the three greats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in traditional Japanese literature. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was a guy from- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The big three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He was the big three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what's the story about in this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been a while since I've watched it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm not sure if it's his autobiography </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or if it's based on his life story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's based on his life story I believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's just based on this life story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who just keeps taking L's man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine if you just take
L's your entire life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just looking for that one win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no, he just keeps coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just keep taking L's your entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds like The Joker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This guy just gets more and more depressed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as his life goes on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it is based on his life story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this character, it's someone
who's clinically depressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's so depressed that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know he tries taking
his life multiple times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With you know, a woman that he's been with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just people that he finds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he just keeps living. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is actually true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The author tried committing
suicide several times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he succeeded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He actually succeeded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He drowned himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so that's the head space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the author who wrote this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, so he died? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> After finishing this story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was the last novel he wrote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before he drowned himself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the most- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's one long suicide note then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause it's just a raw peek
into the head space of someone- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is our most depressing episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really good though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a really good piece
of literature though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's just
based on his life story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all the shitty things
that happens to him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it ends with
just, you think he's found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this Ray of hope, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You think he's found his Ray of hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he just gets shit on once again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine if someone has
stage four leukemia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you just find
out he has AIDS as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he gets picked on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I then you just kick on his- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just keeps going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How it ends is that he's so... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He doesn't even think that... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If he committed suicide
that's not even the right way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to end it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's called No Longer Human </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he feels like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's so low that he's No Longer Human. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He no longer is in this human world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it is the most harrowing thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've used harrowing a
lot because I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the only way to describe- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're essentially reading the fall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That sounds like a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's brutal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the only way to describe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I like those experiences, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you said earlier you have to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the right head space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I feel like, I don't
know if you go into it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> already pretty up, you're
not feeling too great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not gonna do great
for your mental health. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the one problem
as well with No Longer Human </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the reason why probably
not a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that not just because
of it's subject matter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but just the fact that anime
fans today know Daza Osamu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for one Bungo Stray Dogs character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true isn't it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and people are
like, "Dazai, yeah he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my husband Bungo Stray Dogs." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Not knowing that the real Dazai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was the most depressed
fucking author in probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of Japanese literature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he wrote some, not
just No Longer Human </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he wrote some amazing
pieces of literature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because again, he based
it so much on his real life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the fact that he was just
fucking depressed as hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I feel you have
to be in that head space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to write something that
powerful or just that raw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that just hits and just cuts that deeply. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like an Edgar Allan Poe Situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't write dark poetry like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you had a fucked
up life growing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it feels spoiled, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have anything to worry about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry to bring a downer to this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People even watch less. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But bottom line is that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> regardless of the that we did talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of light depressing
pieces of literature and media, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because it puts you down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day, it doesn't mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something that
people should skip over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that it's equally as important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to experience those kinds
of anime and literature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like to do that,
so that I'm comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with having those
emotions pop up sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I have at
least some experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dealing with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe when someone
else's it's a lot easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you do get to
that point where you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> starting to feel that, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay I kind of understand
where this is coming from." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I know better how to process it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a questions for you
guys going off this then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a bit less depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Has there been any shows or any anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in your history that has
affected you in any way? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not just in the negative
aspects obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just rethinking life, but just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Black Butler- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You definitely has a
rethink life after that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think for me, as much
as I hate to use the word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> changed my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> For me was, and this is
gonna sound cliche as fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but Clannad was one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I totally understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where that laughter comes from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there was a handful of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who laughed at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's so cliche
now, to say that Clannad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I watched that all the way through, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it straight up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That after story fucked me up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the first time that I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not just in anime, but
in any piece of media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just fucking broke down crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because especially that second
half of Clannad After Story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just the most brutal
pain to the longest buildup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And just, I don't think I'll be able to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's again going back million topics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's another show I
don't think I'll be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because again, I'm
not in that head space, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not just the fact that
it was just a sad anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think it's just the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> again you've been kind of
following these characters lives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the way through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas visual novels or
romance stories would end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the couple getting together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Clannad took that one step further </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and showed you as the
title says the after story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of what happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think just seeing
that made these characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even more relatable to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the first time where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You know what family is cool, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Family is fucking dope." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Before that family was just a thing you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a Christian matter of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because before you know,
the concept of family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just very much everybody else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's like, of course family's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, everyone wants a family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But Clannad was that one
show that really dug into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just how important family is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that, I mean,
as weird as it is to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I watched Clannad, I
became way close to my family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's a big aspect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's pretty wholesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is wholesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that really changed my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel really bad now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you're talking about
how can I change your life? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't fucking
finish the first season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's no problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've watched Clannad and After Story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The whole time when I was
watching Clannad, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "When is it gonna get good?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't fucking sing that Dango
song one more time bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dare you to sing that song one more- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause I remember watching
the first eight episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, man
this is trying really hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's the problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that the thing with the
first season of Clannad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never say to people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, you should watch the
first season of Clannad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I know that on
the grand scale of things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the first season is fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't appreciate the second season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't jump into After Story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> without having experienced
these characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it is important. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of these characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do make a very significant
impact in After Story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I guess, you know, it's really hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, especially now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe back then you could
make someone watch 25 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of bullshit to get a good pay off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But now you can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't think you
can recommend anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, because the story structure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the joke structures that pop in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just so overdone now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That it just seems like an aged version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of everything that you can see today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But back when Clannad first
came out in 2009, I believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was about 2007, 2009. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I watched it, after
I watched Haruhi Suzumiya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the first season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is just shittier in every way." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The school dynamic was just garbage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you just watch every high
school anime, and just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, it's in high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the same show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This must be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like to compare the high school anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and see what dynamics they got going on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and see what I'm enjoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Their uniform is different than before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This was a model in their school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going off topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the first time
I watched Seraph The End. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember it was a it was a show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a post-apocalyptic show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how vampires had
taken over the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then for like four episodes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just a fucking high school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Why is
there a high school?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's one show that doesn't
need a high school dynamic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's fucking this show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm guilty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm the only guy
I think who has read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all of that manga so far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm the complete opposite of guilty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I never consumed anything about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is so weird because
for the longest time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if you
guys got these messages. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So many people were asking to make a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Seraph of The End. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's got a really big female following. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you noticed I
don't think there's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a single AniTuber that
has made a video on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they're all dudes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even the few females
we have in the [indistinct] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> community have made it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The first episode of Zeraph of The End </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was one of the best first episodes of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember for a while that we had had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was such a good first episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it was really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - World ending Wars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like you said, high school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gets really good again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they leave high school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They quickly abandon that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'd to think that's
the author being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, this is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit go back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It got really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd say about two
thirds through the manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it hasn't finished yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But about two-thirds through the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it is right now, it gets amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it goes not so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause did the manga
deviate from the anime? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I remember watching All of The Anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was one of those shows where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a good time watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I remember correctly, the manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was really really similar to the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they build on a lot of the things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I thought were really
interesting in the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazingly in the manga as it goes on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then it became really weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and world ending plot kind of trigger E. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like the final villain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they have as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a fine, it's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those shows where I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I had a good time watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to re watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm probably not gonna remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the stuff that happens." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you recommend people
to read it or watch it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I haven't done either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would say watch it and
if you what you've watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then continue onwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll going to probably enjoy it I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up to a certain point and then
you'll start to be confused </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, it's good though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like how they did a lot of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sounds like the most Trump sentence ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like how they did things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It means a lot to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They did things, I
like the things I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally get it though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I actually agree with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a good time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the most 6 out of 10 ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very decent and I
have minimal complaints. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's not much to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're just kind of like, I'm happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm happy with what happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't want an more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was before I had five
Isekai to watch every season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this just took the space of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This came right after the hyper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> season one of Attack of Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember everyone was
hyped as fuck for this app. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it kinda fell off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though I thought the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was pretty fucking hype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just kind of just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It just didn't take off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird as hell because the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> had an amazing fight scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> An orchestrated, fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They were hunting down these vampires. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Really cool episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some reason
that wasn't enough hype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's one of those shows that weirdly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I hear some people still talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't really see anything about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause I think people who read it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are really, really into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the problem with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I just kind of
liked its own identity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it first aired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember when it first aired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I made a joke that I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh it's Attack on Blue
Exorcist with gay vampires." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or something along that line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It very much is an amalgamation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of a lot of different aspects. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the main character
is kind of annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's true as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's never a good sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's annoying cause it's
like I like all of this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we're getting a lot of this one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm just kind of wish it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just be a little less potent, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a lot of shows like that though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've read the manga after it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and no one really spoke about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "I don't
really know why I like this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a certain Black Clover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't read Black Clover. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey man, Black Clover is good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm repping Black Clover man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit, I shouldn't have said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's gonna go off for 40 minutes about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My monkey brain is taking over now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Black Clover, Black Clover. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Black Clover. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For some reason, I
always ended up reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the manga that no one fucking talks about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or gives a shit about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know why I ended up... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think because I don't know anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I find it more interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because no one talks about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm definitely in that phase right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Where I'm just like, I just wanna find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the weirdest fucking unknown
manga and just talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it's not unknown at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I read Terraformars just
because no one speaks about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember liking
what I saw of the anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is funny cause the
anime adaptation was horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember enjoying the concepts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I went back and read all of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I had a fucking great time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Terraformars is awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should definitely read
it if you get the chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Super gory, terrifying cockroaches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you've seen the
thumbnail that Connor has made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about his cockroach story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a Terraformar cockroach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, let me give you a
32nd pitch on Terraformars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's an expedition to Mars,
and there's these cockroaches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that are absolute giga
charged cockroaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gym bro cockroaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they wanna
bring them back to earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to see why they're like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who made these cockroaches like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there must be some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why are they so chad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then it turns out
that these guys can fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then did humans get
injected with bug DNA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> insect DNA to become super humans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then they still keep getting destroyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the giga charged cockroaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just a great war. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a great time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Lots of politics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Lots of Game of Thrones
politics-esk things involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lots of deaths. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you would think that
a really straightforward plot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's about action, big
cockroach fight, big bug boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then it just suddenly... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But then it really quickly... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big bug boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's such a perfect
way to describe it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bug boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You be bug boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't ever feel as
excited for learning one bug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I remember, I remember thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was in high
school the mantis shrimp, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coolest bug in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what the mantis shrimp is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a bug? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the one that punches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It punch, the speed of
sound and it punches so hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that it can't be contained in aquarium. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that chapter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This thing is tiny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when they made a human
formed with a mantis shrimp, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was bro, bro, I know what that is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then yeah, he was RP. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was pretty strong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I've gone off topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But because I remember thinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You read 80 chapters of this thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking that it's just gonna
be big man punch bug man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, that's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you're down frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then it quickly turns into, but wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if earth was trying to take
over Mars and get these samples </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there would be a lot
of up politics involved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with which country is gonna want what. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And so it divulges into a lot of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's really fucking interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The wall building has done really well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's super fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really recommend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry that turned from a 32nd
pitch into a whole discussion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a great manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you, if you something
Gantz, something like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll probably go
right ahead and view it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I've read it,
just after I read Gantz. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I was looking for some very- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Perfect for that kind of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was in the edgy teenager phase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was literally living
my edgy teenager phase, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like six months ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I read Gantz, I read Terraformars . </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes, the edgy teenager phase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you never grow out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love going back
to my edgy teenager phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I really wanna
reread Gantz as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gantz is fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That defined what I was into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as a late teen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so good, Gantz. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like aliens, sexy girls, gore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sign me up baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, there's a scene in Gantz. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I guess because we're used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the normal dynamics in anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where they're like,
"Oh, a hot girl turn up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he wants to have sex with her." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But then he actually
just starts fucking her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he just starts fucking her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Who is this chad?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never seen such a
big chad in anime before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was on the train,
reading this as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a terrible manga
to read on the train. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause every time I'd flick the panel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll just be naked tits and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sex scene The manga is so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so weird that it's
like not even remotely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a realistic depiction of sex. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so weak then suddenly she's
obsessed with him after it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the one thing that's
amazing about Gantz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would to sell people on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is one the monster drawings
and the level of detail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is why you do not want
to watch the anime at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause Gantz is peak mid 2000 Gonzo CG. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You think CG today is bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Watch, Gantz, and you just
see how bad CG was back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just remember just the
absolutely just messed up CG </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of even the opening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> let's see how many times
we can rotate this camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Make everybody sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll put that on the screen
right now, so you can see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The opening was a banger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, that song was so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every time I watched it, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm about to throw up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so dizzying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you enjoyed the good
parts of Darling and the Franks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the mystery and not knowing
anything about the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and wondering, "Oh my God,
how does this all function?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If you like that aspect of world
building you'll love Gantz. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was really impressed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by world building in Gantz, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because not to spoil how it ends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but the actual ending of Gantz itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was very very anticlimactic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Questionable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the actual answers was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of was that you
know that big brain meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was, "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's one of the few series that I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has built up this huge mystery </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and has delivered on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And has delivered on a answer that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's satisfying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The actual ending is not great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but the answers for the main
mysteries were very satisfying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So it doesn't end amazingly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the explanation for all the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was happening is very cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought it was really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's also some stuff in the manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that did not age well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't wanna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone who's read it
will know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, there's a part where
a character does black face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and suddenly turns- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, I completely
forgot about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I read it six months ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's a scene where
one of the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goes to shoot up a thing in public. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He goes to do a public shooting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really really bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Its awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the most yikes moment I've ever- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please don't cancel Oku Hiroya, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's a normal Japanese guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he wears blackface </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then he's just drawn
like an actual black guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's really, really
uncomfortable to read. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you're like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't really know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was the moment
where I went online, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like has anyone else
realized how fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then immediately everyone was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "You know it's good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We kind of turn a blind eye on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its the one thing that
makes it really hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to recommend, because it's
a very interesting series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it does a lot of cool things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but then it's really, really fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That part is you kind of
wish that wasn't there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because then you could
recommend it to edge people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just an example of
something that has an aged well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause when I read that as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of nuance that
is lost in Japanese culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's still, even for Japanese
standards is pretty awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When Gantz was serializing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was very lopsided in
terms of, is this okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or is this not okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know if the Japanese
audience is concerned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with it being racist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's definitely the one giant
stain on Gantz in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Other than the 3D CG. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a pretty damn, I
mean, that's just the stain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just the shit stain on the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have a live action movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the live action was not as horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a lot of people
thought it was gonna be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ca use I watched the live action. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, it wasn't amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Solid 5 out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But , there was definitely
a lot of questionable CG </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it because of course
Japanese live actions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the way that they actually
did the whole Gantz thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the whole feel of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The whole despair of, shit, this wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't know what the fuck is happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They did that really
well in the live action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you think is the
best live action anime movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna say, I know, which one it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which one is for you Gintama? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not familiar with Gintama. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Gintama live action. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never laughed that
hard watching a live action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And not talking about
Dragonball Evolution, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ironic laughing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's genuinely- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It brings out the Gin Tama
spirit, so fucking well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know how the hell they did it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you read a Mana like Gin Tama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or watch an anime like Gin Tama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're there's no way
this can be live action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no fucking way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't translate this
comedy into live action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they somehow did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The mat lads did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like the casting was perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The costumes were perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll take your word for
it, cause I have no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even the action scenes,
because the second half of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes into the first story arc of Gin Tama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And concludes it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, wow, this
is actually really good CG </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and really good choreography. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's very believable ginta movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would watch that again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how good it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was pleasantly surprised
with the Jojo part four movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought some of the
scenes they did pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing with
live-action anime movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The bar is so low that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it good compared
to all these other shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or is it just genuinely good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Being passable is the best compliment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can give an anime live action. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember watching the ghost
in the shell live action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember how
offensively average it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't form an opinion on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I'm just like, "It's okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The ghost in the show was really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's if you watched it as a ghost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the show live action,
it was a four out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you just watched it as like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you just thought okay this
is just a standalone, scifi- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Complex. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bring brain references. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what, I watched
Alita the Battle Angel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you totally forget it's a manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you think it was good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was kind of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's one of the best animated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or manga movies we've had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the ending was just whack man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but I mean, everything
up until the ending was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me, Alita was very
much Ghost in The Shell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I put it higher
than Ghost in The Shell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you read Alita? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, who the fuck has read Alita? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have, that's why I watched the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey has read everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That why I've watched the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I bet, if I watched
the manga I'd like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, very much like Ghost in The Shell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bet if I read the manga
I'd like the manga more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like Ghost in the Shell . </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People who are fans of Ghost in The Shell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before they watched live action, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a shit adaptation
of Ghost in the Show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alita is the exact same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good as a standalone movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But as an adaptation of
Alita it was pretty weak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But at least the Hollywood one is better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than the Japanese adaptation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you watch the attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's with them being Nazis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What's with that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got invited by Madman in
Australia to go to the cinemas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the day, premier day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, "You
can bring a plus one." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I brought my best friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's a huge anime fan and we watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we just kind of sat there
as the credits were rolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just looked over and
I'm like, "How was that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my friend's like, I
know you got me in for free, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I want my money back." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, you what I kind of have to agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with you there man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because my cousin who I've been trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get into anime for ages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Biggest norma, you can kind of think of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Breaking bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was, recommending Attack on Titans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because that's one of the perfect- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Attack on Titans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he fucking ends up watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the attack on Titan live action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he is like, "Yeah,
that wasn't very good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "You were almost there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're this close." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now whenever I
recommended Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Am like, trust me the
anime is so much better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "But is it the same story?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You might not know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's this character called Levi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He wasn't in the live action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they couldn't pronounce his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that's the reason
why they cut him out right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason why Levi's
known in the live action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because they were like,
"These are Japanese actors. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think they can
pronounce the V sound." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm, "You do realize this was written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> by a Japanese person." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - People like that are
the reason why microwave's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> come with instructions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They need a hand to hold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, you watched the movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How'd you fuck up this bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How is he fucking this up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Man, I kind of just stay
away from the movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just stay away from all my movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the only one I've
enjoyed is Edge of Tomorrow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I didn't- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That one was really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tom Hanks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tom Hanks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tom cruise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking Tom Cruise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tom Cruise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it was Tom Hanks, I
would have [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I didn't even realize
that was based on a manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's All You Need is Kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like the edgiest title ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All You Need is Kill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Coming to you next summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually based off a novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was then later adapted into a manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was written by Obata Takeshi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the illustrator for Death Note. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which is also very good manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when I saw, cause I picked up the novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while I was in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was just like,
"All You Need is Kill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck yeah, dude, that sounds awesome." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I read it and the
novel was really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, when they were
promoting in the bookstore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like, "Tom Cruise
movie coming out soon." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, don't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please, please, Tom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But of course I had to go watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm like all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is probably gonna be shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go watch it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "All right, you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll give you this one Hollywood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You did good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was one of the few
films that I watched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh I gotta go
read the source material now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was quite different
from the source material. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It wasn't exactly the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's how you adapt a live
action movie in my opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've gotta change some things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If there was something that is just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's a concept in
a story that you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> will never work in live action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't put it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so simple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yet there are so
many fucking productions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and directors who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, we can do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No, we can definitely." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Assassination Classroom, giant yellow guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking man CG will fix that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a weird adaptation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why, but I've
slowly started to find myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> watching live action, animated movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why, why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you do this to yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gonna give me shit
for watching [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a guilty pleasure for me now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I watched the
Erased live action as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And even though I didn't like Erased. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was on Netflix, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But purely just because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the perfect example of
curiosity killed the cat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I'm just so curious to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How could they possibly adapt this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I go into it, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Amazing, I just wasted an
hour and a half of my life." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are just some animated actions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you just know are gonna be shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's some you watch for the train wreck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but not all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Erased, you don't need to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The Full Metal Alchemist live action. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to watch that to
know it's going to be shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the one thing
I still haven't watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I'm gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The definite one is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna watch the
live action movie now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'll be guys, Metal of
the Alchemist isn't that good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck are you talking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Full Metal Alchemist sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What were you guys on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We should please do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, please don't, please don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You will actually ruin
the story for yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll get a speed run story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, the only reason I
watched the Death Note one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Death Note one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is because, you know, I
wanted to be able to help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the discussion on Twitter and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I got a great video out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can clown on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because everyone's
gonna be waiting for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you can't clown The Erased one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because no one gives a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's why I
didn't make a video on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why watch it, why
waste an hour and a half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I've done that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there are more anime live-action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I haven't made a video on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than ones that I haven't made a video on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because no one needs
to know this is shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need to know this is shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need to share this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everybody already knows it's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have to make a video
on The Parasite live action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because everybody knew
it was gonna be shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I needed to know that
it was gonna to be shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And sure enough, I found out
that it was absolutely garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what blows my mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that sometimes they
may only make the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to promote the garbage movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With Parasite one of those situations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I know Kaiji, the gambler one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was definitely a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That anime was just made
to promote the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the movie was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The movie was questionable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, actually... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I enjoyed the Kaiji movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in this really campy kind of way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But in what world would
you choose the movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over the anime? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh no, absolutely not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolutely not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because watching, watching
the Kaiji live action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was kind of just watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some K drama or J drama. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, do you want to explain what Kaiji is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly to the audience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so, it's a gambling story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this guy racks up this
massive, massive debt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot why he even
racked up this massive debt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember why he did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's for some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, so basically he gets an offer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from this mysterious company
that can clear his debt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That just says, "You
need to go on the ship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're gonna play a bunch of games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you win these games,
then we will clear your debt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or you can go into even greater debt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the basic premise is
just Kaiji on the ship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just after the ship parks over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just him going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bunch of different gambling games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just trying to clear his debt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he's not OP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's the best part,
is that you genuinely... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He loses a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He loses as much as he wins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's great because
you genuinely don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if he's gonna lose or win every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a very quotable show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of people didn't watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think mainly because for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was only published in for ADP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you remember that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was only published in 40P. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It came out in 2007 as
well, it only for ADP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember when I was watching it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Where's the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just know that when you watch
it it's gonna to be like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's definitely worth your time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought the reason why
people didn't watch Kaiji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was because of the art style. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think is that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think there's a ton of reasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why people don't watch it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's got zero female
characters in it, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember a
single female character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got a lot of ugly
bastards in it, I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the one show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has more ugly bastards than hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's Kaiji, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine an NTR plot, but instead of sex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just watching a guy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just NTR gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just Kaiji, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Going from watching Kaiji to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how you
pronounce it, Kakegurui. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kakegurui, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like, how can I watch this shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when this gambling is so fake? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all just gambling to serve the plot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas in Kaiji, it felt real gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Kakegurui was just they threw ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, how do we make
these hot girls orgasm? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just throw in." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The main character always wins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unless it doesn't really matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Then she doesn't win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "Haha,
you didn't expect that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Yeah, but it didn't matter." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There was the one dumb moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the part I dropped the series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was when the girl with the
gun playing Russian roulette </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like it's obvious
no one is going to die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't pretend like someone is going to die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm not stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I couldn't watch it further. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm like, "This is just dumb." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas if that was in Kaiji, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone's gonna die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey and Garnt] Someones gonna die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is great, but then it wasn't sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe both of them could die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the best part about Kaiji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that you just genuinely don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the best part of Kaiji
is the narrator's voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is there just that narrator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in every fucking show of that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's so epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I only see it an anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not watching this
Netflix show and this narrator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes out, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, what's the follow-up series? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The spinoff one with the
middle management, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Tonegawa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tonegawa, maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never watched that
one, was that any good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's quite funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you go in expecting Kaiji, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be very disappointed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you want Kaiji, then
it's better if you read. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno the author's name, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but read some of his other works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Akagi is really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Akagi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Akagi, is basically Mahjong Kaiji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the thing, I had
no interest in Mahjong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was watching the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no fucking rules... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no clue of the
rules of Mahjong either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You get drawn in right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But after I finished Akagi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, man, maybe I should
learn how to play Mahjong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This looks fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know which show was it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a little girls competing
in mahjong tournaments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it might've just
been called Mahjong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, I don't know, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what it was, but I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying my goddamn
best to learn Mahjong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There a lot of shows like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I mean you know,
March Comes in Like a Lion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made me really invested in Shogi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't know
what the fuck Shogi is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then after I watched
March Comes in Like a Lion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna learn Shogi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, I kind of wanna learn Shogi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shogi is just Japanese chess right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know, I'm good at
chess, I wanna be good at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even know how to play chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yet I was like, Shogi looks fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, I don't know
how to play chess Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because of, I just didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We didn't even own a
chess board in my house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know how to play chess, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know the basics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking suck at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't played in years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We need a chess anime, but
obviously, because Shogi- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because I actually
really want a chess anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That would be so good in anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It would be so fucking hype in anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm surprised there hasn't been one yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is because how big is Chess in Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not very big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I guess if
you're gonna play chess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you might as well play Shogi, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because I think a
lot of the grandmasters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are from Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, that's true actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember I got
sucked into this YouTube hole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of just watching a lot of chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no interest in chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no interest in chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Man, this is
actually really interesting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause the history and
just the entire premise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of chess is really, really interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The fact that you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a history around chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically this
massive tournament arc. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's reading about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some the most historical chess games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no interest in chess,
but this was fucking hype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking,
man this would work so well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in an anime or manga setting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I went out to try and find
a single chess anime or manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there just wasn't one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was really, really disappointed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's surprising
honestly, because I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole stereotype with
chess in anime is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, the transfer
student who also happens to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the daughter of the giant companies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, "Let me just do
a little bit of chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on the side line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The way chess is used in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is to make someone look smart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there's no reason
for Lelouch to play chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because he's a tactical genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he's a tactical genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you ever lead with the King Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you never lead with the King. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna tell
people about your hidden- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's you're a chess champion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I was 13 or 12 or I
just started high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was after I left primary school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was playing professional chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And how I ended up
playing professional chess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was weird to begin with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I never played it much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just liked video games a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was the only video game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that my dad would play with me is chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So cause if I wanted- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - EChess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, normal chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I remember I was
playing at year three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> How old are you in year three
in the UK, like eight, nine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eight, nine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the chess club is
only for the last year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was all the 12 year olds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember they wouldn't
let me play with them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but one they let me play with
them and it's just so anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause outside of the chess club </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I beat their best player
in a game of chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then they were like, "No, no
you've got to let this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play with us his good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I beat them all, and
then nothing happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for three years until it was
my time to join the chess club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was allowed to join the club. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I joined the chess club. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And our school had lost every
single chess tournament ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it was a local... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't even know we had this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was a local circuit, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Between all the schools played each other, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like football and every other sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's one for chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember that we
started playing in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and also the guy who is
number two in our chess team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was number
one, we were both equal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is also very anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rival character in everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's power level was on par with mine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My whole chess experience
is genuinely an anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna keep talking and
there's more stuff to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we just started
winning every single game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> against every other school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't even close. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember these kids were bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember every time
they would be shocked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at how quickly we would beat these kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause, it's very different
in professional chess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to playing if somebody doesn't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In professional chess, it's a long thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll get more into it later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> These were games I
could win in 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I can see how they
fucked up and I would take it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, it just made sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't practice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just good at
games and it made sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then one time there was a school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and these guys had been
number one for like 10 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a row or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause they had a guy
who was someone's parent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's obsessed with chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Very, very good at chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we beat his team. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were shocked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, "Not me,
you beat the protege team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is a sports anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a fucking sports anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could base a chess manga
off of your life honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember thinking it
was weird because this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was making like a whole... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Bear in mind, I was 12, I didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And this guy is making a whole commotion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was shocked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was sitting there and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Walk me through everything you did." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't write it down." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because most you're
supposed to write it down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in professional chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was writing it down
and I thought that was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Why don't
you write down your moves? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just did them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not gonna go back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Why did you move here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did you know how
to do that and stuff?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "I don't
know, I just did it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he spoke to my mom, and was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You should come to this thing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's 200 kids come to a place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> By the way, chess for kids is
a really weird kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just adults pushing a bunch
of Cambridge kids to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to a location
and that was 2, 300 kids, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all just playing chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you would get an opponent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you won to lost, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would then play someone who has won. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And the more you kept winning,
the more you would go up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And eventually people
who won all their games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would go on to play for the area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a legit tournament. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Legit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the best [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was killing all my games, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had won four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you play seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I won four in a row. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They were really easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My friend as well, he'd lost two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he was already
out and I felt bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll go on for you friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll see you in the finals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I never had any... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of these kids as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They would be studying
it in between games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I would just whip out
Pokemon at start playing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'll be like, "It's my
time to go and save and play." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I remember, so my fifth game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was against the guy, I beat in my school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The prodigy team or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had to play him again and we drew. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was really anti-climactic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Fuck, I beat him last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna beat him again." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, I got on the team and I was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was struggling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause this is where it was
getting really serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was decent enough where I
could win 70% of my games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was still starting
to get really long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because chess games never
went more than an hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they start becoming two hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm 13. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, "This is [indistinct]." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to play- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I start winning and then I got
content and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, do you wanna play for your country?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Sure, I guess
I'll play for my country." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I'm doing good enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I turn up, I go to
the first tournament. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You won't believe because I was number 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's 10 seats. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 1 is the best 10 is the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was the worst on the country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Worst for the country for team. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Guess who was number one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've told you guys this story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was the main bully at my school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I shit you not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't make this shit up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't make this shit up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I shit you not, it was
the main bully at my school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who no one knew he did this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the point in the manga
where the flashback begins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He used to bully me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was the main rival all along. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He literally was the kid
that everyone was scared of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember thinking man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was really good at Halo Wars too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Then suddenly he's really good at chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was amazing, and he
was winning a lot against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really good players. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bear in mind, when it got to this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was pretty much me, him and eight kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who were gonna go to Cambridge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The environment was really weird as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember just, that
was when I really started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to not enjoy chess anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that when I remember,
when I lost the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got fucked bollocked by the coaches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were furious at me, because
they would take your sheet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because this is when you had
to start writing it down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would take your sheet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they would rinse you for your moves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they would
watch you the whole game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's always an area above
where they can watch you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember if you made a move,
that was under five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've got rinsed for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they were like, "You
didn't think long enough." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've gotta go through the options. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it gets to the
point where you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know that they're
thinking just as many moves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ahead as you are and it's
starting to get really difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you're like, "Fuck,
I haven't studied enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at this point." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I never studied chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But this is where I was
getting to the point where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was against people who
are naturally pretty good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also were studying
all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just a really bad environment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really didn't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would finish my games
and I'd play Pokemon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They would wanna talk about,
so why did you move rook </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to F2, why did you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he was really
impressive when he moved his... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "I don't." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We are playing chess
for eight hours today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I do not wanna talk about
chess in between my games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just a really... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it was a really weird environment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, if I came into
chess later in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would've had a more
healthy enjoyment of chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still like to play it occasionally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think I'm just scarred
from the anime experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause that's what I find
so fascinating about chess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just talking to you and hearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about your chess story and
reading up and watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Magnus Carlsen I think that's his name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Magnus Carlsen, his one the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - His story and how you were just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You were just born and
you just got the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There are people who
just studied the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there are just
people who just are geniuses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking fascinating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking fascinating to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was weird because you kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> No matter how good you are at something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much raw talent
you have at something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you start competing
at such a high level, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you start to realize that
it doesn't matter as much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also you meet people who also... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There might be 10 people in that country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who also have that same raw talent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's like fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause then it starts to
come to who can put them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I didn't care about chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I never cared about chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just good at it,
and I just played it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Such a thing that a
protagonist would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never cared about chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereas the protagonist
would have got to my point lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then been like, "I'm gonna
to dedicate my life to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Pokemon Ranger just came out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm gonna start spinning around that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you took the [indistinct] route. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you're just like, "I
lost, end of the manga." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was just kinda like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It gets to that point in
your life, where you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need this anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember my parents are so sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why my parents
were so invested in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was a mixture of proud </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also they love bragging about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why wouldn't you do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your series got
canceled from poor sales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had a spin off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So what happened is about
when I was 16 or 17, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a rejuvenation of my enjoyment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you remember a website
called MLG Game Battles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was where you could
compete against cob, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also Yahoo Chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember, I would compete
against fully grown men </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and beat them on Yahoo Chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'd get so pissed off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then joined the local pub, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was a weird experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I joined the local pub
chest team and I remember... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bear in mind they were all 80
to 40 year old men, always. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember one time I
was playing against a guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who looked Ross Kemp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A skinhead, terrifying dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like this over the table. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a brick shit out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Every, every bouncer
you see at a nightclub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm 15, 16, like this with my Coke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he had a pint and was smoking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm there with my Coke,
occasionally checking my phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if that pissed him off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in between moves, I wouldn't
look at what he was doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just check my phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I would like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I'm normally thinking in my move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I don't really pay much
attention about doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember when I beat him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he looked really fucking
angry and I was so scared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was, "Is he gonna hit me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like this on the table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't believe you won. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't believe you've done this man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't believe you've done this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> People didn't losing to a 15
year old, that happened a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can understand, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just really committed
to making this a manga mnow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, please, cause from
a narrative perspective, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many interesting ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could tackle chess just as a content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna take that concept
of your friend being beaten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the preliminary and
then just cut to the scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're in the final. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And your friend is that
one guy who narrates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all you'll moves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a speed wagon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like, he just did a [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, what's an [indistinct] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is and then he just goes
along with the explanation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, this is gonna sound so nerdy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's one move in chess
that I always wanted to use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know the name of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was the one where if someone moves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> their pawn to and then in front of... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you move your Pawn 2,
and then move it 2 as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can then take it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's an [indistinct]. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always wanted to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude using a castling
is Op, you always castle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It says, "Why did the castle there?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I'll tell you why he's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember they tried to teach us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, "Why don't you use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Indian Prince opening of 1970?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when I would do an opening move, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always did the same opening
move because I just liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was nice and symmetrical, I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they would always say
why did you use, this person? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, like I said, the
Indian Prince move of 1764. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "What the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like how the Bishop goes to boop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bishop goes, boop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just feels nice, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just feels nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's hard to explain
it when you're a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're just
thinking four moves head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, if this goes
here, and this goes here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this goes here, then you go there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just how you see it, it was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like any sport I imagine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where kids are really good at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the adults are really pushy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and kind of almost borderline... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Some of the kids I'd say they had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a predatory relationship with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of them, again, I said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were very rich
parents whose kids went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to very good private schools </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were destined to
go to Cambridge or Oxford, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter what. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they would, you know
exactly what I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what kind of kids I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the moment you spoke to them? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, we're from a different world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really odd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chess is like their
entire world to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was something that
was forced upon them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it was, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's something that
looks good on the resume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you apply for Cambridge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, to be fair it
got me a few good jobs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it helped a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember some job interviews </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they liked playing chess,
and they would bring it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like, "Oh,
that's cute, you're good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's a really
interesting story that you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, bottom line is we need
to turn this into an anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Most definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If someone was I want
to make a chess anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would absolutely- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just talk to Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He has a very interesting story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If anyone would like a
free story, it's right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's the perfect
chance to teach people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how to play chess as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's a really good game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's one of my
favorite things to sit down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and talk to someone about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just talk and then play chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's a really
good way to, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just have fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's also fun beating people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who think they're good at chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's pretty fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Power trip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I'll meet people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who have just been studying chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's getting really
big on Twitch right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'll meet people who
they're really getting into it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just stomp them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Oh, well." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, here's the thing,
here's the worst part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about chess professionally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that you normally know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five or six moves in
if you've lost or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you have to play it for
another two and a half hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and all it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Crappy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the difference
between casual chess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and professional chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that casually, you
always think you could win, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you outsmart them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Professional chess, it's just
how do I drag this out enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that maybe they'll make a mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God it was awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was awful, I hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it just got to the
point where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the fucking point in this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, being a troll online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm literally just being awkward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just prolonging the inevitable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's like,
"I fucked up, I fucked up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 30 minutes in and now I
gotta put up with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for two and a half hours." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's learning a game of league </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then five minutes in your own side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someones hinting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, someone's hinting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the jungle is just AFK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, "Can I just FF now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we just FF. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is a diamond game right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one's going to make a mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I remember this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I never got praised for winning games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They would always be good job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know when they would praise me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I made it hell for the other person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This poor girl, I dragged it
out and she made a mistake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a stalemate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This game went on for
3 hours and 20 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was something fucking long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember I'd lost an hour in 100%, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just made it awkward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't playing to win anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was playing to make it awkward for her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I did things that
you wouldn't normally do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to try and win. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You would just do it to block
everything that she did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To annoy them right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember she
was getting so stressed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is kind of fun,
but also I hate this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is torture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I got back, it was coming back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the football locker room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nice one let's hit the shower son. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You really made it hell
for that 13 year old girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Congratulations Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, "Man,
that didn't feel good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a stalemate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I worked three hours for a stalemate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolutely cock tease. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's these other
worst ones there where... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember those people
who would constantly... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause you can ask for a draw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, do you want to draw? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it would fuck my psychology up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was like, "Does
this mean I'm winning? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Does this mean his losing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And one time I remember
I regret it to this day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I should have took the draw and I lost it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He gave me an out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a learning experience man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the character development we need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got a little trophy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If you won three games professionally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta a thing called a Wendy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what it was,
it was like a little- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is it called a Wendy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, it's just
says Wendy on the plaque. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a Wendy's burger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just a Plaque
that just says a Wendy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm sure there's some chess people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who know what this is,
but I have no idea what- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please, educate us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was so confused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Why does it not say my name? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I won these things." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not Wendy, I'm Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think also if you Google my name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think my chest records come up- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you dig deep enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People are gonna find them now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll see exactly
which county and country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was playing for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't stalk him though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there anything else
you guys wanna talk about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a huge detour, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think we can
top that chess story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was an intense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just watched the
entire anime, in like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a story I love telling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's one of those
things where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't bring it up if they're
not gonna be invested in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's such a long story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's a really interesting story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember this last time you told me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "We need to
talk about this publicly." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've never talked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bring it up occasionally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine just being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I was a chess pro by accident." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "What do you mean you were
a chess player by accident." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Easy conversation starter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - From a young age though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just always really, really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at video games as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It always just clicked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd always just caught them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To this day I normally get
video games super quickly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just have that talent man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're a tensai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it was English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If they gamed English I'd have
been fucking pro at English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they'd have made it a
spelling fucking simulator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's a good place to end it. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> "What if we just sit down- </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> And we're not going to worry </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> - We could have just sat here
in silence and just been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So what'd you guys want to talk about." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess what kind of
balance do you guys want of... </SPEAKER_00>
