<connor> (Joey slurping) </connor>
<connor> - Mm, very good stuff.
- Clearly didn't put any. </connor>
<joey> (Joey clicking teeth) </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't expect how
bitter that was gonna be. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just black coffee.
- Beans. </connor>
<connor> - The beans. </connor>
<garnt> (relaxing music) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, I didn't
know what an Americano is </garnt>
<garnt> until I moved to Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - You thought it was </connor>
<connor> watered down coffee?
- Yeah, </connor>
<connor> watered down coffee. </connor>
<connor> Yeah because, do you know, </connor>
<connor> I only started caring about
coffee after I moved to Japan </connor>
<connor> because before I moved to Japan </connor>
<connor> it was so easy to get
reasonable coffee, right? </connor>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Why is the Japan coffee
like, so watered down?" </garnt>
<joey> And then it's 'cause everything here </joey>
<garnt> is like Americano, it's just </garnt>
<garnt> watered down espressos.
- Yeah, it's like </garnt>
<joey> Americano standard of coffee. </joey>
<garnt> Is this the cold open? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess so. </joey>
<connor> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<garnt> - Hey, you're not the host. </garnt>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Happy New Year, boys and girls. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of- </joey>
<garnt> - Well hopefully it's happy New Years. </garnt>
<joey> Happy New Year for us, </joey>
<joey> but maybe for you, </joey>
<joey> it is New Years Eve.
- Happy New Years Eve, </joey>
<garnt> if you're in America. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're in Japan or around that area, </garnt>
<garnt> then happy New Year, welcome to 2022. </garnt>
<joey> I'm Joey, and I'm with
Garnt and Connor as always. </joey>
<connor> And it's the new year, new me. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You look like you were just like, </connor>
<joey> serving tables, I just realized. </joey>
<garnt> (speakers laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I'm here to serve you some
content ladies and gentlemen. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Joey just
finished his part-time job </connor>
<connor> serving some tables. </connor>
<joey> - Just quickly ran down, you know, </joey>
<joey> YouTube's been tough in 2021, </joey>
<joey> almost got my channel canceled, sorry. </joey>
<garnt> - I got to ask, did you cut your hair </garnt>
<joey> because you were just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's a new year in the podcast. </joey>
<joey> New year, new me?" </joey>
<garnt> - No, that's totally
coincidental actually. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "Oh yeah, this
episode is gonna be New Years, </joey>
<garnt> and I'll look completely different." </garnt>
<garnt> No, I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to get a haircut anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was, oh, I
am still at the point. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I actually
went back to Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> but I figured if I'm gonna see my parents </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time in two years, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe get rid of the Jesus hair, you know? </garnt>
<joey> Get a fresh cut. </joey>
<garnt> - So, last week I believe
we commented on the country, </garnt>
<garnt> thankfully, opening back up, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's going to be very dated now, </garnt>
<garnt> because as we're filming this episode, </garnt>
<garnt> the country's closed back down. </garnt>
<garnt> So by the time this episode comes out, </garnt>
<garnt> we don't know where
the country's gonna be. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, maybe it's gonna be open, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's gonna be closed, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Ladies and gentlemen, the Omicron. </joey>
<connor> - Let's just stoop
commenting on current events. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's probably good. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's just stop doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then Mr. B screwed, I'm kidding. </garnt>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah so, </connor>
<joey> yeah, like literally as of
yesterday of us recording, </joey>
<joey> Japan announced that they're </joey>
<joey> gonna shut down the country again, </joey>
<joey> which is honestly like, I give them props </joey>
<connor> that they acted so goddamn quickly. </connor>
<connor> Like, this new prime minister </connor>
<connor> is not fucking around.
- Hold up, hold up, </connor>
<joey> let's pretend, </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> if this was something else, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, this was something that
Japan wasn't eager to do, </connor>
<connor> this would have taken months. </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Oh we can, </connor>
<joey> we have an excuse to close borders? </joey>
<joey> Oh shit, yeah, well close them." </joey>
<joey> - Well, they didn't do that
with the Olympics, did they? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, well, I mean, you know, </connor>
<joey> it depends.
- I think that </joey>
<joey> when I saw online that the
prime minister was like, </joey>
<joey> I think it was like two days prior </joey>
<joey> that the new strain had
been announced, right? </joey>
<joey> And then everyone on
Twitter was like, oh shit, </joey>
<joey> it only took the government
two days to act upon this. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like- </joey>
<connor> - Oh no, they decided-
- Why is this like, </connor>
<connor> a rare event? </connor>
<joey> Shouldn't that be normal. </joey>
<connor> - They decided the moment on, </connor>
<connor> they just took them
two days to approve it, </connor>
<connor> and then some. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<joey> - They knew what they were doing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But anyway, current events, bad. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Current event's </joey>
<joey> bad.
- Sad. </joey>
<joey> New year, it's over. </joey>
<joey> New year, new me. </joey>
<joey> New year.
- It's 2022 guys. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wait, did we, </joey>
<joey> okay, actually did we say our
like, new year's resolution? </joey>
<garnt> I think we did, 'cause
Chris was on, right? </garnt>
<garnt> We said what we wanted to do. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you remember what you said? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean I- </garnt>
<connor> - I remember what I said. </connor>
<connor> - What, last year? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't remember </connor>
<connor> what I said last year.
- Our first episode </connor>
<garnt> of last year?
- Oh, last year? </garnt>
<garnt> - It goes to show, right? </garnt>
<joey> We're all fucking good with
our new year's resolution, </joey>
<joey> but I remember what I said. </joey>
<joey> - What did you say?
- I remember </joey>
<joey> sarcastically saying to Chris, </joey>
<connor> I wanna be on the Abroad in Japan Channel. </connor>
<joey> Unfortunately.
- And now you are. </joey>
<garnt> - Unfortunately it's happened many times, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, and it did. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you actually got through </connor>
<joey> with your new year's resolution? </joey>
<garnt> You should be proud.
- You're the first person </garnt>
<garnt> I know who actually did their </garnt>
<connor> new year's resolution.
- Cheers to me, boys. </connor>
<joey> Cheers to me, cheers, cheers. </joey>
<connor> Celebrate my success, gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Very good. </joey>
<joey> I appreciate that.
- Wait, that was a... </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I brought a </joey>
<joey> New Year's-
- Was this the </joey>
<joey> Rubik's cube thing? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Was yours the Rubik's cube? </joey>
<connor> Was that 2019? </connor>
<joey> I think that was 2019, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've been able to do a Rubik's cube </joey>
<joey> for the past two years now, at least. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, every time we have a
Rubik's cube in the office now, </garnt>
<joey> Joey just goes ahead and solves it, </joey>
<joey> so he's been able to do it for a while. </joey>
<joey> I do not remember you saying that </joey>
<joey> as a new year's resolution, </joey>
<joey> though.
- I don't think I </joey>
<garnt> gave in years resolution, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I haven't really been a guy to, </joey>
<garnt> like, choose new year's resolutions, </garnt>
<connor> because for the most
like three or four years, </connor>
<joey> I just haven't been able to do them, so. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it must be like, I
feel bad for the viewers, </connor>
<connor> who probably think that we have
like dementia or something, </connor>
<connor> that we can't remember
anything what we've said. </connor>
<connor> And then we're like, </connor>
<connor> and we probably had this
conversation last year </connor>
<connor> where we're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, so we just don't like them, </connor>
<connor> so we just decided," </connor>
<connor> I remember I must've said
something along the lines of, </connor>
<connor> "I just prefer small goals that I just." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I can't, </connor>
<garnt> I don't even remember what
I say like a week ago. </garnt>
<garnt> Like sometimes I have a
conversation with my mom, </garnt>
<connor> and she was just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh yeah, when you were
talking about this, </joey>
<joey> I can't believe you said that." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Mom, I do not remember
saying those words at all." </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't even remember
what I had for like, </garnt>
<joey> dinner like three days ago. </joey>
<connor> So it was like, you can't expect
me to remember after like, </connor>
<joey> what was like a hundred plus hours </joey>
<joey> of us talking on this show, </joey>
<joey> but you just like, remember
this one little detail? </joey>
<joey> It's not gonna happen. </joey>
<garnt> - No, 'cause like, I remember
talking about current events, </garnt>
<joey> Joey's channel right now with the- </joey>
<joey> - Is in the dire straits. </joey>
<joey> - Is in the dire straits, </joey>
<joey> and of course he uploads
to his second channel, </joey>
<joey> and I see it's blown up, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause even my mum, </joey>
<garnt> my mum sends me a message and she's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I just saw that Joey's
channels in trouble. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you given him a phone
call to make sure he's okay?" </garnt>
<joey> - And I'm just like, just
breaking down, crying, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like in my bed, just
weeping into my pillow. </joey>
<joey> I mean like, as of right now, </joey>
<joey> it still hasn't been resolved, </joey>
<joey> but luckily I have contacted YouTube, </joey>
<connor> and I'm pretty confident
it's gonna get resolved, </connor>
<connor> so that's why I'm not like,
too stressed about it, </connor>
<connor> but it was very humbling
when I made that video, </connor>
<connor> and like, so many people
came to me and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, yeah, I'll subscribe and all that." </connor>
<joey> So thanks if you did. </joey>
<connor> - I really like, you know... </connor>
<connor> I like a situation that I
know is gonna be resolved, </connor>
<garnt> but I can still make a
video complaining about it, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get monetized. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, you get monetized. </joey>
<joey> - But also it's pushed
like a week off work, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you don't have to upload that one. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, fantastic. </connor>
<joey> - So I can't upload for
two weeks, all right, </joey>
<connor> 'cause of all the- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Guys, </joey>
<connor> I just wanna bring you this content. </connor>
<connor> I really do, I just, </connor>
<connor> oh, I just can't. </connor>
<joey> - Well, you know, it's like, </joey>
<joey> it is bittersweet, to be fair, </joey>
<joey> because it's like, </joey>
<joey> it's cool that this has
been like this explosion </joey>
<joey> and stuff on the second
channel, but it's like, </joey>
<joey> I wish I didn't have to resort to this. </joey>
<joey> I wish it like, </joey>
<joey> my main channel,
literally on life support, </joey>
<joey> wasn't the reason why I
was getting all these subs. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I mean your second channel </garnt>
<garnt> has basically been becoming your </garnt>
<garnt> anime channel for the long
time, for the longest time. </garnt>
<joey> So what if you just like
migrating the anime man </joey>
<joey> to just now it's just Joey? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I could.
- It's exactly </joey>
<joey> what you wanted all your career, </joey>
<garnt> right?
- It could, it could happen. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, it's like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna lose nine years. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] What if you
pulled an epic prank, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right? </joey>
<connor> You just change the names and
pictures of both the channels. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What like, so Joey has his own? </joey>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Have you thought about it, really, like? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it could work. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe for like, </garnt>
<joey> an hour.
- The old switch-a-roo? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- A good day to switch. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah guys, sub to my second channel." </joey>
<joey> Wink, wink.
- JK, </joey>
<joey> this was the anime man. </joey>
<garnt> - This was the same channel all along. </garnt>
<joey> - And then you like, tell everyone, </joey>
<joey> like, there's a good group. </joey>
<joey> You tell everyone, like on Joey, </joey>
<connor> if you go and comment
on the new Joey channel, </connor>
<connor> tell them, "Man, I really
love this Joey content." </connor>
<connor> Just spam all the comments, </connor>
<connor> so now nobody can see the old comments. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> well we can all (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - Now this can be the side. </connor>
<joey> - So if I actually did do it, </joey>
<joey> "Here you go, guys. </joey>
<joey> It was a prank, you just got pranked." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I really love
the new Joey channel. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Nah, but I'm hoping like
next couple of days, </joey>
<joey> it will get resolved. </joey>
<garnt> - You can't upload for two weeks? </garnt>
<joey> - I can't upload for two weeks, no, </joey>
<joey> which sucks because I have to like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause especially when
you're dealing with sponsors, </joey>
<connor> I have to tell them like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh sorry, YouTube did a big fucky-wucky, </connor>
<connor> and now I can't upload." </connor>
<connor> So it's very annoying
having to explain that </connor>
<joey> to companies who clearly
don't understand, like, </joey>
<joey> "Just upload." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - "Your channel's still
there, just upload." </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "No, no, no,
that's not how it works." </joey>
<garnt> - It's just the life of a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> where you just wake up one day maybe, </garnt>
<garnt> and you just find out that
maybe your career is in danger, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess all of this is
like, now out of my hands." </garnt>
<joey> - It was so shit as well, </joey>
<joey> because I got the strike
literally the day, </joey>
<joey> the night I came back
from Hokkaido, right? </joey>
<joey> Also it was after a five
day trip with Chris, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, all right,
I gotta just relax now, </joey>
<joey> just get on my computer, maybe watch some, </joey>
<joey> and my channel's about to die. </joey>
<joey> Amazing, thanks YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I was extremely drunk </connor>
<garnt> when all of my channel
got copyright claimed. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember that. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey snickering) </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- I was like, </joey>
<joey> I didn't know how to process it, </joey>
<joey> because I was drunk, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah? </joey>
<joey> - So I was like, 'cause
I just had a night out. </joey>
<garnt> I think I was with Garnt, we
must have had a night out. </garnt>
<connor> I think I was like, just very like. </connor>
<garnt> - Was that the night that you accidentally </garnt>
<connor> deleted one of your videos. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was another night. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] That was a different night. </joey>
<joey> - To be fair, I'm sure we
would have done that as well. </joey>
<garnt> I would have made that mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> I do remember, God, I must sound terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have we told that story yet? </garnt>
<connor> - We have told that story, </connor>
<connor> I got really drunk, </connor>
<connor> and it was like 4:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> and we were at your friend's house. </connor>
<connor> But no, I remember </connor>
<connor> I was on a trip with Garnt, </connor>
<connor> and we just had like the one night out, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, yeah, it
was a really good night. </connor>
<connor> And then it was like 4:00 AM,
and I was about to go to bed. </connor>
<connor> And then my email was
like, could hear like, </connor>
<connor> oh poor tuna just playing in my head. </connor>
<connor> Like YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, </connor>
<connor> copyright claim has been filed. </connor>
<connor> I was like... </connor>
<connor> (Connor sighing heavily) </connor>
<connor> Like, what do you even do? </connor>
<joey> Like, do you sober up mentally? </joey>
<connor> But you're not sober up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know? </joey>
<joey> You're like, oh, I'm gonna sleep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, your brain's on a
hundred percent overdrive. </joey>
<joey> It's just, you can't </joey>
<joey> do anything about it.
- 'Cause the problem is </joey>
<garnt> you wanna sort it out
there and then, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You just wanna like get
in contact with someone, </garnt>
<garnt> just know that you're in the
process of it being sorted out, </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of the times,
you just gotta wait, </garnt>
<garnt> and you just gotta make noise, </garnt>
<garnt> and just gotta like, </garnt>
<garnt> hope that someone can
sort this out for you. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, have I ever told this story </connor>
<connor> about what happened to all that? </connor>
<joey> The one that got caught
with the (indistinct)? </joey>
<joey> - I think-
- Not on "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, not on "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, like twice now </joey>
<joey> all of my channels has been claimed </joey>
<connor> for the same reason, twice, right? </connor>
<connor> So I was using this outro
song that I think I heard, </connor>
<connor> where did I get it? </connor>
<connor> I think I heard it on
Sky William's channel, </connor>
<connor> which is like, that's a fuckin'... </connor>
<joey> - That's a throwback. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's a throwback. </joey>
<joey> He used it as his outro. </joey>
<joey> I thought, "I like that." </joey>
<joey> And also I was like, I
had like a hundred subs, </joey>
<joey> so I thought, "It's okay if I just like, </joey>
<joey> take the same outro, right?" </joey>
<connor> - Of course.
- Of course. </connor>
<connor> - "No one's gonna see it." </connor>
<joey> And then obviously like, people saw it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I'm like, </joey>
<joey> got some Sky Williams fans.
- 'Cause people loved it, </joey>
<connor> 'cause he was a banger. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Such a banger in fact,
that I had to buy license. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And I didn't know there was
an original, original song, </connor>
<connor> I just thought it was just this one song. </connor>
<joey> - Right, so you had the remix version? </joey>
<connor> - So I had the remix version. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know that it was a remix, right? </connor>
<connor> So I went to the artist who made it, </connor>
<connor> and the song had a lot of views. </connor>
<connor> It was called like, "Do
it for Love" or something. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I had this, and I used
this on every single video. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Well yeah, it was your outro. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, then of course, </joey>
<joey> this come to bite me in the ass. </joey>
<joey> I didn't just play it
when the video ended, </joey>
<joey> it would like fade into the video. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So this will come back to bite me later. </joey>
<joey> So I got, in like 2000, maybe '17 or '16, </joey>
<connor> I got, I wanna say 80% of my
channel copyright claimed. </connor>
<connor> And this is on the old system as well, </connor>
<connor> where it wouldn't tell you, </connor>
<connor> which I think it didn't tell you </connor>
<connor> which time it was copyright claimed. </connor>
<connor> It would just say you've
been copyright claimed, </connor>
<joey> this is the thing.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it was by a company that was </joey>
<joey> on behalf of the artist </joey>
<joey> who I purchased the license from for $50. </joey>
<connor> I bought this license. </connor>
<connor> Back then I thought, "Holy
shit, it's so much money. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, this is how
much the licenses cost?" </connor>
<joey> - It's like a whole month on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm like, well basically. </joey>
<joey> - At that time.
- At that time, </joey>
<joey> it was like a lot of money, you know? </joey>
<joey> And this is back when I was
terrified of everything, </joey>
<connor> and I remember I bought
licenses to fonts and shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure I'm the only
person on earth who paid </connor>
<connor> for license for a font. </connor>
<connor> - Have you paid for WinRAR? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I want to though, </connor>
<garnt> just to tell the guy I appreciate it. </garnt>
<joey> - But you have to be above
the age of 70 to do it. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna meet a single
person who has paid </garnt>
<garnt> for WinRAR.
- I'm gonna do it </garnt>
<garnt> on live stream, I'm gonna do it live. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Just to see what happens? </joey>
<garnt> - I just wanna see what happens. </garnt>
<garnt> What happens?
- Do you just explode? </garnt>
<connor> So it's like... </connor>
<connor> (Joey groans) </connor>
<joey> We weren't designed for this. </joey>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - The stream just ends. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I buy WinRAR. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a test. </connor>
<connor> You win life at that point, you know? </connor>
<connor> - It's like, congratulations. </connor>
<connor> - The simulation shuts down, </connor>
<connor> and you just see like the congrat, </connor>
<garnt> like the entire world just
disintegrates around you. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just wake up like... </garnt>
<connor> (Joey gasping) </connor>
<connor> - You know the Bible story from like, </connor>
<connor> a hundred episodes ago? </connor>
<connor> It's just that. </connor>
<connor> It's like, there are
people who pay for WinRAR, </connor>
<joey> and there are people who don't. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] God comes down and says stop. </joey>
<joey> - You know the flying society thing? </joey>
<joey> Like, society, everyone paid for WinRAR. </joey>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I paid for this license
and whatnot, right? </connor>
<connor> And I angrily emailed the guy. </connor>
<connor> Bear in mind, I was like 19, </connor>
<joey> so I was like trying to conduct
myself as a businessman, </joey>
<joey> but I didn't know what
the fuck I was doing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I angrily emailed him
from my Hotmail account, </joey>
<joey> and I instructed him that
I'd purchased this license, </joey>
<joey> please tell this person to stop. </joey>
<joey> And so this whole thing where </joey>
<joey> the guy wrote me an email being like, </joey>
<connor> "Hey, you have my word that
you bought the license." </connor>
<connor> And I had like, PayPal receipts. </connor>
<connor> So then I had to email this company </connor>
<connor> that was claiming on behalf,
which I think was Distrokid. </connor>
<connor> So he had put this song in
a copyright claiming thing, </connor>
<connor> so it went around. </connor>
<connor> So I had a bit of
difficulty, it took a while, </connor>
<joey> but I eventually got Distrokid to like, </joey>
<joey> stop claiming my stuff, </joey>
<joey> and they stopped claiming
it all, and it was good. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember how I did it. </joey>
<joey> It was like this long,
whole process, it was awful. </joey>
<connor> And then all good, all good. </connor>
<connor> I kept using the outro after that. </connor>
<connor> This is where I should
have learned my lesson, </connor>
<connor> and changed the outro, but I'd thought, </connor>
<connor> "I'd won the battle. </connor>
<connor> I'd won it, I'd done it." </connor>
<joey> - Also, the song is a banger. </joey>
<connor> - The song kind of slaps, right? </connor>
<connor> I'd thought, okay, </connor>
<connor> I'd proven to some entity
that this is legit, </connor>
<joey> and I have the artist who
says that it's all good. </joey>
<joey> And I thought, okay, this is it. </joey>
<joey> I'm good to use this now. </joey>
<connor> Like, I paid for it. </connor>
<connor> I got proof and we're all Gucci. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so I carry on using it. </connor>
<connor> And then, maybe a year later, I wanna say, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how long
exactly, there was a timeline, </connor>
<connor> I get claimed again. </connor>
<joey> This time, like two-thirds
of my channel, I want to say, </joey>
<joey> and this is right before they
added the option to mute. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So like, now if you
get copyright claimed, </connor>
<connor> 'cause sometimes there's
still bullshit claims. </connor>
<connor> They'll find like one second, </connor>
<connor> and then they'll say "We
own the entire video." </connor>
<garnt> So just mute it for one second. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck off, </garnt>
<connor> you can have it.
- You can mute it, </connor>
<connor> or delete the segments, </connor>
<joey> which is one of the more positive changes </joey>
<connor> YouTube has made.
- A Godsend. </connor>
<garnt> - You know?
- Definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - And unfortunately
this situation happened, </garnt>
<connor> I wanna say like, one before
they introduced that tool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I got all of my thing claimed, </connor>
<connor> and I was kind of like,
what the fuck do I do? </connor>
<connor> Because two thirds of
my revenue just like, </connor>
<connor> got Thanos'd away. </connor>
<connor> And this happened to my channel for about, </connor>
<connor> I wanna say two months straight. </connor>
<connor> So for two months straight,
my earnings are like this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I lost so much money
that I never got back, </connor>
<connor> so it's very, very, </connor>
<connor> I'm still to this day
quite annoyed about that. </connor>
<connor> And I went on this whole thing of like, </connor>
<connor> all right, what the fuck is going on? </connor>
<garnt> So, it was like Warner Brothers
or something had claimed it </garnt>
<garnt> on behalf of some artists
that I'd never heard of. </garnt>
<garnt> I go, and I find out
that this was a remix, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> And apparently this was like a big artist, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm an idiot, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I didn't know who this person was. </garnt>
<connor> - That's probably why it was a banger. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why it was a banger. </connor>
<garnt> And so, I was like,
okay, so this is weird. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought that he sold me this license, </garnt>
<connor> and it was good. </connor>
<garnt> So I very confidently counter
every single claim thinking, </garnt>
<connor> "I've got the license, it's all good," </connor>
<connor> and then I get denied. </connor>
<connor> And then I appeal them
as well, which is like, </connor>
<connor> if you lose all these appeals,
your channel gets deleted. </connor>
<connor> So I appealed a bunch of them, </connor>
<connor> and for some reason I just
got denied the appeal, </connor>
<connor> but nothing happened. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So I just couldn't
appeal again, it was weird. </connor>
<connor> And so now, now I was starting
to be like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Like, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> I counted all these claims and
stuff and nothing happened, </connor>
<connor> and I don't really know what to do now. </connor>
<connor> So I remember I got in touch </connor>
<connor> with the guy who I
bought the license from, </connor>
<connor> who was the artist who made the song. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Hey, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What's going on, man? </connor>
<connor> You sold me a license. </connor>
<connor> Is it good, or is it not?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Well, I have
the license to make the remix, </connor>
<connor> but I don't think," </connor>
<connor> and then he was like, "I'm not
sure what I can and can't," </connor>
<connor> and I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> And then I asked a YouTube
man who is a lawyer man. </connor>
<connor> He gave me advice that
was not legal advice. </connor>
<connor> Every single sentence ended with, </connor>
<connor> "This is not legal advice," </connor>
<connor> He basically informed me that yeah, </connor>
<connor> this license was no good. </connor>
<joey> It was like nothing. </joey>
<joey> - Bogus. </joey>
<joey> - Whether the artist knew
that or not, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> He might genuinely not have known. </connor>
<connor> So he basically- </connor>
<joey> - Well if he's like an
Indie artist as well, </joey>
<connor> he's probably- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I assumed that he didn't fully know. </connor>
<joey> - Do you stroke it? </joey>
<joey> I don't think he knew.
- I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - It was a weird thing, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> and so I asked the guy, </connor>
<connor> I went had like really angry DMs with him </connor>
<connor> back and forth where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "So can I use this? </connor>
<connor> Did you fuck me over?" </connor>
<connor> Like, "Do you know how
much this fucks me?" </connor>
<connor> Like, "What am I supposed to do?" </connor>
<connor> And so in the end it turned out, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I was in the wrong, </connor>
<connor> because I had been sold this bogus license </connor>
<connor> that was like, not real. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so then I was like,
well fuck, what do I do now? </connor>
<connor> I've just lost like three or four, </connor>
<connor> I think it was three years of YouTube work </connor>
<connor> that is just gone. </connor>
<connor> I just can't use any of it. </connor>
<connor> - So scary, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so I made this video ranting, </connor>
<joey> being like, "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> Like, "What do I do? </joey>
<joey> That's just so fucked. </joey>
<joey> I've been wronged," et cetera, et cetera. </joey>
<joey> And you know, and I YouTube
for help at the time, </joey>
<connor> they just didn't help me. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, well,
what the fuck am I doing? </connor>
<connor> And then funny enough, </connor>
<connor> I had a YouTube partner manager
before all of this went down </connor>
<connor> who was really good, surprisingly, </connor>
<connor> because normally they don't talk to you. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then that person left the company, </connor>
<connor> and then I got someone new, </connor>
<connor> and they introduced
themselves through an email, </connor>
<connor> and then never heard from them again. </connor>
<connor> (Joey snorting) </connor>
<connor> - That's how it always is. </connor>
<joey> - That's how it is, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so I went on like
a mini-rant in this video </joey>
<joey> being like, Yeah, YouTube is useless. </joey>
<joey> They don't do anything. </joey>
<joey> I have the shoe-shoe person. </joey>
<joey> They never talked to me. </joey>
<joey> They don't help me at all." </joey>
<joey> After that video goes live, </joey>
<joey> I got an email from a YouTube person. </joey>
<joey> It was like, "Hey."
- Of course. </joey>
<joey> - "Hey, I'm that person
that you were like, </joey>
<joey> was saying that was useless.
- Shit-talking? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I'd actually like to
help your situation out." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh, okay, that's great. </joey>
<joey> Awesome." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So they basically said, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, so what we can do </joey>
<joey> is we can go through every single video, </joey>
<joey> and if you send me the file again, </joey>
<joey> without the music in it, </joey>
<joey> we can replace the video </joey>
<joey> and take off the thing."
- Like on the back? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, I had to go through 200
videos, and re-render them, </connor>
<joey> or just cut out the music, </joey>
<joey> 'cause some of the files, </joey>
<joey> I didn't have the original files anymore. </joey>
<joey> Like, the Adobe file or
whatever, like it was tough. </joey>
<joey> Luckily, a lot of the more recent ones, </joey>
<garnt> the ones I liked and was more proud of, </garnt>
<garnt> like at that time. </garnt>
<garnt> - You had the original files. </garnt>
<joey> - I had the original files. </joey>
<joey> So, we had like 200 videos on Google Drive </joey>
<connor> linked in an Excel spreadsheet, </connor>
<connor> and then we had to one by one swap them. </connor>
<connor> But this process wasn't perfect either, </connor>
<connor> because videos got uploaded
to the wrong video. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - So like. </connor>
<connor> - So you'd click on a
certain thumbnail and title, </connor>
<joey> and it took you to a
different video, right? </joey>
<connor> - It was like, that
was the original video, </connor>
<joey> and then they replaced
it with another video </joey>
<connor> that got put there. </connor>
<joey> Like I did like, there was like a, </joey>
<joey> I remember it was an "Attack
on Titan" impressions, </joey>
<connor> and "Yuri on Ice" impressions. </connor>
<connor> They both got swapped, </connor>
<connor> so when people went to
"Yuri on Ice" impressions, </connor>
<joey> it was just me doing
"Attack on Titan" things, </joey>
<joey> and then when it was the other one, </joey>
<joey> it was the other video. </joey>
<joey> And I sat there with
YouTube for like an hour </joey>
<joey> trying to explain to
them what was happening, </joey>
<joey> because the subtitles also got swapped. </joey>
<joey> So they were looking at the
video only in the subtitles, </joey>
<joey> like the raw subtitle data, </joey>
<joey> and they were like, "No,
no, it's the right one. </joey>
<joey> You're talking about 'Yuri on Ice' </joey>
<joey> in the subtitles or something," </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "No,
no, no, no, the video, </joey>
<joey> the video is wrong." </joey>
<joey> And I was like panicking, </joey>
<connor> and I was getting tons
of comments being like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is going on? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, fix this. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you not just like,
swap the titles around? </garnt>
<connor> - It was just weird, </connor>
<garnt> because all the entire video </garnt>
<garnt> is swapped.
- Did you see what Joey is </garnt>
<garnt> gonna do with this channel? </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Do a whole switch-a-roo. </joey>
<connor> - I wonder what the side
effects are of this is like, </connor>
<garnt> so eventually we got it all sorted. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just go on the channel when like, </garnt>
<connor> why has this "Attack on Titan"
video got "Yuri on Ice?" </connor>
<connor> Like, what's going on there? </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, so all the
comments were like that too. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't remember Yuri </joey>
<joey> in "Attack on Titans."
- Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> So it was all weird, and then like, again, </joey>
<joey> like two months later, </joey>
<joey> it finally all got done, and we did it. </joey>
<joey> Some of the videos, like I
said, they couldn't be salvaged. </joey>
<connor> And the reason why it
came to bite me back later </connor>
<connor> was because some outros in
my videos now, I just mute. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So you can't hear anything. </connor>
<joey> - Also 'cause like, I
had the exact same thing, </joey>
<connor> but after YouTube introduced
the whole muting thing. </connor>
<connor> So I had my old, old intro. </connor>
<garnt> So my current intro now is
made by my friend from uni </garnt>
<garnt> who used to be like a music
producer and it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> not even out on like
any website or anything. </garnt>
<joey> So I know it's like, good. </joey>
<joey> It's all copyright free, </joey>
<joey> because I had the exact
same thing where I saw, </joey>
<joey> like I went on to like SoundCloud, </joey>
<joey> and I found like this
really like banger song. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, cool, I'll use it as an outro," </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like kind of wacky, goofy. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, all the gaming YouTube </joey>
<joey> was using it at the time. </joey>
<garnt> And then of course, </garnt>
<garnt> that artist got really
popular on SoundCloud. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Because every
YouTuber was using. </garnt>
<garnt> - Got a major record label because of it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the record label
copywrite claimed all of my shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I had, same thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I DM'd the artist, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah, so what's happening now? </joey>
<joey> You said I could use it." </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Yeah, but
I'm like a big shot now. </joey>
<joey> I got a major record
label, and unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> I can't do anything for you." </joey>
<joey> But luckily this was
during the time where, </joey>
<joey> again, YouTube introduced
the muting thing. </joey>
<connor> - Still kind of shitty of them to not, </connor>
<connor> if you asked, did you ask
them permission initially? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> So I asked, so I DM'd the artist initially </connor>
<connor> when she was just on SoundCloud, </connor>
<joey> and she was like, "Yeah,
please, go for it. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'd love that." </joey>
<joey> Like just, you know, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - That's kind of fucked up, what the heck? </joey>
<joey> - "Just link it in the
description, you'll be all good." </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh sweet,
that's very nice of her. </joey>
<joey> And then yeah, she was like, </joey>
<connor> "Well, sorry. </connor>
<connor> That's not my decision,
that's my label's decision. </connor>
<connor> So, sorry." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] So shitty. </connor>
<connor> - So like, if you go back
to videos from like 2017, </connor>
<joey> where I use that outro,
they're all mute at the end. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've got a lot of videos </joey>
<joey> where it's just me talking at the end, </joey>
<joey> and I still get comments
just saying, being like, </joey>
<joey> "Why does it just go silent?" </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Yeah, man." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I've
had to use that feature </connor>
<connor> for some of my videos, </connor>
<connor> but like I don't mute it. </connor>
<connor> I just cut out like the- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, now you can replace the music. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can replace the music, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I believe I had to
do that for "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> or something, right? </connor>
<connor> Because that got copyright
claimed or something. </connor>
<connor> one of the specials, or something. </connor>
<connor> Oh, and "After Dark" as well. </connor>
<connor> For some reason I'll
intro for "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> got copyright claims, and after that- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] On Twitch. </connor>
<joey> - On Twitch. </joey>
<joey> - A royalty-free song. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a royalty-free
song, but Twitch was like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, no, no." </joey>
<connor> - Well the copywrite
system's unfortunately </connor>
<connor> really easy to abuse. </connor>
<connor> Like, you can stick any
old fuckin' piece of music, </connor>
<garnt> and start claiming shit, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's only until
somebody like, stops you. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like the weirdest
copyright claimed I've gotten </garnt>
<garnt> is like for anime music that
I've put into my videos. </garnt>
<garnt> Like before, like anime
oversees were just free game, </garnt>
<garnt> because Japan, the anime industry
didn't really give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And now they're slowly coming
to realize, wait a minute, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers use our music. </garnt>
<garnt> How can this be? </garnt>
<garnt> So like now anime OSTs are
starting to be claimed as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but I didn't get claimed by
one of the anime companies. </garnt>
<garnt> So I, in one of my videos,
I had "You Say Run" on it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I got claimed, and
"You Say Run" got claimed, </garnt>
<garnt> but it didn't get claimed, </garnt>
<garnt> it got claimed by our cover of </garnt>
<garnt> "You Say Run."
- What? </garnt>
<garnt> - So a YouTuber who I believe
is signed with a record label </garnt>
<garnt> also made a video where they
made a cover of "You Say Run," </garnt>
<garnt> and that's got like, the
original "You Say Run" </garnt>
<garnt> that I used in my video
got claimed by a cover </garnt>
<garnt> of "You Say Run".
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, that's, </garnt>
<garnt> where do I even begin with that, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's a. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, like super
early in my YouTube channel, </joey>
<connor> I used to do like covers of anime songs, </connor>
<connor> like on guitar and piano
and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Reason of why I don't do that anymore, </connor>
<connor> it's because the few times I
ever got a copyright strike, </connor>
<joey> not a claim, a strike
was from a cover I did. </joey>
<connor> I did a cover of fuckin'
"Paranoid Android" by Radiohead, </connor>
<connor> because it was the ending to "Ergo Proxy," </connor>
<connor> and at the time it was
like, I really liked it. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, I got a fucking strike on it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not sure if that can
also be a humblebrag, </garnt>
<garnt> because that's like saying
like, you were so good. </garnt>
<garnt> I covered it.
- YouTube literally </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was the real thing.
- YouTube thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> the original song. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Thanks YouTube, </garnt>
<joey> but also, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - I've had my voice claimed
a few times actually. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my own videos. </joey>
<joey> People trying to claim my like, </joey>
<connor> say like, where I'm just
talking, there's nothing. </connor>
<garnt> - That's obviously not VA. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I've seen a TikTok of that. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird, it's weird,
it's pretty bizarre. </garnt>
<joey> Like, I don't know.
- I've never heard of that. </joey>
<joey> - I heard like, an original
as one dude on YouTube, </joey>
<connor> one time he uploaded his original song, </connor>
<connor> and then got claimed by someone, </connor>
<joey> someone claimed his original song </joey>
<joey> that he uploaded to his own channel. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] How? </connor>
<connor> - Well, 'cause anyone
can put anything content. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Like, these companies
are given free reign. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, remember there was like, </joey>
<joey> I forgot when it was,
it was like maybe 2018, </joey>
<garnt> there was like that copyright
Armageddon that was happening </garnt>
<garnt> where like all these
like fake companies were </garnt>
<joey> going around, and just like striking? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's still
happening, because like- </joey>
<joey> - It's not as bad as
it used to be, though. </joey>
<joey> - It's not, it definitely isn't, </joey>
<joey> and I'm glad, like one
of the positive things </joey>
<joey> YouTube has done has given
creators tools to like, </joey>
<joey> for example, cut or mute the segment </joey>
<garnt> that has been copyright claimed it out, </garnt>
<garnt> which we just didn't have before. </garnt>
<garnt> So if we've got a copyright claim before </garnt>
<garnt> for like a second of music, </garnt>
<garnt> then there was just like,
nothing we could do. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like a dead video. </garnt>
<connor> - Man, you know what companies suck? </connor>
<connor> Well, there's fuckin' like,
Viral Hog and all those dudes, </connor>
<connor> the ones that buy viral videos. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And just go around claiming
them, and like Armageddon, </connor>
<connor> like, fuckin' awful. </connor>
<joey> - Like Nine Gag and stuff like that? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> So they're like these,
you know when you see </joey>
<garnt> those watermarks on Facebook? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, do you remember that video </garnt>
<garnt> of that dude punching the kangaroo? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- LADBible? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kinda like that, but a bit different, </garnt>
<connor> because LADBible, </connor>
<connor> they don't normally go
around copyright claim, </connor>
<joey> but that video, right? </joey>
<connor> The person who had that video
sold it to this company, </connor>
<connor> and then what they do
is everyone who's then </connor>
<joey> talking about it was showing it, </joey>
<joey> they'll just go around and
copyright claiming everything, </joey>
<connor> and any of these news networks. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's scummy. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's the business model, </connor>
<connor> like they buy these videos
for like very cheap, </connor>
<connor> even like, have you ever had offers </connor>
<connor> from people who wanna buy your videos? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's really weird, </connor>
<connor> yeah.
- I've had that. </connor>
<connor> - They'll go around buying them, </connor>
<connor> and then just claim everything,
and it's just, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's really shit, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause people react to
stuff on stream as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - And also the worst thing is about that, </garnt>
<garnt> luckily I'm 99% of you will
never have to experience </garnt>
<garnt> is that these copyright claims, right? </garnt>
<joey> Sometimes they're like
really fucking generous </joey>
<joey> with the timing on the video. </joey>
<joey> Like, so they have to say
what time in the video </joey>
<joey> they copyright claimed, </joey>
<joey> and sometimes they'll add on like, </joey>
<garnt> 5 or 10 seconds to the end, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "You piece of shit." </garnt>
<garnt> Now I've got to like, </garnt>
<connor> it was like a clear edit and everything. </connor>
<connor> I've got to edit out or mute shit, </connor>
<joey> 'cause you don't get to contest the time, </joey>
<joey> so whatever the time is, </joey>
<connor> that's like, if you wanna
mute the corporate content, </connor>
<connor> you don't get to say where it is. </connor>
<connor> It's whatever they submitted is it. </connor>
<connor> So one time, on one video, </connor>
<connor> I remember I reacted to
like a clip or something </connor>
<joey> on a live stream or something or Connadog. </joey>
<joey> And they claimed it and I
was like, that's fair enough. </joey>
<joey> But then they claimed
like 40 seconds extra, </joey>
<joey> nothing to do with said clip. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Wow. </joey>
<connor> - And I was like, "Wow dude, like really?" </connor>
<connor> Like a four second clip.
- They own your </connor>
<joey> reaction as well. </joey>
<connor> - Nah, nah. </connor>
<connor> The videos like that,
where I react to shit, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck, </connor>
<joey> but it's like, bro, what are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Don't claim shit that isn't
the video, like, come on. </joey>
<connor> You're just lazy, you don't want </connor>
<connor> to put in the time.
- But that's the problem, </connor>
<connor> right, it's like, </connor>
<joey> I feel like YouTube has done
a really good job of like, </joey>
<joey> trying to make the playing field
as fair as possible, right? </joey>
<joey> Like only recently they added
that whole thing of like, </joey>
<joey> how during an appealing process, </joey>
<connor> the money that the video accumulates </connor>
<connor> goes into what's called
escrow, which is like kind of- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] What you should've done anyway. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's kind of like, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't go to the person who </connor>
<connor> is the supposed copyright
holder, or the video owner, </connor>
<garnt> it kind of like, it's
floating in the cloud </garnt>
<garnt> until it's resolved. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is great, </garnt>
<joey> it's fantastic.
- It's like if you </joey>
<joey> put in a pool. </joey>
<garnt> No one can get that until
the copyright situation </garnt>
<joey> is resolved. </joey>
<joey> - Which is fantastic, but
like at the same time, </joey>
<joey> even today I feel the advantage
is still in the claimant. </joey>
<joey> Clearly YouTube is like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> obviously if you're
gonna go out of your way </joey>
<joey> to claim something copyright-wise, </joey>
<joey> then you must have a good reason for it, </joey>
<joey> but a lot of companies don't. </joey>

<garnt> - Thank you Ayylien clothing
for sponsoring this episode, </garnt>
<garnt> back to the video. </garnt>
<connor> But speaking of like other
changes that YouTube has made. </connor>
<connor> - Now the dust has settled
on the first like thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so like, has
dislikes been removed? </connor>
<connor> I'm very confused, </connor>
<garnt> because I can still
see them on my channel. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a slow process.
- On your channel, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Not on anyone else's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, on anyone else's channel though, </garnt>
<joey> it should be completely gone. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I can see, I can still
see it on videos, I think. </garnt>
<joey> Let me check, let me check. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I know that- </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, it's gone. </joey>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> No, literally, I was literally- </connor>
<connor> - It's been like that for days. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I literally looked
at fuckin' videos yesterday </connor>
<garnt> and I was just like, what
is the dislike channel? </garnt>
<garnt> And then where is the dislikes going? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's getting like
slowly implemented, I think, </joey>
<joey> so not all channel owners can see, </joey>
<joey> but like at least with your own content, </joey>
<joey> you can still see your dislikes, </joey>
<joey> which goes completely against
the argument that YouTube made </joey>
<joey> as to why they wanted to
get rid of the dislikes. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember I made a
video on a second channel, </joey>
<joey> and one of the YouTube reasonings </joey>
<joey> for getting rid of the
dislike button was that like, </joey>
<joey> oh if you see dislikes on your videos, </joey>
<joey> it discourages smaller creators, you know? </joey>
<joey> Perhaps they're getting disliked bombed, </joey>
<joey> perhaps they're getting bullied, </joey>
<joey> and no one likes to see
a bunch of dislikes. </joey>
<joey> Yet, you can still see
dislikes on your own videos, </joey>
<joey> so what the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> - You know, I'm just
glad they're standing up </garnt>
<garnt> for the small creators, </garnt>
<garnt> all two of them or something that exists </garnt>
<joey> on the entire platform of YouTube </joey>
<joey> that have ever complained about this. </joey>
<joey> Because I was talking to this about, </joey>
<joey> with a bunch of other YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> and I asked them, do you
know a single creator </joey>
<joey> in your field that has ever
complained about dislike bombs? </joey>
<garnt> Like whatever size, and
not a single person I know </garnt>
<garnt> has ever been like a
target of dislike bombs </garnt>
<garnt> to the point where it actually
actively ruins their channel. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know? </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever received
a lot of dislikes? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I mean, 'cause I feel, </joey>
<joey> me and Garnt make more opinionated videos </joey>
<joey> than you do, right? </joey>
<joey> So obviously there are some opinions </joey>
<joey> I've said in the past
that people aren't very </joey>
<joey> happy with.
- I've never really </joey>
<joey> had a lot of dislikes on one video. </joey>
<connor> - I've had some videos
that didn't do as well. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what do you classify
as a lot of dislikes? </joey>
<connor> - More than... </connor>
<joey> - Like 10%? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 10% is quite a lot. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I've had a few
videos, but not that much. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't have that much, </garnt>
<garnt> most of it is like the more
controversial opinion videos, </garnt>
<garnt> but in general-
- All people </garnt>
<garnt> who didn't like, watch the video </garnt>
<garnt> up to the end.
- I think I've had 10%. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the only one was the... </garnt>
<garnt> - The Christian one.
- The Christian one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Understandable. </connor>
<connor> - Not everyone's cup of tea. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but, no, I've had
a few where it's like, </connor>
<connor> when I look back on those videos, </connor>
<connor> or like how I presented them, </connor>
<connor> I can see why they got dislike bombed, </connor>
<connor> and I don't really blame them for it. </connor>
<connor> I guess I remember like, </connor>
<connor> I think one that really blew up recently </connor>
<connor> that got quite a few
dislikes, I think it is like, </connor>
<connor> a nine to one is, </connor>
<connor> it's an old "Let's Fight" episode, </connor>
<garnt> where the title of it is, </garnt>
<garnt> "Beserk is Not a Masterpiece," </garnt>
<garnt> I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Dislike. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, right now, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's at 10 or 15% dislike, </garnt>
<garnt> and it only blow up after
Mira-sensei's par scene, right? </garnt>
<joey> Because obviously people were searching </joey>
<garnt> of "Beserk" and all that, and obviously, </garnt>
<joey> if you watch the video,
I argue against that. </joey>
<garnt> - You'd know that Joey is like
the biggest "Beserk" simp. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Like, ever. </joey>
<garnt> - That was the title. </garnt>
<garnt> I used that because that was
one of the opinions I got, </garnt>
<garnt> and I fought against it, </garnt>
<connor> but clearly people don't
watch it all the way through </connor>
<connor> or up to that point, </connor>
<connor> so they just see the title and they think, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, this guy hates Beserk, dislike." </joey>
<connor> - In some ways I, you know, </connor>
<connor> I personally liked the dislike button, </connor>
<connor> but in other ways I think it
doesn't really do anything, </connor>
<connor> and it doesn't serve. </connor>
<connor> The only place-
- Have you ever </connor>
<joey> actively disliked a video? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yes.
- Yes, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, but here's the problem, right? </connor>
<joey> - For what reason? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but, this is the problem, right? </joey>
<connor> There's no agreed upon
consensus on when you dislike. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You could dislike because
you disagree with the opinion, </connor>
<connor> you could dislike because
you didn't enjoy the video </connor>
<connor> as much as another one, </connor>
<connor> you could dislike because you
just don't like the person. </connor>
<joey> I feel like the dislike, </joey>
<joey> although is sometimes
helpful on a tutorial, yes. </joey>
<joey> It's very black and white. </joey>
<joey> Is the tutorial not good? </joey>
<joey> Dislike. </joey>
<connor> Like, when it comes to like your videos, </connor>
<connor> I feel like the dislike bar
doesn't serve the same purpose </connor>
<connor> as it does on a tutorial, </connor>
<connor> where information is actually important. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it serves a
purpose when you know </garnt>
<garnt> like you really fucked up, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Again, that, again, there. </connor>
<connor> - Or you've purposely
made a very controversial </connor>
<connor> opinion, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and the more I think about it, </joey>
<joey> the more I think, yeah, okay, </joey>
<connor> in some ways the dislike
and like bar is useless, </connor>
<connor> like it doesn't mean anything. </connor>
<connor> With 99% of videos, I think
it is completely useless, </connor>
<connor> and only with tutorials and
knowing when you fucked up, </connor>
<garnt> that's literally the only two reasons. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I mean, there
is also some catharsis </garnt>
<garnt> to being able to dislike
a video, and just like, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you see a video,
and it's so outrageous, </garnt>
<connor> and you wanna know that you're
not the only fucking person </connor>
<connor> who thinks that this video is like, </connor>
<connor> that this is a shitty video or something, </connor>
<connor> and you go to the dislike
bar and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Thank God, I'm not the
only one," you know? </connor>
<connor> There is some catharsis. </connor>
<connor> It's like going into a video and seeing </connor>
<connor> comments are disabled, and
I'm just like, fuck you. </connor>
<connor> Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but that's way- </connor>
<garnt> - No balls. </garnt>
<joey> - The like and dislike bar's like nothing, </joey>
<joey> it's the comments that matter, I think. </joey>
<connor> And when the come to the disabled, </connor>
<connor> I get way more than I do. </connor>
<joey> - Right, like to me, it's like, </joey>
<joey> I don't mind if you
disagree with an opinion </joey>
<joey> I make on a video, </joey>
<joey> but I would much rather
you leave a comment </joey>
<joey> explaining why you dislike it, </joey>
<joey> or why you are against
whatever I said in that video </joey>
<joey> rather than just like leaving a dislike. </joey>
<joey> Because, again, as you said, </joey>
<joey> a dislike can mean a
million different things. </joey>
<connor> - Because sometimes people will be like, </connor>
<connor> "This video wasn't as
good as another one." </connor>
<connor> Does that mean that
that person disliked it? </connor>
<joey> And is that like, fair? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if I didn't like the
video that someone made, </joey>
<joey> or I liked another one more,
I wouldn't personally dislike. </joey>
<joey> - No.
- But that's how I do it. </joey>
<joey> So, to me trying to like
extrapolate any information </joey>
<joey> from this random just metric
that doesn't mean shit, </joey>
<connor> like, it doesn't help me. </connor>
<connor> Like, when I see a video
that has 99.9% likes, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay. </connor>
<connor> Now I see a video with 99.8% likes. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what's the difference here? </connor>
<connor> Like, did it get more
likes than previously, </connor>
<garnt> or like, less dislikes? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really understand. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, I've never really- </connor>
<garnt> - No, but I mean, like,
I think it is useful, </garnt>
<garnt> not in the small percentages, </garnt>
<garnt> but in the large percentages, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because most videos on
YouTube should have like, </garnt>
<garnt> an above 90% like ratio,
like to dislike ratio. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's actually 99, </connor>
<connor> is like normally good. </connor>
<connor> 95 is where you're getting
to like, all right. </connor>
<connor> Maybe have said something
low, a little bad. </connor>
<connor> If it's 10%, if you have 9 to 1 ratio, </connor>
<connor> you've probably fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no, you haven't fucked up, </garnt>
<garnt> you've just pissed off... </garnt>
<joey> My experience is you've
probably pissed off- </joey>
<joey> - A certain group. </joey>
<joey> - A certain community or
a certain group, you know? </joey>
<joey> And then you get to like the 50%, </joey>
<garnt> and that's when you know that
something big has gone down. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause your core
audience will always like, </connor>
<joey> I mean that's really- </joey>
<joey> - But that doesn't
necessarily like, for example, </joey>
<connor> like a channel I like to
watch a lot of is "Needledrop" </connor>
<connor> who does like a lot of
music reviews, right? </connor>
<joey> He's had a couple of recent, </joey>
<joey> before the dislikes disappeared, </joey>
<garnt> he's had a couple of
videos that were like, </garnt>
<garnt> 40% likes, but it was
still like a good video. </garnt>
<joey> It was just the thing,
his opinion about it, </joey>
<joey> obviously didn't coincide
with the general public. </joey>
<connor> - Right, so but like, what does that, </connor>
<joey> as a viewer, what do I then
gather from that video? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, is this a bad video? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, does he say something
that's flat out wrong? </connor>
<connor> Does he say something that a lot of people </connor>
<joey> just don't agree with? </joey>
<joey> Like, it doesn't really tell you anything </joey>
<joey> in that scenario.
- It's a mixture </joey>
<connor> of all those, right? </connor>
<connor> And that's why you have to
go down into the comments </connor>
<connor> after that to be like, okay, </connor>
<joey> what is the reasoning
behind this massive dislike? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like YouTube removing
this way for viewers </garnt>
<connor> to express themselves or
like the distaste of a video, </connor>
<connor> they're going to find other ways </connor>
<joey> to express their distaste towards a video. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm sure ratioing is just now- </joey>
<joey> - Ratio, yeah, ratio. </joey>
<joey> - It's going to now be a fuckin'
thing in the YouTubesphere. </joey>
<joey> - As if it I wasn't
already fucking annoying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I can't wait to like, </joey>
<garnt> comments to like ratio
YouTube videos though. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that's just, that's
what's going to happen, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Viewers always find, like
audiences always find a way </connor>
<joey> to show you their dislike. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's either </connor>
<joey> the YouTube comments are
gonna get more toxic, </joey>
<joey> or other social media platforms that </joey>
<joey> that particular YouTuber is known to be on </joey>
<joey> is gonna get more toxic behavior. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like, the biggest
thing that annoys me is </garnt>
<garnt> the tutorials and stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> because you are very
much removing an easy way </garnt>
<garnt> to discern whether our tutorial is right, </garnt>
<garnt> or whether a certain video is right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because let's say you
upload a shitty tutorial, </garnt>
<garnt> or you upload a scam, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You disabled comments, </garnt>
<garnt> but likes and dislikes is still available, </garnt>
<garnt> are still up in the open. </garnt>
<garnt> So you're kind of just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just kind of like taking a risk </garnt>
<garnt> on whether you should
listen to them, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you don't know
how many people disabled. </garnt>
<connor> - But also likes are very
easy to manipulate as well, </connor>
<joey> like that's another thing. </joey>
<joey> - Well, but I would argue that- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] At a smaller level. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I would argue that now </joey>
<joey> that you can't even see
the dislikes anymore, </joey>
<joey> there's not even point </joey>
<joey> of disabling likes and
dislikes anymore, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it's just in a
constant, disabled state, right? </joey>
<garnt> Because it's like, you can only, </garnt>
<joey> like say for example
there was a scam video. </joey>
<garnt> If they disabled the comments, </garnt>
<garnt> now what's the only thing you can see? </garnt>
<garnt> Is the likes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like... </garnt>
<joey> - I mean.
- You can't do </joey>
<joey> anything about that. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I think
YouTube were trying to go </joey>
<garnt> for something similar
to what Instagram did </garnt>
<connor> with their likes about
making likes not public, </connor>
<connor> except for the poster. </connor>
<connor> And like for Instagram, I get it for that. </connor>
<connor> You know, for that platform,
I think it made sense because- </connor>
<connor> - They reverted it. </connor>
<connor> The reversed it. </connor>
<connor> - Did they? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait.
- When? </garnt>
<connor> - I can see all the likes. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, they reversed it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they reverted it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they reverted it. </joey>
<connor> - Since how long? </connor>
<connor> - Like a long time now. </connor>
<garnt> - Holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay well- </garnt>
<connor> - Were you still under the
impression that that was? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Well we can see how often
Garnt goes on his Instagram. </joey>
<garnt> - It's no big secret that
I don't go on Instagram, </garnt>
<garnt> so I guess my point is now mute. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Well fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm glad you guys stopped
me before I was starting, </garnt>
<garnt> before I was going to start
spewing a lot of bullshit. </garnt>
<joey> - [Speaker 3] Mine is not showing. </joey>
<connor> - No, they show up for me. </connor>
<connor> - They show up for me. </connor>
<connor> - [Speaker 3] You too? They don't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they show up for me. </connor>
<connor> I think they might be
slowly rolling it back out, </connor>
<connor> or you have to like maybe
opt-in to it, or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, but. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, see? </connor>
<connor> - That must be data that shows, </connor>
<joey> on their end, right? </joey>
<connor> That like says, hey, when
people all see likes, </connor>
<garnt> it's good for us. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I don't know what that is. </connor>
<garnt> I can only speak to. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's probably, if people can see likes, </garnt>
<garnt> it just keeps them on the platform, </garnt>
<garnt> because viewers wanna feel
like they're having some, </garnt>
<garnt> like they can contribute in
some way, shape, or form. </garnt>
<joey> - They wanna see a metric, </joey>
<joey> and they wanna see that metric go up. </joey>
<connor> - With the YouTube one, </connor>
<connor> the main speculation was
that brands weren't happy </connor>
<joey> with the dislike box. </joey>
<joey> - Now, in some ways I feel like </joey>
<connor> that's too easy of an explanation. </connor>
<connor> I feel like, usually in the past, </connor>
<connor> I don't think they've been
that catering of brands. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, I could be wrong here. </joey>
<joey> I feel like they must have
some data that backs up </joey>
<joey> that removing dislikes </joey>
<joey> will lead to better views or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean.
- They must, </joey>
<joey> because there's no way that, </joey>
<joey> YouTube's seems too selfish
to do something for brands. </joey>
<connor> It seems like, I feel
it just happens to be. </connor>
<joey> - No, so the YouTube
creator's channel on YouTube </joey>
<connor> made a video, it was
like a three-minute video </connor>
<joey> that was like concise saying
why they were moving it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, was it the dude who's like, </connor>
<joey> is that the one that the
guy was like sitting there? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, the guys just
sitting there being like, </connor>
<connor> "This is the reason
why we're gonna do it." </connor>
<connor> Nice and quick, I give him props for that. </connor>
<connor> At least it wasn't like a fuckin' </connor>
<connor> 30-minute explanation video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, </connor>
<connor> they gave a number
- It sort of fuckin' </connor>
<connor> like Nickacado Avocado. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> It was nice and concise, which is nice. </connor>
<connor> But, yeah one of the
reasons they gave was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, we saw a metric
that we tested upon </connor>
<connor> millions of users," don't
know how true that is, </connor>
<connor> that apparently the amount of dislikes </connor>
<connor> does not change the
watch time of that video. </connor>
<connor> - I believe that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I believe that </connor>
<connor> as well.
- Yeah, and I'm like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean, of course. </joey>
<connor> - I'd argue- </connor>
<joey> - I don't really watch.
- That's not a reason though, </joey>
<joey> to get rid of it.
- To (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> with dislikes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I argued being like, </connor>
<joey> well yeah, what if you're
watching like an apology video </joey>
<joey> that's like 40 minutes long, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's a lot of dislikes on it, </joey>
<joey> but people wanna see it until the end. </joey>
<connor> - I mean you usually there's one priority, </connor>
<joey> it's making people watch longer, </joey>
<joey> so there must be some evidence </joey>
<connor> to prove that getting rid of
it makes people watch longer. </connor>
<joey> - I did find a funny though </joey>
<joey> that the last point
they gave that was like, </joey>
<joey> "And the last question is, </joey>
<joey> did we get rid of the dislike button </joey>
<joey> because of YouTube rewind?" </joey>
<joey> They brought that point by, </joey>
<joey> and dude, I've never seen a guy say no </joey>
<joey> with such coping in my life. </joey>
<joey> He was like, "No." </joey>
<joey> You can see the coping in his eyes. </joey>
<garnt> - You could see how many
times he had to film that </garnt>
<garnt> to sound genuine, </garnt>
<garnt> to get the most genuine
take that he could, </garnt>
<joey> because he knew people were gonna be </joey>
<joey> watching this under a microscope at like, </joey>
<joey> 0.25 speed or something to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, the inflection in his voice </joey>
<joey> kind of leads me to believe that YouTube </joey>
<joey> made him say that."
- "I heard a slight </joey>
<joey> vibrato in his voice, </joey>
<joey> meaning he is about to
start crying at any minute." </joey>
<connor> - I just wish they
would tell us the truth, </connor>
<connor> and give us some data, but
they're not gonna do that. </connor>
<garnt> Why would they?
- No. </garnt>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, what, like... </connor>
<garnt> What, not annoyed me, but the way, </garnt>
<joey> what really made me suspicious
was the way they framed it </joey>
<joey> to like, "Oh, we're
doing you guys a favor." </joey>
<joey> - You asked for this. </joey>
<joey> - Don't, don't, don't. </joey>
<joey> Thank us later. </joey>
<joey> Please, please. </joey>
<joey> Hold the applause, </joey>
<joey> but we are helping you
for your mental health. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, </joey>
<garnt> literally no creator I have
talked to or ever heard of </garnt>
<garnt> asked YouTube to do this, </garnt>
<garnt> and they framed it in a way </garnt>
<garnt> that they're doing it for the creators. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Have you ever
seen a YouTube creator </joey>
<joey> make a video in front of the camera going, </joey>
<joey> "Guys, my mental health is deteriorating </joey>
<joey> from all these dislikes
I'm getting, man, fuck." </joey>
<joey> No, of course not. </joey>
<joey> It's the fucking algorithm
that's demanding YouTuber's </joey>
<joey> to not take a break. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one time a
corporation has said, </garnt>
<garnt> "Don't worry guys, we've heard you." </garnt>
<joey> (Joey cackling) </joey>
<garnt> The audience didn't actually say anything. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - We have been silent. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> You've had tape on our
mouths the entire time. </joey>
<connor> We can't say anything.
- That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> Hey you guys, we're gonna
help you guys out here. </connor>
<connor> - There's like, no one. </connor>
<garnt> (speakers laughing) </garnt>
<joey> I don't even know why I'm here, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - It's literally the,
"I've saved the day," </garnt>
<joey> "But you haven't done anything," </joey>
<joey> and they just leave. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You're welcome, see ya. </joey>
<joey> My God.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - So I've finally started to
settle in my new place now. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we are-
- 20 years later. </connor>
<connor> - 20 years later, you know? </connor>
<connor> Hosted the house warming. </connor>
<joey> Unfortunately, Joey couldn't make it, </joey>
<joey> because you were busy with the. </joey>
<joey> - I was doing (indistinct), yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I will say, yeah.
- Lovely lasagna. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I will say, ever since that day. </joey>
<joey> So, okay. </joey>
<joey> So I don't know if I've told the story </joey>
<joey> of the world-famous lasagna yet, </joey>
<joey> which it's not world-famous. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] But it's about to be. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, now it's about to be, </joey>
<joey> so in Japan, I don't know why, </joey>
<connor> but you can get a lot of
good Italian food in Japan, </connor>
<connor> but for some reason you
just can't get lasagna. </connor>
<joey> Like, no Italian restaurant in Japan, </joey>
<joey> for some reason, serves lasagna. </joey>
<joey> And the few that they do, </joey>
<joey> they definitely don't serve good lasagna. </joey>
<joey> So because of this, I would just like, </joey>
<joey> look, I've been living
in Japan for a year. </joey>
<joey> I'm craving lasagna. </joey>
<joey> So what better way to
do it than just learn </joey>
<joey> how to do it yourself? </joey>
<joey> - I'll do it myself, </joey>
<joey> damn it.
- I fuckin', </joey>
<joey> I literally fuckin' Thanos, </joey>
<garnt> I'll fuckin' do it myself, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So about a year ago. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't realize that
was a Thanos reference. </joey>
<joey> I just said it. </joey>
<connor> - Is it a Thanos reference? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - It's the one where
he takes the gauntlet, </joey>
<connor> and says fine, I'll do it myself. </connor>
<joey> - [Speaker 4] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I haven't seen the movie. </garnt>
<connor> I've just seen the meme. </connor>
<joey> - It's a pretty famous meme. </joey>
<joey> - It's the most generic line </joey>
<joey> that could be attached to any character. </joey>
<connor> - I can say anything. </connor>
<connor> I can be like, "Oh my penis
is a little bit itchy." </connor>
<joey> She's like, "I don't remember
when Thanos said that." </joey>
<garnt> - I'll do it myself. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll do it myself.
- All right, go on, tell it. </joey>
<connor> - So about a year ago, I
learned how to cook lasagna, </connor>
<connor> and I cooked it once, right? </connor>
<joey> I cook it once, and it was
like a mediocre lasagna. </joey>
<joey> - And it's a difficult dish, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean... </connor>
<connor> Kind of.
- It's like lego, </connor>
<connor> but with pasta. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like- </connor>
<connor> - It's cool. </connor>
<connor> - It's a pasta cake, right? </connor>
<connor> It's just concentrated
pasta, with meat of course. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it kind of is. </connor>
<garnt> - That's kind of what it is. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like all the flavor of pasta bowl, </connor>
<connor> layered out very precisely. </connor>
<connor> - Right, yeah.
- Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - So, deep during quarantine, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes we would have dinner parties </garnt>
<connor> where we would invite people over, </connor>
<connor> or just people would come over. </connor>
<connor> And one day Sydney invites Connor over, </connor>
<connor> and she says, "Oh, you
can have some of Garnt's </connor>
<connor> world-famous lasagna." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> and Connor's just like, what? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, what? </joey>
<garnt> What do you mean world-famous,
Cindy, I've cooked it once. </garnt>
<garnt> And ever since she said that, </garnt>
<joey> because she didn't say it to Connor, </joey>
<joey> she said it's a Mae Lynne as well. </joey>
<garnt> And so for like a good five months, </garnt>
<garnt> people have built up this idea </garnt>
<garnt> that I make world-famous lasagna, </garnt>
<joey> right?
- It's just a joke. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just out here like, </garnt>
<connor> misinformation. </connor>
<joey> - I would just drop people, </joey>
<garnt> "Have you had Garnt's
world-famous lasagna? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And so the first time I
actually cook it for Mae Lynne, </garnt>
<joey> Mae Lynne's the one I
wanna please the most. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course. </joey>
<joey> - You want to get that </joey>
<joey> good Google review.
- Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<connor> of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> Because if you can please
Mae Lynne with a meal, </connor>
<joey> you can do anything.
- You know what's good. </joey>
<joey> - It's basically Michelin
star at that point. </joey>
<joey> It is world-famous, so
the first time I cook, </joey>
<joey> it was at Mae Lynne's house. </joey>
<joey> And when you're cooking in a kitchen </joey>
<joey> that you're unfamiliar with, </joey>
<joey> with equipment that you don't know, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you have an
oven, or you don't know. </joey>
<connor> Like, with Japanese ovens, </connor>
<connor> especially the ones that aren't pre-built, </connor>
<connor> but the ones that you buy,
they say a temperature, </connor>
<connor> but the actual temperature
varies depending on what oven </connor>
<connor> and what brand you buy, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I remember first
time I cooked this lasagna </connor>
<connor> for the public was that Mae Lynne's house. </connor>
<connor> - For the public.
- For the public. </connor>
<connor> - For the world. </connor>
<connor> - It's so world-famous- </connor>
<connor> - It's so world-famous. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like fucking sweating, </connor>
<connor> because weeks before I come to
Mae Lynne's house to cook it, </connor>
<connor> Mae Lynne was like, </connor>
<connor> "Can't wait for the world famous lasagna." </connor>
<joey> You know what? </joey>
<joey> You know what? </joey>
<joey> I'm a give you a fucking Google review, </joey>
<joey> just to see if it is
actually world-famous. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, for fuck's sake,
man, this joke has gone </joey>
<joey> too far.
- The pressure. </joey>
<joey> - This is like cook for Gordon
Ramsey or something, right? </joey>
<joey> I feel like I'm part of
like, "Kitchen Nightmares" </joey>
<joey> or something right now. </joey>
<joey> So I'm cooking, I'm cooking
at Mae Lynne's house, </joey>
<joey> and it takes a while
to cook lasagna, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it's not like an easy dish. </joey>
<joey> You gotta cook the meat sauce, </joey>
<joey> you gotta layer it up, </joey>
<joey> and I wasn't familiar
with Mae Lynne's oven. </joey>
<garnt> I'd cooked it a bunch
of times in my own oven, </garnt>
<garnt> and the first time I'm
cooking in Mae Lynne's oven. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Something that an
experienced chef would say. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I cook it in Mae Lynne's oven, </garnt>
<garnt> and unfortunately it wasn't hot enough. </garnt>
<garnt> Her oven didn't go hot enough. </garnt>
<joey> - I liked it, I liked it. </joey>
<joey> - So you had a crispy lasagna? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I cook it, and- </garnt>
<garnt> - A little al dente lasagna. </garnt>
<joey> - That ain't al dente, that's crispy. </joey>
<connor> - What's the crispy one? </connor>
<connor> - Not al dente. </connor>
<connor> - What is al dente? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I just say shit.
- Al dente means </garnt>
<garnt> to the bite, right? </garnt>
<connor> So it's like just right softness, </connor>
<connor> I think.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Italian's, please confirm. </joey>
<joey> - Just say Italian words. </joey>
<joey> Like, just say them. </joey>
<joey> - It was definitely- </joey>
<joey> - Mama mia.
- Star of Italy. </joey>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I cook my lasagna mama mia. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it wasn't fully cooked, </joey>
<connor> but the inside was definitely,
as Gordon Ramsey would say, </connor>
<connor> fucking raw. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> (Joey giggling) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, even if lasagna is like raw, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, this is still pretty </connor>
<joey> fucking good.
- It's a little, </joey>
<joey> I don't mind my lasagna a little crunchy. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor enjoyed it, when I cooked some- </garnt>
<connor> - I am not picky about my lasagna. </connor>
<connor> As long as you have all
the ingredients in there. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, the meat sauce is pretty good, </connor>
<connor> but Mae Lynne, nothing
goes past Mae Lynne. </connor>
<connor> She takes one bite and
she's like, "This is raw." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> "This is raw," </connor>
<connor> and I'm like.
- Without the energy </connor>
<connor> of Gordon Ramsay. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, ah, </connor>
<joey> my cooking career is over
after one dish, you know? </joey>
<joey> This is it, this is it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Big sad, big sad. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna put up my apron now, </joey>
<connor> I'm never gonna cook again. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just glad I got to
experience the "Ratatouille" movie, </connor>
<connor> in like, real time. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And so that was the last
time I cooked a lasagna </garnt>
<garnt> for other people to taste. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So it actually deterred you? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> until, until, </joey>
<joey> until this housewarming party </joey>
<joey> where Sydney obviously invites, </joey>
<joey> you know, Sydney invites everyone. </joey>
<joey> And she sends people this menu as well, </joey>
<connor> things that we were going to cook, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, Sydney,
why would you do that? </connor>
<connor> And without my knowledge, </connor>
<connor> she said I would be cooking
the world-famous lasagna, </connor>
<connor> literally on the menu, </connor>
<connor> right?
- She was trying to </connor>
<connor> bring the old man out of retirement, </connor>
<connor> and try and get him back in the game. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a retired hero
or something, you know? </connor>
<connor> I'm just like Sydney- </connor>
<joey> - "I haven't done that in years." </joey>
<joey> - "I'm past my prime, now I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> I can't do it, Sydney. </joey>
<joey> Don't make me do it." </joey>
<joey> She's like, "Garnt, it's out. </joey>
<joey> Mae Lynne's coming, you
need to do it," right? </joey>
<connor> And so like, I'm like sweating now. </connor>
<connor> So a few days before the lasagna, </connor>
<connor> a few days before the housewarming,
I have a practice run. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - I actually got so
nervous that I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I need to practice it. </joey>
<joey> My lasagna making skills
are a little rusty. </joey>
<joey> I need to get back on the pedestal, </joey>
<joey> see how it is done again. </joey>
<joey> And so, yeah, so- </joey>
<joey> - I need some oil in these bones. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I did my lasagna
and Sydney loves it, </joey>
<connor> but I'm just like, I can do
better, I need to do better. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, God. </connor>
<connor> - I must confer the beyond. </connor>
<connor> - I make some mental notes before the day, </connor>
<connor> about the small changes I'm
going to make to the recipe, </connor>
<connor> like the small changes I'm gonna make </connor>
<connor> to the preparation and everything, </connor>
<garnt> and so the day comes, and- </garnt>
<joey> - It's like you're going
to like a bake-off. </joey>
<garnt> - It is, it is. </garnt>
<joey> - This ain't no joke. </joey>
<joey> - Like, imagine cooking
for Mae Lynne, you know, </joey>
<joey> but it's like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I would never dare to- </joey>
<joey> - But it's your own personal recipe, </joey>
<joey> you know?
- Right, right. </joey>
<joey> Like, I think I would actually rather cook </joey>
<joey> for Gordon Ramsey at this point. </joey>
<joey> And so everyone comes, everyone comes, </joey>
<connor> and everyone has all the
different side dishes. </connor>
<connor> We have some meat boards,
we have some other things, </connor>
<connor> but the lasagna is the main dish, </connor>
<connor> and like, everyone's having a merry time. </connor>
<connor> I'm fuckin' sweating, </connor>
<connor> not just because of
the heat from the oven, </connor>
<connor> but I'm sweating out of nerves, man. </connor>
<connor> - You did look very nervous. </connor>
<connor> I do remember you looking really worried. </connor>
<connor> - I remember everyone coming in, </connor>
<connor> everyone coming in, Sydney
just greeting everyone, </connor>
<joey> and everyone's being so short. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Don't talk
to me, don't talk to me. </joey>
<joey> I'm making lasagna right
now, I'm making lasagna." </joey>
<joey> Connor's like, "Yo Garnt,
can I see your office?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "No Connor, </joey>
<joey> I'll show you after I
finish this fucking lasagna, </joey>
<joey> and then I'll be social and
then I'll be a good host. </joey>
<joey> But until the lasagna's
done, nothing is happening." </joey>
<joey> And so, and so I cook the lasagna. </joey>
<connor> It's an hour after Sydney had said </connor>
<connor> that the lasagna would be finished. </connor>
<connor> I don't care. </connor>
<connor> You can't rush perfection. </connor>
<connor> And then I finish it,
and then I take it out. </connor>
<connor> And then this is a
really weird experience. </connor>
<connor> People start crowding
around this lasagna, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, it's like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, people started
crowding around this lasagna, </connor>
<connor> and I'm gonna say, it looked
fucking good, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] I mean, I saw the photos, </garnt>
<garnt> and it looked good.
- There's the thing </garnt>
<garnt> about lasagna, right? </garnt>
<joey> Anyone who loves lasagna will understand, </joey>
<joey> is that the first spatula, </joey>
<joey> the first serving is always the best one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - Because the more people start
chunking out that lasagna, </connor>
<connor> the more sloppy it becomes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Don't get me wrong, </connor>
<joey> it's not like lasagna is
the cleanest thing on earth, </joey>
<joey> but the first spatular
scoop is the best one. </joey>
<garnt> You get the perfect ratio. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like, I needed to make sure </connor>
<connor> the cheese was like perfectly toasted, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it can't be like raw cheese. </connor>
<joey> And the edges need to be
like a little bit crispy, </joey>
<joey> a little bit burned, right? </joey>
<joey> To me, that's a good lasagna. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, of course,
- You can't have like, </joey>
<connor> a completely raw, but not
too overburned lasagna. </connor>
<connor> And so I remember, I
remember finishing it. </connor>
<connor> Everyone was taking pictures. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Mae Lynne,
have the first taste." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey wheezing) </garnt>
<garnt> The spotlight comes on. </garnt>
<garnt> The room is silent, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I give her the dish. </garnt>
<garnt> She takes one bite. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just like the longest </garnt>
<garnt> fuckin' few seconds of my life, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I see her chewing this
lasagna, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> my life is like flashing
before my eyes right now. </garnt>
<garnt> And she's just like, "Oh
shit, you've leveled up." </garnt>
<garnt> I was... </garnt>
<garnt> (crew laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey singing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't explain the fucking euphoria </garnt>
<garnt> that just went over my body. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey screaming) </garnt>
<connor> - It was very good. </connor>
<garnt> - It was literally that Japanese going... </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt yelling) </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was good lasagna, it was very good, </connor>
<connor> I have to say, I can confirm. </connor>
<connor> It was great lasagna. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a lost "Food Wars" episode. </connor>
<joey> - It was.
- I'll be honest, </joey>
<connor> I don't remember any of the
other food that was there. </connor>
<connor> I remember the lasagna.
- Damn, must be good. </connor>
<connor> - And there was sandwiches. </connor>
<connor> There was </connor>
<connor> miniature sandwiches.
- Right, right, right. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know... </joey>
<joey> I know there was a menu, </joey>
<connor> but I can't remember
anything else on the menu. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, </connor>
<garnt> what does it matter when you
had the world-famous lasagna? </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted Mae Lynne to
be really pretentious about it, </garnt>
<joey> just be like, </joey>
<connor> "Al dente." </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure she had a childhood
flashback when she ate it. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, I hope so. </connor>
<connor> But ever since that point, I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "Damn, cooking's fun. </joey>
<joey> Cooking for other people can be fun." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Who would've thought. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so ever since
that, ever since then, </joey>
<joey> me and Sydney had been
cooking almost like every day. </joey>
<connor> So we used to like Uber
Eats almost every day, </connor>
<connor> and a big thing, </connor>
<connor> a big deal is because we
do have a dishwasher now, </connor>
<connor> so we don't have to wash
dishes ourselves anymore, </connor>
<connor> and that takes so much of the effort out </connor>
<connor> in the cooking process, </connor>
<connor> because I find cooking relaxing, </connor>
<connor> and I actually find it relaxing </connor>
<garnt> to chop up the onions or chop
up the vegetables or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> prepare the dish, cook the dish. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the clearing up that is
always putting me off cooking. </garnt>
<garnt> Ever since I've gotten the dishwasher, </garnt>
<garnt> cooking has actually been an
enjoyable experience for me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel the more I'm doing it now. </joey>
<joey> Like, I used to fuckin' dread it. </joey>
<joey> Like, it was just stressful, </joey>
<connor> even following the menu or the recipe, </connor>
<connor> somehow I fucked it up in some regard. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm following the recipe, how
does this taste like shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But now the more I'm
like, (indistinct) cook, </connor>
<joey> and like, trying out
really easy pastas and like </joey>
<joey> something that is very difficult
to fuck up kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh. </joey>
<joey> Wow. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of fun. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> Is this what it feels like
to be good at something? </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just like, when you
see people eating your meal, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just enjoying
it and feeling happy, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, oh, this is how chefs feel. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I think I found like a
new hobby or something, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's genuinely a good feeling </connor>
<connor> to cook something that you're proud of, </connor>
<joey> and people also enjoy your cooking. </joey>
<joey> I get it now. </joey>
<joey> Mom, I get it, okay? </joey>
<joey> - I'm just saying.
- I get why you </joey>
<joey> was always like Eagle-eyed on me </joey>
<garnt> whenever I'd eat any of your meals. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, I get it now. </connor>
<garnt> - I like cooking. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a lot of work. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is.
- But also, </garnt>
<joey> I'm also really bad with
portion control, right? </joey>
<joey> When I make food, I make food, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of food.
- Like a feast. </joey>
<joey> - I used to make a lot of lasagna, </joey>
<garnt> but the problem was is that
I would then eat lasagna- </garnt>
<garnt> - You make a lasagna? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But is it world-famous? </joey>
<connor> - Nobody's had it. </connor>
<connor> - Well now I'm curious,
Connor, now I'm curious </connor>
<connor> how your lasagna is.
- We're about </connor>
<joey> to have a lasagna-off, aren't we? </joey>
<joey> - One time I made a
lasagna, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I totally forgot to
make the white sauce layer. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, why does
this taste like bricks? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it is. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause there was like, </connor>
<joey> no white layers to balance
out the tomato shit. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, so I would have to make lasagna. </joey>
<connor> I always liked leftover
lasagna more than lasagna. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Something about </connor>
<joey> lasagna sometimes that like the next day, </joey>
<connor> when you heat it up, it's just perfect. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it's so thick, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's so thick, it kind of gets, </connor>
<joey> I don't know, try it, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - It's like-
- I have tried it. </connor>
<garnt> I like it.
- It's like </garnt>
<garnt> how leftover deep dish pizza tastes better </garnt>
<joey> than the fresh deep dish pizza. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, sometimes, I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> but at least the lasagna that I made. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, maybe it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> something I'm figmenting.
- Are you talking </garnt>
<connor> about microwaved lasagna, </connor>
<garnt> or do you just eat it straight
out with the fuckin' fridge? </garnt>
<joey> - Properly made lasagna. </joey>
<garnt> - And then I would like, put it back </garnt>
<joey> in the oven.
- The next day, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, put it back in the oven? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just tastes good. </garnt>
<joey> - I think maybe it's because like, </joey>
<connor> the juices are like, </connor>
<connor> seeping.
- Coagulated? </connor>
<connor> Are you talking about solid? </connor>
<connor> - It like seeps in, right? </connor>
<joey> - You could cut through it like a cake. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Whereas normal lasagna,
it goes fuckin' everywhere. </joey>
<joey> Which, don't get me wrong, </joey>
<joey> I generally prefer the normal lasagna, </joey>
<joey> but somehow when I used to make it </joey>
<joey> that for some reason I
liked it the day after more. </joey>
<joey> - No, I get that. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - Well, it's like curry, right? </connor>
<joey> Curry the day off to tastes
just as good as the day before. </joey>
<joey> - No, I've heard that. </joey>
<garnt> That's like the biggest
fallacy I've ever heard, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've had day-old curry </garnt>
<garnt> that definitely doesn't
taste as good as like- </garnt>
<joey> - What kind of curry though? </joey>
<garnt> - Indian curry, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Because I understand why. </connor>
<joey> - Indian curry may not be the same, </joey>
<joey> because with Japanese curry, </joey>
<garnt> it's definitely better the day after. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it's taken the time
for everything to seep in. </connor>
<joey> - So are you, </joey>
<connor> sorry, go on. </connor>
<garnt> - But like I was talking, </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese curry tastes
the same no matter what, </garnt>
<connor> I feel.
- Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - I feel.
- You think so? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I've never had bad curry, </connor>
<garnt> but I've never had curry
that's made me like amazed </garnt>
<garnt> about how good it is. </garnt>
<joey> - It is the most like, 6 out of 10 </joey>
<connor> kind of.
- The special gourmet ones, </connor>
<connor> where they use like really rich stock, </connor>
<connor> and they have really
good quality beef pies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - At the end of the day, it's still </joey>
<joey> Japanese curry.
- It's still Japanese curry. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - With pizza, </joey>
<joey> I was wondering about this, </joey>
<connor> because you know there's
people who are like purists, </connor>
<connor> that like stone-baked, </connor>
<connor> where is it from? </connor>
<connor> Napoli, Napoli? </connor>
<connor> - Napoli.
- Napoli. </connor>
<connor> - Like, "That's the only style. </connor>
<connor> That's the correct style." </connor>
<connor> Which type of pizza is
your favorite style? </connor>
<garnt> I was just curious, </garnt>
<garnt> because-
- Stone-baked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Stone-baked? </garnt>
<connor> I do like stone-baked. </connor>
<connor> - Stone-baked is the only pizza
where I can eat the crust. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Because, okay. </connor>
<connor> Because some like,
sourdough stone-baked pizza? </connor>
<joey> Oh my God, okay. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it's good. </joey>
<joey> - I'm a crust hater, </joey>
<garnt> but I'm a eat that fuckin' crust. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm the same.
- And I'm gonna enjoy it, </connor>
<connor> okay? </connor>
<connor> - American pizza is the
best pizza, I think. </connor>
<joey> - Like, what kind of American pizza? </joey>
<connor> - Like a New York pizza,
that's like the best pizza. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, New York pizza
is pretty fuckin' bomb. </joey>
<connor> - I think American style of
making pizza is the best way. </connor>
<joey> I love stone-baked, I
love stone-baked, right? </joey>
<connor> I love it, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> But like, I don't know what
it is about American toppings. </connor>
<garnt> - Italians, </garnt>
<joey> I hear you Italians, I felt- </joey>
<joey> - Listen, listen, all right? </joey>
<garnt> - A whole generation just like, </garnt>
<connor> died right there.
- Here's my argument, </connor>
<garnt> right? </garnt>
<garnt> The thing with stone-baked pizza </garnt>
<garnt> that sometimes kind of pisses me off, </garnt>
<garnt> why are they so goddamn
light with the toppings? </garnt>
<joey> Like, they put like one pepperoni on it, </joey>
<joey> and call it a day, you know? </joey>
<joey> Which I get it, you don't
want to like submerge it. </joey>
<joey> But also, everything falls
off like, immediately as well, </joey>
<joey> so nothing stays in place, </joey>
<connor> and they put like, no fucking cheese on. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that based off like the, </connor>
<connor> it's either the Napoli or the
other type of a Italian pizza. </connor>
<connor> But like, it's not supposed
to be a heavy meal. </connor>
<connor> It's supposed to be very, </connor>
<connor> very light.
- I love when </connor>
<joey> it's heavy.
- I don't know </joey>
<joey> which one it is. </joey>
<joey> - I love the heaviness of American pizza. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> Like it's all like a nice- </connor>
<garnt> - By American pizza, what do you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's so many different types </garnt>
<garnt> of American pizza.
- The American style </garnt>
<connor> of making pizza is like
the, from what I understand, </connor>
<connor> like New York where it's like- </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Like Dominos. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like perfectly
constructed, right? </connor>
<connor> Where it's this slice that like, </connor>
<connor> is very solid on its own,
like when it's cut up, </connor>
<garnt> nothing like falls off, </garnt>
<garnt> nothing like fuckin'
slips off or anything. </garnt>
<connor> It's a nice, solid bit of pizza. </connor>
<garnt> I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> Also, one thing I tried, </garnt>
<garnt> which I thought was gonna
be disgusting, right? </garnt>
<garnt> This is vile, I know it sounds gross. </garnt>
<garnt> Hear me out, all right? </garnt>
<connor> I had this. </connor>
<connor> - Do you like the grease? </connor>
<garnt> Do you like the grease? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, so... </garnt>
<joey> - Hold on, hold on, hold on. </joey>
<joey> I'm listening, I'm listening. </joey>
<connor> - I tried the hot dog in the crust pizza, </connor>
<joey> and fucking I loved it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like a sausage. </joey>
<connor> - Like a hot dog in the
crust, I really enjoyed it. </connor>
<joey> - Do you like cheesy crust? </joey>
<connor> - Yes, but I liked the hot dog one more. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - It's like an extra meal. </connor>
<joey> - But what if you put the
cheese inside of the hotdog, </joey>
<garnt> and you put that in the crust? </garnt>
<joey> - That's just not even a crust anymore. </joey>
<joey> Like whenever people say, </joey>
<joey> "But do you eat stuffed crust? </joey>
<joey> Stuffed crust is good." </joey>
<joey> Stuff crust is what you
eat when you're like, </joey>
<joey> when you don't wanna
actually eat crust, okay? </joey>
<joey> It's a mozzarella stick, </joey>
<joey> okay?
- Okay yeah, I know that. </joey>
<joey> - This is just a fucking hot dog, okay? </joey>
<joey> You're eating a pizza
with a hot dog at the end. </joey>
<connor> - I like hot dogs. </connor>
<garnt> I like the hot dogs.
- That sounds amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - I like the hot dog. </joey>
<joey> You can get it in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Pizza Hut did it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<garnt> - You're not gonna pretend
that this is better </garnt>
<joey> than stone-baked pizza, or
like fresh fuckin' pizza? </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, yes.
- Okay, but in Japan, though. </joey>
<joey> - No way. </joey>
<garnt> No fucking way am I
listening to this right now. </garnt>
<joey> - In Japan, there's two types
of pizza in Japan, right? </joey>
<joey> There's pizza, and then there's pizza. </joey>
<connor> All right, two different things. </connor>
<joey> You guys laugh, but it is true. </joey>
<joey> - We got like an hour
left on this recording, </joey>
<joey> can we order a Pizza Hut pizza
with sausage in the crust? </joey>
<joey> - I actually wanna try it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just saying, we should do it. </joey>
<garnt> We should all have a live reaction. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - One, because I wanna see your reaction. </garnt>
<connor> - I want to see your reaction.
- I've had hotdog crust pizza. </connor>
<garnt> It's a hot dog crust pizza. </garnt>
<garnt> - On camera? </garnt>
<joey> Have you had it on camera? </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] I've never tried it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I want to see Joey </garnt>
<garnt> try it.
- How have you never tried it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I barely eat cheesy crust. </garnt>
<joey> I just want like, a regular crust. </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure they have it, man, </joey>
<joey> I'm telling you.
- Why don't you </joey>
<connor> like cheesy crust? </connor>
<garnt> - It's too heavy. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you want a hotdog crust? </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, it's like, it's so good. </connor>
<connor> It's like a very tight hot dog. </connor>
<joey> It's like wrapped around. </joey>
<joey> It's like a bite-sized hot dog. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a hotdog burrito. </joey>
<joey> - Bro, it's so good. </joey>
<connor> I hope they have it. </connor>
<connor> I need to check if they still have it. </connor>
<connor> - So in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> There's two types of pizza, there's pizza, </connor>
<connor> which is like stuff like
Pizza Hut, Domino's, </connor>
<connor> American pizza basically. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then this pizza,
which is the Italian pizza. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> - So like if you ever go
to like an Italian-like </connor>
<connor> restaurant or whatever, or establishment, </connor>
<connor> you'll be able to know the difference </connor>
<garnt> between like the Italian, </garnt>
<garnt> like stone-baked stuff that Garnt likes, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the American
stuff that Connor likes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - At least Japan has
made a distinction being, </garnt>
<garnt> like, at least they're
not one of those countries </garnt>
<garnt> that are like, "All pizza is the same." </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I remember when I
first went to New York, right? </garnt>
<joey> I had my first like New York pizza, </joey>
<garnt> and the selling point
of this pizza was that </garnt>
<connor> you could literally tilt-
- It's as big as your face. </connor>
<connor> - You could literally tilt the pizza, </connor>
<connor> and you could see the oil dripping off it, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, how
is this a selling point? </connor>
<connor> You're meant to make this appetizing. </connor>
<garnt> It's just pure fat that's
like rolling off now. </garnt>
<joey> - But I went to a place
in New York that was like, </joey>
<joey> I guess like kind of famous in New York. </joey>
<joey> I forgot what it was, but like, </joey>
<joey> they're famous for like
dabbing the oil off the pizza. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Off the pizza? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's really, really,
it's a massive pizza, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's really thin and really light. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So like, I don't know about the full, </joey>
<joey> whole like, oil dripping off thing, </joey>
<garnt> like if that was the selling point, </garnt>
<joey> I wouldn't eat it. </joey>
<garnt> - But the point is you're
still dabbing off the oil, </garnt>
<connor> because there is so much oil on the pizza. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - And to me, that's not appetizing. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Like when I see that much oil on anything, </connor>
<connor> that just, I don't wanna eat it, you know? </connor>
<connor> I can feel my arteries just clogging up </connor>
<joey> from eating this.
- As much as like, </joey>
<joey> there's a place called
Pizza Slice in Shibuya </joey>
<joey> that's really good, that
does a New York style pizza. </joey>
<joey> Fuckin' bomb. </joey>
<joey> I can only go there maybe
like once a month though, </joey>
<joey> because my God, after two slices, </joey>
<joey> I'm like about to explode. </joey>
<garnt> - Look, I get it where, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I get that it's a nice fast meal. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels good, it feels unhealthy. </garnt>
<garnt> But to say that it is better
than stone-baked pizza. </garnt>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<garnt> - That's where I draw the line, man. </garnt>
<garnt> No fuckin' way. </garnt>
<joey> - If I had to choose, oh God, so hard. </joey>
<connor> - I just liked pizza in general. </connor>
<connor> - It's all delicious. </connor>
<connor> - It's all delicious. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not saying that
stone-baked is not delicious, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not saying that New
York pizza is not delicious </garnt>
<joey> as well in its own way </joey>
<joey> that I love.
- Because like, </joey>
<joey> both types of pizza have their benefits. </joey>
<joey> - Cause the only thing- </joey>
<joey> - One, it can be an everyday meal. </joey>
<joey> - The only pizza that I'd
say the Americans do the best </joey>
<joey> is Chicago pizza. </joey>
<joey> - The deep dish stuff, right?
- Deep dish stuff. </joey>
<connor> But like, that's like, </connor>
<garnt> that's not even nowhere else even does it. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a pie, that's a pie. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> It's it's a pizza lasagna,
but it's a pizza lasagna. </joey>
<connor> That's what Chicago deep dish pizza is, </connor>
<joey> and that's why </joey>
<connor> it's fucking amazing.
- It's got these squared. </connor>

<garnt> Joey with the outro. </garnt>
<connor> - Back to the show. </connor>
<connor> - For me, there's something
about the fillingness </connor>
<garnt> of an American pizza
style that I love so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I love, I really, really miss </garnt>
<connor> Domino's pizza in the UK. </connor>
<connor> It was so good. </connor>
<connor> I love that piece. </connor>
<joey> - What's different about it in the UK? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why it's so good. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know either. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just biased. </joey>
<joey> - I think it just tastes the same. </joey>
<joey> That's me. </joey>
<joey> - I've had Domino's around like, </joey>
<joey> lots of different places, </joey>
<joey> and they all kind of taste the same. </joey>
<connor> - I had Little Caesar's pizza in America. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I thought it was delicious. </joey>
<joey> - The mini-pizzas? </joey>
<joey> - No, the big ones. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the big ones. </joey>
<joey> - This was like $5 for like a large, </joey>
<joey> and everyone was saying like, </joey>
<joey> "Bro, it's like the worst pizza on earth." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's not- </joey>
<joey> - I actually like, liked it. </joey>
<joey> I like oven pizza a lot. </joey>
<joey> - It's not really great. </joey>
<joey> I had it in America as well.
- I liked it. </joey>
<joey> I liked it. </joey>
<joey> - I'd much rather Domino's </joey>
<joey> than Little Caesars.
- I like Little Caesars. </joey>
<connor> And also- </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just convinced you
don't have tastebuds. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The more you talk,
the more I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Also, my enjoyment of it also increases </connor>
<garnt> knowing that for all of
that for $5, that's insane. </garnt>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's got nothing to do
- That's got nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> - With the taste.
- With the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the taste is good, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's only heightened by
the fact that it's simply $5 </garnt>
<joey> for this massive food. </joey>
<joey> Like this could feed the
entire fucking last supper, </joey>
<joey> this little Caesar's pizza. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's not that great. </joey>
<joey> That's why.
- That doesn't </joey>
<garnt> effect the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it does. </garnt>
<garnt> We go to a place, right? </garnt>
<connor> The price affects the
way you see the food. </connor>
<joey> It does. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, and that's exactly
why Little Caesars </joey>
<joey> tastes like $5 pizza,
and it's not that great. </joey>
<joey> You get a dollar slice in New York, </joey>
<joey> and it is foolish of me to act like </joey>
<connor> knowing it was $1 didn't
contribute to my enjoyment vessel. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, </joey>
<joey> but you don't go to a New
York pizza place and be like, </joey>
<joey> "I would like an exquisite
meal right now please, $1? </joey>
<joey> Oh, what a steal." </joey>
<garnt> - Is it because stone-baked
pizzas are not big enough? </garnt>
<connor> - That is one big factor. </connor>
<joey> - Is that it?
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So, hypothetically, </connor>
<connor> if you found a restaurant
here in Japan, or wherever, </connor>
<joey> that does stone-baked sourdough pizza </joey>
<joey> but it was the size of a New York pizza. </joey>
<connor> - But also they skimp out on
the toppings a lot, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan, they definitely do. </garnt>
<garnt> But if you've had like
stone-baked in England? </garnt>
<connor> Like in Europe?
- In Italy, </connor>
<connor> and a lot of the time they skimp out. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "You don't
put enough toppings on." </garnt>
<connor> Like, the sauce is
generous enough, I'd say. </connor>
<joey> But like cheese? </joey>
<joey> Like, come on man. </joey>
<joey> - I had stone-baked in Italy,
and they stacked that shit. </joey>
<garnt> - I haven't been to Italy, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> the best stone-baked pizza places I go to, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't skimp on the cheese. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't skimp on the toppings. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you're in like
a British version of it, </connor>
<connor> so they fix it. </connor>
<joey> - The one I had in
Northern Italy was packed. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Was it really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It was like- </joey>
<joey> - Every time I've had one in Italy, </joey>
<connor> it's been like, very lacking in toppings. </connor>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think you go
into the right places. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Like as the person who is like </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest simp for bread, </garnt>
<garnt> how does that not play a factor
in how these pizzas taste? </garnt>
<connor> - No, So that's more of a, </connor>
<connor> I would say stone-baked in many aspects. </connor>
<connor> in my mind, it's more
about enjoying the bread </connor>
<connor> than it is about the pizza. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't even consider it- </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like to a point where I'm like- </connor>
<connor> - It's flavored bread. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather just get like,
bread, like, at this point. </connor>
<connor> Just give me a real fuckin' pizza, bro. </connor>
<connor> If it doesn't give me like
five spots the next day, </connor>
<connor> it isn't a pizza. </connor>
<connor> I wanna be fucked up. </connor>
<connor> Fuck me up with this pizza. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> You know what? </garnt>
<connor> The board's right, British
people don't have taste. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> It's confirmed. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm team America with this one, man. </garnt>
<connor> I'm American all the way on this one. </connor>
<connor> American pizza goes hard. </connor>
<joey> It doesn't- </joey>
<joey> - There's a time and a
place for an American pizza. </joey>
<garnt> - Every time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hands down.
- Every day. </garnt>
<joey> - There is a time and a
place for American pizza, </joey>
<connor> but it is not the superior pizza. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] It is not the superior- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not the superior pizza.
- It is superior. </garnt>
<joey> - America, I salute you with your pizza. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay then. </joey>
<joey> - Your pizza slaps. </joey>
<connor> Keep doing it. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, let's see how, </joey>
<joey> okay, then question, </joey>
<joey> which one's better, Japanese
sushi or American sushi? </joey>
<joey> - I'ma head out. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Well no, obviously Japan does it better. </connor>
<connor> - Well then. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Sushi. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like, if I was to
give you a choice of like, </joey>
<connor> just standard like regular
tuna that you get a like, </connor>
<joey> a composition here, or a California roll, </joey>
<joey> which one would you choose? </joey>
<connor> - But I feel like compare, </connor>
<connor> like I feel like the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> a pizza, a stone-baked pizza, </connor>
<connor> and a pizza are like the same shit, right? </connor>
<connor> - What you've said. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But, a sushi roll is not
even remotely like sushi. </connor>
<garnt> Come on. </garnt>
<connor> You cannot sit here me dead in the eye </connor>
<connor> and tell me that you think. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, Connor, what you've basically said </garnt>
<garnt> is basically like, oh yeah, </garnt>
<joey> sweet and sour chicken
is the best Chinese food. </joey>
<joey> (Connor and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - Orange chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Orange chicken is the best. </joey>
<joey> Chicken tikka masala is the
best Indian curry, in the world. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, no. </joey>
<joey> I am not going to stand here
and listen to this bullshit, </joey>
<joey> okay? </joey>
<joey> - I've had, okay right, </joey>
<joey> I've had both pizzas. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm becoming in honorary
Italian for like a fuckin' day. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't care.
- Just to call you </joey>
<garnt> out on your fucking bullshit. </garnt>
<connor> The rest of the episode. </connor>
<connor> - If I lose my Italian fan
base for this, so be it, right? </connor>
<connor> You guys have shit pizza
compared to the Americans. </connor>
<connor> Come on.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - I just can't get over the fact that- </joey>
<connor> - Let's trace it back to World War II. </connor>
<connor> I'm just kidding. </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like with sushi and stuff like that, </connor>
<joey> there's like a lot of the
sushi is not even close. </joey>
<joey> I don't even think that's- </joey>
<joey> - How is it not close? </joey>
<joey> - They use the same ingredients. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's not. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of the time, </connor>
<connor> the ingredients aren't even similar, </connor>
<joey> I think.
- Everything inside </joey>
<connor> of a California roll, they
use in regular sushi here. </connor>
<connor> - Do they really? </connor>
<connor> - Just not together. </connor>
<connor> - What's in the California roll? </connor>
<joey> - What are the ingredients
of California roll? </joey>
<connor> - It's salmon. </connor>
<connor> - You sounded so confident. </connor>
<joey> - It's salmon, cucumber. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Does roll- </joey>
<joey> - But like, rolls in general are like </joey>
<connor> an American thing.
- So different. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so different from sushi. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say stone-baked is that far off </joey>
<joey> from normal pizza.
- But Japan has rolls as well. </joey>
<connor> - Do they really? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- No, </garnt>
<garnt> but they don't have
the same kind of rolls. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not the same kinds- </garnt>
<joey> - It's lot of fried shit, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Nothing like that. </joey>
<joey> - From what I've seen, </joey>
<garnt> Japanese rolls are just
like one fish in a roll, </garnt>
<connor> and that's it.
- I feel like </connor>
<connor> this is a dumb argument,
but I'm ready to die for it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - That's "Trash Taste" though, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - It ain't "Trash Taste"
without a food argument. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just, I'm watching
a man commit suicide, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "All right, you can kinda,
you jump off the cliff." </garnt>
<garnt> - I think- </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't say I didn't try to like, </garnt>
<garnt> grab you and warn you that this is a cliff </garnt>
<garnt> you're jumping off of. </garnt>
<connor> - I think a lot of the
viewers will agree with me </connor>
<connor> that American pizza is
better than Italian. </connor>
<connor> First of all, we have
an American audience. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's because I guarantee </joey>
<joey> that there are more Americans
watching this than Italians, </joey>
<joey> and there are more people who have been </joey>
<joey> to America than Italy. </joey>
<joey> - I've been to both. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, yes, yes.
- Still more pie. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, yes. </connor>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] A California
roll is not Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I know.
- We know that. </connor>
<connor> - What are the ingredients? </connor>
<connor> - Is it the? </connor>
<joey> - [Crew Member] Imitation crab. </joey>
<joey> - Which they have. </joey>
<joey> Which they have. </joey>
<connor> - You don't get crab on
sushi normally though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You don't really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course you do. </connor>
<joey> - Not that often. </joey>
<connor> - I get it all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Really, where?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In any sushi tray. </connor>
<joey> - You get the crab head in the thing, </joey>
<joey> but you never get like crab. </joey>
<joey> - You get crab on it, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You can, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Really, I've never seen this. </connor>
<garnt> - This is the man who just said
that meat sushi didn't exist </garnt>
<connor> even though he's had it, so I don't know. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - To be fair, I still don't
view it when I go to get sushi. </connor>
<joey> - Not exactly the most
reliable narrator, this man. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't matter. </joey>
<connor> America pizza's better than stone-baked. </connor>
<connor> I'll die on the hill.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - This is just like a bad
person making a good argument. </connor>
<connor> Like people just gonna disagree with me, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm fuckin' dumb. </connor>
<joey> It's not a good argument.
- It's a great argument. </joey>
<joey> - It's not a good.
- It's a great argument. </joey>
<joey> - It's quite in fact the opposite. </joey>
<joey> You're a good person with a shit argument. </joey>
<joey> - This is a preferential thing, </joey>
<connor> I just think the pizza's better. </connor>
<connor> It's not flat out being wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Look, I'm not saying
American pizza is bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I love American pizza.
- This is not what we are, </garnt>
<garnt> arguing by the way.
- Both pizzas </garnt>
<connor> are fantastic in their </connor>
<connor> own unique ways.
- But to act like </connor>
<connor> it is so far beyond
belief to it even insist </connor>
<connor> that American pizza could be interpreted </connor>
<connor> as better than stone-baked. </connor>
<joey> Like, that's just a wild claim. </joey>
<joey> It's not wild. </joey>
<joey> People like American pizza
more than stone-baked. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Because they've
never had stone-baked. </joey>
<connor> - They have had stone-baked. </connor>
<joey> - I want to see how many people. </joey>
<joey> - I think you'll be shocked
by the amount of viewers </joey>
<connor> that actually think American </connor>
<joey> is better than stone-baked.
- How many of our viewers </joey>
<joey> who have had both can agree with you, </joey>
<joey> and say that the American- </joey>
<connor> - Your head's in the clouds. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you say Domino's is
better than stone-baked pizza? </garnt>
<connor> - In my mind, </connor>
<garnt> I would rather Domino's pizza
than a stone-baked pizza. </garnt>
<connor> - What?
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And I have seen, right? </connor>
<connor> I remember, I remember as well, </connor>
<joey> I felt so gratified like- </joey>
<joey> - Hey yo, give this man some taste buds. </joey>
<joey> - I felt so relieved, </joey>
<joey> which, who's that guy who
was like 1500 Netflix shows? </joey>
<joey> The, I think he's a chef
from, I think Japan, </joey>
<joey> but he's he's American. </joey>
<joey> - The bearded guy? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I forgot his name. </joey>
<joey> - There was one scene, right? </joey>
<connor> Where he was doing a
whole thing about pizza, </connor>
<connor> and he went around reviewing
all different types of pizza. </connor>
<connor> And there was one scene where he's like, </connor>
<connor> "You know, at the end of the day though, </connor>
<joey> there's just something
about a Domino's pizza </joey>
<joey> that just go so hard." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yes, </joey>
<joey> yes. </joey>
<joey> - That's probably a reason why
we don't remember his name. </joey>
<joey> - Pretending like Domino's pizza, </joey>
<joey> or these like fast food
pizza taste like shit, </joey>
<garnt> you're just clowning.
- I never said that. </garnt>
<connor> - We never said that.
- We never said that. </connor>
<joey> - It's like saying a McDonald's burger </joey>
<connor> is better than like a
gourmet freshly made burger </connor>
<connor> at a burger joint, you know? </connor>
<garnt> Like, yes, there's a place for it, </garnt>
<connor> but to say that as better is like. </connor>
<connor> - I've had many burgers </connor>
<joey> where I would prefer
the McDonald's burger, </joey>
<joey> over said burger. </joey>
<joey> - Well yes, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Because a lot of the time
they're just like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> let's just get some like good beef. </joey>
<connor> Let's just like, not consider
the ratios or anything. </connor>
<connor> We should put like, shit on it. </connor>
<joey> Let's put like, </joey>
<joey> 500 crumbs of bacon.
- What I'm saying, </joey>
<joey> the argument we're making
is think of the best burger </joey>
<joey> you've ever had that wasn't McDonald's, </joey>
<joey> and put that next to a McDonald's burger, </joey>
<connor> which one would you rather?
- But I've had </connor>
<connor> a lot of pizza in Italy
that wasn't stone-baked </connor>
<joey> that I think was much
better than stone-baked, </joey>
<joey> but I was more into it
than American style. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's like- </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the heaviness of it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Stone-baked </joey>
<joey> isn't the only type of pizza. </joey>
<joey> But to me, definitely,
it is like the pinnacle. </joey>
<connor> I fucking love stone-baked.
- Fucking hell. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It's the best bread. </joey>
<connor> - You know what? </connor>
<garnt> It's because it's like the best bread, </garnt>
<garnt> the best cheese. </garnt>
<connor> - This is coming from a man
who can't appreciate the crust. </connor>
<garnt> This comes with like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like you've
already tainted the pizza </garnt>
<connor> with shit tasting crust.
- It's because </connor>
<connor> I don't eat the crust
that I can appreciate </connor>
<garnt> a fucking good stone-baked, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's the only
pizza that I eat the crust, </garnt>
<connor> okay?
- I just feel like </connor>
<connor> you have, like. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like watching a
vegan eat a chicken wing. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, oh my God, it's a monumental, </connor>
<joey> it must be really fucking good chicken. </joey>
<connor> - You don't even appreciate bread, </connor>
<connor> So how can you even have an
opinion on what's better pizza? </connor>
<connor> Like, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, you don't have a core fundamental </connor>
<connor> of bread.
- No, no, no, </connor>
<garnt> it's like, I don't
appreciate 90% of bread, </garnt>
<garnt> because to me, 90% of bread
tastes the fuckin' same, </garnt>
<joey> you know? </joey>
<joey> But it's like.
- Okay, </joey>
<joey> I'ma have to stop you </joey>
<garnt> right here, bro.
- You cannot say that. </garnt>
<joey> - I was on your side until you said that. </joey>
<connor> - That's like me going, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, every fuckin' rice and noodles </connor>
<connor> is the fuckin' same, bro. </connor>
<joey> It's like, let's just get." </joey>
<joey> - Udon is exactly the same as fuckin'- </joey>
<joey> - Why is it no different
from instant noodles? </joey>
<joey> Bro, it's 90% the same. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like 90% of the ramen noodles- </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't think you could be
racist towards white people. </connor>
<connor> But in that moment, I
think you genuinely were. </connor>
<connor> I think that was actually racist
towards white people, bro. </connor>
<joey> - French people clutching
their baguettes right now. </joey>
<connor> - French folk? Germans
are losing it right now. </connor>
<connor> That's half of German food, man. </connor>
<connor> We got to do a "Trash Taste" special </connor>
<connor> where we just take Garnt
to a German bakery, </connor>
<connor> and he just he's like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I didn't know you could have
15 different types of bread. </connor>
<joey> - Are you saying that a pretzel </joey>
<joey> tastes the same as a baguette? </joey>
<joey> - Is pretzel bread? </joey>
<connor> Oh. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] What kind of? </connor>
<connor> Yes, it's bread. </connor>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> Not the little fuckin' hard
like, cookie-esque ones. </joey>
<connor> - Like pretzels.
- Like an actual pretzel. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be honest. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> - What are you about to say? </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna be honest. </joey>
<connor> A pretzel to me is just a salted baguette. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- That's what </connor>
<connor> it tastes like to me.
- No. </connor>
<connor> What?
- That's that's kind of </connor>
<connor> what it tastes like to me.
- What? </connor>
<connor> - What?
- Okay? </connor>
<connor> - Like, to me, </connor>
<connor> bread.
- Bro. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, to me, I can't eat bread. </connor>
<connor> - This is how World War III begins. </connor>
<connor> - To me, I can't eat bread
by itself a lot of times, </connor>
<garnt> it needs to be flavored, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> It needs to have some butter on it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, for example, a baguette, </garnt>
<garnt> I need some butter with that baguette. </garnt>
<garnt> I love the times, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> Pretzels, they have salt, okay? </garnt>
<connor> - No, you can't just eat a baguette. </connor>
<connor> Like, a good baguette? </connor>
<garnt> - With butter? </garnt>
<connor> - No, just a baguette. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Just eat it by itself. </joey>
<joey> - I can't fuckin' eat
a baguette by itself. </joey>
<connor> That's just like- </connor>
<connor> - You just blew off all
of your fuckin' audience </connor>
<garnt> this is episode, Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> You like, won the Italians,
and then throw them away. </connor>
<joey> What the fuck, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> They're furious.
- No, no, no, no, no- </joey>
<joey> - Even the Italians are doing this right. </joey>
<garnt> - We need to on a European tour, </garnt>
<connor> fuckin' actually have- </connor>
<connor> - Bye-bye Europe. </connor>
<connor> - With the crust, </connor>
<connor> you're not eating, you
know, it's not like, </connor>
<connor> you have the pizza pie with the cheese, </connor>
<connor> and the toppings and everything, </connor>
<connor> and then you have the crust part, right? </connor>
<garnt> That's a very small ratio
to the whole pizza itself. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't eat a pizza-sized
crust no matter how good </garnt>
<connor> the fuckin' stone-baked crust is. </connor>
<garnt> - I can just chow down
on a whole baguette, </garnt>
<garnt> like straight down,
when it's good quality? </garnt>
<joey> Like, I don't even need-
- Pretzel as well? </joey>
<joey> Like, if it's lightly salted, </joey>
<joey> don't even don't even need </joey>
<joey> mustard with that.
- I don't think </joey>
<connor> you've had good bread, Garnt, </connor>
<joey> genuinely.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think you, if you had fresh bread, </connor>
<connor> like good bread, I think
you'd change your mind. </connor>
<garnt> - Fresh bread is good, but like- </garnt>
<connor> - What like fuckin' tesco bread? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, I've had fresh bread, </garnt>
<garnt> but bread to me is-
- What fresh bread? </garnt>
<connor> I'm skeptical now, </connor>
<garnt> where have you had this fresh bread? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so you- </joey>
<garnt> - You had fresh bread yesterday. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] That was fuckin' great. </joey>
<joey> Could I eat more than just
the slice that we got? </joey>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What? </garnt>
<garnt> - That was too much, and with the slice? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I fuckin'- </garnt>
<garnt> - I could have destroyed that whole plate. </garnt>
<connor> - No, fuck no.
- Yeah, I coulda </connor>
<connor> had that bread.
- That's way to good. </connor>
<joey> - Every time I go to </joey>
<joey> an Italian restaurant in America- </joey>
<joey> - I've had many meals where
I have enjoyed the bread, </joey>
<connor> like an amount where honestly, </connor>
<connor> if the rest of my food didn't
come out, I would be happy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, every time I go to an
Italian restaurant in America, </joey>
<joey> and they always give
you the plate of bread. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like more, I need more. </garnt>
<joey> This is not gonna be enough. </joey>
<garnt> - Bread, to me, is a starter. </garnt>
<joey> It is a starter. </joey>
<connor> It is not the meal. </connor>
<connor> You can't just have bread as a meal. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] This man would not </connor>
<connor> have survived.
- I don't know who </connor>
<connor> I'm offending wit this take right now, </connor>
<joey> but to me. </joey>
<joey> - The entire middle ages. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Peasants in the 1800's. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't just have like,
pure bread as a meal. </garnt>
<joey> I'm pretty sure like- </joey>
<joey> - If you were born in
the 1700's in Europe, </joey>
<joey> you would be so dead. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I didn't think
we're gonna have another </connor>
<joey> food episode.
- They're like, "Bread? </joey>
<joey> For dinner?" </joey>
<connor> - I feel like, right, </connor>
<connor> you guys may be such a
big deal fuckin' deal </connor>
<connor> about this pizza thing </connor>
<connor> that I didn't think it was a big deal. </connor>
<connor> - No one means this shit. </connor>
<connor> - And this man walks in here being like, </connor>
<connor> "Bread is shit," like, straight up. </connor>
<connor> Like, what? </connor>
<garnt> You don't even have like a
gluten allergy or something, </garnt>
<connor> or some shit like that to hide behind. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't say bread was shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I said, "Bread is not a meal." </garnt>
<connor> - You said "90% of bread," </connor>
<connor> and I quote, "tastes the same." </connor>
<garnt> (Connor sighing) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, I'm gonna go back
on that statement, okay? </connor>
<connor> - You better recant </connor>
<connor> that statement.
- 90% of bread </connor>
<joey> does not taste the same.
- How much percent? </joey>
<connor> How much percent? </connor>
<connor> - But I mean like- </connor>
<joey> - Grade 87%. </joey>
<connor> - Name a percent, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, with bread, I
can't have bread as a meal. </joey>
<connor> That's like having pure rice as a meal, </connor>
<connor> okay?
- No. </connor>
<joey> - As an Asian, I can't
just have a rice as a meal. </joey>
<connor> I know people can just
have rice as a meal, </connor>
<connor> but you need to fucking
seasoning on the rice. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so different.
- You need some flavoring. </garnt>
<garnt> You need something to go with the rice. </garnt>
<connor> - I can have rice as a meal. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I know you can, but now- </connor>
<garnt> - No, I know you can, but would you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Bread doesn't fill
the same role as rice. </garnt>
<joey> - It literally does. </joey>
<connor> - No, it doesn't.
- It literally does. </connor>
<connor> - No it doesn't, it doesn't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean like, </connor>
<joey> I'll completely disagree that
all bread tastes the same </joey>
<joey> or whatever, but I can agree
that all rice tastes the same. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, okay. </connor>
<joey> I would say most rice- </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> That is... </garnt>
<joey> - There is different types of rice, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But, like rice.
- Obviously, I can tell </connor>
<joey> the difference between like Japanese rice, </joey>
<connor> and like saffron rice. </connor>
<connor> - But there's like, rice pudding
and all that shit as well </connor>
<connor> that's all nonsense, but. </connor>
<joey> - Is rice pudding even rice </joey>
<joey> at that point?
- I think </joey>
<connor> comparing the roles that
bread and rice fill is like, </connor>
<connor> no, it's completely different. </connor>
<connor> It's totally different. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't believe you're Japanese, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're going to say that
all rice tastes the same, </garnt>
<garnt> where a huge part of
Japanese cuisine is like, </garnt>
<garnt> the subtle differences
in how the rice tastes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey yo, that's all bullshit there. </garnt>
<joey> That's all marketing. </joey>
<joey> It's all marketing, dude. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I will agree with- </joey>
<joey> - Every time you go to a
fuckin' Dukan or anything, </joey>
<joey> and you get like the massive meal, </joey>
<joey> and they bring out the bowl of rice, </joey>
<joey> and they're like, this
is the top branded rice </joey>
<connor> of this prefecture, and I take a bite, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Bro, this tastes </connor>
<garnt> exactly the same." </garnt>
<garnt> - You are wrong. </garnt>
<joey> It does not taste </joey>
<joey> the same.
- It tastes exactly the same. </joey>
<garnt> - You're chowing down on it
too fucking fast to appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> the subtle fuckin' taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally just carbs. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just... </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what bread is. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what bread is.
- No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally just carbs.
- No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally just carbs. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so much more than that, </garnt>
<garnt> whereas rice is just pure starch, right? </garnt>
<joey> Bread has so much more that goes </joey>
<joey> into making a good bread, right? </joey>
<joey> You've got all the different ingredients, </joey>
<joey> that go into making it.
- I'm afraid to say </joey>
<joey> anything anymore. </joey>
<connor> - Rice is just like a hundred
percent starch, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Because there is subtle
differences into how to cook rice. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, but like, </joey>
<joey> if we brought out two
bowls of rice, right? </joey>
<garnt> And one was from like
fuckin' Akita prefecture. </garnt>
<garnt> - You wouldn't tell </garnt>
<garnt> the difference.
- And another one </garnt>
<garnt> from another prefecture, </garnt>
<joey> I could not tell you
the fuckin' difference. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's not just
about the type of rice. </garnt>
<garnt> It's how you cook it as
well, which is why sushi rice </garnt>
<garnt> tastes different depending on
which sushi place you go to, </garnt>
<garnt> because- </garnt>
<garnt> - Sushi rice tastes different </garnt>
<garnt> because it's got vinegar in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's cooked with vinegar. </garnt>
<garnt> It's seasoned with vinegar, </garnt>
<garnt> right?
- Yeah, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so it's part
of the cooking process. </garnt>
<joey> - But if there was two
bowls of sushi rice, </joey>
<joey> one from Akita and one from Nagano, </joey>
<joey> you can't tell the difference. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like saying you
have two pieces of bread </garnt>
<garnt> were cooked exactly the same, </garnt>
<garnt> then they taste the
same, which they would, </garnt>
<garnt> because they're cooked
exactly the same way. </garnt>
<garnt> That's-
(Joey cackling) </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like both of these
arguments are fucking stupid. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they are. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just trying </joey>
<joey> to make sense-
- I just realized. </joey>
<connor> - Of both arguments here, </connor>
<connor> and I'm losing my mind.
- I just realized. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm losing my mind to this
fuckin' conversation now. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I do agree that
rice is less, what's the word? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Diverse. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, diverse than bread. </connor>
<connor> Like, the bread has way too many. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm saying, like my core argument </garnt>
<garnt> is that I can't eat bread as a meal. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the same way as
eating rice as a meal. </garnt>
<garnt> - I genuinely believe you
haven't had good bread, </garnt>
<garnt> like genuinely.
- I have had good bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think you have. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was the bread we had yesterday good? </garnt>
<connor> - That was, even compared to German bread, </connor>
<connor> that's mid. </connor>
<connor> - Was it good bread yesterday? </connor>
<connor> - I thought was kind of good. </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was good, </connor>
<connor> it was good, right? </connor>
<connor> Don't get me wrong, it was good bread, </connor>
<connor> but, I'm telling you, man. </connor>
<joey> I been to- </joey>
<joey> - I've never been to Germany,
so I don't know, like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I spent a lot
of my childhood in Germany, </joey>
<joey> and I can tell you,
man, it's fuckin' good. </joey>
<joey> It's so good.
- I bet. </joey>
<joey> - Every time we go a German
restaurant, it's like, amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's like, </joey>
<joey> the only thing that
Germany does well, right? </joey>
<connor> Is the three foods that
Germany specialize in, </connor>
<connor> beer, which is food there. </connor>
<joey> It's not a drink, it's a food. </joey>
<joey> You have bread, and then you have meat. </joey>
<garnt> The meat is good, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sausages.
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking amazing, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Great sausages. </connor>
<connor> - There's a reason why
they stick to three things, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they fucking do it amazing. </connor>
<connor> The bread is insane. </connor>
<joey> Everyone's like French baguettes. </joey>
<joey> No, like French baguettes
can fuck themselves, bro. </joey>
<joey> German bread is like
20,000 light years ahead. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Of it. </joey>
<connor> It's not even comparable. </connor>
<garnt> - So could you, what if you
could have bread as a meal, </garnt>
<connor> why don't you then? </connor>
<connor> - You're saying you want variation, right? </connor>
<connor> You want like, different things. </connor>
<connor> Like, if you just have bread every, </connor>
<joey> yeah, you will get bored, </joey>
<joey> but I can easily have bread
occasionally as a full meal </joey>
<joey> if I needed to. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - If it was German bread,
yeah, no qualms about it. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, if it was German bread, </joey>
<connor> I guess.
- Like a fresh pretzel? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, if you give me like
three pretzels just by itself, </connor>
<connor> not like no mustard or anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Give me a beer too? </garnt>
<joey> - Give me a beer with that, oh. </joey>
<garnt> - I need a stronger taste than just bread. </garnt>
<joey> - Because you haven't had good bread. </joey>
<joey> - You haven't had a good- </joey>
<connor> - I have had good bread. </connor>
<connor> No matter how good the bread is, </connor>
<connor> I can't eat a bread as an entire meal. </connor>
<joey> - We're going to Germany.
- You know? </joey>
<joey> - We're going to Germany. </joey>
<joey> - Go to Germany, get a good pretzel. </joey>
<joey> - I can appreciate good bread, </joey>
<joey> I can appreciate a good slice </joey>
<joey> before the actual meal comes up, </joey>
<joey> before the actual serving </joey>
<joey> of whatever dish I've ordered comes out, </joey>
<connor> you know, a bread is a good starter, </connor>
<connor> gets the pallet going, </connor>
<connor> but can I eat an entire? </connor>
<connor> If I go to a restaurant and I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - You're lucky we have a
Russian, not a German dub. </connor>
<connor> I'll tell you that, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - "Waiter, I would like to
order an entire plate of bread, </garnt>
<garnt> and nothing else." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, no, I can't do that. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why you go to the bakery. </connor>
<joey> You don't go to the restaurant for </joey>
<joey> a piece of bread.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> There's a big bakery that
serves exclusively bread. </connor>
<connor> - Can I get like, bacon there too? </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, cut out the middleman, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, made for people
who want bread as a meal, </joey>
<joey> perhaps, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Oh my fucking God. </joey>
<garnt> - You're exhausted now, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - I am exhausted. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't wait for this fucking
hotdog crust to turn up. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I wanna try this shit, dude. </joey>
<connor> - It's so good.
- I really want to </connor>
<connor> try this shit. </connor>

<joey> - [Sydney] Also, I just wanna say, </joey>
<joey> Garnt, that you said every beer, </joey>
<joey> or not beer, bread, </joey>
<joey> where you make it, it'll taste the same, </joey>
<joey> even if it has the ingredients. </joey>
<joey> Actually, it's been
proven that when an air, </joey>
<joey> like bread rises, the air surrounding it, </joey>
<connor> depending on the region,
completely changes the taste. </connor>
<connor> (Connor mockingly singing) </connor>
<joey> So shut the hell up. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Sydney.
- Can we put </connor>
<joey> this in the episode?
- Sydney, </joey>
<joey> you're meant to be on my side. </joey>
<garnt> - [Sydney] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sydney, Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> - Put it in, Bruda. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Sydney] And then you put in- </garnt>
<garnt> - Justice has been served. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't believe I've
been betrayed by this. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney, we're meant to be a fuckin' team. </garnt>
<garnt> - Top 10 anime betrayals. </garnt>
<joey> - [Sydney] No, because
you're also saying like, </joey>
<joey> you guys are say like
rice tastes the same, </joey>
<joey> like what kind of fucking like, honestly? </joey>
<joey> - No, rice does taste the same. </joey>
<joey> - Rice does taste the same. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't taste the same. </joey>
<joey> - [Sydney] The complete difference between </joey>
<joey> Thai rice, Japanese rice. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you.
- But all </joey>
<joey> Japanese rice tastes the same. </joey>
<garnt> - No, but all rice does
not taste the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does. </garnt>
<joey> All Japanese rice tastes the same. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, all Japanese rice tastes the same. </joey>
<joey> You guys are fooling yourselves. </joey>
<joey> It all tastes the same. </joey>
<joey> It's all a marketing ploy. </joey>
<joey> It's all a marketing ploy, </joey>
<joey> don't believe that shit when
they tell you at the rural con. </joey>
<joey> They could be giving
you fuckin' hundred yen, </joey>
<joey> like microwave packaged
rice for all I care. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but while we're
waiting for the hotdog crust, </garnt>
<garnt> I do have a story. </garnt>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<joey> - That finishes the lasagna
arc, lasagna story arc. </joey>
<joey> Well, it's not even like a,
it's like a side story now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So after our housewarming party, </joey>
<joey> we got a pretty merry, </joey>
<joey> and there was one thing I
had forgotten about Japan, </joey>
<joey> because in my previous place, </joey>
<garnt> I lived on like a high enough floor </garnt>
<garnt> that I didn't need to worry
about bugs or wildlife </garnt>
<garnt> or that kind of thing, </garnt>
<garnt> because nothing could
ever reach the top floor </garnt>
<garnt> of my apartment at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I forgot that Japan
has cockroaches, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - They sure do, guys. </garnt>
<joey> Most countries do. </joey>
<joey> - I had completely forgotten </joey>
<joey> that Japan had cockroaches, right? </joey>
<joey> And what we found out
was during the party, </joey>
<joey> we didn't close one of our windows fully. </joey>
<joey> So the window was slightly ajar, </joey>
<connor> and we had left the food out, </connor>
<connor> because unlike in Thailand
where we were taught </connor>
<connor> to clean up everything every day, </connor>
<connor> because cockroaches can come, </connor>
<connor> living in a house, </connor>
<connor> we had forgotten that cockroaches can come </connor>
<connor> because we are living on the bottom floor, </connor>
<connor> where a lot of cockroaches
are, unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's a pretty new house, </connor>
<connor> so we didn't have to
worry about that before. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't notice this,
or I didn't know this </connor>
<connor> until me and Sydney were
having dinner the next day, </connor>
<connor> we'd cooked a nice meal, </connor>
<connor> because Sydney had cooked a nice meal, </connor>
<garnt> and we were enjoying this
curry that she had cooked. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were like chowing down, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I look over, and
in the corner of my eye, </garnt>
<garnt> I see a black speck move about, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I move over and I look over, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a fat fucking cockroach. </garnt>
<joey> - How fat are we talking? </joey>
<garnt> - It's about that size. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] That's pretty,
that's a decent size. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a decent sized </garnt>
<joey> cockroach.
- Just moved in. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I had just moved in, </joey>
<joey> and I literally got PTSD, </joey>
<joey> because if you don't remember, </joey>
<joey> I had had a previous experience </joey>
<joey> with a cockroach in Thailand. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The famous cockroach story? </joey>
<joey> - If you wanna check that out, </joey>
<joey> there's a clip where I tell the story, </joey>
<joey> but I had had a previous
experience in Thailand </joey>
<joey> with a cockroach, </joey>
<joey> and it wasn't a pleasant
experience at all. </joey>
<joey> And I remember seeing this cockroach, </joey>
<joey> and Sydney was like, chatting away to me, </joey>
<joey> and she was like, "Garnt...Garnt?" </joey>
<joey> And I just, like, I was just silent. </joey>
<joey> I was just staring at this cockroach. </joey>
<joey> (Connor singing suspensefully)
And then </joey>
<garnt> she like starts getting angry, </garnt>
<garnt> "Garnt, listen to me." </garnt>
<garnt> And she says that, and
then she looks over, </garnt>
<garnt> and then we're just
both staring in silence. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's as if the cockroach knew </garnt>
<garnt> that we were looking at it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was flexing, because as
soon as Sydney looks over, </garnt>
<garnt> it just crawls away into
the air conditioning </garnt>
<garnt> in one of the holes,
and it just disappears. </garnt>
<garnt> And me and Sydney are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> How do we burn this entire house down? </garnt>
<garnt> We can't burn this entire house down. </garnt>
<garnt> We just moved into this place," right? </garnt>
<joey> - The cockroach literally
did an understandable, </joey>
<garnt> "Have a nice day," to you, </garnt>
<joey> just going off. </joey>
<joey> - And me and Sidney were
just sitting here in silence. </joey>
<joey> We were like war veterans, right? </joey>
<joey> Because we were just like,
we literally escaped- </joey>
<joey> - Not this again. </joey>
<joey> - We literally escaped this country, </joey>
<joey> we literally escaped Thailand </joey>
<joey> so we didn't have to
experience this again. </joey>
<joey> And here we are moved into our new place, </joey>
<garnt> where we've been here for like a month, </garnt>
<garnt> and we have a single
cockroach in our house. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, what do we do? </garnt>
<garnt> So we sit there for
about an hour being like, </garnt>
<garnt> well, do we move out again? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that a viable option? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what does the contract say, right? </garnt>
<connor> And then eventually I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I start going on Amazon and I buy like, </connor>
<connor> every cockroach related product I can find </connor>
<connor> in terms of like, cockroach
traps, cockroach sprays, </connor>
<connor> even though I've had previous experience </connor>
<connor> with cockroach sprays. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] No, spray never works. </connor>
<garnt> - I start reading-
- Sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> Some of the fuckers are
built like brick stone. </connor>
<joey> - If Terraformers has taught us anything, </joey>
<garnt> that shit don't work. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes.
- They are invincible. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so like I started doing research </joey>
<joey> about Japanese cockroaches, </joey>
<joey> and if sprays actually work, </joey>
<joey> or if traps actually works, </joey>
<joey> because my experience with
cockroaches in Thailand </joey>
<connor> is that sprays don't work at fuckin' all, </connor>
<connor> and it can actually make
the situation worse. </connor>
<connor> - They just like, scream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they just-
(Connor screeching) </connor>
<connor> - They just scream. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] They go beserk mode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and so that was, </joey>
<joey> so I order everything, </joey>
<joey> and I just try to forget
about the cockroach, </joey>
<joey> but like that night, </joey>
<joey> me and Sydney slept
with like one eye open. </joey>
<joey> Like we couldn't sleep that night, </joey>
<connor> 'cause we were just like, how can we sleep </connor>
<connor> knowing that there is a
fucking cockroach downstairs? </connor>
<connor> What happens if I go to
the toilet, and I see it? </connor>
<connor> Well, I just hear a
scuffling about, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] In the dark, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so in the dark. </connor>
<connor> So, we finally go to sleep, </connor>
<connor> and then first thing in the morning </connor>
<connor> I go downstairs to go to my office, </connor>
<connor> because my office is on the bottom floor, </connor>
<connor> and my living room and dining
room is on the second floor. </connor>
<connor> And I go downstairs, and what do I see? </connor>
<connor> It's the fucker. </connor>
<connor> It's right in the center
of my living room. </connor>
<connor> - It's got a lot of balls. </connor>
<connor> - It has got a lot of balls. </connor>
<connor> - Right on the kitchen. </connor>
<connor> - And I fuckin' freeze up. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> How do I get rid of this cockroach? </connor>
<connor> What do I do now? </connor>
<connor> I don't have my spray. </connor>
<connor> I don't, like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I'm kind of scared that
it's just gonna run off, </connor>
<connor> maybe it's gonna fly, and
like hit me in the face again, </connor>
<connor> and like, maybe it's gonna
be a similar experience </connor>
<connor> to what had happened in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting out the shoe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting out the shoe. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like,
(Connor imitating whip) </connor>
<connor> - It's that spirit you've got. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, looking around. </connor>
<connor> What do I do? </connor>
<connor> Do I try and kill it? </connor>
<connor> Do I chase it away? </connor>
<connor> What do I do? </connor>
<connor> And then I'm trying to
ninja my way down, right? </connor>
<connor> And as soon as I try to do that, </connor>
<connor> it sees me, and then it
starts running, right? </connor>
<connor> It starts running. </connor>
<connor> And then I look at it, and I realize, </connor>
<connor> wait a minute, it's
running so fuckin' slowly, </connor>
<connor> because my experience was
with Thailand cockroach </connor>
<connor> is that they're like fuckin' Sonic. </connor>
<connor> They're like fuckin'
speedy motherfucker's. </connor>
<connor> This cockroach was running at full speed, </connor>
<connor> and it was just running like this. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> and then I like, I corner
it so it runs the other way, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm still afraid that he can fly, </connor>
<connor> and I chase it towards the stairs, right? </connor>
<connor> And I assume that it's just
gonna get to the stairs, </connor>
<connor> and fly off. </connor>
<connor> It goes to the edge of the stairs, right? </connor>
<connor> And this stupid motherfucker, right? </connor>
<connor> It tries to go on the side of the stairs, </connor>
<connor> and it just drops, right? </connor>
<connor> It just drops, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, wait a minute, </connor>
<connor> these fuckers can't fly. </connor>
<connor> They can't fly, and they're slow as fuck. </connor>
<joey> And then suddenly I'm like,
I'm starting to feel myself. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, all right, all right, </joey>
<joey> maybe I got a chance here. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I don't need the cockroach spray. </joey>
<joey> I can get rid of this by myself. </joey>
<joey> So eventually the cockroach, right now, </joey>
<joey> is on the bottom floor,
so it's not even flying. </joey>
<joey> It didn't even like fly down, </joey>
<joey> It just walked, stumbled down, </joey>
<joey> like, landed on his back, </joey>
<joey> like, went downstairs, and
it kept going downstairs. </joey>
<connor> So, I run down the stairs
and I go into my office, </connor>
<connor> and I try to grab the
closest thing I could find </connor>
<connor> to fuckin' slam this thing, right? </connor>
<connor> And so the closest thing
I could find in this rush </connor>
<garnt> happened to be a mouse pad, </garnt>
<garnt> a booby mouse pad, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt, what is that gonna do? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Why? </garnt>
<connor> - You literally could
have got anything else. </connor>
<joey> - I think your fist would have been </joey>
<garnt> more accurate.
- 'Cause I </garnt>
<connor> didn't wanna, like, </connor>
<joey> I didn't wanna stain myself, okay? </joey>
<joey> So the closest-
- You're gonna stain </joey>
<joey> the booby mouse pad? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, okay. </joey>
<joey> Weebs are crying right now. </joey>
<joey> It was the fastest thing I could find </joey>
<garnt> in the rush.
- Fuck off, </garnt>
<connor> was this the fastest thing you could find. </connor>
<joey> - Do you just have booby
mouse pads on your floor? </joey>
<joey> - Because I was looking for something, </joey>
<joey> like a shoe or something, </joey>
<joey> but everything in my office, </joey>
<joey> like I can't grab- </joey>
<garnt> - Isn't your office right next
to where you keep your shoes? </garnt>
<garnt> So my shoes were in the cupboard, right? </garnt>
<joey> - What about the slam dunk shoes? </joey>
<garnt> (speakers laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I am not going to use
my fuckin' slam dunkers. </joey>
<joey> - Slam dunk. </joey>
<joey> - So it was like most of the
things in my office are figures </joey>
<joey> or most of the things I see like figures, </joey>
<joey> or like glass, or like solid shit. </joey>
<joey> So the only thing that I felt that </joey>
<joey> was the closest thing-
- Had elasticity? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, elasticity, </connor>
<connor> with this thing I could slam this thing </connor>
<garnt> without having to worry about it braking, </garnt>
<garnt> happened to be the booby mousepad, right? </garnt>
<connor> - What's wrong with you guys? </connor>
<garnt> Where was that? </garnt>
<joey> - I wasn't thinking, okay? </joey>
<connor> - There's nothing else in your room? </connor>
<joey> - Is this the domestic
girlfriend one that you got? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, so this is me-
- A fuckin' signed </connor>
<garnt> piece of memorabilia. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't signed, it wasn't signed. </garnt>
<joey> I have my signed piece of memorabilia. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It was the worst girl. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, okay, </joey>
<joey> so this was just like, </joey>
<joey> I explained this, like I
thought about this consciously, </joey>
<joey> no, I just ran in my room just
like, grabbed this mouse pad. </joey>
<joey> That was the closest thing,
and just ran back out, </joey>
<joey> and by instincts, or
maybe not by instinct, </joey>
<joey> so I grabbed like the booby
side of things, right? </joey>
<joey> I grabbed the tit side of things, right? </joey>
<connor> But like, this mousepad is like, </connor>
<connor> you've felt a booby mousepad.
- It's flimsy, </connor>
<joey> but it still has some weight to it, right? </joey>
<joey> So it's not exactly like
I'm hitting it with paper, </joey>
<garnt> it has a little bit of weight, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like slapping someone like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd love to see how you picked this up, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "Yes, this
is the weapon, my Lord." </connor>
<joey> God sent like the fucking
gladiator stadium, like guns. </joey>
<joey> You may choose a weapon of your choice. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Picks up a rock. </joey>
<connor> - Picks up the booby mousepad. </connor>
<connor> "I'm ready." </connor>
<garnt> - Look, I had picked it up. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd committed to it, </garnt>
<joey> because I was scared that
I would run back out, </joey>
<joey> and the cockroach would be gone, </joey>
<joey> but thankfully I ran back
out, it was still there. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, great. </joey>
<garnt> I fuckin' wham it once, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> We're at full strength, slap
it, doesn't do anything. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, yeah.
- Well, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That makes it like an air cannon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm just like, wham
it once, didn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> Wham it twice, didn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just fuckin'... </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt huffing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like... </garnt>
<connor> - Like fuckin' Quentin Tarantino scene. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like a scene from a
gangster movie or something, </garnt>
<garnt> instead I don't have a hammer, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not bashing someone's head in, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm bashing this fucking cockroach in. </garnt>
<garnt> - With a booby. </garnt>
<garnt> - With a booby mousepad, </garnt>
<garnt> and like this thing, okay. </garnt>
<connor> So I hit it, it falls
over, runs back again, </connor>
<connor> flips over, runs back again. </connor>
<connor> - We're fucking you now. </connor>
<connor> - But after about five slams, </connor>
<connor> it starts slowing down. </connor>
<connor> This thing was like fucking boss battle, </connor>
<joey> and it had a fucking health bar. </joey>
<joey> I could see his health
bar twitting down, right? </joey>
<joey> Sydney's like, "Garnt,
what's going on? Garnt?" </joey>
<joey> I don't say anything. </joey>
<joey> I need to concentrate on kicking- </joey>
<joey> - A boss battle. </joey>
<joey> - All I hear is the boss battle. </joey>
<joey> - All I hear is the fucking
"Dark Souls" boss battle music. </joey>
<connor> I go for it for another three times. </connor>
<connor> It's like, crawling now, but I
still can't do the finishing, </connor>
<connor> like I still can't deal
the finishing blow. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm just like, finally,
after it starts crawling, </garnt>
<garnt> I start using my head. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, wait a minute,
this isn't the heavy side. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought you meant literally like. </joey>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<joey> What's harder than a booby mouse pad? </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, wait a minute,
this isn't the heavy side. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, all right, I'm
gonna do the finishing move. </garnt>
<garnt> I turn the mouse pad over
so it's booby side up. </garnt>
<garnt> This is where all the weight is, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I go for one more, fuckin' wham. </garnt>
<garnt> Direct hit, one-hit
kill, it is dead, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It is- </garnt>
<joey> - He literally went from like, </joey>
<joey> he went from dual blade to a broad sword. </joey>
<connor> - I can't believe you're
framing this story </connor>
<connor> like some kind of victory. </connor>
<garnt> It's sounds like the most
pathetic thing I've ever heard. </garnt>
<connor> - Because when it's like,
when I saw it belly up, right? </connor>
<connor> I literally was panting, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's the soft spot. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like... </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt panting) </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney runs down, right? </garnt>
<garnt> She's like panicking, 'cause
she thought I just fell down </garnt>
<garnt> the fuckin' stairs or something, </garnt>
<garnt> because all she heard
was like, wham, wham, </garnt>
<garnt> and me just heavy breathing. </garnt>
<connor> And all Sydney witnesses is just me </connor>
<connor> standing over the dead
corpse of this cockroach </connor>
<connor> with a booby mousepad in hand, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, in my mind, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Do you see what you get? </connor>
<connor> Do you see what you get if
you mess with the warrior?" </connor>
<connor> So like, that's how I felt. </connor>
<connor> I'd never felt so much </connor>
<connor> adrenaline-
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Should hold up the mouse and be like. </connor>
<joey> (speakers screaming) </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I just wanna know why
was the cockroach, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't think I've ever heard
of a cockroach be that slow. </joey>
<joey> Maybe it ate too much lasagna.
- I've seen some. </joey>
<connor> There are some slow cockroaches. </connor>
<joey> - It ate the lasagna, probably. </joey>
<connor> - We don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, oh fuck, I'm so full, </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna stop.
- I'm gonna take my time. </connor>
<joey> Nice walking.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But that means you probably have more. </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<garnt> - That means you probably have more. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I mean, we already saw
one, and we've only seen- </garnt>
<joey> - Saw one. </joey>
<joey> - You only saw one, but you
know these sneaky motherfuckers </joey>
<garnt> probably created a colony. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've got a load of traps
out just in case, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - I've been dealing with a pest of my own. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like I gonna
say like Garnt or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, true, but. </connor>
<connor> Fucking pigeons keep
shitting on my balcony. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I put the grass down. </connor>
<connor> They keep shitting on the grass. </connor>
<connor> Do you know how hard it
is to clean fake grass? </connor>
<joey> - That's so weird, 'cause
you've seen my balcony. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, I have. </connor>
<connor> I was gonna ask, how do you
not get pigeons shitting </connor>
<connor> on your balcony?
- Never. </connor>
<connor> - They come here, they chill there. </connor>
<connor> I'll literally, I'll
clean it all up, right? </connor>
<connor> It'll take like 30 minutes
to clean all this shit up. </connor>
<connor> There's so much crap. </connor>
<joey> - The only place actually
that I get pigeons </joey>
<joey> is the window in my office, </joey>
<joey> which is on the edge of the building. </joey>
<connor> - I think, because there's
like, my balcony is inward, </connor>
<joey> so it's like there's no wind or anything. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So I think it's like
nice and cozy for them, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they always go for the corner top, </joey>
<joey> like they nestle </joey>
<joey> in the corner.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they shit on this
thing relentlessly. </joey>
<joey> I literally clean it, and
I'll come back the next day, </joey>
<connor> and they'd be like 15 poops. </connor>
<connor> (Joey giggling) </connor>
<connor> And it's annoying', cause
it's like solidifies. </connor>
<joey> - You need to have something
to like, anti-pigeon. </joey>
<connor> - So now I've started having to, </connor>
<connor> I've gone through like
every method in the book. </connor>
<joey> I've got reflective shit
all over my balcony now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - It's just everywhere.
- Hanging up CDs? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like stuff that
reflects, and so far, so far- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It's working? </joey>
<connor> - No poop. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, that's good. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm hoping that I
don't get any more poop. </connor>
<connor> - God, just remembering that story </connor>
<garnt> is just getting me ugly man, sorry. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't realize how relentless
these pigeons could be. </connor>
<garnt> - Right.
- And they're so noisy too. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they are.
- I'll be sleeping. </garnt>
<connor> I've got a PTSD, I'll hear the... </connor>
<connor> (Connor trilling) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Fuck, get
out of here you damn kids." </connor>
<joey> - Pulls out the shotgun. </joey>
<joey> "Half my life." </joey>
<joey> - I get Garnt's M-16 from the figure rack, </joey>
<joey> so my, "Who wants some freedom?" </joey>
<joey> (Joey trilling) </joey>
<joey> - Why didn't you use the
M-16 on the cockroach? </joey>
<connor> - The M-16 is here. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, should take it home, shouldn't you? </connor>
<joey> - If we ever get a cockroach, </joey>
<connor> we'll win. </connor>
<joey> - Picks up cigarette. </joey>
<joey> - Pull out the big guns. </joey>
<joey> - With the cigarette in his mouth. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - M-16 resting on his shoulder. </connor>
<joey> - I dare you. </joey>
<joey> I dare you to come. </joey>
<connor> - Take another bottle of zen, </connor>
<garnt> cockroach, I dare you. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, because
after we killed it, </garnt>
<connor> or after I killed it, you know? </connor>
<connor> - We? We? </connor>
<connor> - There's no we thing,
don't even go there. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Our victory. </connor>
<connor> - After I killed it, </connor>
<garnt> after I successfully slayed
this fuckin' demon, then- </garnt>
<connor> - Could probably hear fuckin' Lisa </connor>
<joey> playing in the background. </joey>
<joey> (Connor singing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So after I slay this demon, </joey>
<connor> we got the brush out. </connor>
<connor> We sweep it away, right? </connor>
<connor> So I take it outside, lay it out. </connor>
<connor> Turns out the boss had a second phase. </connor>
<connor> It fucking gets up again, right? </connor>
<connor> I saw it scurry, and then-
- Second phase. </connor>
<connor> - All the old classic play at the end, </connor>
<connor> old classic. </connor>
<connor> - It's so weird, because
when we were sweeping in, </connor>
<connor> no movement, fucking dead. </connor>
<connor> Soon as it goes outside. </connor>
<connor> - That's a pro right there. </connor>
<connor> - Soon as it goes outside, turns
over, start scuttling away. </connor>
<garnt> So I had fuckin' hit
it again, hit it again. </garnt>
<garnt> - With what? </garnt>
<garnt> - With the broom, </garnt>
<garnt> With the broom, right? </garnt>
<joey> - But if it's outside, then
just leave it, all right? </joey>
<garnt> - You know, no. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not about, </garnt>
<joey> it's about sending a message. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] You did send a message, inside. </connor>
<connor> - What if the kids are watching, </connor>
<connor> outside?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's actually true. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but then eventually I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> fuck it, you know? </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna let this one go. </connor>
<garnt> I'll be like, "Tell your friends, </garnt>
<garnt> tell your friends what happens
if you enter this house," </garnt>
<joey> you know? </joey>
<connor> - Come again, </connor>
<connor> I dare you.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Come again. </connor>
<connor> - And that was how Garnt
became a local hero. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> All right. </joey>
<joey> The hot dog pizza has arrived. </joey>
<joey> - Do we know how much it
was, do you have a receipt? </joey>
<connor> - [Crew Member] About 22 hundred. </connor>
<joey> - Fuck me man.
- 22 bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- For pizza this size? </connor>
<joey> - Look at this.
- It looks delicious, though. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's 50 off though. </joey>
<joey> This was $20. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Thanks Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - What a joke. </connor>
<connor> Look at that. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> It's like actual, like, sausages. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, bro. </connor>
<joey> Dig in. </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - Dig in, y'all. </joey>
<connor> - What kind of pizza is it? </connor>
<connor> - Just a normal Margherita,
or no, it looks at pepperoni. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, give me a slice. </connor>
<garnt> Go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're not gonna tell me </garnt>
<garnt> that this is better than the stone-baked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, this is, bro. </garnt>
<joey> Look at the size.
- Well, okay, </joey>
<joey> to be fair-
- Oh, look how </joey>
<connor> moist that cardboard is.
- I'm not a massive </connor>
<joey> fan of Pizza Hut pizza in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - No, the Pizza Hut, </connor>
<connor> this one in Japan is weak, bro. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's not great, but. </joey>
<joey> I am curious to see how this... </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How the sausage is gonna fair. </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty good, actually. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, pizza is pizza, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's gonna taste good no matter what. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just love that thick,
cheesy taste, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - I love thick bread. </joey>
<garnt> - I like how we're just eating. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Audio-only listeners, I apologize. </joey>
<garnt> - What point were we
trying to prove again? </garnt>
<connor> - The hotdog. </connor>
<connor> I mean, when you get to it, try it. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - And then wrap it up a little bit, </connor>
<garnt> get some sauce. </garnt>
<connor> - Can I just eat it first? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like it's gonna taste less good </joey>
<joey> than the pizza side. </joey>
<joey> I've gotta have some sauce
left, some cheese on it? </joey>
<joey> (relaxing music) </joey>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - Such a weird pause.
- It's a hot dog. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I love it. </connor>
<garnt> (relaxing music) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I fuck with this. </joey>
<joey> - Right, isn't it good? </joey>
<joey> - It's weirdly good. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I've had this before. </garnt>
<connor> - It shouldn't be this good. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I normally get dip as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this better than stuffed crust? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think so. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's better than stuffed crust. </connor>
<connor> - This is so good. </connor>
<connor> I love that. </connor>
<joey> - I don't like the cheese
they use in stuffed crust. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's too thick. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, </connor>
<joey> it's way too thick.
- And it's like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like it tastes very similar, </joey>
<garnt> so you just get a lot of
cheese, like way too much. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you have to have
the fresh stuffed crust. </garnt>
<garnt> Because when starts-
- We'll finish this later. </garnt>
<garnt> - When it starts off.
- Staff, please, try. </garnt>
<joey> - Give us your </joey>
<connor> verdict.
- Staff, give it a go. </connor>
<connor> - Give us a go. </connor>
<garnt> - We need a second opinion on the show. </garnt>
<joey> - When it starts to harden a bit, </joey>
<garnt> that's when stuff crust. </garnt>
<joey> - [Crew Member] I don't like, what is it? </joey>
<joey> What is it outside? </joey>
<connor> - Well, normally, sometimes
it's inside, but I like it. </connor>
<connor> I think it's good. </connor>
<connor> I want Sydney's verdict, because American. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah Sydney, what's your
verdict as an American, Sydney? </garnt>
<joey> - [Sydney] I'll try it, </joey>
<joey> so do I eat the- </joey>
<joey> - Why don't you just eat the- </joey>
<joey> - Just eat it how you normally would, </joey>
<joey> and then when you get to the crust, </joey>
<joey> just leave a little bit of the pizza, </joey>
<connor> and then just go from the side. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's like, "Leftover pizza? </connor>
<garnt> Can you believe?"
- Oh, are we doing later? </garnt>
<connor> I died. </connor>
<joey> I'll finish it later. </joey>
<joey> - Who just leaves a pizza? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not that hungry, I'll be honest. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Wanted my American. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not American, but Goddamn, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I wish I was. </connor>
<connor> Maybe that's why I'm so angry
about them all the time, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just wanna be an American maybe. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> I wish I was-
- He's angry at something </joey>
<joey> he can't be. </joey>
<joey> - I just, I wish I could be American. </joey>
<connor> - [Crew Member] It's an
option, I mean, it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - With dip, it's way better. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe.
- When you get </joey>
<joey> some dip on it, man. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Crew Member] It's an option. </connor>
<connor> - If you put some ranch on that shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, bro. </connor>
<connor> It's different. </connor>
<connor> - Or garlic and herb, </connor>
<garnt> or something.
- It's not stone-baked. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't put ranch on stone-baked. </garnt>
<joey> - [Sydney] No. </joey>
<garnt> - You shouldn't put ranch
on stone-baked, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - So then what's the verdict? </garnt>
<garnt> - I wouldn't dare. </garnt>
<joey> - [Sydney] If I was drunk,
this would be like heaven. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Sydney] But normally, </joey>
<joey> no, I'd rather cheese in the crust. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> I suppose.
- I would </connor>
<garnt> prefer cheese in the crust as well. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like you get a pizza, </connor>
<joey> and then at the end you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh shit."
- You get like, </joey>
<joey> a little meal at the end.
- A little hotdog. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- All right, okay. </joey>
<joey> I like, I like it. </joey>
<joey> I never go to a restaurant
and look a waiter in the eye </joey>
<joey> and be like, </joey>
<connor> can I have the option with
the hot dog in the crust? </connor>
<connor> But, if I can call up a
pizza place and tell them, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, can you send it with the crust." </connor>
<garnt> For some reason, I feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I've figured out your taste, </garnt>
<joey> which is you need some variety in it. </joey>
<joey> You can't just have like, even
if something tastes amazing, </joey>
<garnt> you can't just have that same thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I can eat
bread, like straight up. </connor>
<garnt> - Except for bread, apparently. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like two
ends of the spectrum. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Either side the no variety, </joey>
<connor> or too much variety.
- This is where half and half </connor>
<joey> is amazing as well. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I love half and half. </garnt>
<garnt> Who doesn't want half and half? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want half and half. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I don't like half and half. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't like half and half.
- Why? </garnt>
<connor> Why would you not want
two different flavors? </connor>
<garnt> - Because why not just
order the superior flavor? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And just- </garnt>
<connor> - Well maybe two flavors are amazing, </connor>
<connor> and I want to experience both. </connor>
<garnt> - One flavor is always the best, </garnt>
<joey> so I order that flavor,
and that's all I need, </joey>
<joey> because-
- I feel like this is weird. </joey>
<joey> - I agree. </joey>
<joey> - Because if you have </joey>
<joey> half and half-
- Do you never </joey>
<joey> get half and half? </joey>
<connor> - Never. </connor>
<connor> - Very rarely. </connor>
<connor> - Never by choice. </connor>
<connor> It's always at a party, right? </connor>
<connor> Because you need variety
at a party, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I often find that
at halfway through a pizza, </connor>
<garnt> especially heavy one, </garnt>
<joey> I kind of need something
else to kind of mix it up </joey>
<joey> so that I'm not tasting
just the same, same, </joey>
<joey> same, same, same. </joey>
<joey> - But, for me-
- That's what dip is for. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, well dip, I mean, I love dip too. </garnt>
<garnt> When I have pizza, </garnt>
<garnt> I want like every dip on the table, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, dunk, dunk, dunk. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Well, for me, if I have the same thing, </connor>
<garnt> but it's an amazing same thing, </garnt>
<garnt> then I can just eat that endlessly </garnt>
<garnt> until I'm full.
- That's true, </garnt>
<garnt> because pizza is like, </garnt>
<garnt> that style of pizza we
just had is quite heavy. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, getting four or
five slices of that in, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> I need a gingersnap.
- You know what's not? </garnt>
<garnt> - Stone-baked.
- Stone-baked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which they aren't. </garnt>
<connor> Again, I'm not saying
that stone-baked is like, </connor>
<joey> better.
- It's like </joey>
<joey> Garnt was waiting for that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Garnt's like "Now
is the time to strike." </joey>
<joey> - That's what he does, right? </joey>
<joey> If you fold up a stone-baked pizza </joey>
<joey> into one little ball, </joey>
<joey> it's like one slice of a normal
American pizza, in depth. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Do you fold up your pizza into a ball? </joey>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<connor> Yo, can we do that? </connor>
<connor> Can we roll up a stone-baked
pizza into a ball, </connor>
<connor> and just like, take a bite out of it? </connor>
<joey> - Just like kind of wrap it around, </joey>
<connor> so it'll just turn into a dim sum. </connor>
<joey> - Kind of like a dim sum. </joey>
<connor> - It's like wove around. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I'm just </joey>
<garnt> speechless.
- I think I </garnt>
<joey> actually got the Italian
mafia on me for saying that. </joey>
<joey> - You just lost any rights
to would go to Italy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I think we've all lost some
sort of ride to some sorts of. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, yes you have. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yes, you have. </joey>
<joey> - You have definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure you just
declared war against Italy. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm willing to give credit
where credit's due to Italy, </connor>
<joey> you know? </joey>
<joey> - Give credit where
credit is due to Italy. </joey>
<joey> Like they were the one
that kind of came in, </joey>
<connor> and was like, "You guys have it good." </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Italy's all right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, a British man says. </joey>
<joey> (speakers laughing) </joey>
<joey> Hear me out, right? </joey>
<joey> (speakers chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Hear me out.
- Hear me out, </joey>
<joey> the Italian's have got </joey>
<joey> something.
- Coffee, </joey>
<joey> They're doing that right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> They got something right, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Pasta? </connor>
<connor> They got that on lockdown. </connor>
<connor> No one can even pretend to
have any claim over pasta. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So like, okay. </joey>
<joey> For example, right? </joey>
<joey> American pasta is like
a little bit different </joey>
<joey> to the standard Italian pasta, right? </joey>
<connor> - Italian pasta is fuckin'
drenched in, sorry, </connor>
<joey> American is fuckin' heavy. </joey>
<joey> It's so much sauce.
- It's like, oily. </joey>
<joey> - Like, it's a lot of oil. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah okay, I don't fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> That's just too much. </joey>
<connor> - There is a time and place. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like Imagiano's is like, </connor>
<joey> every now and then I'll go there </joey>
<joey> if I wanna feel like I
wanna destroy my stomach. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like I understand how Olive Garden </connor>
<connor> can do like bottomless stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, oh, they do bottomless
bread, don't they? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's bottomless breadsticks. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<joey> - Which is like, the breadsticks
aren't even that good. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I don't want bottomless
of something that's mid. </joey>
<garnt> - Would you have an entire
meal of breadsticks? </garnt>
<garnt> - It depends how good the breadsticks are. </garnt>
<joey> - If the breadsticks are good? </joey>
<joey> Not Olive Garden breadsticks though. </joey>
<connor> - No, no.
- That's just </connor>
<connor> like bread flavored cardboard. </connor>
<joey> Sorry Olive Garden, but. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just wondering- </connor>
<connor> - When we ordered, </connor>
<joey> it was Napoleon-style pizza
from around, not too far away. </joey>
<joey> There's a few chains with of around Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> and it was awful. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was really shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It wasn't that great. </joey>
<connor> - It was so bad.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean it's Japan, right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't really know, though, </joey>
<connor> but that was going for like stone-baked, </connor>
<joey> but not stone-baked. </joey>
<joey> That was a really weird
hybrid, do you remember that? </joey>
<joey> - It looked like a stone-baked, </joey>
<connor> but it didn't taste like it was actually </connor>
<connor> stone-baked, you know? </connor>
<joey> It's like, it looks
stone-baked, but here's an oven. </joey>
<connor> A lot of pizzas I find don't
have a very discernible, </connor>
<joey> cheesy taste, and I wanna
be able to taste the cheese. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I find that like a lot of pizzas either, </joey>
<joey> because that's also when you put </joey>
<joey> too much topping on the pizza. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like you can't taste anything, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you just taste meat. </joey>
<joey> It's too much. </joey>
<garnt> I need to taste all the flavors in unison. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, there needs to
be a right ratio of like, </garnt>
<connor> crust, sauce, and cheese,
and toppings as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - Otherwise I think there are
some pizzas I see where like, </connor>
<garnt> it's basically just cheesy bread, </garnt>
<garnt> and I know that's a type of pizza. </garnt>
<connor> - You can get pizza
that's just cheese, right? </connor>
<garnt> And you could also get margarita. </garnt>
<connor> - Cheese pizza. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which is just a sauce and cheese. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't understand that.
- I don't fuck with that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fuck with that. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I get that. </joey>
<connor> - I guess that's if you're like, </connor>
<joey> "I wanna have a pizza,
but I don't wanna feel </joey>
<joey> too bad about it." </joey>
<joey> - It's like the people who get a pizza, </joey>
<connor> and then just scrape
the toppings off, right? </connor>
<garnt> - That hurts, that actually hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, what happened
to you in your childhood? </garnt>
<joey> - Just get a pasta. </joey>
<joey> - Sydney does that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - I die a bit inside every time I see </connor>
<connor> her do that.
- Just dunk your bread </connor>
<garnt> in some pasta sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey giggling) </garnt>
<garnt> Just bring like a fuckin' pasta, </garnt>
<joey> like one of those sauce pots with you. </joey>
<joey> Like, why ruin some pizza? </joey>
<joey> Like, don't do that. </joey>
<connor> This is not how I intended
the new year to start, </connor>
<connor> by the way. </connor>
<connor> I didn't think I'd be- </connor>
<joey> - I intended to start this way. </joey>
<joey> It's not "Trash Taste" without
an argument about food. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I don't know who had the most </garnt>
<joey> clown opinion this episode. </joey>
<connor> - You.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - 90% of bread tastes the same. </connor>
<garnt> - All rice tastes the same? </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, come on. </connor>
<garnt> - Italian pizza in better
than America pizza? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was a clown today,
ladies and gentlemen. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone was a clown. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad we called this "Trash Taste." </connor>
<joey> It shields us from a lot of criticism. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Let's just say that much, because we say </connor>
<connor> some fucking stupid. </connor>
<joey> - You can say all you want
guys, but we're "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> What did you expect? </joey>
<garnt> - I like how we made the name </garnt>
<garnt> in preparation of us
having shitty anime takes. </garnt>
<connor> None of us intended to ever talk </connor>
<garnt> about food.
- Here's what I hate </garnt>
<garnt> about online, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone is so scared to give their </garnt>
<connor> genuine opinions on stuff. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I'm talking like, </connor>
<connor> not just like politics and
all that shit, whatever. </connor>
<connor> I don't give a about fuck about that. </connor>
<connor> - Like, unimportant stuff.
- Tell me </connor>
<connor> your weird food tastes that you have </connor>
<connor> that is really, honestly, </connor>
<garnt> it's quite bizarre, but you'd die by it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone has these things. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone has </connor>
<connor> a weird-
- But is scared to tell them. </connor>
<connor> - Because they were brought
up in a certain way, </connor>
<connor> or they're not so familiar
with a certain type of cuisine, </connor>
<garnt> or, you know, sometimes taste
buds don't always make sense. </garnt>
<garnt> You've got to have, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no such thing
as objective taste buds. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- One of my </connor>
<connor> favorite dishes as a child, </connor>
<connor> this is the most British
thing I'm about to say. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<connor> My mum would just make
mashed potatoes and spam. </connor>
<connor> Just mashed potato in the spam, </connor>
<connor> and then just mash it all up, </connor>
<connor> and just give it to me. </connor>
<connor> That's it, like the whole plate just that. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, it does sound
like it could be good, </joey>
<connor> but-
- Dude, it's really fucking- </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I could
eat that repeatedly. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] I can. </garnt>
<joey> - Well yeah, of course you can. </joey>
<garnt> - It sounds like something where </garnt>
<garnt> if you didn't eat it as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> but you wouldn't like, </garnt>
<garnt> you couldn't eat that-
- Maybe we should try it. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it's like me with natto. </joey>
<joey> Only reason I like is because
I had it since I was a baby. </joey>
<joey> - Can you convince kids to like any food? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I believe you can. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did they convince you to like natto, </garnt>
<connor> but they can't convince kids
to like broccoli and stuff? </connor>
<joey> - Because of the people that
don't like broccoli are babies. </joey>
<connor> - They are actually babies?
- They're actual babies. </connor>
<joey> - They're actually babies. </joey>
<joey> - They're actually... </joey>
<joey> (Connor chuckles) </joey>
<joey> How can babies like natto? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I liked it. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, hold on, do you know what it is? </joey>
<joey> Big brain. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Kids love slime. </joey>
<joey> Kid fuckin' love slime. </joey>
<connor> Think about it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah.
- Think about it. </joey>
<joey> - Every single YouTube channel
for kids, there's slime. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah.
- It's all slime. </joey>
<joey> It's a conspiracy, bro,
I'm getting the red bull. </joey>
<connor> Bro, that's why kids in Japan, </connor>
<connor> that's why they love
natto, 'cause it's slime. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, baby food though.
- I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Natto is baby
food with beans in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's slime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look, like. </garnt>
<connor> - It was always the slime. </connor>
<garnt> - It was always the slime.
- It was right </garnt>
<joey> in front of us this whole time. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right under our nose. </joey>
<garnt> - But like maybe, you know, broccoli or, </garnt>
<connor> what were we talking about, broccoli? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe broccoli
just doesn't taste good </connor>
<joey> as like, the main </joey>
<joey> part of the dish.
- No, in the case </joey>
<garnt> with broccoli, isn't
it the fact that like, </garnt>
<garnt> because kids' taste
buds are more receptive </garnt>
<garnt> to bitter flavors? </garnt>
<garnt> As an adult, </garnt>
<garnt> and then as you get older.
- Do you like broccoli? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I love broccoli.
- I love broccoli. </joey>
<joey> I love broccoli.
- Do you like, like broccoli? </joey>
<garnt> - I love broccoli.
- I love broccoli. </garnt>
<garnt> You give me like a plate of broccoli, </garnt>
<connor> and I put some mayo on that
shit, and I can just eat it. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what? </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Fuckin', fuckin'... </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, you didn't know broccoli and mayo? </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's a very Japanese thing. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I didn't say it to be controversial. </joey>
<joey> I thought this was normal. </joey>
<connor> - You just said that like it was like, </connor>
<connor> bro, I just like grabbed
the poop out of the toilet. </connor>
<joey> Just grab it, and I just eat it. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No, it's good. </joey>
<connor> Try it. </connor>
<connor> Get some-
- I am down to try this. </connor>
<connor> - Get some steamed broccoli, right? </connor>
<connor> Get some Kewpie mayonnaise, </connor>
<connor> and then dip it.
- Wait, wait, </connor>
<connor> wait, wait. </connor>
<connor> - It's very common in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, here's why I
recoiled for a moment there. </connor>
<connor> I had an image of you
with a bowl of broccoli, </connor>
<connor> and just pouring a bunch of mayo, </connor>
<connor> but I've ordered from that
chicken and broccoli place, </connor>
<connor> it's all over Japan. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It literally gives you, and it's awful, </connor>
<connor> it's so bad, it's like non-seasoned, </connor>
<connor> boiled chicken with boiled broccoli. </connor>
<joey> And it's all prepared,
so they just heat it up </joey>
<joey> and send it to you, and they
charge you like 30 bucks. </joey>
<joey> But one of the dips they give you </joey>
<joey> is low-calorie mayonnaise,
and I got to tell you, </joey>
<joey> it goes hard. </joey>
<connor> - Doesn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it actually does.
- It's actually good, like. </connor>
<connor> - I just realized, </connor>
<connor> I loved that.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's amazing.
- You know what, actually? </connor>
<connor> Friendship again. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sorry.
- World peace, </joey>
<joey> world peace.
- Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Attained once again. </joey>
<garnt> - I think Garnt's the weird one. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, he definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> Definitely.
- Have you had it? </garnt>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - We should have it. </connor>
<garnt> - Well no, he doesn't like condiments. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say though.
- Do you hate mayo though? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay I will, no. </garnt>
<joey> - How do you take his opinions seriously? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, no, I fuckin' hate Mayo, normally. </joey>
<joey> But, living in Japan, Kewpie mayo, right? </joey>
<joey> Well, Kewpie mayo fuckin' is amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know.
- Like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's 'cause I've just
had mayo my entire life. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you put it on? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mayo with? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sub, whenever it's in a sandwich, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, next time you ever- </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I'm asking Mark Zuckerberg, </connor>
<connor> what is being happy? </connor>
<joey> I ate a sandwich. </joey>
<connor> - Initiate happy process. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> No, okay. </connor>
<connor> Next time you have chicken and broccoli, </connor>
<connor> just get some Kewpie mayo, </connor>
<joey> and just, don't even
have to drench that shit, </joey>
<joey> just like a little bit is enough, </joey>
<joey> because the mayo is already powerful. </joey>
<connor> You have a flavor, just a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait, </connor>
<connor> when you eat a fried chicken,
do you not like it with mayo? </connor>
<garnt> - No, because I like the
taste of fried chicken. </garnt>
<connor> - Whoa. </connor>
<connor> Mayo's really good at like, </connor>
<joey> kind of combating the oiliness of it, </joey>
<joey> and the heaviness of it, somehow. </joey>
<joey> - That's why a lot-
- And then like, </joey>
<joey> another oily, heavy liquid. </joey>
<connor> It somehow kinda mitigates. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I like with
(indistinct), for example. </connor>
<joey> You always dip in mayo, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> just because I like the
taste of fried chicken. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] But with the mayo, it's fuckin'. </joey>
<joey> - This guy knows. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some things
where I said, I just like, </garnt>
<garnt> if it's seasoned correctly,
then I enjoy that, right? </garnt>
<joey> Because then I enjoy the
taste of the seasoning, </joey>
<joey> rather than the taste of the condiment. </joey>
<joey> - You can't expect like- </joey>
<joey> - It's like you have some
of the chicken on its own, </joey>
<joey> and I also have of with the mayo. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just to try it out. </joey>
<garnt> Like, dip it.
- Cleaning the palette, </garnt>
<connor> cleaning the palette. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I've said, if
something tastes fuckin' good, </garnt>
<connor> I can eat that thing </connor>
<connor> infinitely.
- That's like what </connor>
<garnt> children do, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Children, like a dog, </garnt>
<joey> Like a dog, a dog can. </joey>
<connor> - I used to eat like, spaghetti bolonaise </connor>
<connor> like five days a week. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry my taste buds
actually work, Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would argue they don't work, </garnt>
<connor> because you are able to eat the same thing </connor>
<connor> over and over again. </connor>
<garnt> - If it's good, not if it's bad. </garnt>
<connor> If something tastes good, </connor>
<connor> then saying you can't eat it </connor>
<garnt> over and over again.
- I have food </garnt>
<garnt> that I cannot eat everyday. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't just go back to it. </connor>
<garnt> Like, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, why do you think
it's so easy for me to be like, </garnt>
<joey> I can easily eat the same meal every day. </joey>
<joey> Right now, I'm eating a
salad every day, and it's- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's fine. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fuckin' easy, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause salads taste great. </garnt>
<joey> - Salad is inoffensive. </joey>
<joey> It's like saying, "Oh, I
can have water every day." </joey>
<joey> - I do have water every day. </joey>
<connor> - I do that. </connor>
<garnt> - I have water every day. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, </joey>
<joey> I'm not really on board
with that argument. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna distance myself
from that argument. </joey>
<connor> - It's just fuckin salad, </connor>
<connor> you can't expect the most like, </connor>
<connor> grandiose combination of flavors, </connor>
<connor> unless you like drench
that shit in dressing. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean... </connor>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<joey> I don't know.
- Other than that, </joey>
<connor> it's just like standard vegetables. </connor>
<connor> - The thing is, I can eat some foods, </connor>
<connor> okay, I found a salad place,
and I really liked it, </connor>
<connor> and I ordered that maybe 10 days in a row, </connor>
<connor> I want to say, I ate the salad. </connor>
<connor> And then now, for some
reason when I try and eat it, </connor>
<connor> I know it's really good, but
I just don't like it anymore. </connor>
<connor> Why is that? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you got bored of it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- But isn't that sad. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's why you don't </joey>
<joey> eat the same thing every fuckin' day. </joey>
<joey> - It was so damn good. </joey>
<joey> - If it's something that I fucking love, </joey>
<joey> I purposely try not to eat it often. </joey>
<connor> - But I think the reason why I went- </connor>
<connor> - Because there's nothing, </connor>
<connor> because there's nothing, </connor>
<connor> because there's nothing
that terrifies me more </connor>
<joey> than one day sitting in
front of my favorite meal, </joey>
<joey> having a bite, and going, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck, it doesn't taste as good as,"- </joey>
<connor> - I just, the reason why, right? </connor>
<connor> Here's why, okay? </connor>
<joey> If it was a pizza, I
wouldn't do it every day. </joey>
<joey> You know why? </joey>
<joey> Pizza's are bad for you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Salads good for you, so I was like, </joey>
<connor> don't mind if I do, round eight, okay. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, I got bored of it, </connor>
<connor> and now I regret it, </connor>
<joey> because now I have a harder
time finding healthier food </joey>
<joey> that I like eating, </joey>
<joey> so I really fucked myself over. </joey>
<connor> - That's the real problem, </connor>
<joey> when you can't have a salad anymore. </joey>
<connor> - Well, that one type of salad. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] That one type of salad. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, my biggest issue is that </joey>
<joey> I have to force myself
to have a balanced diet, </joey>
<joey> because I can easily eat
the same thing every day, </joey>
<joey> if I really, really enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Lasagna. </joey>
<connor> - I could fuck up lasagna.
- World-famous lasagna? </connor>
<connor> - No, okay, I can eat lasagna every day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I could eat </connor>
<connor> lasagna everyday.
- I could fuckin' </connor>
<connor> eat lasagna everyday. </connor>
<connor> - Garfield, </connor>
<joey> Garfield.
- But that's how Garfield. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna say it's
healthy or balanced, </joey>
<garnt> but I can do it, and
I'm going to enjoy it. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course it's healthy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course.
- Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> If mom made it, of course it's healthy. </garnt>
<connor> - Papa John's eats a pizza every day. </connor>
<connor> - He's still alive, somehow. </connor>
<connor> (speakers laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's just the world's
most greasiest human beings. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking God. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, what a fucking awful episode. </connor>
<garnt> - This is actually been
probably the worst episode </garnt>
<garnt> of "Trash Taste" in terms of takes. </garnt>
<joey> - I hope you guys are ready for 2022, </joey>
<joey> because it might honestly
just get worse from here. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I've got
concrete in my stomach. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what it was from
that have eaten today, but. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It's probably
the fuckin' pizza, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> It couldn't have been that, </connor>
<joey> that was the best thing I've eaten today. </joey>
<joey> That was the heaviest slice
of pizza I've had in a while. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] It was amazing. </connor>
<connor> - It was good.
- I should go for another one. </connor>
<connor> - I can't believe, but that's
a problem in Japan, right? </connor>
<joey> It tastes good, but you've gotta pay $22 </joey>
<joey> for that entire ass pie.
- Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - I know, it sucks.
- It's so offensive. </joey>
<connor> - Little Caesar's out here </connor>
<connor> making moves.
- I mean, </connor>
<connor> it might honestly be a blessing, </connor>
<joey> because if it costs the
same as an American pizza, </joey>
<joey> yo I'd be like 500 pounds. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the biggest deterrent, in terms, </garnt>
<connor> you know what we should do, actually? </connor>
<connor> We should make- </connor>
<connor> - "Trash Taste" pizza. </connor>
<connor> - We should make a food three
by three one of these days, </connor>
<connor> and pick the nine dishes that, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna defend the nine dishes. </connor>
<connor> That's going to be like,
the most toxic episode. </connor>
<connor> - Four-hour "Trash Taste" episode. </connor>
<connor> - That's gonna be like, </connor>
<garnt> the most toxic episode of "Trash Taste" </garnt>
<garnt> that's ever been made. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] People skip through that episode. </joey>
<garnt> - We pick the nine dishes
that we couldn't live without. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what format is
really fucking horrible? </connor>
<connor> But just leads to people
tearing their throats out? </connor>
<connor> The like, where you put
stuff in a tournament bracket </connor>
<connor> that shouldn't be in a tournament bracket. </connor>
<joey> Put like video games in
a tournament bracket, </joey>
<connor> like the best one goes through. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, what
was voted the best game? </connor>
<connor> It was like, </connor>
<garnt> "GTA IV."
- "God of War" right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] "God of War" vs the best game- </connor>
<joey> - The best game of all time.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, IGN's
bracket or something. </joey>
<joey> We should do that with food.
- Oh I mean, </joey>
<garnt> it's fuckin' IGN.
- We should do a food bracket. </garnt>
<joey> - How long would that take? </joey>
<joey> - A food tournament-off? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - We come down, and we have to agree, </connor>
<garnt> what is the best food? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> No, I got it, I got it. </garnt>
<connor> - Luckily we're three, </connor>
<connor> so we're countering.
- Oh yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - I've got it. </connor>
<garnt> We're gonna make the food three by three, </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna present our favorite foods, </garnt>
<connor> and then we are going to have the bracket </connor>
<connor> for the viewers to vote for, </connor>
<connor> and then we're gonna present the winner, </connor>
<connor> or we're gonna present
the tournament results </connor>
<connor> on a live stream or something. </connor>
<connor> That's probably gonna-
- That ball game. </connor>
<connor> - We're gonna tear each other's </connor>
<garnt> throats out.
- We have to put </garnt>
<joey> more food though, because it'd be like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But we'll figure it out. </joey>
<connor> - We'll figure it out.
- We'll figure it out. </connor>
<garnt> - But look forward to that, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> In the meantime, here are the patrons. </garnt>
<joey> Look at them all. </joey>
<garnt> They love you. </garnt>
<garnt> - If they're still here. </garnt>
<garnt> (speakers laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I wouldn't be surprised </garnt>
<connor> if everyone was like, "Yo, this ain't </connor>
<joey> worth my time."
- Shout out to the Italians </joey>
<connor> who clocked out an hour and a half ago. </connor>
<connor> You're the real ones. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wanna imagine what it's like </garnt>
<joey> being an audience member in this episode, </joey>
<connor> to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, he's saying
something that makes sense." </connor>
<connor> "Oh no."
- I love it when we have </connor>
<joey> people who are like,
food scientists watching. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like actually, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Listen, I don't give a fuck." </joey>
<joey> Tastebuds go brrr, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like, I... </joey>
<joey> - They probably have to do for you. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, they're all having an aneurysm </connor>
<connor> in front of the screens </connor>
<connor> right now.
- I do apologize </connor>
<joey> for any food experts out there. </joey>
<connor> I might not be right, but
I'm anecdotally correct, </connor>
<connor> so that's what matters, </connor>
<garnt> and that's why we were
in a political situation </garnt>
<garnt> that no one agrees. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- You know, </garnt>
<connor> at least, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I may have some clown takes, </garnt>
<joey> but at least I'm friends
with some fellow clowns, </joey>
<joey> especially this episode.
- Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] This is the circus. </joey>

time we've literally had </garnt>
<joey> every one of our cast members speak out </joey>
<garnt> against something we've
once individually said. </garnt>
<connor> - Before we wrap this up,
where the fuck is Grindlewald? </connor>
<joey> Where's Grindlewald? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> Oh. </joey>
