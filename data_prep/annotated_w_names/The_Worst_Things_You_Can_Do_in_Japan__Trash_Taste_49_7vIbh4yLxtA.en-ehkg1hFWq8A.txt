<joey> - That's why we won't have a Meilyne cam. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's just Meilyne just.
(computer keys rattling) </joey>
<garnt> - Also, I don't think people want to hear </garnt>
<joey> some of this stuff you
have to say, Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to hear some of the stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad these microphones
are super condensed </joey>
<joey> and don't pick up everything. </joey>
<joey> - People don't know
what they're asking for. </joey>
<connor> We'd have to cut so much shit </connor>
<connor> if Meilyne starts opening her mouth. </connor>
<garnt> - And they're not getting it. </garnt>
<garnt> Also Meilyne's just a
fucking normal employee. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> We're not just shoving
a camera in her face. </connor>
<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<joey> - Hello, and welcome to another episode </joey>
<joey> of the Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I am boss man one and I'm here
with boss man two and three. </joey>
<joey> Here to get the dub.
- Ay. </joey>
<garnt> We are not the boys
anymore, we are boss men. </garnt>
<joey> - We are the boss men. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Why did we not call our podcast that? </garnt>
<garnt> Welcome to the boss man podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - No, no.
- Every week is a dub. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - How are you boys doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Good, good. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm tired as all hell because- </joey>
<garnt> - You're in the middle of
moving right now, aren't you? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, by the time this comes out, </joey>
<garnt> I would have finished moving, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- But yeah, like literally </garnt>
<garnt> tomorrow is the moving day for me. </garnt>
<garnt> So I have been just
scrambling for the past week. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like cleaning. </garnt>
<joey> You don't realize how much
stuff you have in your house </joey>
<joey> until you start cleaning your house. </joey>
<joey> - It's always like that, right? </joey>
<garnt> Because I remember whenever I would move, </garnt>
<garnt> like you start packing stuff
up and you think to yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> "It's gonna take a day at most." </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - And you pack up like all
the main stuff in like a day. </joey>
<garnt> And you're like, "Oh, I'm
90% of the way packed." </garnt>
<garnt> And then for some reason,
all the little shit </garnt>
<garnt> that just gets left over,
that takes like two days. </garnt>
<joey> - Like let me introduce myself. </joey>
<connor> - Because you own like I feel like 50% </connor>
<connor> of the items you own, you
never use, think about, </connor>
<connor> but you think you need them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> You also never see them either </joey>
<connor> because they're either put in a closet </connor>
<joey> or kind of out of sight somewhere, right? </joey>
<connor> - Like when you have a
colander, you need a colander, </connor>
<joey> but you don't really think about it </joey>
<joey> until you start using it or (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> you're like, "What the
fuck do I do with this?" </joey>
<joey> - We have this like shaved ice machine </joey>
<garnt> that I think Meilyne got it for us. </garnt>
<garnt> But we had it for like the last summer </garnt>
<garnt> because Meilyne was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I wanna like come
to your guys' place. </garnt>
<joey> And the girls can have a kind of girls day </joey>
<joey> and we can just make
shaved ice or whatever." </joey>
<joey> Never used it.
(Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Once! </joey>
<joey> - Okay, we used it once and
it's just this huge brick </joey>
<joey> of a thing that's just like
sitting in the kitchen. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Why is this here?" </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's always that one
drawer in every kitchen, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That is just the unused appliance drawer, </garnt>
<garnt> right, where it's just these appliances </garnt>
<garnt> that people give you as gifts </garnt>
<garnt> or that you think is gonna be cool </garnt>
<joey> when you host like that dinner
party that never happens, </joey>
<joey> and then there's just these
like random appliances </joey>
<joey> that just get put into this drawer </joey>
<joey> and you forget you even have. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly, but we have like-
- Like knives and forks. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I use my hands. They're amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I got this kind
of cleaning service thing </connor>
<connor> because okay, one thing,
we're immediately gonna go </connor>
<joey> into this one thing I hate about Japan. </joey>
<joey> Throwing away trash, right? </joey>
<joey> And especially the big trash, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like in Australia-
- It's us. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'll just pick myself up. </joey>
<connor> But 'cause I don't know about in the UK, </connor>
<connor> but in Australia we have like this thing, </connor>
<connor> I think it happens once
every two or three months, </connor>
<joey> it's called like council cleanup day. </joey>
<joey> So basically what we do is
we take huge appliances, </joey>
<joey> like couches, beds, drawers,
all that kind of stuff </joey>
<joey> and we literally just throw
it out in front of the street, </joey>
<joey> like just onto the street.
- As you do. </joey>
<joey> - And basically you throw it out. </joey>
<connor> People can kind of walk around </connor>
<connor> and just grab stuff if they want. </connor>
<connor> Like if they think, "Oh, you know, I can- </connor>
<connor> - This happens every two to three months? </connor>
<connor> - It's like every two to
three months or something. </connor>
<connor> - How have I never seen this? </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Have you seen this? </connor>
<connor> - In Australia, yeah, it happens. </connor>
<joey> I don't know if maybe
that's just like the area </joey>
<joey> that I grew up in? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, in the UK I don't
think there's enough space </connor>
<connor> to just throw you stuff- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I thought you were talking
about Japan for a second. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, not in Japan, in Australia, </connor>
<connor> in Australia we have that
where we just throw stuff out </connor>
<connor> and then big garbage truck basically comes </connor>
<connor> and collects all the stuff
that doesn't get picked up </connor>
<joey> after like a week I think.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - Japan doesn't work like that, </joey>
<joey> so we had to throw away our bed, </joey>
<joey> which is a queen size bed, a couch, </joey>
<joey> and couple of tables and a
sofa and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> A lot of big stuff. </joey>
<joey> But like you can't just throw it out </joey>
<joey> with the rest of the trash. </joey>
<joey> Either you have to go to
your like local council </joey>
<joey> and be like, "I want to
throw this stuff away." </joey>
<connor> And they give you these like tickets </connor>
<connor> that you have to pay for. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To basically be like, "All right, </connor>
<connor> I'm throwing this out on this day </connor>
<connor> and then you throw it out onto the street. </connor>
<connor> - And you have to book it and tell them- </connor>
<joey> - You have to book it. </joey>
<connor> - And you have to tell
them the exact measurements </connor>
<connor> of the thing so they
can plan out the truck. </connor>
<joey> - Or, what I've found
out, is you can just, </joey>
<joey> there's just services out
there that you can just call up </joey>
<joey> and be like, "I want to
throw all this crap away." </joey>
<joey> How much is it to get rid of?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Little more expensive than
the whole council thing, </joey>
<joey> but so much easier.
- Oh, I can imagine it is. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's not the price to me. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like we talked about last week, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just getting the paperwork done. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That, like fucking I'm scared of. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And like I'm not even finished </joey>
<joey> with the fucking paperwork, dude, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause we'll have to
do more after we move. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause Japan is just like </garnt>
<joey> a never-ending sea of paperwork. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> But like, I was like okay, </joey>
<joey> I'm getting rid of this giant bed, </joey>
<joey> I'm getting rid of this couch, </joey>
<joey> this table, all these like big appliances. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm like, okay, well
these are the big things gone. </connor>
<joey> So, you know, maybe like 30%
of my belongings probably gone. </joey>
<connor> It was more like 3%. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I feel like in like
your bedroom or office </joey>
<joey> there's so many little things </joey>
<joey> that you just never think about-- </joey>
<joey> - Especially my office-
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- And my office has </connor>
<joey> so many little things,
I'm just like I'm... </joey>
<connor> Well, first of all, </connor>
<joey> I'm looking forward to the
moving company coming in </joey>
<joey> and seeing like all of
like my FAKKU skateboards </joey>
<joey> and shit like that. </joey>
<joey> Just being like, whoa! </joey>
<joey> - They'll be like, "Yo, is
that a rem, 1/8th scale? </joey>
<joey> - Like, "Damn, son!" </joey>
<joey> - You're just like giving
them a tour of your house. </joey>
<joey> Being like, "Yeah, so
this is the JoJo section- </joey>
<joey> - My free office tour. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> No, actually, to be
fair, when the moving guy </connor>
<connor> first came in to check to see what we had, </connor>
<garnt> he walked into my office
and he was like, "Whoa!" </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Otaku's dream, man.
- He was like, "Wow," </garnt>
<connor> Jesus, this guy's got
a fucking collection!" </connor>
<joey> - I had like the opposite happen </joey>
<joey> where like I only use my
tatami room to film in- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Hmm.
- And I only use it, </joey>
<joey> so I have a big tatami room </joey>
<garnt> that I normally do the cosplay videos in. </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm really bad, so I
never clean them up after, </garnt>
<joey> I just leave the cosplays
there until I do the next video </joey>
<joey> and then I clean it up. </joey>
<joey> And then one time, they didn't
tell me they were doing this, </joey>
<joey> but there was like a, </joey>
<joey> they were checking the fire
alarms in the building. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah,
sure, come in, come in." </joey>
<joey> And he's going around my house. </joey>
<joey> He goes into my office, you know, he looks </joey>
<joey> and he's like, "Oh." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah, I like JoJo." </joey>
<joey> He just looked at me like
I was a fucking weirdo. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "All right, thanks buddy." </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then as he went to my tatami room, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, shit, I just remembered </joey>
<joey> that all my shit was in there." </joey>
<joey> And so I go into check that he's there </joey>
<joey> and this man is just standing </joey>
<joey> in the middle of like
my cosplay everywhere. </joey>
<joey> The stuff reeked. </joey>
<joey> Just holding up something
to the fire alarm, </joey>
<joey> just looking like, </joey>
<joey> "Look down, don't look, don't
look, don't look at anything." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then after this guy
left really awkwardly, </joey>
<joey> an hour later, someone else came along </joey>
<joey> from the same company in the building </joey>
<joey> and did the exact same thing. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Wait, why
am I being checked twice?" </joey>
<joey> - Oh, was he like a spot-man? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I was- </joey>
<joey> - "Just gonna make sure my
friend got it right." You know? </joey>
<joey> - He's like, "Yo, I heard
there's free cosplay. </joey>
<joey> Where's it at?" </joey>
<joey> And then I had the exact
same interaction again, </joey>
<joey> where I was like, "Oh yeah, sorry about </joey>
<joey> the mess in this room." </joey>
<joey> - By the way, I like JoJo. </joey>
<joey> - By the way, I also like JoJo. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> "Oh, really, huh?" </joey>
<connor> Fucking weirdo.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But luckily as I said, I'm
pretty sure I mentioned </connor>
<garnt> in the previous podcast episode, </garnt>
<garnt> but like we've got a service </garnt>
<garnt> where they just do all the packing for us. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - My God, I can not imagine if
I had to do that all myself. </joey>
<garnt> - God, I just kind of realized </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm gonna have to
go through when we move, </garnt>
<garnt> because my room's gonna be fine, </garnt>
<garnt> but then I got Sydney's room. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Which the amounts of
fucking fucked-up shit </joey>
<joey> in Sydney's room... </joey>
<joey> - Whoa, be careful
that's the pussy of the- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </connor>
<joey> That was expensive! </joey>
<joey> - So I remember this one time </joey>
<joey> we had to get our doorbell fixed, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Hmm. </joey>
<joey> - So we thought our
house was pretty clean. </joey>
<joey> Basically, whenever
someone needs to come in </joey>
<connor> to check our house at
all, we just make sure </connor>
<connor> Sydney's room is just fucking locked off. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like a quarantine section, you know. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta put up like a- </connor>
<garnt> - Like Chernobyl. </garnt>
<joey> He's like, "You can't go in there. </joey>
<connor> There's an inclusion zone."
- You gotta put up </connor>
<joey> like the R18 curtains </joey>
<garnt> straight to the doorway, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "Only adults allowed." </joey>
<joey> - You put the fucking
biohazard sign on the door </joey>
<joey> just to make sure no one gets in, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's radioactive. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So how we learned our lesson
was we had our doorbell fixed </joey>
<joey> and of course Sydney's
room was like cordoned off, </joey>
<joey> but we forget that sometimes Sydney </joey>
<joey> just has shit lying
about the house, right? </joey>
<joey> And I guess we've just
become so desensitized </joey>
<garnt> to some of the stuff she reviews. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- My fiance reviews, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of lewd stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> That's her channel. </garnt>
<garnt> So we just had like a bunch of figures </garnt>
<garnt> that were just left in the living room </garnt>
<garnt> with just like their tits out, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Living room material.
- As you do. </connor>
<joey> - What living room would
be complete without- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I see you've see my decor. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's the "Mother Knows Breast," </joey>
<garnt> size real scale, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - So this guy just comes in, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And the doorbell's like
right next to the kitchen. </garnt>
<joey> And also we have a shelf
right next to the kitchen, </joey>
<joey> which just has two lewd,
completely naked figures </joey>
<joey> just right next to where the doorbell is. </joey>
<joey> - Right!
- He takes a look, </joey>
<joey> looks at the figures, looks at Sydney </joey>
<connor> and just doesn't make contact
with Sydney ever again. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Has he got Hentai hair?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like Hentai hair, his
hair's covering his eyes? </joey>
<joey> - Just sweating.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that was probably
the longest fucking hour </joey>
<garnt> he had to like enjoy of his life </garnt>
<garnt> when he was just fixing the doorbell. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how he immediately
looked at Sydney. </joey>
<garnt> You wouldn't think that like, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd look at like Garnt, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Being like this mother fucker right here. </garnt>
<joey> Just like leaving his lewd shit out. </joey>
<joey> No, immediately went to Sydney. </joey>
<joey> - He's like, "God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<garnt> I wish my wife would let
me put my dirty figures </garnt>
<connor> in the living room." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's the one time,
whenever someone comes round </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Yo, these lewd stuff, </garnt>
<joey> that's not me guys, guys, that's not me. </joey>
<joey> It's just my partner." </joey>
<joey> - You just like silently point at Sydney. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, seriously, seriously. </joey>
<garnt> It's my partner this time. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I had to like,
'cause I have quite a few </joey>
<joey> doujins and stuff like that
in my bookshelf as well. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, I'll pack
these away before I... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm with these
guys for a couple of days. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want an awkward
experience for a couple of days </joey>
<joey> as they like sift through
my doujins being like, </joey>
<garnt> "So what's the fragile stuff </garnt>
<joey> and what's not the
fragile stuff," but yeah. </joey>
<joey> So because of that, I have
just been so incredibly busy. </joey>
<garnt> I haven't been able to like sit down </garnt>
<garnt> and like playing any games. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, Pokemon Snap came
out like a few days ago. </joey>
<joey> Haven't been able to like
download that shit at all. </joey>
<garnt> - You're not ahead on
videos anymore, are you? </garnt>
<garnt> which is just like, I
heard that about Joey </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like,
""What what is going on?" </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, I think this comes
out end of May, right, </joey>
<joey> but it's like the slowest
month I've ever had, </joey>
<garnt> like I think my next
video is not coming out </garnt>
<joey> for like 12 days or something, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "Fuck,"-
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - My career is over dude. </garnt>
<garnt> I used to upload daily. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like the
signs of the apocalypse </joey>
<joey> is happening.
- Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - The fucking sky's falling
and Joey's not ahead on video. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - That's how I know at the end is coming. </joey>
<joey> - I'm so not ahead,
that I'm falling behind. </joey>
<joey> Fallen and I can't get up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I missed an upload as well </connor>
<connor> and it like killed me. </connor>
<joey> I apologized on my YouTube
page and people were like, </joey>
<joey> "You don't have to apologize." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm like, no. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no I do, I do. </joey>
<joey> No, I'm not apologizing for you. </joey>
<joey> I'm apologizing to me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because that's the thing, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like 12 days to the
average YouTube viewer </garnt>
<garnt> is like whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no difference between
seven days between videos </garnt>
<joey> and like two weeks between upload. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- But to the person </joey>
<joey> who makes it, it's like, "Oh, no." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it's everything. </connor>
<garnt> It's all I think about, these damn videos. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, this is the
first time in my career where </connor>
<connor> I've been ahead on videos so I'm just like </connor>
<joey> damn, I have some free time. </joey>
<joey> - Look at us!
- Look at us! </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - 2021, he turns the tables! </joey>
<joey> - Garnt uploads more than Joey or Connor? </joey>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not yet, maybe one day-
- Maybe one day. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll be back, I'll be back, don't worry. </joey>
<connor> - Let's play a game then. Come on. </connor>
<connor> Let's do it.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Wait until Garnt discovers </connor>
<connor> Five Nights at Freddy's, guys. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's game over. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah, I mean, now
that fucking lockdown's </garnt>
<garnt> been happening again-
- Hmm. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess we can pull a-
- For the 17th time </joey>
<garnt> or whatever time it is.
- For the 17th time. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, locked down in
Japan has been weird, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a roller coaster, it goes like, </connor>
<connor> the cases go up, they
announce a shitty lockdown </connor>
<connor> that's like two more rules added. </connor>
<joey> - Hmm.
- And then they go, </joey>
<joey> "Okay the case is good now." </joey>
<joey> And then they go back up again </joey>
<joey> when they let go of restrictions </joey>
<joey> and then this happened like
the what, the fourth time now? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So we're just doing the
same shit over and over again. </connor>
<joey> - But this locked down
is the shortest ever, </joey>
<garnt> it's only two weeks or something? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think they- </garnt>
<joey> - What's gonna change in two weeks? </joey>
<joey> - What's the point? </joey>
<joey> - I think they literally
just wanted to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, Golden Week's happening? </joey>
<joey> Let's have it not happen." </joey>
<joey> - Can you explain what Golden Week </joey>
<connor> is to the viewers who don't know? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so Golden Week is this week </joey>
<joey> during the first week of May, </joey>
<joey> as we're recording this, </joey>
<joey> we're in the middle of it right now </joey>
<joey> where it's basically just
a bunch of public holidays </joey>
<joey> back to back to back to back to back. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm.
- So I think, yeah, </joey>
<joey> so basically people just get a week off. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you know how I remember Golden Week? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hmm?
- It was the one week </garnt>
<garnt> of the year aside from like New Years </garnt>
<joey> where Mangakas would take a break </joey>
<joey> from their weekly manga schedule. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, oh,
"One Piece" is on break? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck's Golden Week? </joey>
<connor> - Oda's like, "Thank God, finally!" </connor>
<garnt> - Everything's on fire </garnt>
<connor> like, I didn't get "One Piece" this week? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the only reason
I knew of Golden Week </garnt>
<garnt> before moving to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> Well because I think,
Japan needs Golden Week </joey>
<garnt> because Japan's one of the few countries </garnt>
<joey> that works on Christmas. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm.
- You know? </joey>
<joey> Like Christmas is just like,
I think everywhere else, </joey>
<joey> Christmas is like a
public holiday or at least </joey>
<joey> in Australia.
- Christian world. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, like in
Australia, it's the second half </garnt>
<joey> of December until maybe
the first week of January, </joey>
<joey> like three weeks, it's
just full on holiday. </joey>
<connor> - Fucking Christmas here's
is just Valentine's Day 2.0. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, basically.
- It is. </joey>
<joey> - It really is.
- Who gives a shit? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but that was just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, I don't have a partner, finna work." </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's either you're on a date </garnt>
<garnt> or you are working on something. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> So I guess like, you know, to
Japan, they need Golden Week </joey>
<joey> because it's the one time
where they're almost forced </joey>
<joey> to take the week off
because otherwise they get, </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know, people
still are just like, </joey>
<joey> "No, fuck it, it's still
working week for me. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - My whole favorite thing of
all the Japanese Government's </connor>
<connor> lockdowns is that they did
during the whole pandemic, </connor>
<joey> the government thought
of this amazing idea </joey>
<joey> called go-to travel,
(Joey cackles) </joey>
<joey> which is just like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that was a thing!
- This is just the funniest- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the funniest fucking thing. </garnt>
<garnt> So Japanese Government, </garnt>
<garnt> they were losing a lot of money obviously </garnt>
<garnt> from tourism that they weren't getting. </garnt>
<garnt> So in the middle of like the pandemic, </garnt>
<garnt> this is like months ago, this is before, </garnt>
<garnt> this is last year. </garnt>
<joey> - This was during the
first lockdown, wasn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Guys,
we're losing too much money </joey>
<joey> in our travel economy. </joey>
<joey> We need to put some money back into it. </joey>
<joey> What we're going to do is, guys, </joey>
<joey> we're gonna give you 30% off everything </joey>
<joey> and we're gonna pay
you money to go travel. </joey>
<joey> We'll give you 200 bucks to spend, </joey>
<joey> depending on how much you spend." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you get coupons
at your destination. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They were like, "Oh yes,
so like it's a lockdown." </joey>
<joey> But also if you travel, 30% discount!" </joey>
<garnt> - Hey!
- Hey! </garnt>
<joey> - "Here's some money to spend,
go treat yourself, king, </joey>
<joey> but don't leave the house
thought, but don't leave." </joey>
<joey> And then they realized it
was a colossal mistake. </joey>
<garnt> Like a month later, when
the cases went up a fuck ton </garnt>
<connor> because everyone's of course,
everyone's gonna travel! </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, you're paying me to travel </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't want me to travel. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, like if you went
to a five-star hotel </connor>
<connor> that's like a thousand bucks, </connor>
<garnt> it would go down to like
600 and then you'd be given </garnt>
<garnt> 300 bucks to spend and it's
like who isn't gonna do that? </garnt>
<connor> Like if you have disposable income, </connor>
<joey> anyone is gonna do that. </joey>
<joey> - That's like dangling a
carrot in front of a horse </joey>
<connor> and telling the horse not to run, right? </connor>
<joey> (Connor chuckles) </joey>
<joey> Like don't, don't! </joey>
<joey> - I'm finna, I'm finna try
and be responsible here </joey>
<joey> but you Japanese government
making me act up. </joey>
<joey> I want, you know? </joey>
<joey> I was like, well shit,
I'm going to Hokkaido. </joey>
<joey> See ya, guys.
- Of course everyone </joey>
<connor> abused the out fuck out
of that system, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because I--
- Everyone went traveling. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because it was
like, why wouldn't I? </connor>
<connor> - I went to like four different places. </connor>
<connor> I was like-
- Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - I'm obviously not, 'cause
literally everybody is going. </connor>
<joey> Right? So it's like what's the point? </joey>
<connor> What's the point of not going? </connor>
<connor> - It was the most confusing period ever, </connor>
<connor> because they were like, "Don't
travel, but please travel, </connor>
<connor> please, please travel, we
need it for the economy." </connor>
<joey> - And then they shut it down, like after- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like a month.
- A month, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Of course, it was a colossal mistake. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I went to Hokkaido cause
I was like, "Fuck, yeah!" </garnt>
<joey> I didn't interact with anyone- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I think all three
of us went to Hokkaido </joey>
<garnt> at different times, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. Why the fuck wouldn't I? </garnt>
<joey> - I went way after and
it was because you guys </joey>
<joey> kept talking about
Hokkaido, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I think it's my time
to go to Hokkaido as well." </joey>
<joey> Waited for lockdown to
end and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Damn, they weren't joking around. </joey>
<connor> Fucking Hokkaido slaps, man!" </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's like middle of fucking
nowhere, no-one's there, </joey>
<joey> it's like great, it's peaceful. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - But it was just the dumbest thing ever </joey>
<joey> because if they just kept,
like this is the whole thing </joey>
<garnt> that the Japanese government are doing </garnt>
<garnt> where they just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> haven't really committed to anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - They haven't really told
you not to do anything. </garnt>
<connor> They've been very wishy-washy.
- I think that's the thing. </connor>
<garnt> Every restriction they've given, </garnt>
<joey> it seems very half-assed
from my perspective. </joey>
<joey> It's not been like, we've
never been fully open, </joey>
<garnt> but we've also never
been fully closed either. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, like they've never
said you can't travel around. </connor>
<connor> The worst thing- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, if anything, they reward you for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then they also said like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh yeah, restaurants, please
close at eight," you know? </joey>
<joey> Like suddenly for some reason, </joey>
<connor> people are just gonna magically stop </connor>
<connor> getting infected before eight? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, this new
lockdown, they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Restaurants can't serve
alcohol anymore," right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like, so I'm still allowed </joey>
<garnt> to go to the restaurant?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But I just can't drink beer? </connor>
<connor> - It's generous to even
call it like half-measures. </connor>
<joey> It's like-
- Like a quarter-measure. </joey>
<joey> - A one-tenth measure is what they do. </joey>
<joey> And, you know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't really care about
the whole politics at all, </joey>
<connor> but I wish they would just
decide what they want to do. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's the problem, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Is that unlike a lot of
countries, the Japanese, </joey>
<garnt> Japanese law, they can't force
establishments to close down. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Like a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of other countries. </garnt>
<garnt> And so they're like, "Okay,
so we can't force you </garnt>
<joey> to close down, but we advise
you to not serve alcohol, </joey>
<joey> to close after eight," but
there's also from what I heard, </joey>
<garnt> there's like a penalty for establishments </garnt>
<garnt> that don't follow those rules. </garnt>
<connor> - You get a fine. </connor>
<garnt> - If you make a fuck-ton of money, </garnt>
<joey> the restaurants that make so much money </joey>
<joey> were like, "Oh, we'll just pay the bill." </joey>
<joey> - The penalty is so low that
there are a lot of restaurants </joey>
<joey> out there, especially in like inner Tokyo </joey>
<joey> that are just like, "We'll
pay for the penalty, fuck it." </joey>
<joey> - Some of like the biggest restaurants </joey>
<garnt> I think just pay the fine. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they just pay the fine. </joey>
<joey> but they make more off of
the money that they make. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Then also the biggest that
was not even the fine, </connor>
<joey> it was like, "We'll put
you on a list of companies </joey>
<joey> that stayed open."
(Garnt chuckles) </joey>
<joey> And obviously to a lot of Japanese people </joey>
<joey> that's like pretty like, fuck,
we're gonna be on a list? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Fuck. </joey>
<joey> But then for some of them, they were like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't fucking give
a shit about a list." </joey>
<joey> - It's like getting on the naughty list </joey>
<joey> on Santa's-
- Yeah, Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Oh, no." </joey>
<connor> - It's so, so dumb, so dumb. </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing, this would have been, </joey>
<joey> at least in Japan-
- Well, 'cause Australia </joey>
<connor> and New Zealand, like totally locked down. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - New Zealand were like, "No." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, no.
- No one could do anything. </connor>
<connor> - Australia locked down for
like nine months, like fully. </connor>
<connor> And people couldn't go outside
for more than an hour a day. </connor>
<garnt> And like all restaurants were closed, </garnt>
<joey> all that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> And then when in Sydney, at least, </joey>
<joey> we got one case and the entire city </joey>
<joey> went into lock down for like a month. </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, Japan is like, "1,000 cases? </joey>
<joey> Don't drink at restaurants." </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like, cool, thanks. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I mean, it'll
be interesting to see </garnt>
<garnt> what happens in this next year </garnt>
<garnt> because every other country seems to be </garnt>
<joey> getting their vaccines
and we are still like, </joey>
<joey> we're probably not gonna
be able to get our vaccines </joey>
<joey> this year if we stay in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - It's looking more and more likely. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, you know, there's like, </joey>
<joey> I know of a few of my
American friends who are here, </joey>
<joey> who are probably just
gonna like bite the bullet </joey>
<connor> and just go back to America </connor>
<connor> sometime this year to
just go get the vaccine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Everyone in like my age </joey>
<garnt> in America is already getting it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the UK as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, UK as well.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like being a kid again, </garnt>
<joey> when they always got the games before you. </joey>
<joey> It's like fuck, man, why you
all getting the good shit? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - It's reversed now. </joey>
<joey> Japan is the last one to get it out. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's like Japan was always the first. </connor>
<connor> Now, you're the last. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like I've been lied to. </joey>
<joey> - Like are you guys gonna do it? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm probably gonna do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't blame you. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd fucking do it. </garnt>
<garnt> If I was an American or from the UK, </garnt>
<joey> I would absolutely do it. </joey>
<joey> - It's twofold for me, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I want to- </joey>
<connor> - I want go back to the UK. </connor>
<connor> - I want to go back to
UK to visit my friends. </connor>
<connor> - I want beans and toast God damn it! </connor>
<connor> - You know, it's been like, </connor>
<connor> I think this is longest I've been </connor>
<connor> from like seeing my
family, seeing my friends. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, same.
- Same, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm just like, that and the vaccine, </joey>
<joey> if I can get everything
done in one trip, then yeah, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna take like a
month and a half off Japan </joey>
<garnt> and just go do the things that
I need to do for my health. </garnt>
<garnt> And also catch up to all the things like- </garnt>
<connor> - Beans and toast, just wanna have it. </connor>
<garnt> I just wanna have some
beans and fucking toast. </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck my friends, just beans and toast. </joey>
<joey> - Right, there's no Heinz beans here. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck am I supposed to do? </joey>
<garnt> - That's so fucking depressing man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I legitimately miss beans and toast. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry-
- I crave it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think there's
a more depressing sight </connor>
<joey> than just beans on toast by itself. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> As a Brit-
- Listen, </joey>
<joey> baked beans tastes good. </joey>
<joey> - As a Brit, </joey>
<garnt> like seeing the sight of
just like beans on toast </garnt>
<garnt> as like a fucking
breakfast, dinner, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fantastic. </garnt>
<joey> - See, I feel that way, nut
like two or three times a year, </joey>
<joey> I just wake up and I'm like, fuck, </joey>
<connor> I could go for some beans right now. </connor>
<connor> - Baked beans- </connor>
<connor> - Beaked beans, like Heinz
baked beans I'm like ah. </connor>
<connor> - Great source of protein
as well. You know? </connor>
<joey> Like what's not to like? </joey>
<joey> - It's like fuck me up. </joey>
<connor> - Beans are magical,
they're fucking fantastic. </connor>
<joey> - Make me fart like a mother fucker, </joey>
<connor> but still good.
- Who cares? Who cares? </connor>
<connor> I like that. </connor>
<connor> It feels like you're being cleansed. </connor>
<connor> - It's like detox. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> But like, that's the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, at least you guys </joey>
<joey> and like all my American friends </joey>
<connor> have a choice to do that, right? </connor>
<connor> Go back, doubly like get a vaccine- </connor>
<connor> - I just saw like Australia
apparently made it illegal </connor>
<garnt> to return if you're from India, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like illegal, like
you could go to prison </joey>
<connor> if you return. </connor>
<connor> - That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like what?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's the problem, right? </connor>
<garnt> Is that like, I can't do
the same for Australia </garnt>
<garnt> because we're in no
rush to get the vaccine </garnt>
<garnt> because no one's had COVID
for the past four months. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, not even my grandma,
who's like 92 this year </garnt>
<garnt> has gotten it yet. </garnt>
<joey> It's like maybe- </joey>
<garnt> - You guys are isolated as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard enough to get
in your country as it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it makes sense, right? </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, that's
why Australia has done so well </joey>
<joey> and same with New Zealand, but still. </joey>
<garnt> - That's why if like the
whole world goes through </garnt>
<joey> like the fucking apocalypse, </joey>
<joey> Australia is just gonna
be there fucking chilling. </joey>
<joey> - Australia and New Zealand </joey>
<garnt> are gonna be like the
two remaining countries. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. </joey>
<garnt> - Man, seeing the whole like
the whole Joe Rogan controversy </garnt>
<garnt> about all the like vaccines and stuff. </garnt>
<joey> It's so frustrating that like, </joey>
<joey> it's literally been the only
thing anyone can talk about </joey>
<joey> for the past like year and a half is COVID </joey>
<joey> and all this shit. </joey>
<joey> But it's also like, you can't talk about </joey>
<joey> because everyone's fucking
turned it into a political thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Where it's just like, I
just wanna eat baked beans. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't want to die. </garnt>
<connor> - I just don't want to be ill </connor>
<garnt> and I don't want to get other people ill. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and it sucks that
it's become like a thing, </connor>
<garnt> like even now talking about
it, I feel like, fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> there's probably gonna to
be some fucking assholes </garnt>
<connor> in the comments who are
like annoyed about it, </connor>
<connor> I was talking about it and shit. </connor>
<joey> - I just want to kiss my
homie's good night, man. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly.
- Come on, man. </connor>
<joey> Let me kiss my homies. Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna eat some fucking baked beans, </joey>
<connor> watch "Cars 2" in the theater, you know? </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, wasn't
it like the UK recently, </joey>
<joey> I think like couple of days ago? </joey>
<garnt> Just had their first mask-less concert? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like 5,000 people
at a concert or something </garnt>
<joey> and none of them were wearing masks </joey>
<joey> because they were all vaccinated. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not sure about, Meilyne, </garnt>
<joey> can you like play fact checker? </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure I saw
that this morning, but like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not surprised either
because the UK has been, </joey>
<joey> I mean the US and UK have been </joey>
<joey> so fucking good with their vaccines. </joey>
<connor> - I loved how in the UK where
they literally were like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay guys, I think you can
maybe go out for drinks now." </joey>
<joey> Literally like the first
day, London was like rammed. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course.
- Of course it would be. </garnt>
<joey> - And they were like, "We've
been waiting like 10 years </joey>
<garnt> for this, we're gonna go
get a pint with Jerry." </garnt>
<connor> It's like, oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- I can't quite imagine </garnt>
<garnt> how Wetherspoons was going to be like, </garnt>
<connor> as soon as they opened up. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- God, I do miss </garnt>
<garnt> a good Wetherspoons actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - The government could tell, </garnt>
<garnt> like if Britain had to fight
in like another war, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> and the government was
like, "Please fight, </garnt>
<joey> please fight for us." </joey>
<joey> And they'd be like, "Nah, nah." </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Pubs will
be open if you fight." </joey>
<joey> They'll be like, "Where are we fighting? </joey>
<joey> Where are we fighting?" </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is
about pubs and British people </joey>
<joey> but like it turns them into
something like ferocious. </joey>
<joey> Like when pubs come into the equation, </joey>
<joey> they become like different
people that like, </joey>
<garnt> they suddenly become more passionate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like people in Britain </garnt>
<garnt> weren't taking like the pandemic seriously </garnt>
<connor> until pubs started closing down. </connor>
<connor> And that's like the-
- It's the end of the world! </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like I sleep. </garnt>
<joey> I can't go to school or work, whatever. </joey>
<joey> Pubs are closed? What the fuck!? </joey>
<connor> What the fuck!? </connor>
<connor> - This is a political agenda. </connor>
<garnt> How dare they close the pubs! </garnt>
<joey> - That's the exact
moment it got political. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the pubs closed down. </joey>
<joey> I can't believe these
politicians have done this. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - [Meilyne] It was supposedly </joey>
<joey> the first almost normal concert. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> The first almost normal concert, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, damn, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I know British people though </garnt>
<garnt> we fucking lie about
anything to get into events </garnt>
<joey> and stuff.
- That's true. </joey>
<joey> - They'd be like, "Yeah,
I've got a vaccine. </joey>
<connor> Of course, I've got a vaccine." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Oh my arm hurts. Ooh. </joey>
<connor> - Tell me if the Pendulum weren't playing </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I know British people. </joey>
<garnt> Come on, that's a fucking
lie. There's no way. </garnt>
<connor> - Come on.
- There's no fucking way. </connor>
<connor> - The amount of clubs with
like 16 and 17 year olds </connor>
<connor> with fake IDs, come on. </connor>
<joey> People are faking the passports vaccines. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, 100%.
- Vaccine passports </connor>
<garnt> or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the fucking bouncers give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Are you kidding me? </garnt>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<joey> - You could hand a fucking McDonald's </joey>
<joey> like 10 coffee card at them as an ID, </joey>
<joey> they'd let you fucking
in the club in the UK. </joey>
<joey> Get out of here.
- To be fair though, </joey>
<joey> if any country is probably going to do </joey>
<joey> like a fully normal concert first, </joey>
<garnt> it's gonna be the US or the
UK with how they're going. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whether they should. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, when they should is
a different question but- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, from what I've heard </joey>
<joey> from like third party information, </joey>
<joey> from all my mates back there up, </joey>
<joey> it's the one thing that
we've been doing well </joey>
<joey> about the pandemic, which
is the vaccine response. </joey>
<joey> Right?
- Right. </joey>
<connor> - Which it kind of makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we just fucking
bought them all up. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck you other countries. </garnt>
<joey> - We used that first world country money. </joey>
<joey> Give us that shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty tragic though. </joey>
<joey> It's just like US/UK bought them all </joey>
<joey> and then no one else gets it. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> It's pretty tragic really. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- 'Cause you get it </joey>
<joey> from the insiders there, </joey>
<joey> like, "Yeah, we're doing great." </joey>
<joey> And then you get over to- </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, of course you are. </joey>
<garnt> - How's the rest of the world doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, fuck 'em. </garnt>
<garnt> That's their attitude, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty tragic. </garnt>
<connor> - True, true.
- It is what it is I guess. </connor>
<joey> - Money talks.
- Exactly. Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - What do you guys been
doing in the meantime? </connor>
<garnt> You guys been traveling around? </garnt>
<connor> You've been doing anything
interesting before the lockdown? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, before lockdown for a minute </garnt>
<garnt> we could travel in the
little bits that we could. </garnt>
<connor> We recently just went camping which was- </connor>
<joey> - I know, I couldn't come. </joey>
<joey> I had plans I did really far in advance </joey>
<joey> and I was like, wait, shit, </joey>
<connor> I wanted to come camping with the boys. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so Garnt, me, and
like four of our friends </joey>
<joey> went camping in the mountains of- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was my first
experience camping in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and definitely was a very
different experience. </garnt>
<garnt> If you've never been camping before, </garnt>
<garnt> I recommend you go camping in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it is like (indistinct)
baby mode camping, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it really is. </connor>
<garnt> - You roughly described it to me, </garnt>
<connor> but you're saying there's
like electricity, there's- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So let me tell you about this. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I've only been camping
I think once or twice </garnt>
<garnt> else in my life, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - So wait, okay, I have one question. </garnt>
<connor> Did you get like a lot? </connor>
<joey> - What's that?
- Like a square? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> We had to book it. </garnt>
<joey> - We had to book a lot. </joey>
<joey> So my only other experience camping </joey>
<joey> has been just like in the
middle of the fucking fields. </joey>
<joey> Like I went on like a trip in Colorado </joey>
<joey> where we just like rode
horses for eight hours. </joey>
<joey> And we camped literally </joey>
<joey> in the middle of like
the woods in Colorado. </joey>
<joey> That was what I thought- </joey>
<joey> - That sounds fucking fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - It was fucking great. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was gonna
be something similar. </joey>
<joey> So I'm not that experienced in camping. </joey>
<joey> So I asked the boys, </joey>
<joey> "So what should I be bringing?" </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> And so they gave me the
usual sleeping bags, </joey>
<joey> tents, warm clothes and everything, </joey>
<joey> and also like a power
bank to charge your phone. </joey>
<joey> So I came in with the expectations of </joey>
<joey> I need to buy a big fucking power bank, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we're not gonna have
any power there, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> We were camping for like two days. </garnt>

<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - So a friend had a, he
has this thing called </garnt>
<garnt> like the Omnicharge. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the full name, </garnt>
<garnt> but it looked like a battle station. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember he-
- It's not that big. </garnt>
<connor> It's kind of like this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But like it was way bigger than any </garnt>
<garnt> of the portable charges I've ever seen. </garnt>
<joey> And also like what sold me
was that it had it's own plug, </joey>
<joey> so you can plug like-
- Power outlet. </joey>
<joey> - Like an AC adapter. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so you can plug like
power adapter to it, right? </joey>
<joey> So I was like I want something
like that for a camping trip. </joey>
<joey> Right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I asked, "Oh, what's
this thing called?" </joey>
<joey> So he says, "It's the Omnicharger." </joey>
<joey> So I Google it on Amazon </joey>
<joey> and unfortunately they're not
selling on Amazon anymore. </joey>
<garnt> So I go to like the first link </garnt>
<garnt> that's recommended for like that search. </garnt>
<garnt> And here's the thing about Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> is that you see a charger, right? </garnt>
<garnt> There's nothing to like quantify
how big this charger is. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Just from the image.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's dimensions
but you might not look at them. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes it's like
buried in a wall of text. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's buried in wall of text </garnt>
<garnt> so I just see this block, right? </garnt>
<joey> - And I'm just like, it's
probably around the same, </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's recommended from
me searching the Omnicharger </joey>
<connor> so it's probably about
the same size, right? </connor>
<joey> - Fucking A. </joey>
<joey> - It's probably around the same size. </joey>
<joey> Thinking back, like
being like an electronic </joey>
<joey> and ex electronic and electrical engineer, </joey>
<joey> I've got a master's, I should have seen </joey>
<joey> like the amount of like charge it holds. </joey>
<joey> But I didn't look at the
amount of charge it holds. </joey>
<joey> I was just like on like
fucking autopilot mode. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, okay, that looks good. </joey>
<joey> Buy that, okay. </joey>
<joey> So I wait a few days from
all my camping equipment </joey>
<joey> that I bought, and this
fucking massive package, like- </joey>
<joey> - I wish you brought it with you today. </joey>
<joey> - I wish I did. I wish I did. </joey>
<joey> This massive package
gets delivered to my door </joey>
<joey> and I'm all right. </joey>
<joey> Everything's like boxed up </joey>
<joey> so I don't know what everything is. </joey>
<joey> So the first thing I pick
up, it's fucking heavy. </joey>
<joey> It's this fucking brick and
my first thought was, oh no, </joey>
<joey> have I bought like a sleeping bag </joey>
<joey> that's just like 10 times
heavier than I need it? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right.
- And so I start unboxing it </joey>
<garnt> and I see this fucking brick
just in my hands, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember buying
anything this heavy. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Turn it around </connor>
<connor> and it's the fucking charger. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no way. </connor>
<connor> - How big is it?
- This must be a mistake. </connor>
<joey> - I think I have a photo of it. </joey>
<joey> - So Joey has a photo. </joey>
<joey> It's on screen right now. </joey>
<joey> The photo of this brick that I got. </joey>
<joey> I turn it around. </joey>
<joey> I look at like the
appliances that it can power. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, okay,
so this can power phones. </joey>
<joey> It can, you know, charge tablets. </joey>
<joey> And then it says you can charge laptops. </joey>
<joey> It can power a fucking mini-fridge. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like, it
can power a mini fridge, </joey>
<garnt> a microwave and I'm just like, oh shit, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck have I bought? </garnt>
<joey> - This thing he bought it
literally is like, oh, I found it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - So this is like a fucking
brick that I bought. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like two routers
strapped together. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, what the fuck- </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a Mac mini. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what I'm going
to be able to do with this </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like I can't take that on a plane </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like if I take on a plane, </garnt>
<garnt> the TSA probably thinks I'm
gonna bomb the fucking plane. </garnt>
<connor> - You'll get fucking
arrested on that plane. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I'm probably gonna
put on the fucking ISIS list </garnt>
<garnt> if I take this on a plane. </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can't even, so I'm
just thinking to myself, </garnt>
<joey> All right, guys, I've made a mistake. </joey>
<joey> But it's okay because
at least I can use it </joey>
<joey> on this camping trip. </joey>
<joey> So like I lug this massive
fucking brick in my suitcase </joey>
<joey> or in my bag, sorry, </joey>
<joey> which is probably like by itself, </joey>
<joey> the heaviest single object
in my bag for a camping trip. </joey>
<joey> And so we get to this
campsite and you know, </joey>
<joey> we get a lot and we start
unpacking everything </joey>
<joey> and I see this metal box, right? </joey>
<joey> I see this metal box. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "What
the fuck is that metal box?" </joey>
<joey> My first thought was, oh, </joey>
<joey> it's probably like a safe
they provided, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I hear about
some American campsites </joey>
<joey> having like bear safes or something </joey>
<joey> so I was thinking, oh, it
might be a safe or something. </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, "Nabi, what's that?" </joey>
<garnt> And he's just like, "Just
wait, Garnt. Let me show you." </garnt>
<garnt> He opens it up and it's
a fucking power outlet. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Two power outlets are
sticking out like that, </joey>
<connor> I'm just like. </connor>
<connor> - Ah yes, camping with my power outlet. </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, "So wait, </garnt>
<garnt> there's literally no fucking reason </garnt>
<garnt> for me to buy this fucking brick </garnt>
<garnt> and lug this around. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't take it anywhere,
can't take it on the plane. </garnt>
<garnt> and apparently it's
useless for a camping trip. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck do I need this for? </garnt>
<joey> - Literally, I looked at
that thing and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "That's what people use
for like emergencies." </joey>
<joey> When like your house is flooded
and you have no electricity </joey>
<garnt> and like this is the
thing that like powers </garnt>
<joey> your house for like a month. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just thinking if
Japan Sinks ever happens, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking sorted, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - You are like the top of the hierarchy. </garnt>
<connor> Like people could be fighting-
- You could power </connor>
<connor> like a flood light. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I remember the first night </connor>
<connor> he like charged his phone. </connor>
<connor> Well, he was like, "Might as well use </connor>
<connor> this fucking thing I bought" </connor>
<connor> So he charged his phone, right? </connor>
<garnt> It was like a 100%. </garnt>
<garnt> Next morning, phone is fully charged. 97%. </garnt>
<garnt> He used 3% of his charge
to power his phone. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like this thing could last you </garnt>
<garnt> like literally like two months. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I literally-
- It's insane. </joey>
<garnt> - I literally bought it just
so I could recharge my phone </garnt>
<joey> during the duration of this camping trip. </joey>
<joey> - Doesn't it have like
it's own ventilation, </joey>
<joey> like fan inside of it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I knew it was
like fucking way too overkill </joey>
<garnt> when I opened it up, it had
a vent that had like a fan. </garnt>
<joey> - He turned it on and it
literally started going (buzzing). </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah so, 3% to power
the fucking fan probably. </connor>
<joey> 1% but he charged his fucking phone. </joey>
<joey> - It was so funny. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but like I've been camping
quite a bit in Australia. </joey>
<connor> Like my dad and I used to go camping </connor>
<connor> all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to fucking
camp with a power outlet. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck?
- Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> But like I realized, okay, </connor>
<joey> Japan does not know how to go camping </joey>
<joey> because like it really is
baby mode on (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - So we had like some
relatively small tents, right? </joey>
<joey> - Did you have neighbors? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. We had neighbors. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's that's the thing
that really put me off. </joey>
<joey> - But it was one lot apart so
there was social distancing. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was one lot apart,
it was social distancing. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> I bet he could fucking hear you fart. </joey>
<joey> - Probably. </joey>
<joey> One thing I learned about a tent </joey>
<joey> is that it's just not noise proof at all. </joey>
<joey> - No.
- You can hear </joey>
<joey> fucking everything. </joey>
<joey> Literally, I remember we were sleeping </joey>
<joey> and I could hear like the
other tent fucking farting </joey>
<joey> in the background. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just. "Okay, who was that? </joey>
<joey> Was that you Nabi?" </joey>
<joey> Okay. Whatever. </joey>
<joey> But like some of these tents
that these people bought, </joey>
<joey> they weren't fucking tents. </joey>
<joey> So some of our neighbors, right? </joey>
<joey> One lot's like two lots down from us. </joey>
<joey> They start unpacking this tent, right? </joey>
<joey> And then this tent has
fucking compartments, right? </joey>
<joey> And then not only that,
I remember walking past, </joey>
<joey> they had an entrance, right? </joey>
<joey> They had an entrance that
had lights on the entrance. </joey>
<joey> Okay? </joey>
<joey> - Like fairy lights. </joey>
<joey> - And this tent had like
two fucking bedrooms, </joey>
<garnt> a living room.
- Oh, my parents </garnt>
<connor> had a tent like that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is that even a tent, though? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like family tent. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a pop-up apartment. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but it's like a family tent. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just like this isn't
a tent, this is a 2LDK. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, those tents are a
fucking nightmare to set up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- They're a pain in the ass. </connor>
<connor> - Well, but that's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like I get it if it was a family, </joey>
<joey> but this was a couple.
- This was a couple. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, it's 'cause you're a Japanese couple </garnt>
<garnt> so naturally, you're not
gonna in the same bed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was getting to that
because this like this tent </garnt>
<garnt> had carpet, had shelves and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> might as well just bring a
fucking caravan at this point. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, we'd take that </connor>
<connor> but we stayed for like three weeks. </connor>
<garnt> - That makes sense if it's three weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> - They stayed for a single
night and like okay- </garnt>
<joey> - A single night? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a single night.
- Yeah, a single night. </joey>
<joey> They came with us and
then left the same day. </joey>
<joey> - So here's the premium Japanese couple </joey>
<joey> experience that I saw, all right? </joey>
<joey> So we walked past this tent, right? </joey>
<connor> And of course this
Japanese couple, you know, </connor>
<connor> obviously very intimate Japanese couple </connor>
<connor> to be going on a camping
trip by themselves together. </connor>
<connor> - Very intimate.
- Very intimate. </connor>
<connor> So the peak Japanese couple experience </connor>
<connor> was seeing the guy next to his car </connor>
<connor> on a fucking gamer chair or something </connor>
<garnt> and then seeing the girl on the other side </garnt>
<garnt> of this massive tent on a hammock, </garnt>
<garnt> both of them by themselves,
not interacting, </garnt>
<garnt> premium Japanese couple experience. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, isn't that love? </connor>
<garnt> Knowing when to ignore each other. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's love. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I say it's
a premium Japanese couple </garnt>
<garnt> experience because the amount of times </garnt>
<garnt> like we've gone to like
onsens or ryokans or something </garnt>
<connor> and like it's just like us, the boys, </connor>
<connor> and we're just surrounded
by Japanese couples. </connor>
<connor> - They don't talk to each other. </connor>
<connor> - Not talking to each other. </connor>
<joey> - They don't talk to each other. </joey>
<garnt> - Just not interacting with each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - Couples that social distance together, </garnt>
<garnt> stay together, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> They're just social distancing, you know? </garnt>
<joey> But like one part I
couldn't fucking believe was </joey>
<joey> with wood-fire, right? </joey>
<joey> So you had to like go to, well, I mean, </joey>
<joey> they have the option to
go to like the reception, </joey>
<joey> quote unquote, where you
could buy pre-cut wood-fire. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. That's normally how it is. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] All right. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause they don't want you </connor>
<connor> to just fucking picking
shit up around the area </connor>
<joey> and burning it.
- Right, </joey>
<connor> but like the thing is- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's we did.
- That's what we did. </garnt>
<garnt> Because each bundle was like 500 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe for like a bundle about- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it wasn't about the price. </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't about the price
because like this wood, </joey>
<joey> because it's like pre-cut
and clean and dry, </joey>
<joey> this thing burns through
like so fucking quickly </joey>
<connor> and I'm like we're here
for the entire day. </connor>
<connor> We want this fire to keep
going the entire day, right? </connor>
<connor> This thing is not gonna
last us the entire day. </connor>
<garnt> So I just said, fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just like went out into the bush </garnt>
<garnt> and just grabbed some wood </garnt>
<garnt> and our friend Nabi had a hatchet </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Give me that shit," </garnt>
<joey> Just fucking started like
deforesting this fucking forest. </joey>
<connor> - Fucking die, (indistinct) forest. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, we wouldn't
deforest the forest. </joey>
<joey> They were already like- </joey>
<joey> - Bits of dead trees on the ground. </joey>
<joey> - Bits of dead trees on the ground </joey>
<garnt> that we just cut up. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't cut down any trees. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Joey just starts his
fucking Animal Crossing </garnt>
<connor> this fucking campsite. </connor>
<connor> - To emphasize, we
didn't cut up any trees. </connor>
<joey> We just cut off some branches
that had fallen down, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we cut the logs
into like sizeable pieces. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and brought them to our campsite </joey>
<joey> because that to me is the
camping experience, right? </joey>
<garnt> We're out in the wilderness with like- </garnt>
<connor> - You're like out here in
like a fucking swimming pool </connor>
<connor> treating it like Bear Grylls. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's the thing it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> - We wanted to make the most of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - We wanted to make the most of it, </garnt>
<joey> because otherwise we would've had to spend </joey>
<joey> like a hundred bucks for firewood. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, fuck that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, it's not about
the 100 bucks of firewood, </garnt>
<connor> because it's just- </connor>
<connor> - It's not about the money, Joey! </connor>
<connor> It's about the experience! </connor>
<joey> - It's about the experience! </joey>
<joey> - Exactly! </joey>
<joey> The most amount of fun
going out into the bush, </joey>
<joey> picking up some like dead
trees and just bringing it back </joey>
<joey> and just chopping the shit out of it. </joey>
<joey> That was the most fun. </joey>
<connor> - I'd be so fucking bored if I turned up </connor>
<joey> and it's like I got like 10 neighbors, </joey>
<joey> I've got a power outlet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Fuck man. </joey>
<connor> - And it's like, pre-packaged. </connor>
<connor> - Here you go. Here's
all the things you need. </connor>
<garnt> Go have fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - All fucking micro-transactions </garnt>
<joey> with your camping experience, man. </joey>
<joey> Probably like bring your food if you want. </joey>
<joey> I know some camping trips
actually bring you meat, </joey>
<garnt> and a grill, if you want
to have food for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like just stay at a hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> - The best part about camping, right, </garnt>
<garnt> is when you all turn up, right, </garnt>
<joey> and then you're one mate is
like, "Boys, I brought bacon." </joey>
<joey> And everyone's like, "Yes. Let's go! </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- He brought </joey>
<joey> fucking perishable foods. </joey>
<joey> What an idiot, but it works. </joey>
<joey> I mean, and in the UK, </joey>
<joey> there's a little place you
can just kinda ask them, </joey>
<joey> you're like "Hey, can
I camp on your land?" </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Yeah, sure."
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> There's a lot of places
where you can camp- </connor>
<joey> - I mean, in Australia there's
designated camping areas, </joey>
<connor> but like it's first come, first serve. </connor>
<joey> If it's full, then fuck
off somewhere else. </joey>
<connor> - Is there a place like that in Japan </connor>
<joey> or is it all regulated camping? </joey>
<joey> - It's all regulated. </joey>
<connor> - Ah, fuck.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it was fine for
the experience it was, </garnt>
<garnt> but I definitely prefer
the camping experience </garnt>
<garnt> I had in other countries
because it just kind of didn't </garnt>
<garnt> feel like camping, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, there was that
other couple next to us </joey>
<connor> that brought a fucking TV. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah! (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I'd do it. </connor>
<connor> I'd do it too. </connor>
<connor> - And they're like playing Smash Bros </connor>
<connor> or whatever the fuck it was. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, just like, why
are you even camping, dude? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if you've got a fucking plug, </joey>
<joey> why not bring the 50 inch TV? </joey>
<joey> - I guess so.
- I guess so. </joey>
<joey> - Why not bring the 50 incher, bro? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess so. </joey>
<connor> It's ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> I was like, you think that these guys </joey>
<joey> have been like permanently living there </joey>
<connor> with how much shit they have. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, truthfully,
I tend to bring like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can get
those like really shitty </connor>
<connor> like 19 inch battery powered monitors. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You can bring that. </connor>
<connor> You can bring a Switch. </connor>
<connor> - The thing is, </connor>
<connor> because I've had a pretty
fucking stressful week </connor>
<connor> because of the whole move thing. </connor>
<connor> So it's just so nice to just sit down </connor>
<connor> and look at a fire for 12 hours </connor>
<joey> and literally drink
and talk about nothing. </joey>
<joey> It was the best fucking experience I had. </joey>
<connor> - That is the best part of it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, who set up the tents? </joey>
<connor> - We all did.
- We all did. </connor>
<joey> - We all did, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did you really, did you all? </joey>
<joey> Did you really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we all did, we all did. </joey>
<connor> - Really, 'cause most of
the time it's "we all did" </connor>
<connor> and it's like I watched
the other guy do it. </connor>
<joey> - Our tents really
weren't that complicated. </joey>
<connor> - Really?
- 'Cause our tent </connor>
<joey> literally just like a triangle. </joey>
<joey> One of one of those fucking pyramid tents. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't fucking inflatable apartment </joey>
<garnt> - It wasn't a two bedroom apartment. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like 15 I had
the ones where you like, </connor>
<connor> you fucking throw it
in the air and it psh. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like Nabi had
one of those as well. </joey>
<connor> - Pain in the ass to fold up though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Ours was a bit more complicated </connor>
<connor> and we still somehow fucked it up </connor>
<connor> because, so our tent was like, </connor>
<garnt> it's like not pre, I mean,
it kinda is pre-built </garnt>
<garnt> but we kind of have to like
strengthen the supports, </garnt>
<garnt> the support beams that
it comes with, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Support beams. </joey>
<joey> - What they are called, the structure? </joey>
<joey> - Poles.
- Yeah, the poles, yeah. </joey>
<joey> The bone structure. </joey>
<joey> - I don't fucking know what it was. </joey>
<joey> - Poles, it's just fucking poles. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't a pole </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was like part
of the tent, right? </joey>
<joey> So this tent came with like support beams </joey>
<joey> that like supported the structure, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's all just fucking poles. </joey>
<joey> - It's baby mode, tent mode.
- Baby mode, tent mode. </joey>
<joey> We literally didn't have to do anything. </joey>
<joey> We just had to like fucking, </joey>
<joey> well, we thought we didn't
have to do anything, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it all kind of like
unfolded and we like put it up. </joey>
<joey> All we had to do was
like put the pegs down. </joey>
<garnt> We thought great, job done. </garnt>
<garnt> We didn't know it was job done </garnt>
<garnt> because when we were trying to sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> when me and Joey were trying to sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> it just kept caving in, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Because it was also windy as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - It was a windy ass-
- It was insanely windy. </garnt>
<joey> - It was a windy ass night </joey>
<garnt> so like every like fucking hour, </garnt>
<joey> I'd get woken up by
this tent just caving in </joey>
<joey> and I just have to like bring
the support pole up again. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like oh, for fucks sake. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It was horrible. </joey>
<joey> - And I could hear Joey </joey>
<joey> was like having trouble sleeping as well. </joey>
<joey> - I did not sleep at all that night. </joey>
<joey> - And it was only when we were packing up </joey>
<joey> that we took the cover off. </joey>
<garnt> And I was just like, at the
top of the support beam, </garnt>
<garnt> there was this label that said, "Push." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh, why does
this label say push? </garnt>
<garnt> And I push it down and I just hear click. </garnt>
<joey> - And everything is like solid as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Transformers, </garnt>
<garnt> everything just clicked into place. </garnt>
<joey> - I just hear this click and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "What was that click?" </joey>
<joey> And then I tried to like
push in the support beam- </joey>
<connor> - Did you not like read
like the manual or anything? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no.
- Clearly, we should have. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it was a tent. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll just give it a
quick like gaze over. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not used to tents like that. </garnt>
<connor> I'm used to the ones that you
have to like kind of connect </connor>
<connor> all the poles together
and do it yourself, right? </connor>
<joey> So I was like, oh cool. </joey>
<connor> - Who bought the tents? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, Nabi did.
- Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> - So I was like, oh, I've
never seen this kind of tent, </connor>
<joey> but it seems easy enough. </joey>
<connor> It literally just pops out. </connor>
<connor> - Some reason whenever you
fucking do your friend's tent, </connor>
<connor> it's like the biggest piece of shit ever. </connor>
<joey> It's like your tent pristine, brand new. </joey>
<joey> While your friend's tent is
literally like falling apart. </joey>
<joey> The poles don't fucking
connect, they're rusty as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> It's like what did you do to this tent? </garnt>
<connor> How did you put it in this bad condition? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know.
- I don't know, </joey>
<connor> I always had that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but like that night
it was so fucking windy. </joey>
<joey> I mean, the day before
it was so fucking raining </joey>
<joey> that we were just like
we're not camping out there. </joey>
<joey> It's like a torrential
thunderstorm out there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So we're just gonna fucking, </joey>
<joey> we just went to like a nearby dyokon, </joey>
<garnt> but the next day though, when
we actually went camping, </garnt>
<garnt> it was fucking great.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a great experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember Aki the next day, </garnt>
<garnt> Aki was like, "So what
did you guys talk about?" </garnt>
<joey> And I just sat there and was like- </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't matter what you talked about. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, what did I talk about? </joey>
<connor> - What's talked about in
camping, stays in camping. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Don't ask us that. </connor>
<connor> - And it was clearly so unimportant </connor>
<joey> that it didn't even retain in my memory. </joey>
<joey> All I remember is, ooh, a fire burn. </joey>
<joey> That's all I remember
from that camping trip. </joey>
<connor> - Your caveman instincts come out. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember trying to start
a fire for like a full hour. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause Nabi bought these
flints and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, guys, we've got a
power outlet right there." </garnt>
<joey> - He's like in a Bear Grylls- </joey>
<connor> - Just get a fucking outlet. </connor>
<connor> - And Endo, the entire
time was standing there </connor>
<joey> with a blowtorch and he's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Ready when you are, Garnt."
- Why does </joey>
<joey> he have a blow torch? </joey>
<joey> Why does he have a blow torch? </joey>
<garnt> You making fucking creme
brulee on the campsite? </garnt>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<connor> - So there's just me like huddled around </connor>
<garnt> this fucking moss trying
to set that on fire. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I try setting like so many, </garnt>
<garnt> like I try like getting
some YouTube tutorials out. </garnt>
<connor> I tried this for like a full fucking hour. </connor>
<connor> - It just fucking torrential
rained the day before </connor>
<connor> so all the wood's gonna be wet and shit. </connor>
<joey> - And meanwhile I'm
just like sitting there </joey>
<joey> in my gamer chair just
playing FireStarter. </joey>
<garnt> Come on, you got it, you got it, mate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to play
Bear Grylls, man, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - It was almost scary how
enthusiastic Garnt was </joey>
<joey> to start a fire. </joey>
<joey> He was just like, you know like, </joey>
<joey> because like we got there. </joey>
<garnt> - You make it sound like I'm
a fucking casual arsonist. </garnt>
<joey> - You are, Garnt, you are. </joey>
<garnt> - We got there, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And we're like all right, </garnt>
<garnt> let's figure out what we're going to do. </garnt>
<garnt> Are we gonna set up a tent? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<connor> All right, everybody help
get all the stuff out. </connor>
<connor> And Garnt's just kind
of standing there like, </connor>
<connor> "I just can't wait to start a fire." </connor>
<joey> That's how people become arsonists. </joey>
<joey> - Come on, come on, come on. </joey>
<joey> Let's not pretend that the
start of a camping trip </joey>
<joey> is always when you are able
to stop first start a fire. </joey>
<joey> - No, of course.
- That's how you know </joey>
<garnt> the camping trip has begun, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I knew from how enthusiastic you were, </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's like in the car
lighting stuff on fire. </connor>
<connor> - I knew from how enthusiastic
Garnt was to start the fire, </connor>
<connor> I was like, if I let
this man start a fire, </connor>
<joey> he's not gonna do anything else. </joey>
<joey> He's gonna stay next to that fire, </joey>
<joey> fueling that for bitch for like 12 hours. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause who the fuck
enjoys building a tent? </garnt>
<garnt> Like nobody actually
enjoys building a tent. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fiddly as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> Half the time you're trying to figure out </joey>
<joey> how the instruction manuals work. </joey>
<joey> Because the like- </joey>
<joey> - You mean the instruction
manual we didn't read? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. Right. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's a fucking pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> You try and figure out like, </joey>
<joey> somehow they've picked the images </joey>
<garnt> that make it like the least legible </garnt>
<garnt> and like the least
understandable to like figure out </garnt>
<connor> how to build this tent. </connor>
<joey> - Man, it sounds like you took
the monkey brain on the trip. </joey>
<joey> I didn't need to come. </joey>
<connor> There was already monkey brain there. </connor>
<joey> - Garnt was very monkey
brain around that fire. </joey>
<garnt> Like he was like (panting). </garnt>
<joey> I feed it more. </joey>
<garnt> - I was single-handedly fueling
that fire for like 12 hours. </garnt>
<garnt> This fire went on for like 12 hours </garnt>
<garnt> and I was the one like
fueling it every time. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't have to do anything. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like Garnt's
assistant right here, </joey>
<joey> just like fueling it. </joey>
<connor> - We need to look for like an actual place </connor>
<joey> where we can camp, like legit camp. </joey>
<joey> - Legit camp. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if we'll
be able to find that. </joey>
<connor> - No power outlets.
- I don't know </connor>
<joey> if we'll be able to find that in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sure we can find it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was your camping
experience like in England? </garnt>
<connor> - In England, I didn't go much in England. </connor>
<connor> I went around France mainly. </connor>
<garnt> A lot of the time in France though, </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like campsites like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who'd you camp with? </garnt>
<garnt> - My family for the most part, </garnt>
<joey> but then obviously, 'cause we're in Wales, </joey>
<joey> so it's really easy to
just camp for a weekend. </joey>
<joey> And normally you were just
like in a farmer's land </joey>
<joey> in like some fucking random field. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like land that someone owns. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they'd always know someone. </connor>
<garnt> You could just be like, oh, can we camp? </garnt>
<garnt> And maybe it'd be like a tenner a night </garnt>
<garnt> because they didn't really want anything, </garnt>
<joey> they were just like,
"Don't just leave a mess. </joey>
<joey> Just clean everything up." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, 'cause you can't
do that in Australia. </joey>
<joey> It needs to be in like national reserve. </joey>
<connor> - No, you can do whatever
you want on the land. </connor>
<garnt> And normally you're right
next to woods and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> so obviously there's no
power outlets or anything </garnt>
<garnt> and probably a decent
walk away from the car </garnt>
<joey> that you came in.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, it was just good fun though. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you just normally
just set up the tent. </joey>
<joey> If you can get fire going, go ahead, </joey>
<joey> but it might be raining a fuck ton </joey>
<joey> and you might have to start
drinking beers in the tent, </joey>
<joey> like four of you squished
in this tent like, </joey>
<joey> "How you guys doing? </joey>
<joey> All right, nice. </joey>
<joey> Someone wanna boil the kettle? </joey>
<joey> We'll get some pot noodles going." </joey>
<joey> Whatever you do. </joey>
<connor> We did like a Duke of
Edinburgh as well. We did that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- That was good fun as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because in Japan, </connor>
<joey> you can't even like put
a fire on the ground. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you need to buy like a fire pit. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, 'cause sometimes in some places </connor>
<connor> you have to clean it up yourself </connor>
<garnt> and it was easier to just bring something </garnt>
<garnt> that you could wrap like all the ash in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is like, I think
we did that a few times. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause if you have to clean it up, </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's an absolute pain in the ass </connor>
<connor> getting rid of all this ash. </connor>
<joey> - Well, because in Australia </joey>
<joey> all you did was just dig a hole. </joey>
<connor> And then once you were done with the ash, </connor>
<joey> you just fill up that hole again. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's good for the land </joey>
<connor> but I mean, sometimes you
can't do that in some places. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Ah, true, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, it's whatever. </joey>
<joey> I just kinda like, it was never
more than like two nights. </joey>
<joey> It was always like a night. </joey>
<joey> Put the tent up. </joey>
<joey> Kind of get drunk.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Eat a lot of bacon in the
morning, bacon sandwiches. </joey>
<connor> Then just fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, two nights I feel is
like the optimal camping time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'd say so. </connor>
<joey> Two nights is about right before- </joey>
<connor> - It depends, 'cause you need
something to do the second day </connor>
<joey> because the first night,
you're setting up, </joey>
<joey> you're having a few drinks. </joey>
<joey> What do you do during the whole second day </joey>
<joey> before you start drinking? </joey>
<joey> You can't immediately
like start drinking beers </joey>
<joey> at like 11.
- I mean, that's what we did. </joey>
<garnt> - That's kind of what we did. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I guess you can, </joey>
<joey> but then there's someone
like driving, right? </joey>
<garnt> Oh, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I kind of want to do something. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well that's when
you can bring the TV </joey>
<joey> and connect it to the power outlet. </joey>
<joey> It's like who's got the Switch? </joey>
<joey> - Well, 'cause if you go
camping with British people, </joey>
<joey> you know, and there's like four of you, </joey>
<joey> like a 24 pack, sorry,
I smashed so much there, </joey>
<joey> a 24 pack won't last more
than a night of beers, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean?
- That's true. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like how much
beer are you bringing along </joey>
<joey> for this thing, right? </joey>
<joey> You can't do day drinking. </joey>
<joey> You need like 40 beers at least
for that whole experience. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, that's why
I like doing something. </joey>
<connor> That's why like- </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, we brought
like a pack of cards </joey>
<joey> and like, you know, that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we never cracked them opened. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We just left them there
for like decoration. </connor>
<garnt> - I was just having too much
fucking fun with the fire. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - He's like way too
enthusiastic about the fire. </connor>
<garnt> - Was this fire burning like 24/7? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Well not 24/7. </joey>
<garnt> - It was burning or like
a good like 14 hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ, God, you monkey. </garnt>
<connor> - Because we fucking adventured
out and got all the wood. </connor>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> - That was half the fun. </joey>
<connor> - So what did you do the second day? </connor>
<connor> You said you slept in
the tent the first night. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, we didn't sleep
in a tent the first night </connor>
<garnt> because we got there like
super, super early on </garnt>
<joey> the second day because- </joey>
<joey> - The first day it was raining like crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the first day we
missed the day of camping. </joey>
<joey> So we did what anyone do and
just had a nice day at an onsen </joey>
<garnt> and slept with a nice roof over our heads. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just went there the second day </garnt>
<garnt> and we just basically
stayed there all day. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, We got there like
9:00 a.m. or something. </joey>
<joey> Like super early in the morning </joey>
<joey> so it was like a full, full day. </joey>
<connor> - Because I was in the area near you </connor>
<connor> and the storm was fucking brutal. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, the storm in
Tokyo was brutal as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Was it? I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I was kayaking and then I was
on like the ocean kayaking </joey>
<joey> and then the guy who was with us </joey>
<joey> was like, "Oh, there's a storm coming." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah,
I can fucking hear it." </joey>
<joey> Like (imitating rumbling) </joey>
<joey> like rumbling everywhere.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then suddenly
I'm just like kayaking, </joey>
<joey> just chilling, you know, nice weather. </joey>
<joey> And then suddenly out of nowhere, </joey>
<joey> like torrential rains starts pouring down, </joey>
<joey> just will not stop. </joey>
<garnt> It's fucking freezing as well, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, I literally felt like </garnt>
<garnt> I was at the "Shawshank Redemption" </garnt>
<joey> when he's crawling
through the tunnel of shit </joey>
<joey> with the rain, it was like that bad. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like I feel like I'm
crawling through the shit </joey>
<joey> trying to get back to shore
because I'm freezing right now. </joey>
<connor> And I'm fucking like, "Ah!" </connor>
<connor> Wish I was camping instead at that point. </connor>
<connor> But it was really good fuck
kayaking until that started. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- Good fun. </joey>
<joey> - God, I haven't been kayaking, </joey>
<garnt> I've never been kayaking
in the ocean I don't think. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been kayaking on
like rivers and lakes </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> but I don't think I've ever
been kayaking in the ocean. </connor>
<connor> - It's good fun, it's chill. </connor>
<garnt> - It seems a lot scarier. </garnt>
<joey> - Nah. </joey>
<joey> - Something about the ocean
just scares me. You know? </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<garnt> No, I mean, the ocean
is just scary, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's a scary place. </connor>
<connor> - Normally, a lot of
these things, you know, </connor>
<connor> unless you own your own kayak and stuff, </connor>
<joey> you can't just go and do it. </joey>
<joey> If you're renting, </joey>
<joey> there's normally always a
guy that comes with you. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To make sure you don't fucking drown. </joey>
<joey> - But if it's a lake, like
you know, fucking whatever. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was like in a group </joey>
<joey> with a bunch of Japanese people </joey>
<joey> and like one of them just like capsized. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how the fuck
did you manage that? </joey>
<joey> - Probably did it on purpose. </joey>
<joey> - He just flipped his boat </joey>
<joey> and was just like in
the middle of the ocean. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how the fuck's
he gonna get back here? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> He got back in somehow, but my God, </joey>
<joey> that man must have been freezing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I had like my phone on me as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I'm not capsizing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, fuck that. </joey>
<joey> - You put your phone on you </joey>
<connor> on a kayaking trip in
the middle of the ocean. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I sent you a picture of the snake. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, that was on the ocean. </connor>
<connor> - So I was like going, we
were kayaking past like rocks </connor>
<garnt> and I was doing this kind of thing </garnt>
<garnt> where you could kayak around like rocks </garnt>
<garnt> and like you go through like
caves and stuff, kayaking. </garnt>
<joey> And there was just this like
fucking snake just chilling, </joey>
<joey> like some kind of like, </joey>
<joey> this is like the entrance to death. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like fuck, let me
me get a quick 4k pic of that. </garnt>
<garnt> Whipped out my phone
and started taking pics. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) in 4k. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> For the fucking snake. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It was good fun. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I wish I could
go camping with you guys. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, yeah, we
definitely want to go. </joey>
<joey> I mean, Garnt and I still
have all the stuff with us </joey>
<connor> so we definitely want to do that again. </connor>
<connor> - You gonna get a driving
license now, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly, this camping trip </garnt>
<garnt> single-handedly convinced
me to get a driving license </garnt>
<joey> 'cause just like the
drive to this camp site </joey>
<joey> was fucking beautiful. </joey>
<joey> We were driving up these mountains. </joey>
<joey> - The weather was perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, the moment you leave Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> the views get like insane.
- Yeah, 100%. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like you always
want to drive in Japan </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're like, I can't
wait to see the views. </joey>
<joey> All of the service stations are amazing. </joey>
<joey> Like the food you can get </joey>
<joey> at the service stations here are insane. </joey>
<joey> Like when you stop at the
service stations in the UK, </joey>
<joey> I don't know about America, </joey>
<garnt> like on like motorways or what
are they called in the US? </garnt>
<garnt> - Highways.
- Highways. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, when you stop at them to break, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like McDonald's, KFC, it's
like I don't wanna stop. </garnt>
<joey> When you stop in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it's like you can get like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the services areas, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You get like ramen, curry,
sushi, all like fresh as fuck. </joey>
<joey> And it's so good and it's like, </joey>
<connor> well, of course I want to stop </connor>
<joey> because I want to get my coffee- </joey>
<joey> - The one we stopped at had
like a full on like fucking, </joey>
<connor> it was like a mall.
- Yeah, it was nuts. </connor>
<connor> - At the service area. </connor>
<garnt> - And you get really good fucking food. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like sushi, ramen, all that, </garnt>
<connor> that's just fast food here, right? </connor>
<connor> - It's crazy. </connor>
<garnt> It's such good quality as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm out here at night and
there's like a Yoshinoya </garnt>
<garnt> at the service station. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, it's 10:00 a.m. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna have a Yoshinoya
beef roll, let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the one we stopped at </connor>
<joey> had like a like fucking
Starbucks and like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- It had like a whole, </joey>
<joey> it was like almost like
an anime shop. wasn't it? </joey>
<garnt> That was selling like
anime goods randomly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah, they were
selling like "Initial D" merch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah man, it's so good. </garnt>
<connor> You stop, you get that fat meal, </connor>
<garnt> you grab that coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> you start playing the music on the car, </garnt>
<joey> just literally driving
with the Mount Fuji view, </joey>
<joey> clear as day. </joey>
<joey> Fuck you, Chris. It's great. </joey>
<connor> You can't beat it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we got an insane view
of Fuji during the day, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's the
thing about Japan, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like everything here is so aesthetic. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like even looking
at Mount Fuji, right? </garnt>
<joey> You look at Mount Fuji
and I'm just like, man, </joey>
<joey> God really pat himself on the
back when he made that, man. </joey>
<joey> Like Jesus Christ, like Mount Fuji- </joey>
<joey> - He's like my finest work. </joey>
<joey> - Mount Fuji, like you talk
about Mount Everest or whatever, </joey>
<joey> being like the highest
mountains or something. </joey>
<garnt> Fuji is like the most photogenic mountain. </garnt>
<joey> - It is the most
picturesque mountain. 100%. </joey>
<connor> - It's like the best spot as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's so good, man. </joey>
<joey> And then like everyone's so
nice driving on the expressways </joey>
<connor> and stuff here and like the roads, </connor>
<connor> like it's so chill. </connor>
<joey> - It's pretty hard to find like
an asshole driver in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Everyone's so nice. </connor>
<joey> I was like, no, no, you go ahead. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's really nice. You know? </joey>
<joey> It's super chill driving. </joey>
<connor> It's like driving easy mode
and you get like all the best, </connor>
<connor> it's just great. </connor>
<joey> - Everything's baby mode here, man. </joey>
<connor> - So now Garnt, you've
got to go through the hell </connor>
<garnt> of getting your license changed- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the thing, </connor>
<garnt> like I didn't have a reason to drive </garnt>
<garnt> or to want to drive and now I do. </garnt>
<connor> - And the quicker you get it as well </connor>
<connor> you can get rid of those rookie things </connor>
<garnt> that they have on-
- Rookie things? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, like the stickers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, for the first year
when you get your license, </garnt>
<garnt> even though you've driven
in other countries, </garnt>
<connor> you have to get these rookie stickers </connor>
<connor> on your front and back. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a provisional kind of sticker. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It was a pain having to
remember them all the time, </garnt>
<joey> bringing them along with you. </joey>
<garnt> You're like, "Oh, sorry,
gotta bring my stickers. </garnt>
<garnt> I gotta put them on." </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry I interrupted you, you were saying. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't remember what I was saying, </connor>
<garnt> but I guess the only
thing I remember is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I am not looking forward
to doing more paperwork, </garnt>
<garnt> which is what I'm gonna be
doing a lot of this year. </garnt>
<joey> - Japan is like the never
in cesspool of paperwork. </joey>
<connor> - Get the paperwork done
when it's not stressful. </connor>
<joey> So that when you-
- That doesn't happen. </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- That's a trick question. </joey>
<joey> - If you got shit happening, you're busy, </joey>
<connor> the last thing you want
to do is lose a day. </connor>
<connor> Like if you have the time to lose a day, </connor>
<connor> do it now when you can, right? </connor>
<connor> Like that's why I did it. </connor>
<joey> - Bold of you to assume that
we just have a day to lose. </joey>
<connor> - I don't have a day, but
I had a day where like, </connor>
<joey> it wasn't that bad if I lost it </joey>
<joey> 'cause like you know,
when I eventually move </joey>
<joey> at the end of the year, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be fucking hell.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm not gonna want to lose a day. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's gonna be more than a day, trust me. </garnt>
<connor> - Get it now, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - It's not about losing a day. </connor>
<connor> It's about losing a day to paperwork. </connor>
<connor> - It's never gonna be good
so just fucking do it. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I mean, it's just finding, </connor>
<connor> it's not even the motivation, </connor>
<garnt> but just like every time I wake up, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like maybe today's a
day and today's never the day. </garnt>
<connor> - There's like a Denny's
near the place as well </connor>
<connor> so you should be fine. </connor>
<garnt> There's like a Coco's diner.
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>

<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<joey> - Speaking of leisurely activities, </joey>
<joey> you guys went snowboarding- </joey>
<garnt> - Ages ago.
- Ages ago, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think we talked
about that on the podcast yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think we have, no, it was my- </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I couldn't go to that one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It was my very first
experience snowboarding. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm. How was that? </joey>
<joey> - It was, so obviously I went before, </joey>
<joey> like we remembered that the reason </joey>
<joey> I wanted to try out
snowboarding was purely </joey>
<joey> because of SSX Tricky and
Snowboard Kids on the N64, </joey>
<joey> but yeah, had the choice
between going snowboarding </joey>
<garnt> and going skiing and I'm
just like 100% snowboarding. </garnt>
<joey> - I want that SSX Tricky. </joey>
<garnt> - Because everyone told me
that it's like way harder </garnt>
<connor> to start snowboarding. </connor>
<connor> Like beginners find it easier to ski, </connor>
<joey> but it's like harder to master, </joey>
<joey> whereas snowboarding
is harder to get into, </joey>
<joey> but it's easier to master
from what I've heard. </joey>
<joey> - Roughly.
- I think that's true. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I guess like, </joey>
<joey> so my first experience
snowboarding was that, it was okay, </joey>
<connor> I didn't realize how
much I took for granted </connor>
<connor> friction in my life. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - How so, Garnt, how so?
- How so? </connor>
<connor> - Like I remember the first time, </connor>
<connor> so we got all dressed up. </connor>
<joey> I put on all the kits and everything. </joey>
<joey> Put on the snowboards on
like one shoe or one foot </joey>
<joey> or however you lock yourself in. </joey>
<joey> And then, so my first mission was to walk </joey>
<joey> from where I put my
snowboard on to the ski lift. </joey>
<joey> And I remember trying
to take my first step, </joey>
<garnt> immediately slip, and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a bit of a challenge, innit? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, so you're telling me </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna have to go down a fucking hill </garnt>
<garnt> when I can't even take a single step? </garnt>
<joey> - Because it's the type of movement </joey>
<joey> you'd never do otherwise, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's so unnatural. Right? </joey>
<garnt> And so I fucking waddled my
way over to the ski lift. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you have your snowboard on </connor>
<connor> or is it like you're
carrying your snowboard. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I had my snowboard on, </garnt>
<joey> - I think you had the one boot in, right? </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, you had the one boot in? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I had the one boot in </joey>
<joey> 'cause we walked over to like- </joey>
<joey> - Kind of hobbling like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we walked over
to the beginner ski lift </joey>
<garnt> and I was with Sydney and
Meilyne, and Meilyne's partner </garnt>
<garnt> and- </garnt>
<connor> - Meilyne wasn't having
a good time either. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, Meilyne wasn't
having a good time either. </garnt>
<garnt> So only one of us knew how to snowboard. </garnt>
<garnt> And so only one of us was like
showing us how it was done. </garnt>
<garnt> And Meilyne knows how to ski, </garnt>
<joey> but this was her first
time trying to snowboard </joey>
<joey> either as well. </joey>
<joey> So at least I hadn't like a
fellow novice with me, right? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm not the only one. </joey>
<joey> And so we walked all
over to this ski lift. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> And so to go through the gates, </joey>
<joey> we have to like scan ourselves in, right? </joey>
<joey> And like the problem with
having this big snowboard on you </joey>
<joey> is that once I start like taking a step, </joey>
<garnt> sometimes I don't know how to stop, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So there was this fucking
kid in front of me, right? </garnt>
<garnt> There was this kid,
fucking pro snowboarder, </garnt>
<garnt> like easily goes through the gate. </garnt>
<garnt> I like go through the
gate, take my first step </garnt>
<garnt> and I swear to God, I
almost fall on this kid. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You almost took a kid out? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I almost took out
this fucking five year old </connor>
<connor> in front of me. </connor>
<connor> - Frankly, had it coming. </connor>
<connor> Had it coming. </connor>
<connor> - Luckily Mackey just like grabbed me </connor>
<connor> before I fell on this kid. </connor>
<joey> I was like... </joey>
<joey> At this point I hadn't
even got onto the ski lift. </joey>
<joey> And so- </joey>
<connor> - That's the first step.
- That's the first step. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I think I was on my way </garnt>
<garnt> and I was texting, "How's it going? </garnt>
<joey> How's it going?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "It's hard. </joey>
<joey> It's really hard." </joey>
<connor> - It's hard.
- It's fucking hard. </connor>
<garnt> - It's really... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] And I just saw your head, wee. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, when was that? </garnt>
<joey> - [Meilyne] When you
went down by yourself. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. I tumbled a lot of times. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll get to that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really difficult to
fall face first with skis. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause how the fuck
are you gonna do that? </joey>
<joey> Snowboarding's very easy. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's almost guaranteed you're gonna fall </garnt>
<garnt> face first on a snowboard. </garnt>
<joey> - Carry on, carry on,
tell us about your story. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so, </joey>
<garnt> I waddle my way to the ski lift. </garnt>
<joey> And I've never, obviously
this is my first time </joey>
<joey> on a ski lift. </joey>
<joey> I've never like, I don't know
what the right technique is </joey>
<joey> or like how to like, </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'cause you don't think
about this thing, right? </joey>
<joey> You think, walking, easy. </joey>
<joey> One foot forward, next foot forward. </joey>
<joey> It was like I was a baby </joey>
<joey> trying to figure out how to walk again. </joey>
<joey> So it's taking like
all of my mental energy </joey>
<joey> just to figure out how to stay on two feet </joey>
<joey> and then so the person tells me </joey>
<joey> to like go to this point here </joey>
<garnt> where the ski lift is going
to go and like take you up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just thinking, this is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never like panicked
before trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> how to waddle literally one meter forward. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was pretty bit mean of him </connor>
<joey> to make you get on a fucking
ski lift first thing. </joey>
<joey> You should've just gone,
like walked up the hill </joey>
<connor> a little bit and just tried to go down. </connor>
<connor> - Or at least get on the ski lift </connor>
<garnt> holding your snowboard, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Can you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can do that.
- Yes, you can do that. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, but clearly no one told
you that you could do that. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe (indistinct) was
like nah, trial by fire </garnt>
<garnt> will be the option I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, yeah, I literally
didn't know that was an option. </garnt>
<connor> - Normally, yeah, you are suppose to, </connor>
<joey> with beginners on snowboard, </joey>
<joey> what you make them do is </joey>
<joey> you just kind of make them walk up a hill, </joey>
<joey> like a very, very, like not steep hill. </joey>
<garnt> And just kind of make them
like go down straight, </garnt>
<joey> like horizontal or perpendicular,
sorry, to the slope. </joey>
<joey> But that was very much, wow. Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Mike is like fuck that,
on the ski lift right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was kinda like a
animal looking over the edge </garnt>
<connor> being like, okay, gotta go, gotta go. </connor>
<connor> No, don't want to go. </connor>
<connor> Okay, let's go now. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm like, I say a waddle, </connor>
<joey> this was like me trying
to fucking ice skate over </joey>
<joey> to like one meter ahead of
me and just stay still enough </joey>
<joey> for the ski lift to like
lift my butt up and go up. </joey>
<joey> So managed to do that luckily </joey>
<joey> without any big massive incidents- </joey>
<joey> - But then comes the next step. </joey>
<joey> - But then. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - How do you get down?
- How do you get off it? </joey>
<joey> - I was having a great time. </joey>
<joey> I was like, okay, you know what, </joey>
<joey> this fucking slaps. </joey>
<joey> Look at this view. </joey>
<joey> Look at this, like I'm
having a great fucking time. </joey>
<joey> It's like being on a rollercoaster. </joey>
<joey> You know, when you're going up, </joey>
<joey> and you're just enjoying
the view, it's peaceful. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, okay, I
can get into snowboarding. </joey>
<joey> - I can get into snowboarding.
- I can get into snowboarding </joey>
<joey> This is pretty cool. </joey>
<connor> And then I see where the exit is </connor>
<joey> and it gets closer and closer </joey>
<joey> and then it slowly dawns on me. </joey>
<joey> - How do I get off?
- I need to get off this. </joey>
<joey> - How do I exit this seat </joey>
<joey> that I'm currently sitting on right now? </joey>
<joey> And I see the kid in front of me gets off </joey>
<joey> no problem at all. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, oh, that looks easy. </joey>
<joey> That looks easy. </joey>
<joey> I just, you know, I just use the momentum </joey>
<joey> that the seat is carrying me through </joey>
<joey> and I just get off and
just slide off, right? </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm like shadow boxing, right? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm just like
visualizing this in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, how hard
can this possibly be? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how hard can this possibly be? </garnt>
<connor> - This is like Garnt in the
shower, psyching yourself up. </connor>
<garnt> - I was literally psyching myself up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, sure, I can do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if a five-year-old kid
can do it, then I can do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And so literally the first
thing that happens is </garnt>
<connor> the lift goes up, it starts slowing down. </connor>
<connor> I'm like brilliant. </connor>
<connor> I'm not even gonna need
to do this at full speed. </connor>
<connor> It's going up like- </connor>
<garnt> - They're gonna launch you off. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had no idea. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you just had to
use the momentum to ski off. </garnt>
<garnt> I had no fucking clue. </garnt>
<garnt> But honestly I think I
would have preferred that </garnt>
<garnt> because now I had zero
momentum and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> shit, how do I position my feet? </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> And by the time I get to the
point where I need to get off, </connor>
<connor> I hadn't figured out
how I was gonna do this. </connor>
<connor> So literally the first
thing that happens is </connor>
<connor> I put both feet down. </connor>
<connor> I literally tried to-
- Horizontal? </connor>
<connor> - Huh?
- Horizontal? </connor>
<garnt> - Like that?
- Yeah. Like that. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So I was just like, I was like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - First mistake. </joey>
<joey> - I was like okay, what I'm gonna do </joey>
<joey> is I'm gonna put both feet down, </joey>
<joey> twist and they put one of my foot- </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - On the snowboard and just lightly </joey>
<joey> and just breezily just like slide down. </joey>
<joey> So that, so obviously
that didn't work out. </joey>
<garnt> First, what I did was I
put first two feet down, </garnt>
<garnt> stood up immediate face plant. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because there's
this thing behind you </joey>
<joey> that's pushing you forward </joey>
<joey> so you're just gonna go boop. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you gotta like
shimmy to the side like this, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you gotta shimmy like that </joey>
<joey> and then kind of go down like that. </joey>
<garnt> - It would be nice if
someone was there to teach me </garnt>
<garnt> how it's done. </garnt>
<connor> - I would not have done that to you, </connor>
<garnt> Garnt, if I was there. </garnt>
<garnt> I would have told you how to have done it. </garnt>
<connor> - But, the thing is,
here's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> We apparently went on the
beginner slope, right? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The biggest lie.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> There was no way that this was
the fucking beginning slope. </joey>
<joey> And we found out afterwards
on the second day, </joey>
<joey> 'cause me and Meilyne, </joey>
<joey> we weren't having a great time </joey>
<joey> trying to get down this beginner slope </joey>
<joey> and apparently we found on the next day </joey>
<joey> that there was a slope that was dedicated </joey>
<joey> to like people's first
time trying snowboarding. </joey>
<joey> No, we didn't go on that one. </joey>
<joey> We went on the fucking beginner slope, </joey>
<garnt> which was people who had
already been experienced enough </garnt>
<garnt> to go down hills.
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so it was me
Meilyne, Sydney, and Mackey </garnt>
<joey> at the top of this hill. </joey>
<joey> Mackey just fucking bolts
it down already. Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- He was screaming at us. </joey>
<garnt> "You guys are cowards!" </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yo, that guy was really fucking funny. </connor>
<connor> He was getting like
legitimately frustrated </connor>
<garnt> they were like bad.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Just get good, just get good. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, "What do you mean? </joey>
<connor> Just go down, just go down. </connor>
<connor> Just go straight. </connor>
<connor> It's not hard." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And a Mackey goes down first </garnt>
<garnt> and tries to like go the
rest of us into going down. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, you know what guys? </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna go. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna do a pro gamer move
and I'm just gonna go down. </joey>
<joey> Immediately start tumbling fucking down. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Like I must have like front flipped </garnt>
<connor> five fucking times going down- </connor>
<connor> - Sounds like fucking "Looney Tunes." </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, ah, damn, </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind, I thought snow
is gonna cushion the fall. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, man,
this hurts way more </garnt>
<connor> than I thought it was going to do. </connor>
<garnt> - It does cushion but like 30%. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Because all of the snow
that you're snowboarding on </connor>
<joey> has been like plowed so it's compacted. </joey>
<joey> - Like jumping off your bed
onto a very flat pillow. </joey>
<garnt> It's like it'll cushion
you, but to what extent? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just like, I had
this image in my mind </connor>
<connor> that it's just like oh- </connor>
<joey> - I'm just gonna tumble in! </joey>
<joey> - It's just like falling on clouds. </joey>
<joey> And I remember, because of that, </joey>
<joey> like when I first went down, </joey>
<joey> I did not hold back as well. </joey>
<joey> I just like fucking went as fast as I can </joey>
<joey> not realizing that-
- Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - Not realizing that I
didn't know how to break. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And so quickly I kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> before I learned how to break, </garnt>
<garnt> I quickly realized that
the easiest way to break </garnt>
<garnt> was just the fall down. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I mean, that's what they
teach you at first, right? </connor>
<connor> Is like to fall down probably. </connor>
<connor> - There's a reason why
like if you start young, </connor>
<joey> particularly in skiing and snowboarding, </joey>
<joey> you're going to be really fucking like, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be so much
better than somebody </joey>
<joey> who learned later on just
because like when you're a kid </joey>
<joey> you're fearless.
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Kids don't fucking know danger. </joey>
<joey> - No.
- When I was a kid, </joey>
<joey> I was going way too fast </joey>
<joey> and I would just go straight down </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was fucking stupid
and that's what like, </joey>
<joey> I was just like, this is fun. </joey>
<joey> I love going like 100 miles per hour. </joey>
<joey> This is a good idea.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's how people die. </joey>
<joey> - There's no danger here. </joey>
<joey> But when you're an adult
it's a little harder, </joey>
<joey> like yeah, because you fall over once </joey>
<connor> and you're like, holy shit, this hurts! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm not doing
that again. Fuck that! </joey>
<joey> - And so Meilyne and Sydney see me </joey>
<joey> fucking tumbling down this hill. </joey>
<joey> And then I look up and Mackey's like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, your turn now." </joey>
<joey> And they're just like, "No. </joey>
<joey> No, I don't think I will." </joey>
<joey> And so they start like
getting on their butts </joey>
<joey> and just like-
- Sliding down. </joey>
<joey> - And just like slowly sliding down </joey>
<joey> and Mackey's like, "No, come on guys, </joey>
<connor> come on, get up!
- Just be good! </connor>
<garnt> Not just slide. </garnt>
<joey> - Obviously 'cause I learned
young and I was very fortunate, </joey>
<joey> very lucky, very privileged
to be able to learn </joey>
<joey> how to ski and snowboard at a young age. </joey>
<joey> The one thing that kind of like, </joey>
<joey> I don't mind doing it </joey>
<joey> because I'd rather go
with my friends than not </joey>
<joey> but like it does suck having
to wait like 30, 40 minutes. </joey>
<connor> You go down a slope, it
takes you 30 seconds, </connor>
<connor> you gotta wait 40 minutes for
your friends to come down. </connor>
<connor> And then you're like, "Right. </connor>
<connor> Let's go on the beginner one, again. </connor>
<connor> Let's do it again." </connor>
<joey> - So Meilyne and Sydney </joey>
<joey> are literally psyching
themselves up on this hill </joey>
<garnt> for like a good, like
40 minutes to an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, Meilyne? </garnt>
<garnt> They were on this beginner hill. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like this. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was imaging like. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, it was like that like that, </garnt>
<joey> - Oh fuck off, no it wasn't. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It might have felt like that, </garnt>
<joey> but it was probably like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, al I knew was that
I stood up for a second </garnt>
<connor> and I started going way faster
than I was comfortable with. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That's called a hill. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause at the
ski resort we were at, </joey>
<joey> one of the, like the black diamond, </joey>
<joey> one of them was like only 30 degrees. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's not even that bad. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it wasn't, which is like. </joey>
<joey> - Which is like that. </joey>
<joey> - It's like nothing. </joey>
<joey> - So realistically, it was
probably like five degrees. </joey>
<connor> - It was, okay, I get it. </connor>
<connor> Because you can go pretty fast. </connor>
<joey> - It feels like, </joey>
<joey> especially when you're not used to that. </joey>
<connor> - When you can see the bottom, </connor>
<connor> it looks way worse than it is. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 100%, 100%. </joey>
<joey> - Anyway, go on.
- I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Well, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt. </joey>
<joey> - It was the first time
for you so I get it. </joey>
<garnt> - The beginning of the
hill was like quite steep, </garnt>
<garnt> but then you go around to the middle part, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the actual, </garnt>
<garnt> which I feel was the actual
beginner slope, right? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause this hill obviously
wasn't even in like, </connor>
<connor> what's the word I'm looking for? </connor>
<connor> - Altitude?
- Slope. </connor>
<joey> - Slope angle. </joey>
<joey> - Gradient, gradient. </joey>
<joey> That's it, it wasn't equal in gradient. </joey>
<garnt> So the best part to learn
on this beginner hill </garnt>
<garnt> was like right in like
the middle of this course. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, is this the part where he went </connor>
<connor> like in like around like that, </connor>
<connor> like did like a loop de loop. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So the best part to learn was
actually in the middle part, </garnt>
<connor> which is how I learned how
to like control my speed- </connor>
<connor> - And turn? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and turn because
going down this hill </connor>
<connor> for the first time I had two
speeds, it was go and tumble. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> That was the two speeds that I had. </connor>
<joey> So, while waiting for Sydney and Meilyne </joey>
<joey> went on YouTube and started
like looking at some tutorials. </joey>
<connor> - How to snowboard. </connor>
<joey> - On the slope. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, on the slope of how to snowboard. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanted to be that guy
who like slides past you </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, what's this guy doing? </joey>
<joey> Oh, oh. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because the thing about Mackey </garnt>
<garnt> is that he's a good snowboarder, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't think he knows how
to explain how to snowboard. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I was asking Mackey , </connor>
<connor> "Mackey , What's the like
the right technique?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he's very much
like, "Oh, just do it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Just go, just go. </connor>
<joey> - He's very much, "Oh you just
go like this and like this, </joey>
<joey> and then you just..." </joey>
<joey> You know that clip of like
that Australian surfer </joey>
<joey> or not Australia, but just that surfer </joey>
<garnt> who's just like, and it goes
(imitates engine roaring), </garnt>
<joey> (Joey speaking indistinctly) </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, that's kind of why I heard, </garnt>
<joey> when Mackey was trying to
explain to me how to snowboard. </joey>
<joey> It was just like, "Oh,
you just go like this </joey>
<joey> and then you turn like this </joey>
<joey> and then you control
your speed like this." </joey>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Mackey ,
you're just like showing me </garnt>
<garnt> like different angles here. </garnt>
<garnt> This means nothing to me" </garnt>
<connor> - It sucks 'cause it's
like you have to learn </connor>
<connor> to like put your body in the place </connor>
<connor> where your body doesn't
want to naturally be. </connor>
<joey> - Right, because you have
to put all your weight </joey>
<connor> in your front foot, </connor>
<connor> which means you're gonna
be leaning into the hill. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you lean into it
which you don't wanna do. </connor>
<joey> - Just naturally, you don't do that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then you
gotta like throw your body </connor>
<joey> from side to side with your back leg </joey>
<joey> and it's like- </joey>
<joey> - It is a weird move. </joey>
<joey> - If you haven't done it before,
it feels really unnatural, </joey>
<connor> like initially 'cause it's like whoa. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's why the first time, </joey>
<joey> like after you finished the next day, </joey>
<garnt> oh, you fucking feel that </garnt>
<garnt> because you're using all these muscles </garnt>
<joey> you've never used before. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we actually had
the snowboarding trip </garnt>
<garnt> for like two days, but
I could only go one day. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the second day
you're fucked, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I had never felt
more fucked in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, I feel that, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - On this like beginner slope, </connor>
<connor> I don't know which fucking
sick fuck decided to do this, </connor>
<connor> but I was like, that's
funny, but also my God. </connor>
<garnt> On this beginner slope, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like this very narrow kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a hill going down, like winding. </garnt>
<garnt> Right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And at the bottom of
this wind, the exit to it </garnt>
<garnt> someone had put poles like a big X, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was open, right? </garnt>
<joey> So you could go on it, </joey>
<joey> but the only way that you
could avoid these poles </joey>
<joey> was to jump over them in the middle. </joey>
<joey> - Or go under them, right? </joey>
<joey> - Or go under them, which
you weren't gonna do </joey>
<joey> 'cause the gap to jump over was
like this, which isn't much, </joey>
<connor> but when you're a beginner or
even if you're experienced- </connor>
<joey> - Your board is not coming off the snow. </joey>
<connor> - It's hard to get, if
you're not experienced </connor>
<joey> doing any kind of jump on a snowboard, </joey>
<joey> lifting your board up for a
considerable amount of time </joey>
<joey> is unnatural and hard to do.
- They're heavy as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's heavy. It's like this, right? </garnt>
<joey> So there's no way you'll
get, maybe like this, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Off the ground. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, all right,
"Just jump over it, Garnt." </garnt>
<joey> So I went, I jumped over it </joey>
<joey> and my board like just
clipped it a little bit. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh shit. </joey>
<joey> I turn around, Garnt fucking jumps, </joey>
<joey> just fucking jumps. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Face plants. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like I knew it was gonna happen, </garnt>
<joey> but it was funny. </joey>
<garnt> - This late in the day. </garnt>
<connor> When I was like, I was like starting- </connor>
<connor> - He was getting the hang of it. </connor>
<connor> - I was like starting to
get the feel of this right? </connor>
<connor> And you know, I went with
the philosophy of just like, </connor>
<joey> I'm just gonna fall down </joey>
<joey> and hopefully I'll learn something new </joey>
<joey> every time I fall down. </joey>
<joey> - Trial by fire, right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like there's only so many
ways you can fall down </joey>
<joey> before you figure out a way
to not fall down, right? </joey>
<joey> - Of course.
- And so I remember seeing, </joey>
<joey> like I remember seeing these crosses </joey>
<joey> in the middle of like this course </joey>
<joey> that I was going down with Connor. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I fell down before </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Connor, what do we do? </joey>
<joey> Why do they have these here?" </joey>
<joey> - What is this?
- Yeah, what is this? </joey>
<joey> - And they're like, "I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Just fucking jump over
or go under it, right?" </joey>
<joey> - Just jump over. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like there were two options. </joey>
<joey> You can either like jump over it </joey>
<garnt> or you can like crouch super
low and just go under it. </garnt>
<connor> Right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It was it's like, you
couldn't really crouch under. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You'd have to like
lift them up and stop. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why they were there. </joey>
<joey> No one explained why they were there. </joey>
<joey> that they shouldn't have been
there, I'm not really sure. </joey>
<joey> - I guess someone just
forgot to put it away. </joey>
<connor> - I think so, it was pretty weird, </connor>
<connor> but I was like sick, free jump test. </connor>
<garnt> Let's do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was like, by the time
me and Connor were going down, </garnt>
<garnt> I was getting confident with myself. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like going a bit
faster than I was before. </garnt>
<joey> You know, just limit testing myself. </joey>
<joey> And just as I did like
this fucking sick turn, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Fuck yes." </joey>
<joey> - It was a pretty good
turn, it was a good turn. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I did I think the first clean turn </joey>
<joey> of my trip down front. </joey>
<joey> - Going front to like back. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and like I
heard Connor being like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh dude, fuck yeah, that was clean." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Fuck yeah." </joey>
<joey> And then I see this X coming up, </joey>
<joey> this pole coming up and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, pro gamer time. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna attempt a pro gamer move. </joey>
<joey> - Let me unlock 100%
of my brain right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I saw Connor do
it and I just had to, </joey>
<joey> I saw Connor do it and I was
just like you know that scene </joey>
<joey> in the "Matrix" where
Morpheus just goes back to Neo </joey>
<garnt> and is just like, "All you
need to do is believe." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's the jump test. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, "Oh, okay,
Morpheus. I can do this." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Then I get close, </joey>
<connor> like immediately realize
I've jumped way too late. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He just jumped into it. </connor>
<connor> - Instead of like even jumping over it. </connor>
<connor> I just fucking jumped straight into it. </connor>
<connor> - Just face-planted, it was so good. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I was basically
just following Garnt </garnt>
<garnt> with my face backwards, </garnt>
<joey> he must've been so creeped out. </joey>
<joey> I was just like going backwards </joey>
<joey> down the slope like this watching him. </joey>
<joey> Just checking, make
sure what he was doing. </joey>
<joey> And then actually watched him go into it. </joey>
<joey> It was so fucking funny.
- Oh, man. </joey>
<joey> - I got Mackey back. </joey>
<garnt> I took Mackey down like this
slope that was ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh, 'cause they
all stopped and Meilyne quit. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "All right,
Mackey , let's go down." </connor>
<garnt> - For the record, Meilyne and Sydney quit </garnt>
<joey> 'cause they're weak. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] You were
the first one to quit. </joey>
<garnt> - No! Meilyne, no I wasn't! </garnt>
<connor> - Meilyne came back the second day </connor>
<connor> and was like, "I'm returning, guys." </connor>
<garnt> It was like "Lord of the Rings." </garnt>
<garnt> He came back finally. </garnt>
<garnt> Meilyne did like one slope and was like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm done, guys." </connor>
<garnt> And then left. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, 'cause Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> she also had the choice to
snowboard or ski, right? </garnt>
<connor> And after about like one attempt </connor>
<garnt> going down this beginning
of slope on the snowboard, </garnt>
<garnt> she quits and just tries skiing again. </garnt>
<connor> - And then quit 'cause she was shit at it. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause she couldn't do it. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Skiing is easy, right guys? </joey>
<connor> - She was like, "I know how to do it." </connor>
<connor> Couldn't do it. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I just
don't have the strength. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, that's what they
say, that's what they all say. </connor>
<garnt> - So you couldn't do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - If only you had the skis
that first time around. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yeah, I can do it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, easy.
- I'm just holding back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I didn't wanna show off, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then Meilyne came back the next day </joey>
<joey> and was like guys, </joey>
<joey> 'cause she only did like
two slopes on the first day. </joey>
<joey> She was like, "All right,
I'm gonna come back </joey>
<joey> and do snowboarding again. </joey>
<joey> I'm ready to try it. </joey>
<joey> I can do it. </joey>
<joey> Did like one thing and then gave up. </joey>
<connor> But at least she did
try again a second time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- So I was impressed. </connor>
<garnt> - I did try again the second day actually </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember so I went
like all out on the first day. </garnt>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I remember I didn't- </connor>
<joey> - You were fucked. </joey>
<connor> - I was fucked. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize how tired I was </connor>
<connor> because we went down the
slope like a bunch of times. </connor>
<connor> I was there all day.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Took a lot of tumbles on the first day. </connor>
<joey> - As you do. </joey>
<joey> - And I was so ready for the second day </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm just like, by
the end of the first day, </joey>
<joey> I was just at the point </joey>
<joey> when I was getting the hang of it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I was like, fuck
yes, day two. Let's go. </joey>
<joey> I opened my eyes on day two </joey>
<joey> and I felt like I fucking
got punched by Mike Tyson </joey>
<garnt> or something like that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I didn't realize
that the thing that hurt </garnt>
<garnt> the most was my neck.
- Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you've been
hitting your neck a bunch. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - From the whiplash probably. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I didn't realize
that whiplash was a thing </joey>
<joey> when you tumble that much </joey>
<garnt> but now I know that whiplash
is definitely a thing. </garnt>
<connor> - You should have got a helmet as well. </connor>
<connor> They didn't give you one. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you weren't wearing helmets? </connor>
<garnt> - They didn't give him
one for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. that's fucking dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ.
- They didn't give us helmets </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, when I saw them without helmets, </connor>
<connor> I was like, this is a terrible idea. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I could go a whole day without a helmet, </connor>
<connor> but like if I was doing like hard stuff, </connor>
<connor> I would be very like, I would not go down </connor>
<connor> the hard ones that I went down. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if I went again, </joey>
<connor> 'cause last time I went
snowboarding was like fuck, </connor>
<connor> like six years ago, I would
definitely get a helmet </connor>
<connor> just 'cause like my body's not used to it. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't really give a shit </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was with these guys
on like the green slopes </joey>
<joey> and blue slopes and I was
like, ah, fuck it, it's fine. </joey>
<joey> But then like if I went down, like I took- </joey>
<joey> - If you went down to
like a black diamond- </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, so I took
Mackey down a black diamond. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> So everyone had left
and then it was Mackey </joey>
<joey> was the one calling them a coward. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, it's time. </connor>
<connor> Let's go and it's going to do a real one." </connor>
<connor> And there's a double black
diamond, which I wanted to do. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] To clarify like black diamond </joey>
<joey> is like the hardest type of course. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] It's just
like double black diamond </connor>
<joey> was just like the most extreme. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And I couldn't convince </joey>
<connor> him to do that 'cause I
think he was like, "Oh, no, </connor>
<connor> I'm good, but I'm not like that." </connor>
<connor> I was like, all right, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I love how something about snowboarding </joey>
<garnt> just just turns every guy into a dude bro. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like I can just imagine like
when Garnt did that clean turn </joey>
<joey> and Connor was like, "Yo!" </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was proud. </garnt>
<joey> - Like what is it about it
that turns you into a lad? </joey>
<connor> - Because you want your boys to enjoy it </connor>
<joey> so that you can come back again. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like when I'm bringing my friends, </joey>
<joey> my biggest worry is that they will hate it </joey>
<joey> from falling over too much </joey>
<joey> and they don't want to do it again. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because then I'm like I
can't bring my friends again. </joey>
<joey> Like, we can't go to the Alps. You know? </joey>
<joey> We can't go to Italy, drink espressos, </joey>
<joey> then hit the slopes. </joey>
<joey> Have a few bevies in
Germany and hit the alps. </joey>
<joey> You know? That's what I want to do. </joey>
<joey> So and then I was like,
"Yeah, it's just the boys now. </joey>
<joey> Its just me and Mackey. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna take him down a black." </joey>
<joey> And so I found one that, </joey>
<joey> he definitely didn't want to do it. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Come on, let's do it. </connor>
<connor> Come on. I'll be fine. I'll be fine." </connor>
<joey> - Knowing Mackey he can't say no, right? </joey>
<connor> - He was like, "Ah." </connor>
<connor> He's like, "I wanted to do a harder slope, </connor>
<joey> but like not this hard." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, it'll
be fine, it'll be fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Literally like this slope, </joey>
<joey> you can't see the bottom of it. </joey>
<joey> Like you can't see over it
until you start going down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's like that steep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then when I started going on it, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, I think this is closed." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Because it hadn't been treated at all. </joey>
<joey> It was like all ice, it was
all steep ice, like crevices. </joey>
<joey> And like it was so steep </joey>
<joey> that when you'd go off a little bit, </joey>
<joey> you would just fall and
hit like a crevice, ice. </joey>
<joey> It took all my fucking
energy to get down this thing </joey>
<joey> without falling over. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's fucking terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - I was absolutely exhausted. </joey>
<garnt> I don't really get tired when
I go on like blue or red ones </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't really have
to use that much work. </garnt>
<garnt> I can kind of be lazy, but
on the really tough ones, </garnt>
<garnt> the amount you're turning, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to constantly
turn and throw your body </garnt>
<joey> where the board is like, no, no, no, </joey>
<joey> we can't turn on this, it's too steep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You have to force it </joey>
<joey> otherwise you're going too fast. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like knackered </joey>
<joey> and then I look up and I see Mackie just, </joey>
<joey> he gets up, fucking like
falls over, gets up, </joey>
<garnt> falls over, gets up, falls over. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh my God,
Meilyne's gonna fucking kill me." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] I was lucky
you didn't have the GPS on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Meilyne thought
I liked killed him. </garnt>
<garnt> She was like, "Oh my God, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor's gonna kill him." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause that was
on the second day, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, second day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause like we
went our separate ways </connor>
<connor> on the second day </connor>
<connor> because I woke up, felt
like everything was aching. </connor>
<joey> Everything felt like shit. </joey>
<joey> But I was just like,
no, I'ma gonna still go. </joey>
<joey> - You're still pumped, right? </joey>
<joey> - I'm still pumped </joey>
<joey> because I really, really
wanted a second day. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, oh, easily,
fight through the pain. </joey>
<joey> What? It is just a bit
of muscle ache, right? </joey>
<connor> You can get through a bit of muscle ache. </connor>
<connor> So these guys go off to like
a completely different course. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's like two
sides of the mountain. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there was like
two sides of the mountain </connor>
<connor> so these guys go on a
completely different course </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, great. </connor>
<joey> I'll just be left to my own devices </joey>
<joey> and by the end of this day, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to conquer this beginner hill. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> Because I felt like- </joey>
<garnt> - Lift too. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So Sydney had given up by then </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone else was on this other hill. </garnt>
<garnt> And on the second day it was
actually like almost empty </garnt>
<garnt> compared to the first day
'cause the first day was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think like, it was
like a Sunday, wasn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Or like a Saturday? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it must've been. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like a public holiday I think. </garnt>
<garnt> And the second day wasn't a public holiday </garnt>
<garnt> so like the slopes were like almost empty. </garnt>
<connor> - It was like perfect conditions as well, </connor>
<garnt> there's like a shit ton of snow
and it was perfectly clear. </garnt>
<garnt> Sun was out. It was like, perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nice, nice.
- So that was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I get up to the beginners
slope on the second day, </garnt>
<connor> everything aching as fuck. </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, it's fine. </joey>
<joey> All I need to do is like tumble once </joey>
<joey> and I'll just like fight
through the pain and you know, </joey>
<joey> get it over with. </joey>
<joey> So like I go down, right? </joey>
<joey> I start going down this beginner hill, </joey>
<joey> get further than I did yesterday- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's good. </joey>
<joey> - I gotten more used to it </joey>
<joey> and then I tumble and
I was like, all right. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you know, I expect this, </joey>
<joey> but like I tumbled and I landed
with my head like downhill. </joey>
<joey> So like I was like downhill like this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right? </joey>
<garnt> And then I quickly realized, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, how do I get up? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<joey> Cause my neck, </joey>
<joey> my neck muscles were not
working at that point </joey>
<joey> so I could not lift my
neck to go like that. </joey>
<joey> I was not only like, </joey>
<joey> I was lifting it not only like, you know, </joey>
<joey> even when I was like perfectly flat, </joey>
<joey> it was hard enough to lift my neck up. </joey>
<joey> No, I was going against the hill as well, </joey>
<connor> to lift my neck up. </connor>
<garnt> So I quickly realized I
couldn't lift my neck up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I quickly realized how heavy </garnt>
<garnt> my gear that I was wearing was. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause what I would
do is just, if I'm face down, </connor>
<connor> I just bring my board,
I do like a flip back. </connor>
<joey> - You can do a flip, but
you can also kind of just </joey>
<connor> like around turn your body around </connor>
<joey> like shimmy your way around. </joey>
<joey> - If you wanna be faster, </joey>
<joey> you can just fucking throw your legs </joey>
<garnt> and just stamp it into the snow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I did not have enough
ab strength at that time </garnt>
<joey> to like lift my board up, </joey>
<joey> that's how much like how much
like my everything was achy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>

<joey> at manscape.com. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't forget that you
came from your dad's balls. </garnt>
<joey> This is on script, everyone. </joey>
<joey> - I was the best load my dad ever shot. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Back to the fucking video. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of realized quickly I
was in a little bit of a pickle </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> how I was going to get up
with all this heavy gear. </garnt>
<joey> So what I tried doing is
just like slowly shimming, </joey>
<joey> what was I-
- Shimming. </joey>
<joey> - Shimming my body to be like horizontal </joey>
<joey> or something where I could get up. </joey>
<joey> That took ages. </joey>
<connor> I must've been there for
like 40 minutes, right? </connor>
<connor> - No one helped you? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, that's the point. </connor>
<connor> I was there for like a good 20 minutes. </connor>
<garnt> And I'd gotten around like
I'd say about 20 degrees. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - If I saw someone upside down, </joey>
<joey> I would go over and be
like, "Yo, you good? </joey>
<connor> Homie, you good?" </connor>
<joey> - So after about 20 degrees, </joey>
<garnt> like someone skis down
and says, "Are you okay? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you need any help?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like (panting) </garnt>
<joey> "No, I'm okay. I think I got this." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So he goes, "Okay." </joey>
<joey> And he offers me a hand
and so I get up and I, </joey>
<joey> you know, he helps me sit back up </joey>
<joey> and so I sit back up and he goes back over </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, okay, I got this. </joey>
<joey> I try shimming a bit more, slip, </joey>
<joey> like my body slips a bit and
I'm like back on my back. </joey>
<joey> Right?
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I had never known
how it felt to be like, </joey>
<joey> you know, when you see like
a tortoise on their back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah..
- And they can't get back up. </joey>
<joey> That's exactly how I felt. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - One with nature, man. </joey>
<joey> - And so I find after another 20 minutes, </joey>
<joey> I finally get to the point where my feet </joey>
<joey> is like I'm feet first downhill </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like fuck this. </joey>
<joey> I take off the snowboard and I walk. </joey>
<connor> I walked the rest of the way down. </connor>
<garnt> I am not going through
that experience again. </garnt>
<connor> - I will do whatever it takes
to not take the board off. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, I will do- </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, that's what I thought, </connor>
<garnt> but I'm just like, it took
me literally 40 minutes. </garnt>
<connor> - I just hate admitting defeat
and taking my board off. </connor>
<joey> - There's nothing sadder
than just like walking down </joey>
<connor> while everyone's just (imitates
swooshing) past you, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It was a depressing day. </connor>
<connor> - But if you have to do
it, you have to do it. </connor>
<connor> - It's crazy like everyone
snowboards in Japan. </connor>
<joey> It's really weird. </joey>
<joey> In Europe, everyone skies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Japan.... </joey>
<joey> Yeah, for some reason- </joey>
<connor> - And no one was helmets. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - No one wears helmets. </connor>
<joey> - It's scary.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the rental place
didn't even offer it. </joey>
<joey> - No, that's I- </joey>
<joey> - It's like an option you have to ask for. </joey>
<joey> - It's nuts and I was like,
"You don't offer helmets?" </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I got like the rental pack, </garnt>
<joey> which was apparently like
the all-inclusive pack. </joey>
<joey> And they just, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Clearly not all inclusive, is it? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like a beginner, you know, </garnt>
<joey> even like professionals wear helmets, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- You never know </joey>
<joey> what could happen, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause fucking, what was it? </joey>
<joey> Michael Schumacher fell
and hit a rock, didn't he? </joey>
<joey> And then he's in a
vegetative state now I think. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Is he? </garnt>
<garnt> - And he was a really experienced skier. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, he just hit a rock. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess nobody told me </connor>
<connor> and I wish I... </connor>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I turned up and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh God, they don't have helmets." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Scary.
- I mean, </joey>
<joey> I wish I had worn a helmet </joey>
<joey> so I could go the second
day without feeling like- </joey>
<connor> - It would help with your neck as well, </connor>
<connor> because you wouldn't be like- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I wouldn't be like fucking. </garnt>
<joey> - Would it or would it just be </joey>
<connor> like extra weight on your head? </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Oh, God!" </connor>
<connor> - No, 'cause I feel
like that extra distance </connor>
<joey> you go that the helmet cushions. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's true, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely helps.
- Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - Also though, dude, skiing </joey>
<connor> and then being able to
get like a fat ramen </connor>
<connor> or a curry, oh damn, that's good. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, like that onsen you go to </joey>
<connor> after a full day of snowboarding </connor>
<connor> is the best fucking feeling. </connor>
<joey> It is the best sleep you'll have. </joey>
<joey> - Onsen in this place,
was just like a view </joey>
<garnt> of just like the ski slopes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was like an outdoor onsen </garnt>
<connor> where you just viewed the mountains. </connor>
<connor> - And they like
refurbished it all as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, you could feel
like the snow coming down. </garnt>
<garnt> Take me back, man. Take me back. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, hopefully I'll be able
to join you guys this year. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Hell yeah. Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> Dude, I want to ski so
God damn much this season </connor>
<connor> because I haven't done nearly as much </connor>
<connor> as I wanted to when I came here. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Fucking dude, again, </connor>
<connor> like I haven't gone snowboarding or skiing </connor>
<joey> in like five years.
- Yeah and it's suppose to be </joey>
<connor> like some of the best skiing
in the world in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Some of the slopes I walked
on is fucking insane. </joey>
<garnt> - I would just want an experience </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm not on my ass for
literally 90% of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> That would be a cool
experience for me, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, also just after
you're all like sore, you know, </connor>
<joey> you all go the onsen
then you go for the meal </joey>
<joey> and you get a bunch of beers. </joey>
<joey> Oh, it's so good, dude.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - The after ski beer or
snowboarding is just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 100%.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how long did it take
you to learn snowboarding? </garnt>
<joey> - So I always did skiing's
'cause my parents took me. </joey>
<joey> They do like the whole package holidays. </joey>
<joey> I fucking hated skiing, </joey>
<joey> because you'd ski in
like groups with like, </joey>
<joey> we'd go to like Bulgaria
where it's like dirt cheap </joey>
<joey> to like do it and you'd
have to be in a group </joey>
<joey> of other families. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't really enjoy it </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like the rebellious kid </joey>
<joey> so I wanted to do my own thing, </joey>
<joey> but you have to like go
and like follow along </joey>
<connor> and so I'd say it took me like, </connor>
<connor> before I got like good enough
to go on any slope skiing, </connor>
<connor> it was like three weeks. </connor>
<connor> And then I taught myself how to snowboard. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because once you've
gotten the grasp of skiing, </joey>
<joey> it's very easy to kind of, </joey>
<connor> because you're already used
to the lack of friction- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was still really difficult. </connor>
<joey> - It's still hard, it's still hard. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it like didn't
make sense in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing can prepare you for
just how snowboarding works, </garnt>
<garnt> because it really goes against everything </garnt>
<garnt> your mind has trained you for. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, especially the
difference between like skiing </joey>
<garnt> and snowboarding, right? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like in skiing it's like, </joey>
<garnt> if you're facing down the hill, </garnt>
<garnt> then you're gonna go and if you're not, </garnt>
<garnt> then you've stopped. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the literal opposite
with snowboarding, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You need to be facing the side
to go and this way you stop. </garnt>
<connor> - But you know, the thing
that made me want to change </connor>
<connor> really badly was that I, </connor>
<joey> I'm sure anyone who skis will know this, </joey>
<joey> that the shoes are just fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Ugh, the worst, the worst. </joey>
<joey> Concrete blocks on your feet. </joey>
<joey> - You know, 'cause we were doing like, </joey>
<joey> I'm really very grateful that my parents </joey>
<joey> took me on these like, </joey>
<joey> they were like the cheapest
skiing holidays you could get </joey>
<connor> so we often stayed really,
really far away from the places </connor>
<garnt> and you'd have to put your ski shoes on- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of look like clown shoes. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so you put these
shoes on like 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> before you'd like, 10
minute walk from the bus. </connor>
<joey> So you have to walk. </joey>
<joey> I'm like 13 with my skis. </joey>
<joey> I'm not that strong yet. </joey>
<joey> Walking 10 minutes with my
skis in these horrible things, </joey>
<joey> click, clop, click, and
then have to wait on the bus </joey>
<joey> for 20 minutes and you have to walk </joey>
<joey> another like five minutes
and it's just like, </joey>
<joey> I hated it. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I hate these shoes so god damn much. </joey>
<connor> It's so painful wearing them. </connor>
<connor> Everything about these suck. </connor>
<joey> - They absolutely destroy your ankles. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I was like,
I don't care what it takes. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna learn to
snowboard for those God, </connor>
<joey> 'cause you just get boots. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the first time I was
snowboarding boots, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I can walk normally!" </joey>
<joey> - When you're at the restaurant, you know, </joey>
<joey> you see these people with their trays </joey>
<joey> like clopping with their
skis with their food on it, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like move out the way. </joey>
<joey> Chad snowboarder boots here. </joey>
<joey> - Runs past! </joey>
<joey> - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, don't
mind me, just getting a beer, </joey>
<joey> I'll take that, thank you very much. </joey>
<joey> Its like you just get so much more freedom </joey>
<joey> and it's so much chiller,
like I don't know. </joey>
<joey> You haven't got poles to carry, </joey>
<joey> and so that's why I wanted to learn it. </joey>
<joey> I fucking sucked. </joey>
<joey> First three days, I
just kept falling over. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, same. </joey>
<joey> - Me and my little brother
did it at the same time </joey>
<garnt> and my little brother sprained
his ankle like first day. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, no, I'm determined. </joey>
<joey> I'd say snowboarding the
first week that I did it, </joey>
<joey> I was pretty shit. </joey>
<garnt> I could go down a black slope by the end, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was doing it really badly. </garnt>
<joey> I was just like going like
this, you know, really slowly, </joey>
<joey> but like I went down it. </joey>
<joey> And then I'd say it took me like maybe two </joey>
<joey> or three more weeks before I felt like </joey>
<joey> I was actually doing it good. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm.
- Yeah, I was self taught. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean it's just
about like, you know, </joey>
<connor> just getting your body used
to those weird movements that- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and going fast, speed.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But also it's just like just, </garnt>
<garnt> you just have to commit to some of these. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you just have to be like, </garnt>
<joey> I know this is not what
I'm supposed to do, </joey>
<joey> but I have to do this.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's scary, dude. </joey>
<joey> Like leaning forward on a hill, </joey>
<garnt> like you're not built for that. </garnt>
<joey> Your brain's not built to do that. </joey>
<joey> - Your brain's not built to be like, </joey>
<connor> you know this thing
you're going down fast? </connor>
<connor> You gotta lean forward.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Into the danger. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I always felt when I was skiing, </garnt>
<garnt> when you go fast, when you're skiing, </garnt>
<joey> I almost feel like it's like
safer than going slower. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, weirdly- </joey>
<joey> - It felt safer because like the way that, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how it worked, </joey>
<joey> but when I was going snowboarding, </joey>
<joey> when I started getting speed, </joey>
<joey> it did not feel like secure at all. </joey>
<joey> It's wobbling and anything
that hits the board underneath, </joey>
<joey> you feel it a fuck ton when
you're going really fast. </joey>
<joey> It is fucking terrifying.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if you tumble when
you're going like really fast. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just fucking
tumbling all over the place. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, it's like some "Looney Tunes" shit. </connor>
<garnt> - And also like tumbling with
just these massive things </garnt>
<garnt> on your feet, it never
feels natural, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like having two concrete bricks, </garnt>
<joey> just like glued to your feet. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the green army man, right? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Just kind of learn, just of like do this </joey>
<garnt> and then hopefully you fall good. </garnt>
<garnt> Just don't put your hands out. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the hardest part is learning. </garnt>
<garnt> When you fall naturally, you
want to put your hands out, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's when you sprain your ankles, </garnt>
<joey> not ankles, your wrists.
- Your wrists. </joey>
<joey> - You can get like the wrist guards, </joey>
<connor> but they don't help that much. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, what I got taught, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I got taught by like
a professional snowboarder. </connor>
<joey> and he said like, "When you fall, </joey>
<connor> like you have to fall with your fists, </connor>
<connor> 'cause If you fall like
this it goes back." </connor>
<garnt> - Just don't do that.
- He did that </garnt>
<connor> and broke both of his
wrists at the same time. </connor>
<connor> So he's like, "Don't do
that, that shit hurts. </connor>
<joey> I can tell you firsthand." </joey>
<joey> - I just put my arms like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you just fucking
do this then you're good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Just don't fall. </joey>
<joey> - Just get good, right?
- Why would I fall? </joey>
<joey> - No, literally what I
found from snowboarding </joey>
<joey> is that it's literally the
get good of sports, right? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - If you're being taught by Mackey, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just don't be a pussy and just get good. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like when I
started getting used to it, </garnt>
<garnt> there was nothing that
could prepare my mind </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know, I watch YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> When I watched the YouTube tutorials, </garnt>
<connor> I tried to follow what they were saying, </connor>
<connor> but nothing could really prepare me </connor>
<connor> for just like getting
the feel of the snowboard </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like you've got to shut off </connor>
<connor> a part of your brain and
relearn another skill set </connor>
<garnt> when you're like snowboarding and stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and also like just
while you're putting pressure </connor>
<connor> on your toes and your,
like the exact point, </connor>
<joey> can determine so much
on how you're steering. </joey>
<joey> You get so much more controlled
once you realize like, okay, </joey>
<joey> if I just have faith, I put pressure here, </joey>
<joey> it'll turn where I want it to. </joey>
<connor> But you kind of got to like
not panic to learn that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, panicking is what
fucks you up the most. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's good though. </joey>
<joey> I mean, if you ever get
the chance to go, go, </joey>
<joey> but obviously-
- Honestly, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it is a
very privileged sport. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- It is. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> We've been talking about a lot </connor>
<connor> of privileged activities, haven't we? </connor>
<joey> Like kayaking and snowboarding. </joey>
<garnt> I remember when I was at the ski resort </garnt>
<garnt> and I phoned my mom said to tell her </garnt>
<garnt> that I was like snowboarding </garnt>
<garnt> and she was like, "Oh,
you rich now, are you?" </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause to me, like snowboarding and skiing </joey>
<joey> has always been like the rich man's sport. </joey>
<joey> It's always been like the
white man's sport, you know? </joey>
<connor> - White man's sport. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, fuck.
- That's how I was raised up </connor>
<connor> to like view snowboarding
and skiing because you know, </connor>
<connor> when I go on holiday, you know, </connor>
<connor> I visit back home and everything, </connor>
<connor> but I go to like a nice cheap beach </connor>
<connor> or whatever in Thailand or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> Snowboarding and skiing, </garnt>
<garnt> like the only reason I'd never gone before </garnt>
<garnt> was because there seems
to be like so many steps </garnt>
<garnt> and so much equipment that you need </garnt>
<garnt> in order just to go down a slope. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of like golfing, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I was about to say, </joey>
<joey> there's two types of
rich white man sports. </joey>
<joey> It's you either go skiing and
snowboarding or you play golf. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I think I saw something </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is true at all, </connor>
<connor> but I saw something and it was like, </connor>
<joey> it was like based on like
sports or accidents in general, </joey>
<joey> what percentage of them were white people. </joey>
<joey> And it was like the whitest
accident you can have </joey>
<joey> is on a fucking jet ski. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember where it was. </joey>
<joey> It was like 99.5% of accidents on jet skis </joey>
<joey> were white people.
- White people. </joey>
<joey> - And then the next one was
skiing and snowboarding. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course.
- It had like 97 or something. </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing more
white than a jet ski. </joey>
<joey> - I was gonna say when
you put it like that, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I don't think
there is anything whiter </joey>
<joey> than owning a jet ski. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> I mean, it's the whitest thing. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever been on a jet ski? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you thought about
going on a jet ski? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd like to.
- I'd like to. </garnt>
<connor> - Who the fuck owns a jet ski? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't live in like
Florida or shit like that. </joey>
<joey> - I've been on a jet ski. </joey>
<joey> It's fun as fuck.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because I mean, in Thailand, </joey>
<joey> obviously with the beach and everything, </joey>
<joey> there's some services where
you can rent out a jet ski </joey>
<joey> for like a half an hour or whatever. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's basically
just a motorbike on water. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you jump off it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Do you do a sick trick? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - SSX on a jet ski.
- You do any flips? </joey>
<joey> - Whoa!
(all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, it's just a lot of fun. </garnt>
<joey> I could see how people get
injured on that though. </joey>
<joey> You go pretty fast and
you think that it's water </joey>
<joey> so it doesn't hurt. </joey>
<joey> - Water's like hitting concrete. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. You think. </joey>
<joey> - You think that falling
off at full speed, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't hurt, but it fucking hurts. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's a lot of fucking fun. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I haven't done much on it. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I've only had like
half an hour on a jet ski </garnt>
<garnt> on a beach in Thailand once,
but that's pretty much it. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like that's all I need. </connor>
<joey> I'd be like, "You know
what? Now I'm done." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I've fulfilled the white man experience. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll tell you that this like
ski resort that we stayed at, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like, its theme, </garnt>
<garnt> like its theme was like,
it was very like inspired </garnt>
<garnt> by I guess like American culture. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds so bizarre. </garnt>
<connor> A Japanese ski result
inspired by Americans. </connor>
<connor> - By American culture.
- Yeah, it's really weird. </connor>
<garnt> It was like kind of what I imagined, </garnt>
<joey> what I imagine a ferry would be like. </joey>
<joey> You know, it had a lot of different, </joey>
<garnt> a lot of different things. </garnt>
<connor> - 1950s carnival style, I'd say. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh weird, in Japan? </joey>
<garnt> - In Japan.
- Whereabouts did you guys go? </garnt>
<connor> - Hokkaido.
- Hokkaido. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Hokkaido. </connor>
<connor> - But there was some areas of this hotel </connor>
<connor> that were like totally normal, chill, </connor>
<garnt> but there's a big area that
was like kid's theme park. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Carnival theme. </garnt>
<garnt> It was really weird. </garnt>
<connor> It was really fucking bizarre.
- So they had like </connor>
<joey> these animatronics, animals. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like some Chuck E. Cheese shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly like that. </joey>
<joey> Like some Chuck E. Cheese shit, right? </joey>
<joey> But I don't know when they had
bought these animantronics. </joey>
<joey> But I don't know when they had
bought these animantronics. </joey>
<joey> because we were just, me and
Sydney were just sitting there </joey>
<joey> and they play these like songs, right? </joey>
<joey> They'd have these like
animatronic concerts, </joey>
<joey> like in this like children's area </joey>
<garnt> where you can buy fucking
burgers and fries. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like an eating area. </garnt>
<joey> - It was full on Chuck E. Cheese. </joey>
<connor> What the fuck?
- Yeah. Basically. </connor>
<connor> And these poor employees had to listen </connor>
<connor> to these fucking things sing all day. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and so, me and
Sydney were just enjoying </garnt>
<garnt> like a nice burger and
everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Other than this fucking
animatronic dog or something </garnt>
<joey> just starts bigging up the Confederacy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> me and Sydney had to
double-take to be like, </garnt>
<connor> did we just hear that correctly? </connor>
<garnt> Like what is going on right now? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I walked past them </connor>
<connor> and I was like doing my own thing, </connor>
<connor> I'm like why they're wearing
Confederate soldier uniforms? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - Dead ass.
- Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - So after we heard that, </garnt>
<garnt> we took like a closer look
at these animatronics, right? </garnt>
<garnt> To be like what is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> When did they buy these and
where did they buy these from? </garnt>
<garnt> And we saw one of the bears was, </garnt>
<garnt> it was very, let's say not very tasteful. </garnt>
<connor> - 1920s black cartoon character. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no.
- Yes, yes. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - The lips were like massive, you know? </joey>
<joey> And it had the stereotypical
cartoon black man accent </joey>
<joey> with like 1920s, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like the whole, like I don't even... </joey>
<joey> It's literally if you go
and watch a Disney cartoon </joey>
<garnt> from the 1920s with a black person </garnt>
<garnt> with that like kind of
like stereotypical accent </garnt>
<garnt> they gave them and
character, it was just that. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, oh no, oh no, oh no. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<garnt> Why? </garnt>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> You can't make that shit up. </joey>
<joey> - These poor Japanese tourists </joey>
<joey> are just like, "Ah,
American culture. Yeah!" </joey>
<joey> Kids are jut like running
around being like, </joey>
<garnt> "Mama, what's the Confederacy?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yes, Meilyne's got a fucking video. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you show it to Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - Nothing weirder than that thing </joey>
<joey> standing next to Miku. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Like is that a Miku scene? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] It was but I... </garnt>
<garnt> - What is this? </garnt>
<joey> Oh no. </joey>
<garnt> Oh no! </garnt>
<connor> Oh, that is ugly. </connor>
<connor> - It was a really good resort though. </connor>
<garnt> It's really cheap, good onsen. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a really good resort. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really good resort but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Despite that, fantastic. </garnt>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> Oh. </joey>
<joey> - It is one of those things
you're like, "This is great. </joey>
<joey> What is going on here?" </joey>
<joey> - Why is this a thing? </joey>
<joey> Why is this here?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like you have your 90 year old aunt </joey>
<joey> who has that one piece of memorabilia </joey>
<joey> where you're like, "Auntie, </joey>
<joey> you should probably throw that away." </joey>
<joey> - You should probably not talk about that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
You should probably </joey>
<connor> get rid of that I think.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, to give them
the benefit of the doubt </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think that anyone there knew. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - But it's the matter of like, you know, </joey>
<joey> when tourism comes back in, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, it's been there for decades. </connor>
<connor> - Well, clearly. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> How has no tourists come up and been like, </connor>
<joey> "You know what that is, right? </joey>
<connor> That's probably not a good idea." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I wanted to
think of like, you know, </connor>
<joey> because obviously in the
past five, six years, </joey>
<joey> it's been a very hot topic.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's only now where we've
really started to be like, </joey>
<joey> we should probably get
rid of all that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's not a good idea. </joey>
<joey> - So I wonder through, I wonder, </joey>
<joey> has anyone send them an
email, letting them know like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, love the
animatronics. They're great. </joey>
<joey> They're really great." </joey>
<joey> - "The dog is cute but." </joey>
<joey> - "Maybe we should kind of
change up the theme a little bit. </joey>
<connor> We got a bunch of Miku's
probably lying around. </connor>
<connor> We could probably reservice them." </connor>
<joey> - That picture of the
Miku next to the dog. </joey>
<joey> I was like, that is some
cursed shit right there. </joey>
<joey> That looked photoshopped. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking.... </connor>
<joey> I didn't want to like
swear off this place. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was, you
know, I'm sure, you know? </joey>
<joey> - There had to be a
reason behind it, right? </joey>
<joey> - It was a nice place
and I really did feel </joey>
<connor> like they were just like
ignorant, you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it kind of felt like </garnt>
<garnt> they had just like
brought some memorabilia </garnt>
<joey> from America, they didn't
know what they were buying. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I mean this is Hokkaido, right? </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of the fucking ski resorts </garnt>
<garnt> are in the middle of nowhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's in the
middle of fucking nowhere. </garnt>
<garnt> They have no idea about
anything like what's going on. </garnt>
<joey> - It makes sense but it's still not good. </joey>
<joey> - It was just super fucking weird </joey>
<connor> because you walk into this-
- Yeah, it was really bizarre. </connor>
<garnt> - You walk into this- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the last thing you expected to see </garnt>
<connor> in the middle of fucking nowhere in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Because we had to like, </garnt>
<garnt> we got to go on a coach that
lasted about two, three hours </garnt>
<garnt> in the middle of fucking Hokkaido, right? </garnt>
<connor> So we were going in the middle
of nowhere and we walk in </connor>
<garnt> and it's just like old American
memorabilia everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> It was so fucking bizarre. </connor>
<garnt> - It was massive as well. </garnt>
<joey> The hotel part was really fancy as well. </joey>
<joey> So like the entrance to
this hotel was like marble, </joey>
<joey> like pure marble with like pillars </joey>
<joey> and it's like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> It's so fancy you can get a helicopter </joey>
<joey> from the airport to the hotel. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking hell.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then they just had this whole thing </joey>
<joey> that's like... </joey>
<joey> And then also, I mean,
completely unrelated, </joey>
<joey> but I was really offended when I bought a, </joey>
<joey> what was it, advertised as a coffee. </joey>
<joey> And I paid $3 for it. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like okay, it's not
the most expensive coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like, all right,
fine, paid $3 for it. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally dead I saw this woman </garnt>
<garnt> put a fucking shitty pod into a machine </garnt>
<garnt> and then click coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "I don't want it anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it a Nespresso?
- Was it a Nespresso at least? </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't even an Nespresso. </garnt>
<joey> It was some budget version of Nespresso. </joey>
<joey> I was like what is this?
- I can't believe it. </joey>
<joey> - You know, if it's a Nespresso, </joey>
<joey> maybe I'd pay $3 for it. </joey>
<joey> - Not even a Nespresso. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's like the bare minimum. </joey>
<joey> If you're charging for a coffee, </joey>
<joey> you know, I'm not expecting much. </joey>
<joey> But like if you're gonna put
the pod in fucking front of me, </joey>
<joey> like literally just get the
pod in front of me, boom. </joey>
<joey> - Right in front of my coffee. Really? </joey>
<joey> - Really? I was like I
don't wanna drink this shit. </joey>
<joey> Get this acid water out of my face. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to... </joey>
<connor> Connor showing his privilege clearly here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> If it's a pod, get it out of my face. </joey>
<connor> - I've become spoiled
on coffee to the point </connor>
<connor> where I just can't like
drink the shit stuff anymore. </connor>
<joey> Like instant coffee, the
thought of drinking that now </joey>
<joey> like the one in the tubs. </joey>
<garnt> - The Nescafe ones. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh fuck, dude, fuck. </joey>
<joey> Oh, Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> I'm showing my privilege.
I don't even care, dude. </joey>
<connor> If showing my privilege means </connor>
<connor> I don't have to drink that again, gladly. </connor>
<joey> - Look at you, not
drinking instant coffee, </joey>
<connor> going snowboarding. </connor>
<connor> The true rich white man experience. </connor>
<joey> - It's not privileged, </joey>
<joey> it's called fucking taking care of myself, </joey>
<connor> not putting that fucking
dirt water acid into my body. </connor>
<connor> If you're still drinking
instant coffee, I get it. </connor>
<connor> If you're desperate, I always
have it in the cupboard. </connor>
<joey> If I'm desperate, I have
nothing else, I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> But if that's your like, </joey>
<joey> "Can't wait for my morning cup of coffee." </joey>
<joey> Puts acid in the hot water. </joey>
<joey> No, don't do that. </joey>
<joey> You're worth more than that. </joey>
<joey> Don't enable these companies
to sell this garbage shit </joey>
<joey> that they call coffee, it's not coffee. </joey>
<joey> Rant over. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Ted Talk.
- Would you drink it? </garnt>
<joey> - No, I don't drink it. </joey>
<joey> - Back me up here, boys. What the fuck!? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, you kind saying what I thinking. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the stage is all yours, man. </joey>
<connor> - Let the white man, fucking... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let the privileged white man </joey>
<joey> who just came back from
snowboarding say it. </joey>
<connor> - I just didn't come
back! It's fucking May! </connor>
<connor> Where am I gonna snowboard!? </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - No, 'cause like the worst part </joey>
<joey> of like staying in a hotel, right? </joey>
<garnt> Is just knowing that you're
gonna have to like drink </garnt>
<garnt> that shitty instant three-in-one coffee. </garnt>
<joey> - You mean that shitty coffee </joey>
<joey> that you have at the ryokan as well? </joey>
<joey> At camping?
- Oh God. </joey>
<garnt> Don't remind me, man. </garnt>
<joey> - So there's this coffee
machine in the ryokan, right? </joey>
<connor> - Okay. Hold up though. </connor>
<connor> The fact that there's a
coffee machine in a ryokan,, </connor>
<joey> is already.... </joey>
<joey> There's normally no coffee
to be found in these places </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, usually there isn't, right? </connor>
<joey> So all of us, when we walked in, </joey>
<garnt> we saw that and the guy was like, "Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> so for people who are staying, </garnt>
<garnt> you get free coffee at
the coffee machine." </garnt>
<joey> And everyone's like,
"Perfect. That's great. </joey>
<joey> Tomorrow morning's going to be fantastic." </joey>
<joey> Walk up and my first red flag was, </joey>
<joey> it was like "Free coffee." </joey>
<joey> And I was like- </joey>
<joey> - No, no, make me pay, please make me pay. </joey>
<connor> - There is nothing scarier
than something that's for free. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was going to be like- </garnt>
<connor> - Tea, (indistinct) that's fine. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like it's a machine
that serves coffee </connor>
<connor> and you press the button </connor>
<connor> and you could hear beans grinding. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, surely, </connor>
<connor> surely there must be some quality to this </connor>
<garnt> if I can hear something
whirring in the machine, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not just a pod or
something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> So I get this coffee, I drink it </garnt>
<connor> and I'm just like, man, </connor>
<garnt> I'd never thought I would ask for a refund </garnt>
<garnt> for a free coffee, but I'm
kind of considering it now. </garnt>
<connor> - How was it so bad though
if it's like grounded coffee </connor>
<connor> if there's beans- </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I don't know if
it was grounded coffee. </joey>
<garnt> They're might've just been like beans </garnt>
<garnt> just whirling in a container. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure they just grounded dirt </joey>
<joey> and they sold it as coffee </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's what it fucking tasted like. </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure those were rocks </joey>
<connor> that were being ground
up like from the dirt </connor>
<connor> that they dug up. </connor>
<connor> - It's like how some vacuums
have like speakers in them </connor>
<connor> to have like sounds play
when you pick up stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like to make it sound more-
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It was not fresh coffee. </garnt>
<joey> It was a lie. </joey>
<joey> - If it was beans, those
beans have been there </joey>
<connor> since those animatronics have been there. </connor>
<connor> - Once you grind the beans, </connor>
<connor> they go bad like within like, oh God, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how long. </connor>
<connor> Maybe like a few weeks. </connor>
<joey> - Well, clearly the people
at the hotel didn't know. </joey>
<joey> They're like, well, I mean,
once they're in the machine, </joey>
<joey> they're good to go, aren't they? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, beans, they get
pretty bad pretty quickly. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's why it's just like
grind them when you drink them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But clearly they didn't
think about that though. </joey>
<joey> Like, well, there you go. </joey>
<joey> Unlimited supply of
coffee right here for you </joey>
<joey> fine people staying at our hotel. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I will happily
be called privileged </garnt>
<garnt> for just wanting good coffee. </garnt>
<connor> I'll take it. I'll take it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember like- </connor>
<connor> - The most acceptable form of privilege. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, okay, so
if I'm privileged, fine, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not a peasant then. </garnt>
<garnt> As long as I'm not a peasant, fine, fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I remember
like I've grown up </garnt>
<garnt> my entire life on instant coffee. </garnt>
<joey> Like my childhood was my parents </joey>
<joey> like drinking instant coffee </joey>
<joey> with powdered Coffee Mates, right? </joey>
<joey> And that was just my entire life. </joey>
<joey> I remember, like after
I finished university, </joey>
<joey> I had my first job, you know, </joey>
<joey> I tried try getting a coffee
machine for the first time. </joey>
<garnt> And I remember the first thing
my mum and dad said to me, </garnt>
<connor> was like, "Oh, you don't
need a coffee machine. </connor>
<connor> We got fucking Nescafe right here. </connor>
<connor> Just it's cheap." </connor>
<garnt> - It's so easy.
- "It's easy, grind it up." </garnt>
<garnt> - Mother, I respect myself </garnt>
<connor> and I'm not putting that dirt in my body. </connor>
<garnt> - So one year I buy them for like, </garnt>
<joey> I think it was, I can't
remember if it was Christmas </joey>
<joey> or one of their birthdays, </joey>
<joey> buy them a coffee machine, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Mum, Dad, try this. </joey>
<joey> Just try it. Just give it a try." </joey>
<joey> - Just give it a go. </joey>
<joey> - And now every few weeks or something, </joey>
<garnt> they're just like, "Son,
we need more pods., </garnt>
<garnt> Son, where do we buy the pods?" </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It is so much better. </connor>
<joey> It's like night and day
how much better it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's a lot more expensive obviously. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm looking
forward to in my new place </connor>
<connor> 'cause my old place, I
didn't have enough space </connor>
<connor> for a Nespresso machine, right? </connor>
<garnt> So I'm like, fuck the
curtains, fuck the couches, </garnt>
<joey> fuck the beds, Nespresso machine. </joey>
<joey> That is the first thing
on my list right now. </joey>
<connor> - I said this on the live stream, bro. </connor>
<connor> I could lose my house and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Can I keep the coffee
machine at least though?" </connor>
<joey> - If my house catches on fire, </joey>
<joey> I'm taking the Nespresso machine. </joey>
<joey> - What do you save, your gaming PC, </joey>
<connor> all your life's work? </connor>
<connor> Nah, I'm grabbing the coffee machine. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> At least I can watch my house burn down </connor>
<joey> with a nice cup of coffee.
- With a nice cup of coffee. </joey>
<garnt> - With a nice tasting espresso. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Fuck me.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I wish we did bring </connor>
<garnt> a coffee machine on camping. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck the TV. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean that's what the
power outlet was for, right? </joey>
<connor> - If you got a power outlet, </connor>
<connor> why would you not bring... </connor>
<garnt> Fucking plug it in. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's what the
power outlet was for honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Plug it into Garnt's fucking
monstrosity of a generator </garnt>
<joey> and bring an espresso machine with you. </joey>
<connor> Bring the milk frother too. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And bring the milk,
put it in a mini fridge, </joey>
<joey> connect the mini fridge
to your thing as well. </joey>
<connor> - I can just imagine, dude. </connor>
<connor> I step out of my tent, I'm like ah. </connor>
<connor> And I hear like (buzzing) </connor>
<connor> and I look over at
someone else's camping lot </connor>
<joey> and I see them with an espresso machine. </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, you fucking
10,000 IQ mother fuck. </joey>
<joey> I hate you so much right now. </joey>
<joey> And then he fucking froths the milk </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "God damn it!" </joey>
<joey> - God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<joey> - Bringing a TV, weak shit. </joey>
<connor> Bringing your own espresso
machine and milk frother, </connor>
<garnt> that's big brain, bro.
- That is big brain. </garnt>
<connor> - Really the big brain stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - The thing about
camping, I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> but like most food you cook on camping, </garnt>
<garnt> it tastes good, right? </garnt>
<connor> - There's something about the camping cook </connor>
<garnt> that gives you the taste to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's something about
just cooking something </garnt>
<joey> on an open fire that
just makes it be like, </joey>
<garnt> your caveman brain just activates </garnt>
<garnt> ad you're just like, "This tastes good." </garnt>
<garnt> - Bacon on campfire is like next level. </garnt>
<joey> - Any meat on campfire is like legendary. </joey>
<garnt> - The only thing that is just
never translated is coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> Coffee, like camping coffee </garnt>
<garnt> is just like the most, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally the headset meme </garnt>
<connor> of the guy ripping it
off, campfire coffee. </connor>
<connor> I'm like. (sighs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because let's be honest. </connor>
<joey> Camping is basically
just homeless simulator </joey>
<joey> for like a few days, right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know about that. </joey>
<joey> - It's like privileged homeless simulator. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Have you guys ever seen
a homeless person before? </connor>
<joey> - It's like homeless simulator
with a savings account. </joey>
<connor> - Ah, trying to get us speed
run canceled over here. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What, by the homeless community? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - No, I mean, you're
basically going homeless </joey>
<garnt> for a few days in the
middle of the field. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, you got a tent, you
have a fucking power outlet. </connor>
<garnt> Name one homeless person
with a power outlet, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I'm not saying in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, not in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just saying normally. </joey>
<garnt> Like have you seen... </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think homeless people are like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what? </connor>
<joey> I'm homeless, I'm gonna
retreat to the mountains." </joey>
<joey> They don't do that. </joey>
<joey> That's not what they fucking do </joey>
<connor> because they don't have a fucking tent </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're homeless. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- That's Skid Row. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, this is getting a bit off topic, </garnt>
<joey> but I mean, yeah, I've seen
some homeless people have tents. </joey>
<connor> Do they not have tents? </connor>
<connor> - They do. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> They do and it depends
where you are though. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, Skid Row, everyone
has a fucking tent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're all camping.
- Exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - They're not fucking... </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Trash Taste canceled.
- I'm just joking. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just joking. </joey>
<garnt> - We apologize if any of these
jokes are very tasteless, </garnt>
<garnt> which they probably are. </garnt>
<joey> - They probably are, it's all right. </joey>
<garnt> - But no. What was I saying? </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt's homeless simulator. </connor>
<connor> - It was homeless simulator. </connor>
<connor> Like there's nothing that has made me </connor>
<garnt> just like feel more like... (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Are you gonna say you feel grateful? </connor>
<garnt> - I feel grateful that I
have a roof over my head. </garnt>
<joey> - You are so fucking white right now. </joey>
<joey> - I feel grateful that I
have a roof over my head </joey>
<garnt> and that I have a coffee machine. </garnt>
<joey> - I spent one day in
the outdoors with a tent </joey>
<connor> with a power outlet. </connor>
<connor> (Joey grunting) </connor>
<connor> And I'm so grateful that I have all this. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't a tent. It
wasn't a power outlet. </garnt>
<garnt> It was the coffee, which was
what I was trying to say. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - So if you want to feel grateful </joey>
<joey> for your coffee machine, go camping. </joey>
<joey> - If I said that, </joey>
<connor> that would come off as
10 times more privileged </connor>
<garnt> than if Garnt said it.
- Oh, come on! </garnt>
<garnt> You've said something
like that before anyway. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure he said
something five minutes ago </joey>
<connor> that was like that. </connor>
<connor> - And so what? I don't care. </connor>
<connor> I'm tired of pretending
to be a peasant, frankly. </connor>
<joey> It's never what I aim to be. </joey>
<garnt> I remember when I was younger, </garnt>
<garnt> the moment I realized I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> this peasant life isn't for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like 10 years old. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 10 years old!? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't fucking know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Arbitrary age of young age.
- Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - We went on a plane
somewhere and I was like- </joey>
<joey> - Wow, already privileged,
you get to go on a plane. </joey>
<joey> - That's not fucking, oh, come on. </joey>
<connor> It's like fucking Ryanair, it's
hardly a fucking privilege. </connor>
<connor> - You ever been on the EasyJet, Joey? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's the furthest thing from privilege. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like a layover or something. </garnt>
<joey> And then so this was like a, </joey>
<joey> it was a flight that was
going to like Australia, </joey>
<joey> but it stopped in where we
were going to, Amsterdam, </joey>
<joey> so it's like a two hour flight. </joey>
<joey> But I remember we were sitting
in an economy and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Mum, what did they get
to go in the really, </joey>
<joey> really cool looking one? </joey>
<joey> They get to lie down." </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Oh, 'cause
that's really expensive." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Why
don't you pay for it?" </joey>
<joey> They're like, "We can't afford it." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "what do you
mean you can't afford it?" </joey>
<joey> - Just get a good bank account. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "You guys
have a job. Right?" </joey>
<connor> And they're like, "Yeah,
we can't afford it. </connor>
<connor> It's too expensive." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, well." </connor>
<joey> - If you were my kid, I would've
slapped you over the head. </joey>
<connor> - No, I was just asking, I
was like, "How much is it? </connor>
<connor> I don't know how much
it is. How does it work? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm young as fuck,
don't know how much it costs. </garnt>
<joey> I have no notion of this before. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Well, how much is it?" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - How much and why can't you afford it? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "What? </joey>
<joey> So you're telling me that
those people over there </joey>
<joey> have enough money for it? </joey>
<joey> Nah, that's not right. </joey>
<joey> If they can get it, I can get it. </joey>
<joey> Fuck that." </joey>
<joey> That was like my mindset. </joey>
<joey> That's how I've always been in life. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, if someone else can have it, </joey>
<joey> I can have it, why can't I have it? </joey>
<joey> Why not? Why not? </joey>
<joey> If they get it, why don't I? </joey>
<connor> I'm a person too.
- I don't know, </connor>
<joey> did you think like that as a kid? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I always thought if someone
else could do it, I could do it. </connor>
<joey> - When I was like 10 all
I thought it was like, </joey>
<connor> "Thank you father for buying
me a packet of Mentos." </connor>
<joey> - No, no, I was grateful,
but I would always wonder, </joey>
<connor> you never wondered why those other people </connor>
<connor> who had like all this stuff- </connor>
<joey> - I wondered but I was like, </joey>
<joey> well, the fact that
we're not there right now </joey>
<joey> means that they're different. </joey>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<joey> - Why? They're the same as us. </joey>
<connor> They just got lucky. </connor>
<joey> Fuck that! </joey>
<joey> That's what they want you to believe, </joey>
<joey> they want you to believe
they have like 10,000 IQ, </joey>
<joey> we earned this, fuck off, no they didn't. </joey>
<joey> They got fucking lucky. </joey>
<joey> Fuck off, no you didn't. </joey>
<connor> You made a few good decisions, </connor>
<connor> you made an air conditioning
company, good for you. </connor>
<joey> - How to get privileged? Just get lucky. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of luck involved. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, there is. </connor>
<garnt> - It is mostly luck. </garnt>
<connor> - 90% of the people in that first class </connor>
<joey> fucking born into wealth, bro. </joey>
<joey> It's bullshit.
- That is true, that is true. </joey>
<joey> - It's not fair. </joey>
<joey> It's the same rich people </joey>
<garnt> giving each other their kids money. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, fuck that! I deserve that! </garnt>
<garnt> Why don't I deserve that? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm gonna have some of that. </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong with having that mindset </connor>
<connor> of being like, if they can
do it, why can't I get it? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there nothing wrong
with having that mindset. </garnt>
<joey> - There's nothing wrong
with having that mindset. </joey>
<joey> It's just funny that you were </joey>
<garnt> having that mindset like at age 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally. Yeah, like from a young age. </garnt>
<connor> - You were just trying to be a pro gamer. </connor>
<connor> - From a young age, - I always was like, </connor>
<connor> I just wondered like, why, why can't- </connor>
<joey> - Why aren't my parents
mid-maxing life right now? </joey>
<connor> - I just always thought if
someone else could do something, </connor>
<connor> always from a young age, if
they could do it, I could do it. </connor>
<joey> - No, that's great. </joey>
<connor> That's a great mentality to have. </connor>
<joey> When it's talking about,
you know, like privilege. </joey>
<connor> - Well it's because money's
like a taboo subject, right? </connor>
<connor> You can't say that you
want to get a lot of it. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I always just think that like- </connor>
<connor> - That's bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> Like everyone wants to
have a lot of money. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I mean- </connor>
<connor> - But no one wants to admit that, right? </connor>
<connor> - People don't want to
admit that they're like... </connor>
<connor> I mean, people are always
like, "If I had that," </connor>
<connor> but they're never like,
"I'm gonna go for it," </connor>
<joey> because it's embarrassing
admitting to your friends. </joey>
<joey> being like, "I'm gonna be a millionaire. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go for that shit." </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it sounds, you're
like all right, all right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, all right.
- All right, </joey>
<joey> go back to Walmart. </joey>
<joey> Shut the fuck, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It's like, nah, dude, fuck that. </joey>
<joey> Let people try if they want to. </joey>
<joey> Man, let 'em fuck up.
- Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - If you're gonna go
bankrupt, do it before 30 </joey>
<joey> so you can at least like
fix your shit, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like what was that? </joey>
<joey> I saw a thing that was like most people </joey>
<joey> the most impactful years in your life </joey>
<joey> are like 40 years old. </joey>
<joey> Like the people who do
the important things </joey>
<joey> or the CEOs of the
company, all that stuff. </joey>
<joey> It's when you're 40. </joey>
<joey> So just fuck up. </joey>
<joey> Try and do a bunch of shit.
- Yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly.
- Go for gold </garnt>
<connor> when you're like 20, why the fuck not? </connor>
<joey> - Take some risks while you're young. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly like what I
try to tell people is like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially those in their mid 20s, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like
everyone hits the mid 20s, </garnt>
<joey> like 23, 24 where they realize, oh, </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna be working
for the rest of my life. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> And everyone gets their first job, </joey>
<joey> you get excited getting your first job, </joey>
<joey> you're like, "Damn, I'm
actually getting paid for once. </joey>
<joey> I'm not a peasant anymore." </joey>
<connor> Because let's be honest, </connor>
<connor> being a student is- </connor>
<connor> - That's what the system
wants you to think. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Being a student is just like, man, </connor>
<garnt> you've just gotten used to
living like a peasant, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<joey> It's like yes, this is normal. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like somewhere in my mid 20s </garnt>
<joey> when I just realized, man, </joey>
<joey> how the fuck did I just live off cup ramen </joey>
<joey> for a good like five years of my life? </joey>
<joey> That's not normal. </joey>
<joey> And I've just like internalized
that to be like, dude, dude, </joey>
<garnt> Night out versus cup ramen. </garnt>
<joey> Night out anytime.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of course, of course. </joey>
<connor> Got to get your priorities right, </connor>
<joey> but then you realize, wow, </joey>
<joey> I have a job with a disposable income. </joey>
<joey> I can have like a decent living. </joey>
<joey> And that's what you would hope
that most people would have </joey>
<joey> if they went through university, </joey>
<joey> if they got an education. </joey>
<joey> It's a lot harder now.
- Oh yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I was lucky enough to
get even my first job </joey>
<joey> after I graduated from uni, </joey>
<joey> which a lot of people have
a hard time doing now. </joey>
<joey> But I will say if you are
able to be in a position </joey>
<garnt> where you can give yourself a
safety net, then by all means, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck up in your 20s, </garnt>
<garnt> because your 20s are the best point </garnt>
<garnt> where you can fuck up in life </garnt>
<garnt> and still it not be the end of the world. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you still have
enough time to recoup, right? </joey>
<joey> And like, you know, get
back to ground zero. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's what I was just
like, I was like fuck it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I'll try YouTubing. </joey>
<joey> It's probably a terrible idea to lose two </joey>
<joey> or three years of my possible </joey>
<joey> long engineering career to this. </joey>
<garnt> But I was like fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna try it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like why wouldn't I try it? </garnt>
<garnt> Like it'd be stupid for me not to try it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Go for gold. </connor>
<garnt> But I mean, it does get to a point where, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, if I went down
the engineering path, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure you too, you know, </connor>
<joey> eventually in your 40s, </joey>
<joey> you'd probably have a very cushy wage. </joey>
<joey> You'd be very well off. </joey>
<joey> - You'd be very comfortable, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You'd have a very nice, you know, </joey>
<joey> you'd be able to afford
very fine things in life </joey>
<joey> when you become a chartered engineer. </joey>
<joey> The pay you get is very good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And when you work </joey>
<joey> in certain places where the engineering </joey>
<joey> gets more difficult or whatever, </joey>
<joey> like you can start getting nutty money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I was just like, yeah, fuck that. </joey>
<joey> I'd rather take 20K a year
doing something that I like </joey>
<joey> that also has the chance to
make way more down the line. </joey>
<joey> And that's what I was always like though. </joey>
<joey> I always thought why settle? </joey>
<joey> I would rather risk losing it all </joey>
<joey> trying to make a million dollars </joey>
<joey> and then just settle for like, you know? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] A comfortable
amount, right? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because to me it's like, you know, </joey>
<connor> I can do that at any point in my life. </connor>
<connor> I can settle down and do things smartly. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because you never
know with our career, right? </joey>
<joey> Like it could start happening
tomorrow for all we know. </joey>
<connor> - Like if you become the
biggest fucking YouTuber </connor>
<connor> on the planet next week,
dude, you're set for life. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> So it's like, but I don't
even think of it like that. </connor>
<connor> It's not like how I see YouTube anyway, </connor>
<joey> but I would just rather
risk and do something </joey>
<joey> that's kind of like oh,
could lose it all, hehe, XD. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Could just become homeless tomorrow. </joey>
<joey> Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Better start camping. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? Better start
getting good at camping. </joey>
<garnt> But like, I mean I'd rather try it </garnt>
<connor> like yeah, fuck it, why not?
- Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I think it's important </connor>
<connor> to like recognize that some people </connor>
<connor> are just not in the
position to be able to try. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was very lucky that
I built up the savings </connor>
<connor> and I also had a really
good family that set me up </connor>
<joey> to allow me to do that, you know? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Because like I will say this right now. </joey>
<garnt> Like I was never brought
up, like my family weren't </garnt>
<garnt> in the best of financial positions at all, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I was lucky enough
to have a mom and dad </garnt>
<garnt> who work their fucking asses
off to like get me through </garnt>
<garnt> and give me a better
opportunity than they ever had. </garnt>
<joey> And that's why like right
now I'm trying to like, </joey>
<joey> most of everything I earn
I like spend on them. </joey>
<joey> I spend more on them than I do on me </joey>
<joey> because I feel like it's
my way of like paying back </joey>
<joey> the opportunity that they gave me. </joey>
<joey> - Such a good boy.
- Yeah, I mean- </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Such a good son. </joey>
<joey> - I mean dude, like yeah, </joey>
<joey> I mean, my parents
like, especially my dad, </joey>
<joey> he came up from like
fucking poverty almost </joey>
<garnt> in fucking Thailand and somehow
found his way to England </garnt>
<garnt> and worked his fucking ass off, </garnt>
<garnt> had a much harder life
than I ever went through. </garnt>
<garnt> So of course, I'm like fucking, dad- </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't that fucking bad ass though? </connor>
<connor> Like he had a dream, move to England, </connor>
<connor> and then his son's like engineering degree </connor>
<connor> and now he talks about anime titties, but- </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> That part of the story- </garnt>
<garnt> - That was not what I was expecting. </garnt>
<joey> - That part of the story, </joey>
<connor> he doesn't tell that at
his family gatherings. </connor>
<garnt> - Nah, he's fucking proud now, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Like that's such bad ass, dude. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a fallacy where
you think money solves </garnt>
<connor> every problem that you have. </connor>
<connor> Money does not solve- </connor>
<connor> - It makes like significantly easier. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And it sounds so privileged </joey>
<joey> when you say that, but like, no, </joey>
<joey> as someone who hasn't
been poor in her life, </joey>
<joey> money doesn't solve every problem, </joey>
<connor> but there is a point in your life </connor>
<garnt> where money is 90% of
your problems, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Right.
- And once- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, when money is your problem, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really have time to think about </garnt>
<garnt> anything other than money. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly and like my
mentality when I was a kid </garnt>
<connor> was just, I just want to get
by and be like comfortable, </connor>
<connor> you know?
- Same, same, same. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like that was
my big driving force </connor>
<connor> to like really try to be successful </connor>
<connor> and to take risks is just 'cause </connor>
<connor> I was just tired of just not knowing </connor>
<connor> what my life situation would
be five years down the line. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, how the fuck </connor>
<connor> am I gonna take care of my parents </connor>
<connor> when they get old? </connor>
<connor> That was a big fucking thing for me. </connor>
<connor> - There was definitely a time
when I was like 16 to like 18 </connor>
<connor> where I thought I really love video games. </connor>
<joey> I don't really care what job I get. </joey>
<joey> I just want to be able
to play games after work. </joey>
<joey> That's what I genuinely I thought I wanted </joey>
<joey> for like a few years.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then when I went to university, </joey>
<joey> it like very much kicked in. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I don't think I can do </joey>
<joey> an eight hour job a day I hate. </joey>
<connor> - No.
- I think I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - I did a three month internship to know </connor>
<joey> that I don't want to do this
for the rest of my life. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, more
power to people who love </connor>
<joey> that line of work.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was jealous. </joey>
<joey> At the time I was so jealous of the people </joey>
<joey> that loved my course
and what we were doing </joey>
<garnt> because I felt like they
were just so OP with school. </garnt>
<garnt> They like got through it, </garnt>
<garnt> they got all the good opportunities
because they enjoyed it. </garnt>
<connor> Like I just didn't enjoy
it, I couldn't try, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I just didn't care. </joey>
<joey> - No, I have so much respect for people </joey>
<joey> who can go to their nine to five job </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Yeah, this is fine. </joey>
<connor> - At the time when I didn't
know what the fuck I was doing, </connor>
<joey> I was so jealous. </joey>
<joey> I was like, fuck man. </joey>
<joey> I wish I knew what the fuck I was doing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
- You know? </joey>
<joey> And I'm sure for every
person like, you know, </joey>
<joey> I got very lucky and I
found something that I loved </joey>
<joey> and that just luckily makes money somehow. </joey>
<joey> My mom disbelieves that it
did for a very long time </joey>
<garnt> but someone it makes money. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think all parents did
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Somehow it makes money, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, I'm sure for every one of me </garnt>
<garnt> that got very lucky, there
was probably 10 people </garnt>
<garnt> who've never really found what they liked </garnt>
<garnt> and just had to like kind
of just be like, "All right, </garnt>
<garnt> well I gotta get a job. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't do nothing all my life." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- It sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think one thing I've realized more </garnt>
<garnt> as I've grown older is that as a kid </garnt>
<joey> we were sold this idea that
there's only really one way </joey>
<joey> your career path can go, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like education, university, </joey>
<joey> you get a job to do with your degree </joey>
<joey> and your career progresses from there. </joey>
<joey> And that's like, I had that mentality </joey>
<joey> for like the longest time of my life. </joey>
<garnt> And now like the older I've gotten, </garnt>
<garnt> the more people I've met </garnt>
<garnt> who have had like the
weirdest fucking career paths. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, Ladybeard.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - We've had a lot of those
people on the podcast. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like in the
entertainment industry, </joey>
<connor> you do meet the people who
kind of are just bouncing </connor>
<joey> from things to things. </joey>
<connor> - They're just try to figure
out what they want, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Just trying to enjoy life. </garnt>
<connor> - Not even in entertainment, </connor>
<connor> just like living in Japan as well. </connor>
<connor> Like meeting like teachers who
have like found opportunities </connor>
<connor> just randomly, like sometimes, </connor>
<connor> like what I'm trying to
say is that as a kid, </connor>
<connor> I was, you know, we got
put this pressure on </connor>
<connor> that by the time you go to university </connor>
<connor> or by the time you finish high school, </connor>
<connor> you need to know what you want to do </connor>
<connor> for the rest of your life. </connor>
<connor> - I wish they didn't
fucking tell me that lie. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's bullshit.
That is 100% bullshit. </connor>
<connor> - That is the biggest
lie of the fucking world. </connor>
<connor> I feel, especially when
you're a young adult, </connor>
<connor> the biggest lie of the fucking world </connor>
<connor> is thinking that once
you start a career path, </connor>
<connor> that you're gonna have to stick on this </connor>
<connor> for like the majority of your life </connor>
<connor> and that's such a fucking lie. </connor>
<garnt> And like another big lie is thinking that </garnt>
<garnt> you need to go to fucking
university or college </garnt>
<garnt> to have to have a decent career. </garnt>
<garnt> That's also a fucking lie. </garnt>
<garnt> There are so many different career paths </garnt>
<garnt> that are available to you </garnt>
<garnt> that is not just higher education, </garnt>
<garnt> because as an Asian, I was taught that </garnt>
<garnt> if I don't do higher education,
I'm a fucking failure. </garnt>
<joey> - If I don't get that
A, I failed as an Asian. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not even talking
about being a YouTuber </garnt>
<joey> 'cause obviously we are very lucky </joey>
<joey> to be able to be YouTubers. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not even talking about like, </joey>
<joey> oh, we're YouTubers. </joey>
<joey> That's a different career path I found. </joey>
<joey> No, I've met like so many other people </joey>
<garnt> who have like just found random jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, fucking Meilyne </garnt>
<garnt> found her fucking job through Craigslist. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It is about just trying and looking </joey>
<garnt> and just being at the right
place at the right time </garnt>
<joey> and making sure you take every opportunity </joey>
<joey> that comes your way.
- Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Like I just say yes to everything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You miss every opportunity you don't take. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, man.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if you, which is in the UK, </joey>
<joey> which is something that I
just did read and enjoy. </joey>
<joey> It was like the culture of you go to work, </joey>
<joey> you go to the pub and that's it. </joey>
<connor> Like you never try and
do any self improvement. </connor>
<connor> You never try and like look
for any other opportunities. </connor>
<connor> Like looking for another
job is like, oh wow, </connor>
<garnt> what's wrong with you?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And like there are so many
opportunities out there </garnt>
<garnt> for different jobs that you
like never even thought about </garnt>
<connor> until it's just on your lap. </connor>
<connor> Like have we ever talked
about Kenny before? </connor>
<garnt> Like your friend? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I haven't talked about Kenny. </connor>
<connor> - What he's doing? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Kenny's my friend
who's lives in Niigata. </joey>
<joey> And he's a crazy guy. </joey>
<garnt> He's great. I love him. </garnt>
<garnt> He's amazing. He's so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> He's really, really rich. </garnt>
<garnt> - He is a proper lad, he is. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he's up in Niigata
in the middle of Japan </garnt>
<joey> and he's half Japanese, half Welsh, </joey>
<joey> and he's just a fake priest </joey>
<joey> and I think I've spoken on it before </joey>
<joey> that my friend's a fake priest. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like he teaches English </joey>
<joey> and then he's also a fake priest </joey>
<joey> and that's just what he likes doing. </joey>
<joey> But he also just doesn't really care about </joey>
<joey> being in one place for too long. </joey>
<joey> He's like, I'll just kind of go wherever- </joey>
<joey> - Just a wanderer. </joey>
<joey> - He literally just goes places </joey>
<joey> and he's like, "All
right, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> Let's figure it out. Let's
try and get a job here." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He just doesn't give a fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I have a friend who is
similar to that who lives here. </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't do that. </joey>
<connor> But he's bad ass, he just turns up </connor>
<connor> and does what he wants, it's great. </connor>
<joey> And he's always super
happy and super optimistic </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "Are you
British? Are you really? </joey>
<joey> You grew up in the UK, right? </joey>
<joey> How are you this optimistic?" </joey>
<joey> - It's the Japanese side that's kicking. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he just turns up. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </joey>
<connor> Always has a good time,
talks to anyone he meets. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I feel people like that are usually </joey>
<connor> like the most optimistic
people in the planet, right? </connor>
<connor> Because I have a friend
like that who was like, </connor>
<joey> he's an animator for an anime studio here. </joey>
<joey> He did like the, </joey>
<joey> I met him through like
the Pop Team Epic stuff. </joey>
<joey> But like he also just like goes out. </joey>
<joey> He's just like, "I'm just
gonna go on a road trip </joey>
<joey> for a month and just like
try and make some money </joey>
<joey> along the way and just see what happens." </joey>
<joey> And he comes back with all
these like insane stories </joey>
<joey> of just like him on the
road and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I just like walked
into this like random cafe, </joey>
<joey> got a job for like two days
and then got some money </joey>
<joey> and used that for fuel just
to go to the next place." </joey>
<joey> I'm like that's so fucking cool </joey>
<joey> because I can never fucking do that. </joey>
<joey> I could not bring myself to just be like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't know where I'm gonna be tomorrow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm gonna do tomorrow. </garnt>
<joey> I couldn't do that myself.
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't do that either. </joey>
<joey> I need like some, </joey>
<garnt> like at least a little bit of a plan. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need some kind of direction. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, yeah,
- I like plans. I like plans. </connor>
<joey> - I like plans. </joey>
<joey> - I used to like spreadsheet
all my like spending </joey>
<joey> in university, like to the penny </joey>
<joey> and I would have like a prediction
of my spending coming up </joey>
<joey> and what I was allowed to spend </joey>
<joey> and literally everything in a spreadsheet. </joey>
<joey> And then when I started like, </joey>
<joey> my YouTube start giving me
some money in university, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I don't need
the spreadsheet anymore. </joey>
<joey> Fuck this." </joey>
<joey> Why am I like spending hours a week </joey>
<garnt> updating this fucking spreadsheet? </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't fucking matter anyway </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm not gonna spend that much. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It doesn't fucking matter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and like to go
off what we were saying. </connor>
<garnt> I'm not saying like there's no place </garnt>
<joey> for higher education and
university or everything- </joey>
<joey> - I'm still glad I went. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I'm still glad I went </joey>
<joey> but what I'm saying is like </joey>
<joey> don't feel the pressure to need to go </joey>
<joey> just because you don't know </joey>
<joey> what you want to do with your life. </joey>
<joey> That's the big thing. Right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's such bullshit
that by the time you hit 18, </joey>
<joey> it's just the expectation
where it's just like </joey>
<joey> you need to know what you're doing now. </joey>
<joey> Your birthday has ticked over. </joey>
<joey> You are now an adult. </joey>
<joey> You need to know everything now. </joey>
<joey> - There are 30 year olds
out there, 40 year olds </joey>
<connor> who don't know what the
fuck they want to do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - The guy who like founded
McDonald's was like 40 years old. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like I don't
really feel too bad about it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, like I said earlier, </garnt>
<garnt> the most productive years of your life </garnt>
<joey> are like 40 years old. </joey>
<joey> So as far as I'm concerned, </joey>
<joey> you're just fucking up
until you get to the point </joey>
<joey> where you can like actually do shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> You're just fucking up enough </joey>
<garnt> until you found out a way
to not fuck up, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Build the foundation of the character </connor>
<connor> you want to be, you know? </connor>
<joey> - It all goes back to
the snowboarding, right? </joey>
<joey> Like just tumble a couple of times </joey>
<joey> until you learn how to not tumble. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, what a good ending. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow.
