<connor> - Now survival is just, the rules have changed man. </connor>
<connor> It used to being a Sigma male man. </connor>
<connor> Now it's hard, now you gotta pay bills. </connor>
<joey> Fuck man </joey>
<joey> - I can't be a Sigma male while I pay the bills, </joey>
<connor> fuck that shit. - Fuck Sigma male, </connor>
<connor> don't pay your bills, number 1. </connor>
<connor> (bright intro music) </connor>
<joey> - Hi everyone. </joey>
<joey> Welcome to another episode of the Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I'm Joey and I'm with the boys. </joey>
<garnt> - Hello. </garnt>
<joey> - Was that the intro? </joey>
<garnt> Man intro, Joey intros have really gone down hill </garnt>
<garnt> in the past year man, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like salty salmon spices </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever the fuck you started. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you? The fucking YouTube comments? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - I like the old intros better. </joey>
<garnt> I like the old studio better. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember when Joey put effort into his intros. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm Joey. You're enjoying (indistinct) on Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when like half of my intros </connor>
<connor> would get the episodes demonetized. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So annoying. We lost like thousands of dollars. </joey>
<joey> Cause Joey's one of those, couldn't resist being Australian. </joey>
<connor> - Cause Joey was just being Australian. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I can't help them. </connor>
<joey> I have to fight the odds to say all the bad words. </joey>
<connor> - Can you guys tell I'm absolutely ripped today. </connor>
<joey> I went to the gym the first time in two months. </joey>
<joey> - I was about, Oh my, what! </joey>
<joey> - I'm absolutely pumped today. </joey>
<joey> - First time in two months? </joey>
<connor> - First time in two months, my body is dying. </connor>
<connor> - So you signed up to the new gym at your new place? </connor>
<connor> - I did. I did. </connor>
<connor> And it's different, and the etiquette is slightly different. </connor>
<joey> So it kind of threw me off. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, did you sign up by yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Impossible. </joey>
<joey> - I don't believe you. I don't believe you. </joey>
<joey> - I was trying to remember how I did it </joey>
<joey> and it was confusing because he was, </joey>
<joey> - It was all a blur. </joey>
<connor> - He was asking things, I was like, yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Well that's just every interaction I have </garnt>
<connor> with a Japanese person in Japan. </connor>
<connor> They ask me something and I just say yes. </connor>
<garnt> - So here's how good my Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> has gotten to this point now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kind of filling in the blanks. </garnt>
<connor> It kind of feels like </connor>
<connor> you're doing one of those Mario Party mini games </connor>
<connor> where you see a part of the sequence and you're like, </connor>
<connor> I think I know where this sequence is going. </connor>
<joey> - It's like going into Mario Party game </joey>
<joey> without looking at the controls, right? </joey>
<connor> Say, I think, I think this is out of the box. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So now I'm getting to the point where </joey>
<connor> I'm accustomed to the normal flow of signing up to things. </connor>
<connor> So I kind of understand what they're saying </connor>
<connor> and I understood most of what was told of me. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of it was just like, </connor>
<connor> Hey, read this. And I'm like, Oh, soon. Soon. </connor>
<joey> - It's just really weird when they pulled the knife out. </joey>
<joey> Maybe started selling my blog, I guess that's tradition. </joey>
<connor> - The rectal exam was a bit weird, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a little longer, but it's so, </garnt>
<garnt> - So did the signing up take as long as the original stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> But, I signed up to Anytime Fitness. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, Anytime Fitness. - Okay. Yeah </garnt>
<connor> - American chain, I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> - Is it? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. Could we fact check that. </garnt>
<joey> - Go fact check that. </joey>
<connor> But listen, when I went in there it looked American. </connor>
<joey> - Because all the gyms, usually white people </joey>
<joey> to advertise their gym </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. They do. </garnt>
<joey> At the front of our old gym, there was like, </joey>
<joey> it was like five banners </joey>
<garnt> of just like really attractive white guys. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never seen a Japanese person be advertised </connor>
<connor> on a gym before in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - It was weird how in Japanese gyms </connor>
<connor> it is just white people is like the standard, I'm like </connor>
<joey> - I think it might just be because like going to the gym </joey>
<garnt> in this country is like a fucking luxury </garnt>
<garnt> because of how expensive that shit is. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not just that, who the fuck, </joey>
<garnt> what Japanese person has time to go to a gym. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. </garnt>
<connor> - Also most of the Japanese people are in shape, right? </connor>
<connor> And the, and the people that aren't in shape. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they care about being in shape. </connor>
<connor> They have like, </connor>
<connor> they're like, I've got everything I need in my life </connor>
<joey> I don't need to be in shape. </joey>
<connor> I've got my seven lessons. </connor>
<joey> - So why are you working out? </joey>
<connor> Honestly, you're just like naturally in shape. </connor>
<connor> Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> - How did you get fat? How did that happen? </connor>
<connor> Basically? - Yeah. Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I signed up and I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm pretty. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Like I said, </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure I had time for this is American. </joey>
<joey> We had a fact check and it wasn't American. </joey>
<connor> I shouldn't, it was America. </connor>
<joey> That sounds American. Like joy fits 24. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That it does not American. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That sounds Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> That sounds like what a Japanese people think. </garnt>
<garnt> American people think that yes, you're joyful in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your fears and it's open 24. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hours. So it's a joint. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, </garnt>
<joey> anytime fitness is much better than I signed up to it. </joey>
<connor> It didn't really know what the was going on. </connor>
<joey> They took my picture. I got the key thing. </joey>
<garnt> I signed my life away. They asked for my card. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. It worked out. </connor>
<connor> So I believe I'm signed up. So that's good. </connor>
<garnt> I walked in yesterday and nobody stopped me. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing I've noticed about moving is like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> having to cancel memberships and having to cancel stuff is </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 times easier than signing up to something, which is. </garnt>
<connor> - Not it's the opposite in the west, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like I was dreading having to cancel my gym membership </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember when we signed up to a gym membership, </garnt>
<garnt> it took like 45 minutes to an hour of just reading forms. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was just like, so me and Cindy, </garnt>
<garnt> you had to go cancel a gym membership. And we said one word, </garnt>
<joey> which was like, we would like to cancel a membership. </joey>
<joey> And we had to sign one piece of paper, took five minutes. </joey>
<joey> Why can't signing up? Be that easy. </joey>
<joey> - No leaving fees. Just like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Use the gym until at the end of. </joey>
<joey> - It's like everything you'll not suppose </joey>
<joey> to do as a business. </joey>
<joey> Right. It's like why? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I love how, </joey>
<joey> how hesitant they are to sign you up to shoot. It's like, </joey>
<joey> are you sure you want to give us money every month? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's why I'm here. It's just let me in for Christ sake. </joey>
<connor> Exactly. The moment you leave. </connor>
<joey> They're like, oh, thank God. </joey>
<connor> He got to take it and get the out. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I have to change over my internet as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was surprisingly painless. Cause they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> no worries. </garnt>
<joey> Did you want to cancel your incident or did you want to move </joey>
<garnt> to a new place? And I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> it's it is which one's easier. And I'm like, it's the same. </joey>
<garnt> It's just what exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, where's the catch? </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the cat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is it like, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's like pulling teeth when you're like signing out </garnt>
<garnt> fully water or gas up in new places. Like, </garnt>
<joey> are you sure you want water in your place? It's like, yes, </joey>
<joey> please. Thank you. </joey>
<garnt> Like I only just, okay. </garnt>
<joey> So I moved to our current place, like what five? </joey>
<joey> Almost six months ago. Right. </joey>
<joey> And I only just finished finalizing by water stuff. </joey>
<joey> What really? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because like for some reason, </joey>
<connor> cause I got like a new bank account and with the Cayman new </connor>
<connor> card and for some reason they didn't allow me to use my new </connor>
<connor> bank account because it's not under the same name or some </connor>
<connor> kind of, well, you said, you said the B word bank in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> But I've done it before at my previous place. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was pretty painless. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, you know, it's just changing a bank. </garnt>
<garnt> How hard could it be famous? Last question. </garnt>
<garnt> I could have been nothing with the word bank in Japan is </garnt>
<joey> ever easy, but what I don't understand, right. </joey>
<joey> Is that okay? So I signed up and I'm like, okay, </joey>
<garnt> I want to change to my new bank because like, you know, </garnt>
<connor> my money situation has changed at this new place. </connor>
<garnt> And they were like, sure, no worries. </garnt>
<connor> We'll send you a form. </connor>
<connor> You can fill out all your information and then mail it back </connor>
<connor> to us. I'm like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> All right. Email was also a thing. </joey>
<joey> But anyway, so there's, </joey>
<joey> so I think about a month after that phone call, finally, </joey>
<garnt> the phone comes in. I was like, all right. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why this took a month to send out, </joey>
<joey> but she'll fill it in five minutes, send it off. </joey>
<joey> Two months later, I get a phone call and they say, ah, </joey>
<connor> so your bank is not able to be used on my door. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, Chateau, Marty. </connor>
<connor> You could have told me that on the phone three months ago. </connor>
<garnt> Why is it now after all this like waiting and sending out a </garnt>
<garnt> form that you'll finally like. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're going to call you up and be like, yeah, by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> the rate of inflation has changed significantly. </garnt>
<garnt> In the past two months, we do details all over again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you been paying for water since then? </garnt>
<garnt> So before it just used to be like a bank transfer, </garnt>
<joey> like every month automatically. </joey>
<joey> But since then I've had to like get the form. </joey>
<joey> They mail you the form that says the amount. </joey>
<joey> And then I have to go to the family mod or the company </joey>
<joey> nearby and do it cash. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Which just like me up because sometimes I don't check my </joey>
<joey> mail every day. </joey>
<joey> And then there was one month where I almost like got my </joey>
<joey> water stopped. Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Because they just straight up, didn't send me my form. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, and then they call me and they're like, oh, </joey>
<joey> so you haven't paid for your thing. I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I haven't give me the floor. What am I supposed to do? </joey>
<joey> Am I supposed to be like, </joey>
<joey> am I supposed to go and go to the light? </joey>
<joey> Am I supposed to go to the company being like, ah, </joey>
<connor> so I don't have the form, but like, trust me. </connor>
<joey> I know you guys. I have to pay. </joey>
<garnt> - I've realized right when I first moved here, I thought, </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God, I can pay my bills at the local company. </garnt>
<connor> Amazing. This is great. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, no, I realize it's just to avoid banks. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It's just like this whole cut. </joey>
<joey> This country has set up a system where the banks just don't </joey>
<joey> need to do anything, </joey>
<joey> but they still got to have all your money. </joey>
<joey> - And they give you like, what is it like 0.0, </joey>
<joey> zero 1% interest assumption. </joey>
<joey> - The interest gets wiped out by every, </joey>
<garnt> every time you want to take out money. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you, you basically, </garnt>
<connor> there's less interest in the P the, </connor>
<connor> the fees you pay for like any service. </connor>
<connor> Japan is the only country where like hiding your money under </connor>
<joey> your mattress might be a better investment than putting it </joey>
<joey> into a bank. Honestly, it's probably safe for this. </joey>
<joey> - And spend money with a country </joey>
<joey> that people just don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's like, why would we give you interest? </joey>
<garnt> If people are going to keep money in that bank? What the. </garnt>
<garnt> - Weirdly is like a weed, </garnt>
<garnt> like money saving mentality in this country, </garnt>
<garnt> even for who have the money to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Spend. So yeah, apparently the, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the reasons why they didn't want to give more money </garnt>
<garnt> out to people during the pandemic is because we just don't </garnt>
<garnt> spend the money. </garnt>
<joey> So they would just be giving money that wouldn't help </joey>
<joey> stimulate the economy because people wouldn't go up. </joey>
<garnt> Even if you gave them a thousand bucks, </garnt>
<joey> most people were just going to keep it going to. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, it does not surprise me </connor>
<joey> because like domestic tourism is </joey>
<connor> massive here. It's just a massive. </connor>
<connor> - But. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 90% of the economy. </connor>
<garnt> - But it's like, </garnt>
<joey> from what I understand of the domestic tourism here, </joey>
<joey> it is like a massive luxury. </joey>
<joey> Most people can't afford to go from what I understand. </joey>
<garnt> And also don't have the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the biggest resource for any Japanese person, </garnt>
<garnt> especially working is time. How'd you have. </garnt>
<joey> - To do anything. If you have go to Rio can, right? </joey>
<joey> If you stay there for two nights, </joey>
<joey> I guarantee you're probably like one out of 100 people who </joey>
<joey> are staying there for more than one night. </joey>
<joey> Everyone leaves the next day. Always I've noticed that, </joey>
<joey> like, if I go and park my car, it's full next day, </joey>
<connor> empty the car park at like two o'clock. </connor>
<connor> Cause no one's checking until like fall. </connor>
<connor> And I'm the only who apparently stayed. </connor>
<connor> Even though it makes more sense to have a hotel room for </connor>
<connor> these two days, </connor>
<connor> because you at least get one full day of the room. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. That, </garnt>
<connor> that never made sense to me because how can you enjoy the </connor>
<connor> day? </connor>
<joey> Because that means you spend most Rio can't and you can't </joey>
<joey> check until three minutes, </joey>
<garnt> all three or four and they weren't there you check in </garnt>
<connor> earlier as well. </connor>
<joey> This space, </joey>
<joey> even if their space with Japanese hotels and it's not just </joey>
<connor> Rio Cannes it's hotels as well. </connor>
<connor> Even if they have space in the hotel, </connor>
<connor> you still can't check in until the check in time. </connor>
<connor> - You'll have the problem though. </connor>
<garnt> Is that like the main demographic that goes to dual cons for </garnt>
<garnt> one night is usually like retirees, right? </garnt>
<connor> And to them, the con itself is the. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> But you know what sucks is the fact that you don't even get </garnt>
<connor> like a full 24 hours when you buy one. </connor>
<connor> Now that's why in my head I'm like, so in efficient, </connor>
<connor> like you should never ever, like, even if you stay in, like, </connor>
<connor> let's say you're staying in Kyoto. Right? </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't, </connor>
<connor> you should never change hotel every night because you're </connor>
<connor> just wasting time wasting, </connor>
<connor> wasting time that you could have in the hotel room. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> You get the breakfast as well or whatever. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> You count your backgrounds to pain in the. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Plus plus like when I'm on holiday, </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm staying in a hotel or Rio camp, </garnt>
<garnt> what I want to relax, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to think about what time I need to wake up the </garnt>
<connor> morning after that's true. </connor>
<connor> I want at least one day when I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> if I want to lie in, I can lie in. </connor>
<garnt> I want to crack some beers open with the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to know me. They be lying until like 10 o'clock, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> But in Rio cans you have to wake up at aides because most </connor>
<connor> people are only staying there for one night. And you know, </connor>
<connor> they, they have to wake up early to check out. </connor>
<connor> - It's all on Japan side of things like having to sleep or </connor>
<joey> getting to sleep in is like the privilege way. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> you would stay here for more than one night without you </garnt>
<garnt> privileged. </garnt>
<garnt> - I, there was when I went to Rio con I went to one and I </garnt>
<joey> remember I was just, I loved it. </joey>
<joey> But then I was absolutely appalled that they made us check </joey>
<joey> out at 9:00 AM. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I was really privileged. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is my privilege. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm 9:00 AM not 9:00 AM broken me a chance to like </joey>
<joey> brush my teeth and wake up. </joey>
<joey> - At night. </joey>
<joey> You have to check out a non am. </joey>
<joey> And I guarantee like earliest check-in is like, for. </joey>
<joey> - Thing. It's like, what are you cleaning for so long? </joey>
<joey> Well, not surely this cannot take that long. </joey>
<connor> The one thing that I love about like American hotels is that </connor>
<connor> whenever I've always asked for late checkout, </connor>
<garnt> or they've always given it to me, like, </garnt>
<garnt> if it's just like an hour extra, </garnt>
<garnt> like the always chill about it, </garnt>
<connor> like sometimes they made me they've charged me like 20, </connor>
<connor> 30 bucks extra, but Japanese hotel. </connor>
<connor> I remember one time I sit in a hotel room in Niigata and the </connor>
<connor> hotel room itself was $90 for an extra hour. Right. </connor>
<connor> Was $70 just for one extra hours to stay in the room past </connor>
<connor> 11. Right. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, whoa. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, did I hear that? </garnt>
<garnt> Correct? Can you, can you say that again? </garnt>
<garnt> My once you don't blink like 70, the room was 90. </garnt>
<garnt> How does that make any sense? Tell me like sit down. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think to them, </garnt>
<garnt> anything past that time limit is an extra day to them. </garnt>
<garnt> That offering late checkout without offering late checkout. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? Like it's like, we got late checkout, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not really late checkout, but it is late checkout. </garnt>
<garnt> Like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes empty as well. It was like Pete Corona. </garnt>
<garnt> There was nobody staying here. </garnt>
<garnt> Why don't you trying to swindle me? </garnt>
<garnt> - They're fighting for their life, man. </garnt>
<garnt> They need that extra money. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, oh, let's try this guy. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll give you I'll. I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> It's not culture. I'll tip you, man. </connor>
<connor> Just leave me alone. Don't charge me 70 bucks for this. </connor>
<connor> What do I need to do? Who do I need to stop? </connor>
<connor> - It's weird though. </connor>
<connor> Because like most like high-end dual cons, especially they, </connor>
<connor> they usually quiet, lenient with a late checkout and stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like we just, </connor>
<connor> myself and AKI and a few others just came back from this </connor>
<connor> deal in Yamanashi. And like they said, </connor>
<connor> the checkout was like nine 30, </connor>
<garnt> but we were there to like 11 and then we'll like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> you're good. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> Then why you kicking us out at nine 30? </joey>
<joey> If that's the case count, </joey>
<joey> did you ask them for late checkout or were they just like, </joey>
<joey> no, no. </joey>
<joey> They said the night before they were like, oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> So it's nine 30 check out. Is that okay? </joey>
<joey> And we were like, we might be here for longer. </joey>
<connor> Is that okay? And then we're like, okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<connor> then why did you tell me that was the checkout time? </connor>
<connor> Like maybe just most Japanese people just don't ask most of </connor>
<joey> these people. Like those are the rules. </joey>
<joey> We must follow. </joey>
<joey> - Really anal about getting there. If it says 12, </joey>
<joey> they are so paranoid about checking out after like one </joey>
<joey> minute after 12. </joey>
<joey> - That's just like Japanese culture in general though. </joey>
<joey> Like we're very strict on time. Like every time was, </joey>
<joey> nobody has. </joey>
<joey> - Tell us. It's like, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to be like fighting for my life. </joey>
<joey> 10 minutes for checkout. Like, oh, I'll come, </joey>
<joey> I'll come 20 minutes after. No one's going to care. </joey>
<joey> No one knows no one has ever cared, man. </joey>
<joey> I'm, I'm trying to enjoy this bathtub. </joey>
<connor> You gave me, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Come on. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, how can, how can you enjoy it when. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're stressed about time? </garnt>
<garnt> And I guess that's why I'm so confused as to why people stay </garnt>
<garnt> in VO cans for like one night, </garnt>
<connor> because I feel like you need a minimum of two nights to </connor>
<connor> enjoy the experience three nights. </connor>
<connor> If you really just want a relaxing weekend or whatever, </connor>
<connor> that's, that's, that's real privilege in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I'd never heard of, </connor>
<connor> anyone's like a Japanese postal staying at a dual con for </connor>
<connor> more than one night because to them it's like, </connor>
<connor> because to them that one night is probably the equivalent to </connor>
<connor> like a week to something it's like, oh my God, </connor>
<connor> finally a night where I'm not working and just get to like, </connor>
<connor> do whatever the I want. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing about your cons is that there's like, </connor>
<connor> they really pressure you to go to breakfast. </connor>
<connor> And I'm already a breakfast guy and especially not a real </connor>
<connor> con breakfast sky, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like I don't need a three-course meal for breakfast, </connor>
<connor> which is basically what those breakfast is. Are what's an. </connor>
<connor> - American breakfast thing. </connor>
<connor> - They're big. </connor>
<connor> - Breakfast makes American breakfast looked time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Death by a thousand bites, bro. </connor>
<connor> Like they just F they keep giving you tiny pieces and they </connor>
<connor> keep coming and they keep, and they won't stop. </connor>
<connor> I, you know, you know, it's over when they finally asked, </connor>
<connor> like, do you want some tea or coffee? </connor>
<connor> But by that point you're already dead. </connor>
<connor> They've already stuffed you stuff. </connor>
<connor> - I actually feel bad when everyone got mad at you about the </connor>
<connor> breakfast tweet and your, and your hotel. </connor>
<joey> Because it was, it was like one of the few times I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I agree with corner. </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. I, you don't need that much for you for breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - You really know. </joey>
<garnt> - I just, you know, I'm, I'm a, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a simple man for breakfast. I don't really eat it. </garnt>
<joey> I tend to eat it. If I've got something big about to happen, </joey>
<joey> like the cycling special. All right. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I'll have some breakfast, </joey>
<garnt> cause that's just a wise choice to exercise. </garnt>
<garnt> But if I'm not exercising, I'm not eating breakfast. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Give me a cereal bar at most. </garnt>
<connor> Right. I'm I'm I'm not really big on it. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather have a nicer lunch. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not hungry when I wake up. No, </joey>
<joey> not all people can just wake up and go like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel like a buffet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, because like, if I have a big breakfast, </joey>
<joey> which I've really enjoyed the big breakfast, </joey>
<connor> cause I'm not hungry for breakfast. </connor>
<connor> Like that means I'm just not going to eat lunch. </connor>
<connor> Or that means I'm going to get hungry for dinner at this </connor>
<joey> really weird time, which is like a bit early for dinner, </joey>
<joey> but like too late for lunch. Right. </joey>
<joey> It's like up my eating schedule. </joey>
<garnt> - The most as being, you know, when you like, </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of hungry when you wake up, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe you didn't eat too much the night before. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But then like, it really, </garnt>
<garnt> really starts to get hungry at like 11. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the worst time. Cause you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's too early for lunch, but I'm holding out. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't want breakfast, breakfast, but I'm, </garnt>
<joey> I'm holding out here. I got them life. </joey>
<joey> I know all my. </joey>
<joey> - I just, I think, I think what it is is that I, </joey>
<joey> I hate the feeling of like having a food coma before </joey>
<joey> 12:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> It's like, </joey>
<garnt> cause you're just tired in the morning and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Down. A bunch of water when you wake up. </garnt>
<joey> Yes. I mean, I'm normally full from that as well. </joey>
<joey> I. </joey>
<joey> - Drink, I drink a lot of water. </joey>
<joey> You drink. </joey>
<joey> - Water a lot more just. </joey>
<joey> - In general. I do that. </joey>
<joey> I don't see why that's unhealthy hydro home. </joey>
<joey> - Probably probably didn't like 500 milliliters of water. </joey>
<joey> - I drink at least like minimum two or three cups. </joey>
<joey> - So just want to get stuck in with my day. </joey>
<joey> Like if I need a shower, I do that. </joey>
<joey> I go start working. I just kinda wanna, </joey>
<joey> I kinda want to get on with my day. I dunno. </joey>
<garnt> I don't really want to sit around. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like huffing having like a fry up. </garnt>
<joey> That that means something that means it's like a special </joey>
<joey> occasion. You know? </joey>
<connor> It's like, I can't have a fry up everyday. </connor>
<connor> I don't even recommend you have a fry every everyday. </connor>
<connor> But like even, Even just cereal to me is just, </connor>
<joey> that's a big meal for breakfast to me. </joey>
<connor> Like a lot of people say breakfast is the most important </connor>
<connor> meal of the day. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how accurate. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's the cereal companies. </connor>
<connor> The cereal companies have. </connor>
<connor> Crikey does making us think that these carbon monstrosities </connor>
<joey> on necessary. I do not need cornflakes. </joey>
<connor> And I wake up. </connor>
<connor> - The most I'll eat for breakfast is single bananas. </connor>
<connor> I'll have this. </connor>
<connor> - There were chemicals in the cornflakes to turn your gay </connor>
<joey> something on the frogs game. </joey>
<garnt> Rusty's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the most I'll have for breakfast is like a banana. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the fruit companies, aren't trying to convince me to </garnt>
<connor> big fruit companies though. </connor>
<joey> Cause it's like the whole, the whole, you know, the whole, </joey>
<joey> the whole chart came from the pyramid of what you should eat </joey>
<connor> and your day and you should eat this much. </connor>
<connor> And it's just complete nonsense pyramid scheme. Well, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And like the whole idea of that, </garnt>
<garnt> you need to eat these corn flakes, </garnt>
<garnt> which offers no nutritional value in the morning and stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - Like that. Like the bottom, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's like, no, it was all pioneered by these, you know, </connor>
<connor> companies, </connor>
<connor> but way back that I had an agenda to promote their stuff. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. And of course, if, if, if you're the Kellogg's team, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna have your scientific research team. Of course, </garnt>
<joey> you're going to be like, Hey, Kellogg's scientific team. </joey>
<garnt> Could you maybe, maybe not. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not looking to have, excuse me, results. </garnt>
<garnt> But like if there was some kind of correlation that said the </garnt>
<garnt> calyx was good for breakfast, really help us out again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not saying you should convince the world that fruit </garnt>
<joey> loops is healthy or anything, </joey>
<connor> but maybe like a hint at the same. </connor>
<joey> - Like </joey>
<joey> That contract for five years is not going to be necessary. </joey>
<connor> No, one's buying cornflakes. </connor>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<joey> I, I, </joey>
<connor> I didn't know what age I just was like no more cereal for </connor>
<garnt> me. I won't do it. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really ever eat cereal. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wasn't, I wasn't brought up in a cereal household, </garnt>
<garnt> so I never got the craving of it. And then a toast house, </garnt>
<garnt> not like cereal to me always tasted like a sweet, </garnt>
<garnt> like a dessert. Right? </garnt>
<joey> You go. </joey>
<connor> - I will say. </connor>
<connor> And I've just shat on cereal for like five minutes. </connor>
<connor> I do like brand flakes. I really realized I love bread. </connor>
<garnt> But like I remember one time, one time as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> when I discovered bran flakes, </garnt>
<connor> I thought these are so good that I just will keep eating </connor>
<connor> them all day. </connor>
<garnt> So I had the whole box in one day and that was me and Coco </garnt>
<joey> puffs. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> And. </garnt>
<joey> - Bran flakes is like. </joey>
<joey> - On crack, like, oh Lord, my toilet activity that day. </joey>
<joey> I was, I imagined they had the, </joey>
<joey> they were filming Lord of the rings, </joey>
<garnt> mortar scenes out of my bathroom. </garnt>
<connor> Then that time it was horrible. I was so much. </connor>
<connor> - Pain. There's nothing worse than an overly fiber. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my. </garnt>
<garnt> - God. I was, I was scared. </garnt>
<connor> I was genuinely scared. I was like 12 years old. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, why do they make them taste so good? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So I'm like, oh I, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I used to have a horrible diet when I was a little kid. </joey>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<connor> - But everyone does, your parents are like, yes, go on it. </connor>
<garnt> Those gummies that were made in the ninja turtles. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause like, cause like my, </garnt>
<garnt> my parents had no retaliation on giving me my sister, </garnt>
<garnt> like Coco puffs and like fruit loops and like MuTu grain and </garnt>
<connor> all the like sugary off cereals. </connor>
<joey> - And you know, now when you're a parent, that it's, it, </joey>
<joey> it seems very difficult because you're already kind of </joey>
<joey> struggling just to just get by. </joey>
<joey> The last thing you want to do is start like comparing cocoa </joey>
<connor> puffs with, you know, it, </connor>
<garnt> it shuts the kid out for 10 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> give them the cocoa pops. Right. </garnt>
<joey> But then later on you're like, all right, </joey>
<joey> maybe I shouldn't have gave him given that a kid's four </joey>
<garnt> slices of Nutella bread, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe 50 grams of sugar for breakfast. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like it was a blessing that I didn't like, </connor>
<connor> I didn't discover the teller until like I wasn't, oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> If I discovered the teller as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> which a lot of people did, </garnt>
<connor> I like my diet would have been destroyed. </connor>
<connor> - My diet was destroyed because it's like, oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> you had cargo puffs for breakfast. </connor>
<joey> And then my mom would pack Nutella sandwiches for lunch. </joey>
<connor> And I was just like, how did I not gain a million pounds? </connor>
<joey> - Luckily when you're young, it's much easier. </joey>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - Young, young and Asian. </connor>
<connor> That's like the life hack right there. Right. </connor>
<connor> - I despised them. </connor>
<connor> My mum kept up with what was healthy because it just meant </connor>
<garnt> that I never got to eat anything fun. </garnt>
<connor> And all the kids around me always had like under the one </connor>
<connor> there's one kid. Okay. </connor>
<joey> And he was a bit overweight, </joey>
<joey> but he always had chocolate spread sandwiches. </joey>
<garnt> And I just think that sounds so cool. </garnt>
<connor> I had a little chocolate bread, man. </connor>
<joey> I'm out here eating my cheese sandwich, like a peasant, </joey>
<connor> like a king. </connor>
<connor> He's getting chocolate spread with a chocolate yogurt, bro. </connor>
<connor> I'm like eating even good. But then, </connor>
<connor> but then when he wasn't eating </connor>
<connor> his parents unfortunately set him up to fail. </connor>
<garnt> It was a good when I tried it, I thought, oh, </garnt>
<connor> this doesn't taste. </connor>
<connor> Not no chocolate spread. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't like chocolate mousse and all that. </connor>
<joey> I didn't really like that. And. </joey>
<joey> - I may maybe just because he wasn't normalized for me. </joey>
<joey> I hardly had it. So every time I did have it, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I'm having chocolate for a meal. </joey>
<connor> This is, this is a lifestyle right here. </connor>
<connor> This is. </connor>
<connor> - I love cheese, strings, cheese straight. </connor>
<garnt> - Awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fun. Even now I enjoy doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I definitely enjoy this process. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't even like trying to get it as thin, </garnt>
<garnt> as possible as well. And just like. </garnt>
<joey> - Try to get like that. Perfect. </joey>
<connor> Like it's just like. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I dunno if they have this, they. </connor>
<connor> - Have shoestring satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - Southeast Asia, two strings. </connor>
<joey> They don't think they do. </joey>
<garnt> It's just like this. Like. </garnt>
<joey> - It's in all the imports. Like supermarket. </joey>
<joey> - It's not real cheese. I don't know how they do. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know how they get real. </garnt>
<joey> - Cheese, but it tastes better than real cheese in a sense. </joey>
<joey> But then it doesn't. But. </joey>
<connor> - Like it's like cheese flavored plastic. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like playing a mini game to eat cheese. </garnt>
<joey> And for some reason that just adds the flavor. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I used to, </joey>
<connor> I used to have to do this thing when I was little. </connor>
<joey> I know if I'm the only one, but like I would, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't like rip it and then immediately eat it. </joey>
<joey> I would kind of rip it and try and like create a perfect </joey>
<garnt> pile. </garnt>
<connor> - Hannibal Lecter. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I like put it in a rhino, like my finest. </garnt>
<joey> - My name is Joseph. </joey>
<joey> I'm 12 years old. I live in Melbourne. </joey>
<joey> School cafeteria. </joey>
<garnt> - Making perfectly cut off string cheese, this flying it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Never had a cheese missing out. </joey>
<joey> - You're missing the flavor is. But. </joey>
<connor> - I feel, </connor>
<garnt> I feel if you're an adult and you've never had string cheese </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid, it's kind of a toll hurdle to like get. </garnt>
<connor> - Th there are some things that I try nowadays in Japan and </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I've never had a Japanese childhood, </connor>
<connor> but I feel the childhood in this. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Like. </joey>
<garnt> - Some of the stuff we tried in the company episodes right. </garnt>
<garnt> With with that crisp thing that was like, </garnt>
<connor> that was just like one big it or whatever and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> I've I can feel, I can see myself eating this as a kid. </joey>
<joey> - I also have like the fish cakes, which is vital. </joey>
<joey> The like, oh, </joey>
<garnt> what the kamaboko maybe like the fish and cheese. </garnt>
<joey> - Or something. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I had both of those when I was a kid, I was like. </joey>
<connor> - Bro. </connor>
<joey> - Just like, just anything that was like of that size. </joey>
<joey> I would just try. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like I realize there's some things that if you didn't grow </connor>
<joey> up with it, oh, you probably wouldn't enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> Like in Thailand, in Thailand, </joey>
<garnt> we have this snack called Tato, which is, </garnt>
<joey> which is basically just dried fish. </joey>
<garnt> - Quiet Southeast Asia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is. </garnt>
<joey> - Just like, what, what is it? </joey>
<joey> It's it's just like dried fish. Right. </joey>
<joey> It's just. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, cause when I think of Tara, </connor>
<garnt> I think it was the purple a light sweet potato. I. </garnt>
<joey> - Have no interest associated with. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. So, </garnt>
<garnt> so I remember like eating this as a kid and thinking this </garnt>
<garnt> tastes amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I brought some back to England and I gave some to my </garnt>
<garnt> mates and they had, they had a bite and they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is just fish food. I'm like this isn't fish food. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's that? It's that, it's that one. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> The fish drinks basically fishing, like cheese strings, </garnt>
<garnt> but we fish. </garnt>
<joey> - The fish and they did this. </joey>
<joey> - Shrinks out of everything. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I just hear that story and I'm just like, oh, </connor>
<joey> there's you might as over here being like first time. </joey>
<joey> - I've never. </joey>
<joey> - Got mom every time. Every time I like, </joey>
<joey> cause I grew up with Vegemite as well. </joey>
<joey> Then every time I give that to someone who's known an </joey>
<connor> Australian and they eat and they're like, oh, </connor>
<connor> this tastes like poison. It. </connor>
<connor> - Tastes good on toast. It's brilliant. </connor>
<connor> - Lovely on toast. </connor>
<connor> - I would just put it on toast. </connor>
<connor> There's a spread on tasting. </connor>
<connor> - We can make it work, but put beans. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't, you don't what else is actually good at, </garnt>
<garnt> with is on rice. </garnt>
<garnt> Made your mind on rice is actually not bad because if you </garnt>
<connor> think about it, it's the same thing as putting it on top. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know who you offended more Australian than you or </connor>
<connor> like the Japanese in you, but you, you, </connor>
<garnt> you somehow like offended both your ancestors at the same </garnt>
<connor> time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> Like I definitely got disowned the moment I said that on </joey>
<joey> camera, A rice farm and just died some way </joey>
<connor> I try to once, because I, I actually saw it on Japanese, </connor>
<joey> on Japanese YouTube though, because that will like, okay. </joey>
<connor> So my Australian friend brought back this veggie my thing, </connor>
<connor> I had it on toast thought it was disgusting. </connor>
<connor> But then I thought I'm Japanese put that on rice. </connor>
<connor> Anything's good on rice fried it. </connor>
<joey> And apparently the guy said it was good. So I was like, </joey>
<connor> all right, well, </connor>
<connor> if the guy on the internet said it was good at Buffalo, </connor>
<connor> obviously. </connor>
<joey> - It must be true. </joey>
<joey> - It must be true. If a Japanese guy said it must be. </joey>
<connor> - The truth of the week says it's good. I'll try it. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> Exactly. So I tried it and I was like, okay, you know what? </joey>
<connor> Not as good as on toast, but possible. </connor>
<garnt> - Possibly. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I sorry to get back to the gym to bring it up again. </joey>
<joey> I was in the gym and I was watching an anime to go along </joey>
<garnt> with such gym experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the only time you watch animate, man. </garnt>
<garnt> You've been talking about watching animate a lot recently, </garnt>
<garnt> twice. </garnt>
<connor> - Twice. </connor>
<connor> - That is a lot. </connor>
<connor> - More times than me. </connor>
<connor> - I want to watch something. </connor>
<connor> And then I saw the new season of backy was out. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, well, this is good, Jim, of course. </joey>
<garnt> And I watched it in like my God, </garnt>
<joey> if you haven't started watching Becky, like you need. </joey>
<garnt> - To, I haven't seen this new season yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it like. </garnt>
<joey> - This is probably the greatest season </joey>
<garnt> of television I've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> This was so funny. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause cause Paul three Bucky, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the new season is my favorite bulky bottom line. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly. I've I was like trying to work out, </garnt>
<garnt> but I just couldn't stop laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like just some of the plot points honestly puts Jojo to </garnt>
<connor> shame at times stupid. This. </connor>
<garnt> - Show is when it really starts to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get fun back is I don't even know how to explain it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just men with muscles fighting. And it's just so funny. </garnt>
<joey> - Basically, a kid who's like, </joey>
<joey> I want to be the strongest creature on the planet. </joey>
<joey> And then he does everything he can to be the strongest. </joey>
<joey> - There's no way we can describe in words what back here is </joey>
<connor> kinda like it's kinda like Joe, Joe, </connor>
<connor> you kind of just have to explain. </connor>
<connor> - That's the reason why it doesn't do is as well as jokes. </connor>
<connor> I think, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't have like an aesthetic that is quite as </connor>
<garnt> appealing. The stranger judge has so much, </garnt>
<joey> George has so much style and stuff to go around with it. </joey>
<joey> But, but I think Becky is always more stupid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Lucky. </joey>
<garnt> Kiska is one of those like illustrators where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> are you really good at drawing? Or are you really sharp? </garnt>
<garnt> So I like, like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> There were some things where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's an amazing show. And then other scenes I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think this man has ever seen a human being in his </garnt>
<garnt> life. </garnt>
<garnt> That is not how anatomy works. It's. </garnt>
<garnt> - You take a character and you're like, </garnt>
<connor> let's make this a muscly character. And you're like, well, </connor>
<connor> what proportions do you think is reasonable, </connor>
<connor> reasonable for a muscly character. </connor>
<connor> And then the author just went, all right, </connor>
<connor> multiply that by 10. And then that's the, that's like the. </connor>
<connor> - Every character, every single character, </connor>
<joey> even the weak characters, I like built like brick house. </joey>
<connor> Right. It's insane. </connor>
<joey> And like, I could tell you some plot points and I will, </joey>
<connor> and they won't even spoil it for you. </connor>
<connor> So you won't make any sense. Right. </connor>
<connor> So at one point during the show, the main protagonist, </connor>
<connor> Becky start shadowboxing right. </connor>
<connor> - Is it the mantis? </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, that as well. </connor>
<connor> But so you start, this is, </connor>
<joey> it's like a 10 year old kid and he's like, look, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to show you that I'm going to fight an opponent. </joey>
<joey> And so he starts fighting the air and then he starts </joey>
<joey> fighting Mike Tyson. Oh. </joey>
<joey> - This one, this. </joey>
<joey> - One is Tyson appears out of thin air and Mike Tyson isn't </joey>
<connor> there. But Mike Tyson is lending blows and he physically, </connor>
<joey> physically gets hurt. </joey>
<joey> And then he's fighting him back and then the kids can see </joey>
<joey> the spirit of Mike Tyson. </joey>
<connor> And then this just happens. </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, and then the main character is like, </connor>
<connor> oh yeah, Mike Tyson's week. </connor>
<connor> And then he just summons a praying mantis that beats the out </connor>
<joey> of him. But then he starts fighting the praying mantis, </joey>
<connor> this imaginary. </connor>
<connor> - In a, in a room, right? </connor>
<connor> - Like some military guys like, Hey, come fight. </connor>
<joey> And then he's like, no. </joey>
<connor> And then he just kidnapped George Bush and it's like, </connor>
<connor> what's going on? What is. </connor>
<joey> - What is going on? </joey>
<joey> Then he. </joey>
<joey> - Kidnaps in this plot. He kidnaps George Bush. </joey>
<joey> So he can go to prison. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But. </joey>
<joey> - Like, so then he can beat up all the prisoners. </joey>
<connor> - Why would George Bush help you go to prison? If, if, </connor>
<connor> if you kidnap him, </connor>
<connor> they would just watch it doesn't make any sense. </connor>
<connor> - I love how is just like it is. So with the times, like, </connor>
<joey> you know exactly when Paul three was also. </joey>
<joey> - Watching Becky, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, </joey>
<joey> if you only learned about America through trash tastes, </joey>
<joey> it's, This they say about it. </joey>
<connor> There's this one, </connor>
<connor> I had to pause it cause I just laughed my off. </connor>
<connor> And this is one point where this American prison guard is </connor>
<connor> about to die. And the two Japanese guys, one of them saves, </connor>
<connor> the Japanese guy saves the American and the other Japanese </connor>
<connor> goes, why would you save an American? </connor>
<connor> He's never going to care about you. He's American. </connor>
<connor> I just post it. And he was like, what, what does that mean? </connor>
<connor> What is the, like, what does this trust? </connor>
<connor> - The Americans like compassion. What is the, what is that? </connor>
<connor> - Compassion and my country. Why would you save it America? </connor>
<connor> They wouldn't care about. </connor>
<joey> - Holy. </joey>
<joey> My FA my favorite Bucky's on the, I'll never figure. </joey>
<joey> And I can't wait for them to adopt this. </joey>
<garnt> I think it's part four. </garnt>
<joey> And it's when Barack Obama comes out. </joey>
<garnt> Cause he gets in the manga. He's like newly elected. </garnt>
<joey> Right? So it's like, you know, </joey>
<joey> the era of when this was written and like how my usual, </joey>
<connor> like the main, </connor>
<joey> like the dad guy who was like the most powerful guy, </joey>
<joey> he's like, </joey>
<joey> he goes to talk to the bomber because of course he can. </joey>
<garnt> - Sit down to any page you want. </garnt>
<connor> Like the main antagonist could just sit down with anyone </connor>
<joey> just because he's so built different bill. </joey>
<joey> - But like, but like Obama at first is like, </joey>
<joey> I've heard of that, man. </joey>
<joey> I don't trust him. </joey>
<connor> I don't trust them at all. But like, </connor>
<connor> I need to see you see the real deal. </connor>
<joey> I need to see if he's the real deal. </joey>
<joey> So then he comes into the room and he's like, show me, </joey>
<joey> you're the real deal. And, and use your, and use your Argos. </joey>
<joey> All right, bet. </joey>
<joey> And he grabs like a handful of sand and he crushes it in his </joey>
<joey> hand and turns it into a time and. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know what he's going to do. </joey>
<joey> - And then Obama's like you all the real one. </joey>
<joey> - So there's like, this show is muffly. </joey>
<joey> If you haven't watched Mackie, </joey>
<joey> you are honestly doing yourself. This is so fun. </joey>
<joey> Let's get past the start. It can be a little jenky, </joey>
<joey> but like the animate is really good. It's really fun. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I'm surprised. </joey>
<joey> I mean, culture just hasn't picked up on bikinis, right? </joey>
<garnt> Because so much of this is meme of. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so funny. So apparently right, </connor>
<joey> because these there's these three characters, Bacchae the, </joey>
<joey> the, usually a Hanmer and Oliver biscuit. </joey>
<joey> The other guy was just three guys. </joey>
<garnt> They're so dangerous and so powerful because their muscles </garnt>
<joey> right that half of the GPS in the world is, </joey>
<connor> is on in the air solely to track this only the track them in </connor>
<connor> this world. </connor>
<connor> And so whenever they run above two kilometers an hour, </connor>
<garnt> the GPS has all the GPS in the world has to stop working </garnt>
<connor> just to track these. </connor>
<connor> So there's a whole section where they explained that when </connor>
<connor> people are driving or using their phones, </connor>
<joey> the GPS just doesn't work correctly. </joey>
<connor> Because some of these characters decided to go for a light </connor>
<connor> jog. </connor>
<connor> You can't make this out of this. </connor>
<connor> - I'm telling you like, that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> If people, if you thought Jojo was ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Judges witches. </connor>
<connor> It could be as ridiculous as Baki at time. </connor>
<connor> - And you combine that with </connor>
<garnt> then also another part in another </garnt>
<garnt> season where you drove a Honda again, </garnt>
<garnt> the main antagonist meats, Mohammed Ali, and he, and he's, </garnt>
<connor> he's like, you could, </connor>
<connor> you can't beat me because you took off to do important human </connor>
<connor> rights things. I respect you because you did. </connor>
<connor> And it's like. </connor>
<connor> - What's going on? </connor>
<joey> - Isn't one of the antagonists, like Mohammed Ali's son. </joey>
<connor> - But like respect to Mohammed Ali. </connor>
<connor> But even though he's weaker than him, because he went to, </connor>
<connor> he took time about his career to, to argue for civil rights. </connor>
<connor> Great. We love the guy, but then junior is just like cocky. </connor>
<connor> And then he gets like. </connor>
<connor> - But then he like kidnaps, like the main, </connor>
<connor> like loving just the pocket and then gets beaten up by like </connor>
<connor> five dudes for five days straight, </connor>
<connor> just like over and over and over. </connor>
<joey> There was also the scene I love where it's like, honey, </joey>
<connor> I'm a coder. Who's like my favorite character. </connor>
<joey> He's like, he he's like bored. </joey>
<joey> So he's just like, oh man, everyone's a week. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's way. No one can stand up to me except one man, </joey>
<joey> call my manager, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I'm going to go pay him a visit. </joey>
<joey> So he goes and pays him a visit. </joey>
<joey> It's just like walking down the street. And he's like, </joey>
<joey> so we gonna stop fighting. And he's like, right here, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, that's in the middle of a crowd. </joey>
<joey> But then a kid comes up and is like, oh my God, you draw. </joey>
<joey> I'm a massive fan of you. And like handsome, like a squishy, </joey>
<connor> right? It's like, can you sign this squishy? </connor>
<joey> And you know, normally you think he pulls out a pen? </joey>
<joey> Does the sign? No, this is a humble user. </joey>
<connor> He's built different. What he does is he stab, </connor>
<connor> he gets his finger. </connor>
<joey> He stabs the Shishi and then slices it into four quarters </joey>
<joey> with his finger. </joey>
<garnt> So it's like all broken apart. And the kid's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God, thank you so much, honey. </garnt>
<garnt> Avocado is like, man, </garnt>
<connor> I'd be happier with that than a signature. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, what is this? </garnt>
<joey> And then they start beating the out of each other. </joey>
<joey> - It is insane. Like, </joey>
<joey> I I'm sure if you don't know anything about Becky, </joey>
<joey> that probably sat me no sense. </joey>
<joey> And it doesn't make any sense. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't in context. </connor>
<connor> I still don't quite understand what the story is. </connor>
<connor> And I've watched three seasons. I don't get the point of. </connor>
<connor> - You watched the Netflix and that's six seasons on even the </connor>
<connor> beginning of the story. Cause Netflix seasons are like. </connor>
<connor> - Starts a season. </connor>
<connor> It's like a. </connor>
<connor> - Sequel to an anime or like the Mongo that came out like </connor>
<garnt> decades ago. And then it's been going along with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. GI has gotten a lot better as well. </connor>
<garnt> On the season. The CGI has kind of jank in the first season. </garnt>
<garnt> I think still watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I, I would say like the animation, </garnt>
<connor> especially compared to Joe, Joe isn't as good, </connor>
<connor> but like you don't watch it for the animation. </connor>
<connor> You watch it for like the bat crazy stuff. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, it's just insane how they decide fights. </connor>
<connor> And it is like, </connor>
<garnt> imagine if a world was decided purely by muscles, like. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like muscles can solve every world issue </connor>
<connor> in the world. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God guns in this world are meaningless compared to </connor>
<connor> muscles like guns don't do any guns or suggest guns for </connor>
<connor> normal human beings. </connor>
<garnt> And they don't operate in the same world for the characters </garnt>
<garnt> too. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like every single character is an Avengers level of </garnt>
<garnt> threats. That's just what, that's just what it is. </garnt>
<connor> Right? Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's every single time you think you've met the </connor>
<joey> strongest character? No, they, he, </joey>
<joey> they introduce some new character that is even stronger as </joey>
<garnt> the main. </garnt>
<garnt> - One in the pile to Regan. Is it the. </garnt>
<connor> - Prehistoric guy? Is it the first human? </connor>
<connor> - No, sir. </connor>
<joey> I believe they've done what they did with the first season </joey>
<joey> up. They sent me one season split into two. </joey>
<joey> I think that's what we've done here. </joey>
<joey> So the first arc is just through the prison. </joey>
<connor> And then the next doc is the, prehistorical the pickle. </connor>
<connor> This, </connor>
<connor> this arc opens up with a press conference from like a safari </connor>
<connor> where like all these people died to this giant mammoth. </connor>
<connor> - Elephant, which killed hundreds of people and, and, </connor>
<connor> and animals. </connor>
<connor> And in this press conference, he's like one man killed this, </connor>
<connor> this 500 meter tall. </connor>
<joey> Like, and then like the press conference was like, no, no, </joey>
<joey> no it didn't. And then it's like, what is this? </joey>
<joey> What is so dumb? </joey>
<joey> That's what I love about Bucky is that every character has </joey>
<joey> such as this bat crazy backstory, </joey>
<connor> the way they get introduced with this like crazy backstory. </connor>
<connor> And you have like Speedwagon, </connor>
<connor> like basically a narrator just going over their entire bags </connor>
<garnt> with him, doing all of these like batshit crazy things. </garnt>
<connor> And you think he can't get crazier until it does. </connor>
<connor> Every time. </connor>
<connor> - I've almost caught off to the manga. And I'm like, how, </connor>
<garnt> how did they top the first human ever who ever lived? </garnt>
<garnt> Who beat a Tyrannosaurus? </garnt>
<joey> - I, </joey>
<joey> even though I know sort of what the next doctor about that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> This is an arc about them fighting prehistoric creatures, </joey>
<joey> right? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of what the. </joey>
<connor> - And they're like, </connor>
<connor> let's see if they stand up to the humans. </connor>
<connor> - Today, like Jurassic park instead, </connor>
<joey> if they turned into test the humans, </joey>
<joey> instead of like seeing what the dinosaurs could do, </joey>
<joey> it's like, </joey>
<joey> let's see what the humans can do against the dinosaurs </joey>
<connor> because humans, humans are too boring in this world. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's just like every, </connor>
<connor> no normal martial arts master is good enough anymore now. </connor>
<connor> But it's just so funny because like the main protagonist, </connor>
<connor> which is the main character, </connor>
<garnt> his dad is just like bat insane. And also just hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just so insane. Some of the he's actually insane. </garnt>
<joey> The fact there's a whole whole scene dedicated to him </joey>
<joey> watching his son having sex. </joey>
<joey> - And that was, that was what sold me on the first. </joey>
<joey> Honestly. </joey>
<joey> - If I can't sell you on Becky is that </joey>
<garnt> there is a scene where </garnt>
<garnt> he is about to lose his virginity. </garnt>
<garnt> And his dad comes in giving him advice in like the creepiest </garnt>
<garnt> way. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he was like, Louis, please watch this show. </garnt>
<joey> It is insane. The fact that people haven't watched, </joey>
<joey> this is just mindblowing. He. </joey>
<connor> - Literally squats down next to the bed and says, eat. </connor>
<garnt> - Her, Every day. </garnt>
<joey> - Every day. And see your instincts. </joey>
<joey> Let your instincts take over. Become an animal. </joey>
<joey> When you want. </joey>
<joey> - Bucky tons. </joey>
<joey> - Super sand levels. </joey>
<connor> - He loses a genius. </connor>
<connor> They have, they have like a, </connor>
<joey> because like they actually have sex and they turned the sex </joey>
<connor> scene into what Jo Jo fights like, oh, </connor>
<connor> sex sex is like a bat. </connor>
<joey> - I'm a, be honest though. </joey>
<joey> It is in real life. </joey>
<joey> You like trying to think of like 10 things of this. </joey>
<joey> Make sure you do it right. Accurate, sexy. </joey>
<garnt> The enemy changed my mind. No on top of that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Not only is the, </garnt>
<joey> is this the hyper sexy anatomy immediately after that? </joey>
<joey> You don't need this. No. </joey>
<garnt> Goku super say, and I'm going to save the world. </garnt>
<garnt> This man powered up more than GOCO ever wishes. He could, </garnt>
<garnt> by losing his virginity. </garnt>
<connor> These people can sense that this man lost his virginity. </connor>
<joey> They did. </joey>
<joey> He was fighting. </joey>
<joey> - Because one of the prison guys like trusted, come. </joey>
<connor> - On. No, no, no, not one, </connor>
<connor> two before this main character was so weak that he couldn't </connor>
<connor> face one of these dudes one-on-one after sex. </connor>
<connor> Two of them come in and they cannot face it like this man's </connor>
<connor> aura. </connor>
<connor> This man's Nan has increased so much from busting a nut. </connor>
<connor> Like they can't even think of some that develop. </connor>
<joey> - Like hockey power. </joey>
<joey> - And then it's like gone, </joey>
<joey> turned into his dad after nothing. </joey>
<joey> It's insane. But it's this whole episode was like, </joey>
<connor> you had to pause it and just be like, what the is going on? </connor>
<joey> Please watch back. It is insane. </joey>
<connor> I cannot add this new season was so fun. </connor>
<connor> I was going to only watch like two episodes have binged it </connor>
<connor> all in one day. So fun. </connor>
<connor> It's insane to watch it. </connor>
<joey> If you go into the mindset of this is going to be a kind of </joey>
<joey> stupid Jojo esque show. I guarantee you will love it. </joey>
<connor> If you can watch it with the boys, the is hilarious. </connor>
<joey> - We need a Bucky out of context and a compilation </joey>
<joey> of barking. So many out of context, </joey>
<joey> Jo Jo memes and compilations, </joey>
<garnt> but there's nothing for Bucky now. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't, I don't it's it deserves like it's just every, </connor>
<connor> I can think of so many clubs, </connor>
<connor> so many clips of this show that could deserve to be being, </connor>
<joey> oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my Lord. </joey>
<garnt> - Fight for my life about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Going back to the gym though. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like how you watch this when you're doing the gym. </garnt>
<garnt> Because like the last thing I tried watching anime while </garnt>
<joey> going to the gym. Cause I'm just like, yeah, dubbed. </joey>
<joey> But like, do you know what? </joey>
<joey> Get too absorbed into whatever you're watching. </joey>
<joey> Cause I can't like, I can't concentrate on like working out. </joey>
<joey> If I'm like absorbed into a show. </joey>
<connor> - Right here. I want to get absorbed </connor>
<connor> in anything but running. </connor>
<connor> I want to take my mind off. Cause the moment I, I, </connor>
<garnt> I want to be staring at my screen and not at that calorie </garnt>
<joey> counter or the distance treadmill. </joey>
<garnt> - Bike is like, perfect. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like is amazing because you can just, </joey>
<joey> if you have something that's like an hour 30, </joey>
<garnt> just go and watch. Like if you're, </garnt>
<connor> if you want to watch something, </connor>
<connor> like I will do my best to just be like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to watch this just on the bike. </connor>
<connor> Cause I, you know, I, to me, </connor>
<joey> the viewing experience is nearly identical. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's not as good. And you're not as comfortable. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to say it's the same thing. But you know, if, </joey>
<connor> if it's something that you don't care about too much, </connor>
<garnt> you know, it's not that one film you've been waiting for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like every time I've watched something while trying to </garnt>
<garnt> work out. Cause I remember I, when, </garnt>
<garnt> when I still went to the gym. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was always watching YouTube or watching. </garnt>
<connor> - YouTube videos and stuff. I think, </connor>
<connor> I feel like YouTube is fine, </connor>
<connor> but like with anime I tried watching like the new season of </connor>
<connor> my hair, academia, </connor>
<connor> I used to do Bosch and I realized I would watch an episode </connor>
<connor> and then I would not retain anything that happened in that </connor>
<connor> episode. I watch watch the next episode and I would like, </connor>
<connor> I'd be so confused as to what was going on. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> Oh wow. Okay. </connor>
<joey> See, I can normally follow along. </joey>
<joey> And I mean, because I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> when you're doing your you're working out, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. You're working out for, you're doing the, </joey>
<joey> the sets for like what a minute, minute, half, </joey>
<connor> two minutes someone's gonna call me, like, </connor>
<joey> you're doing it all wrong. What the? </joey>
<connor> But like, you know, you get, you get on and off time. </connor>
<connor> So I normally just, I have it down below, like on the floor. </connor>
<connor> So I do my through my reps and I just kind of watch like one </connor>
<garnt> minute and America next rep and then set it, tell me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I, I can't do that. </garnt>
<connor> Like if I'm doing reps, </connor>
<garnt> like I need to be like fully concentrated. I need to, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - You said, it is really hard to, to focus. </garnt>
<connor> When the, tell me about this GPS, </connor>
<garnt> he's like laughing too much to do this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bucky would be impossible to watch at. </garnt>
<garnt> - The gym like that. All them, </garnt>
<connor> the most muscular men on earth talking about like the insane </connor>
<garnt> amount of strength and muscles. They have </garnt>
<garnt> doing a squat while someone is talking about how they gain </garnt>
<garnt> their muscles. And backy is like the most like pumped thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you, can't not go for the extra wrap, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's insane. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> But I, yeah, it is, it is kind of difficult. </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of have to pick and choose. </garnt>
<garnt> Now in my head, I have like media for the gym. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, this is gym media. </connor>
<connor> This is stuff that I can watch in the gym. </connor>
<connor> Cause I don't care too much about it, </connor>
<connor> but I want to watch it. </connor>
<garnt> And if I, if I care a lot, </garnt>
<connor> I'll stop watching it after one episode and save it. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I like it. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I'll save it for when I want to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - If not the secret to getting Connor, to watch anime, </connor>
<joey> going to the gym. </joey>
<joey> - Basically getting me to do something right. </joey>
<connor> Maybe not watch, but obviously right now I've, </connor>
<garnt> I've not been watching anything at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been just watching league of legends, but. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of. </connor>
<garnt> - Hard. I'm very tired today. </garnt>
<connor> I had four hours of sleep because I've been watching league </connor>
<connor> of legends. Pretty good. </connor>
<joey> I would talk about it. </joey>
<garnt> - I know Joey's not interested in the toilet quickly, </garnt>
<joey> but basically it's been one of the most hypers years in </joey>
<connor> group stages, every fight every year. </connor>
<connor> - Well the harvest, </connor>
<connor> the legends is probably the only sport I try to keep up with </connor>
<connor> or at least for the worlds, it is really entertaining. </connor>
<connor> And I'm sure. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure if I understood the rules, </connor>
<connor> I think I'd really get into it as well. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I like watching e-sports stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> but what I actually enjoy about worlds specifically, well, </garnt>
<garnt> does that you get, </garnt>
<garnt> I get the same feeling from worlds as I get watching, </garnt>
<connor> like say the world cup or something, right. </connor>
<connor> Where like, even, </connor>
<garnt> even in the smallest stages you have like really small </garnt>
<garnt> regions and you have like regions that are like across the </garnt>
<connor> world. </connor>
<garnt> And even though you have like certain countries and certain </garnt>
<garnt> regions that are stronger than others. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Like it's still feels like a global event where you see fans </connor>
<joey> from all over the world. Especially when we had a crowds, </joey>
<connor> just like cheering for even like teams that are not so </connor>
<connor> well-known that are like up and coming regions. </connor>
<connor> And I really like, I love that in sporting events when it's, </connor>
<garnt> when it's not just like one kind of country, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like a global kind of. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, but that's what I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. It's like, </garnt>
<joey> I feel like league for me would be like any other sport that </joey>
<joey> I just don't know the rules of. Like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like once you teach me the rules of like, </joey>
<joey> what's going on, like how, how, you know, </joey>
<garnt> what's a good play. </garnt>
<joey> - What's not a problem is you need </joey>
<garnt> to let them to play league. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. But I don't want to do that a hundred percent. </garnt>
<connor> You don't want it. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you know, it's like, again, </connor>
<joey> like learning any sport, right. </joey>
<joey> It's like once you know the rules, I think it, </joey>
<garnt> you can have a really fun time of just watching it, </garnt>
<garnt> watching it and playing it. It's totally different. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the reason I got into league as these players, </garnt>
<garnt> as opposed to like, maybe like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember trying to get into the Overwatch e-sports scene. </garnt>
<garnt> me. And oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the game of sides, </garnt>
<garnt> which I don't think is as good of a spectator sport as say </garnt>
<garnt> league or something. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember I went to an event with our, </garnt>
<garnt> with our mates and I found out that they had teams from like </garnt>
<joey> different cities from across the world. Right. </joey>
<garnt> I was really upset. </garnt>
<joey> And they were like, oh my God, they have a team from London. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember what the exact name, what Spitfire, </joey>
<joey> London Spitfire team from London, Spitfire. </joey>
<joey> I was like, great. </joey>
<connor> We've got some representation from the UK and London. </connor>
<joey> And I remember the team walks out and everyone is Korean. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, why would you lie to me? </joey>
<garnt> Like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me? Like they confused. </garnt>
<garnt> I understand it. But it's like a franchise model. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. It's kind of like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like football teams where you sell the slot to whoever does </garnt>
<joey> it. But. </joey>
<connor> - They had, there was no London who was. </connor>
<connor> - Not a single Londoner. </connor>
<connor> - To my nose. </connor>
<garnt> The way the Overwatch had done it is that they had these </garnt>
<garnt> team names decided you could buy in and you getting, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if you could choose, but yeah. </garnt>
<connor> It kind of ruined it because you know, as much as you know, </connor>
<connor> you know, league of legends has so many, </connor>
<connor> you're allowed to bring in foreign imports. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So there's like a maximum cap to how many people you can </connor>
<connor> import from other countries. Right. </connor>
<connor> - If you're rooting for Europe. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'd like to see Europe. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a Japanese rugby team at one point with a less </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese place than. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> And this year in league, like the Jew, </connor>
<garnt> there was a Japanese team that qualified for the main event. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's the first time I ever have in history because no </garnt>
<joey> one in Japan who gives a about league of legends. </joey>
<connor> So it's just like really small team quantified for the main </connor>
<connor> event. And I'm just like, it. </connor>
<connor> This is the plot line right here. What the? </connor>
<garnt> Why am I watching animated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Strong Neesha? But I just struggles. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause there's not a big PC culture. Hell no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately I don't really see a PC culture taking off any </garnt>
<garnt> time soon. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's crawling, but it's, </garnt>
<connor> I don't think it's like dedicated to games likely. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I think it's just mobile gaming is just too massive. </connor>
<connor> It is. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> For like people, because as we said, people don't have. </connor>
<connor> - But like stuff like apex is blowing up. </connor>
<connor> So I think that's been a real big push for PCC </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Apex is doing very well in vitro, </connor>
<connor> but it's only just especially, at least in Japan very much. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Think. </joey>
<joey> Cause I think before that, </joey>
<joey> like the biggest PC game we had here was like pub G. </joey>
<connor> Oh yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But, and like that was like the biggest in the dirt. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that was like the biggest that I'd ever gotten </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan in terms of like a PC game. </garnt>
<garnt> - PC, like bangs are popping up a bit in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> They are a. </joey>
<joey> - PC cafe gaming cafes. </joey>
<connor> - Chill because we have it in London, </connor>
<joey> but that was one and it was so God expensive. </joey>
<joey> It was like $15 an hour. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. And it was it's like, it's it's I understand that you, </joey>
<garnt> you know, you're a business, </garnt>
<garnt> you got to make money and London real estate isn't cheap. </garnt>
<connor> But also it has to come on. </connor>
<connor> There's gotta be a reasonable amount. I've got a PC at home, </connor>
<connor> come on like five bucks an hour. I'll buy food. </connor>
<connor> I'll promise. I'll buy food. </connor>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> I, I don't. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a bit of a rip bit too. </joey>
<joey> - Much because yeah. </joey>
<garnt> If I want to have a full gaming session with the boys in the </garnt>
<garnt> cafe, I spent like a hundred bucks, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> I can, </garnt>
<garnt> but if I want to play the entire steam library for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. What if I want to play like a game of like SIF two, </garnt>
<connor> which is like 12 hours was rip, then it's like $300 for GSE. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, what the? </joey>
<connor> I think in countries like Korea, </connor>
<connor> it's a lot more affordable because they rely more on like </connor>
<connor> you buying food and drinks and stuff, </connor>
<connor> which I would prefer I'll buy food and drink. If. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Cause I feel like in the UK it's like, it's, it's, </connor>
<connor> it's a strange concept. You know where it is in Korea. </connor>
<connor> It's just a normal way to socialize. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I noticed that in Korea, it was not Korea in the UK. </joey>
<connor> It was either Chinese students who, </connor>
<connor> in that old day where it was kind of like British people, </connor>
<garnt> who'd be like, Ooh, play PC for an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh. </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't meant to, unless you're a rich foreign student, </connor>
<connor> you're supposed to be there all day. </connor>
<garnt> It's a shame because I would love to game in a PC. </garnt>
<garnt> That's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why, that's why we want to go to Korea. </garnt>
<connor> - We've been saying this before, </connor>
<connor> but we've always just wanted to spend like 12 hours a day </connor>
<connor> gaming. And that's my idea of a vacation. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like an amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Vacation to me. Shut off my phone. </connor>
<connor> Just game. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Look at me game. </connor>
<garnt> - Just get some toxic gaming in there because I, </garnt>
<garnt> I realized how like small, </garnt>
<garnt> like how unpopular PC gaming was in Japan when Nazi joins </garnt>
<garnt> the Japanese league of legends servers. And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> great. Join the Japanese league of legends service. </garnt>
<garnt> Perfect way to practice my Japanese and game at the same </garnt>
<garnt> time. A little bit. </garnt>
<connor> I realize until like about like 50 games in no one on the </connor>
<connor> Japanese league of legends service speaks Japanese. </connor>
<connor> No it's all Chinese. </connor>
<connor> Everyone speaks Chinese or English because no one Japanese </connor>
<garnt> is playing the Japanese service. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like Chinese Giannis. </garnt>
<garnt> People were smurfing on the Chinese people. </garnt>
<joey> - Just go to like have fun. </joey>
<connor> - And what I realized is that it's the most toxic server in </connor>
<connor> the world that I've been to because no one Japaneses play. </connor>
<joey> So it's all smells from other countries. Just like, </joey>
<connor> let's just like being toxic on the server. </connor>
<garnt> So yeah. I can see why Japanese, like it's, </garnt>
<garnt> especially with league, </garnt>
<connor> at least why it wasn't so popular in Japan. </connor>
<joey> Apex is a different deal, </joey>
<connor> but basically the secret to getting a game popular in Japan, </connor>
<garnt> I guess it's just your appeal to beat you. </garnt>
<garnt> Just put some gotcha. </garnt>
<connor> Gotcha. Put some gotcha in league and you're all good. </connor>
<connor> You got the Japanese market. Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a conceptual game as well. </garnt>
<connor> It's very easy to hop in and just play a few games. </connor>
<connor> If you ever guys one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> one day I saw you playing Minecraft the other day now I'm so </garnt>
<garnt> disappoint. You started without me. </garnt>
<joey> I was invited. </joey>
<joey> - To suffer boys. </joey>
<joey> - I saw you dying in the lava like five times. Listen, </joey>
<connor> we don't talk about it. </connor>
<connor> We'll play Minecraft. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I've got to get myself situated first. </joey>
<joey> Cause I've recently just moved as well. It was a, </joey>
<joey> what are your places? </joey>
<connor> Goodie was an interesting moving experience mostly because </connor>
<connor> of all the that Sydney has built up over the years. </connor>
<connor> Okay. So we hired the same moving company, right? </connor>
<connor> So, so there's this main guy and he knows that where YouTube </connor>
<joey> was. Cause he moved, he moved all the trash, </joey>
<joey> all the trash day stuff. Right. </joey>
<connor> I don't think he was prepared. </connor>
<connor> Like he knew that we were anime fans. Right. </connor>
<garnt> But I don't think he was prepared for some of the stuff that </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney had. </garnt>
<connor> Like just within her closet. </connor>
<connor> I remember. So yeah. </connor>
<connor> Before, before, so before, before they do the move, </connor>
<garnt> they also have to like scout the place just to see what they </garnt>
<garnt> have to move and how many trucks have to rent out. </garnt>
<connor> And Sydney, Sydney was just like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I know the stuff, I know my room's a bit of, </connor>
<garnt> a bit of a nuclear like wasteland right now. You know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to clean it up a bit. Right. </garnt>
<connor> So what she does is she takes off all like the lewd posters </connor>
<connor> off a wall, right. </connor>
<connor> She's like, I'm going to, I'm cleaning up my room. </connor>
<connor> You know, he's not going to notice cleaning up, </connor>
<connor> cleaning up my room. So she takes off all the loo posters. </connor>
<garnt> Thank you. She's got a job done. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got nothing to worry about. </garnt>
<garnt> What she forgets right. Is there's no posters on the wall, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's just a massive pile of sex toys that she just </garnt>
<garnt> somehow forgot about. </garnt>
<garnt> You really know how numb she is to that kind of where it's </garnt>
<garnt> like, oh yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. </garnt>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<garnt> It's the of the round sign art, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Then it's the 10 kilogram boobs that are just lying on the </garnt>
<connor> floor. So she forgets to hide that, but she takes softer, </connor>
<connor> slightly lewd posters off the wall. </connor>
<connor> Distasteful gone. </connor>
<connor> Now the guy opens the door and is greeted by just the 10 </connor>
<connor> kilogram boobs that are just sitting on her desk that she </connor>
<connor> somehow just forgets about. </connor>
<garnt> He probably wanted to like get out of there. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'll figure after we get everything packed up, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously he like, they hired different people. </garnt>
<garnt> So he he's seen all this before, </garnt>
<joey> but obviously his employees haven't seen this. Right. </joey>
<joey> And so they have to, they have to pack everything up. </joey>
<joey> Right. And so how it was, they packed everything up. </joey>
<garnt> There were about like four men just loading, </garnt>
<garnt> loading stuff into the two trucks that we had. </garnt>
<connor> Sydney stayed behind. </connor>
<garnt> Sydney, stayed behind to clean up a place after we had all, </garnt>
<garnt> we were all driving to our new place to unpack everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And I sat with them in one of the vans and I sat with them </garnt>
<garnt> with two of them. And two of them weren't the main guy. </garnt>
<joey> So it was just one of their employees. And it was just like, </joey>
<garnt> it was like a good 15, 20 minutes of silence. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<joey> And we were just driving along and the guy next to me just </joey>
<joey> goes so interesting stuff. He got there. </joey>
<connor> I was like, oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> So it's like, I'm starting to explain the. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So it's like, you know, this is just, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> where you tubers and the room that, that room, that room, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, that room. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not my room. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like trying to explain what b-boy is unfortunate. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. It's like, ah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's a little up sheet here, but don't worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's totally fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I showed them all the cost plays I had. They were like, </garnt>
<garnt> what, why do you have so many costumes? </garnt>
<garnt> Why is there so many dresses? You're like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my job. </garnt>
<garnt> - To say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, </garnt>
<garnt> what's worse to say if it's your job or if it's your hobby. </garnt>
<garnt> - The guy walked in my room was like, so you're single. </garnt>
<garnt> Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm glad Sydney was there. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause if it was just me sorting this out, like I kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> how do I explain that? How the do I explain that? </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah. I live, I live with a fiance. </garnt>
<garnt> I know she collects sex toys and reviews them on a YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> channel. And they'll just like, yeah, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> Review. I was like, yeah, sure, bet. </garnt>
<garnt> Bet. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even the worst part because after, </garnt>
<garnt> after I have this like a half an hour explanation explains </garnt>
<garnt> to them what we did and just, you know, just, </garnt>
<joey> just explain the situation so they understand. </joey>
<joey> So we get to the house and so they start loading stuff, </joey>
<joey> you know, </joey>
<connor> first goes the beds and then all of like the other boxes and </connor>
<garnt> then the big stuff. </garnt>
<connor> And then I had scheduled the gas guy to come on the same day </connor>
<connor> because you know, we've got to turn on the gas or maximize, </connor>
<joey> you know, midmaxing, midmaxing moving. </joey>
<connor> Yep. </connor>
<joey> So I got a phone call from the gas guy, as every, </joey>
<joey> as everyone's coming in, packing, </joey>
<garnt> unloading all the stuff into the house, I'm like, oh, I'm, </garnt>
<connor> I'm about to come over. Is that cool? </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, great, perfect. </garnt>
<connor> I'm here right now. Just come right in. </connor>
<connor> So he comes in checks, the gas thing turns it on. </connor>
<connor> Does the check everything's perfect. And as he's, </connor>
<connor> as he's about to walk down the stairs, guess what pops up? </connor>
<connor> It's the 10 kilogram boobs right in front of him. </connor>
<connor> The guy just like presents where I'm on a silver platter and </connor>
<connor> the guy. </connor>
<connor> - Inside of like a box or anything like. </connor>
<connor> - That. He was, he was inside a box, the box, the packaging, </connor>
<garnt> which is just an anime girl with her breast cell. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because this thing, this thing doesn't need to go in a box. </garnt>
<garnt> It is its own box. It's just boobs. </garnt>
<garnt> That is 10 kilograms. The box is big enough by itself. </garnt>
<garnt> So he just, he stops. </garnt>
<garnt> They both stop. The gas guy looks at him. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks at him, looks down at the box. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks at me and he goes, oh, very important. </garnt>
<joey> - So he's like, yes. </joey>
<joey> - It's got a sense of humor. </joey>
<garnt> - The guy. So what is the guy was like, oh, a one of them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I'm just, I just phoned Sydney up afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, why did, why did you give me this job? </garnt>
<garnt> I should be the one cleaning up. </garnt>
<garnt> You should be the one handling with. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really necessary to keep. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also didn't need to go in the box that had all the loose </garnt>
<garnt> in front of it. </garnt>
<joey> Like you couldn't have just put it into like the moving box. </joey>
<joey> - I, we let the movers pack. </joey>
<joey> What I did with. </joey>
<connor> - All my loose is that I packed it </connor>
<connor> in a box separately before </connor>
<joey> the moving people came. </joey>
<joey> So they had no idea of all the coasts should I have in my </joey>
<joey> house. </joey>
<joey> - I try to pack as much stuff as I could, </joey>
<joey> but there's too much stuff because when they pack stuff, </joey>
<connor> I just lost track of everything. I was like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know which box everything's in. </connor>
<joey> - I tried to like help them and like try to keep track of </joey>
<joey> everything. And then like about two hours in you realize, </joey>
<garnt> I don't know where anything is anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - And, and so like, even like a month after I was like, </garnt>
<connor> which box is that one specific thing I need in, I terrible. </connor>
<connor> The boxes can't find it. And I'm like, well. </connor>
<joey> - I'm. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like I still haven't found my wireless headphones, </joey>
<joey> which is somewhere in one of the boxes. </joey>
<garnt> I like you forget about the little items that you kind of </garnt>
<garnt> need in day-to-day life until you're staring at about 20 </garnt>
<garnt> boxes in front of you. And you realize that, oh, this, </garnt>
<garnt> this one thing is in one of these boxes. Like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess how does that happen? Every time I've sweat. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I, it doesn't matter who I ask, </garnt>
<garnt> how far they're moving, how much stuff they have, </garnt>
<connor> every move items. </connor>
<connor> Just like go into some Donnie Darko happens where it's just </connor>
<connor> like disappears into a void on the way it's like, </connor>
<connor> cause like you, you look at it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I had that as well where I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm missing like two or three items. </connor>
<connor> At least I went back to the old house. </connor>
<joey> Obviously not there ring up the moving company. </joey>
<joey> They say they don't have it. I'm like, well the, </joey>
<joey> where the did it go? </joey>
<joey> You're not going to tell me it's in one of these boxes </joey>
<joey> because you opened it all up and still not there. </joey>
<joey> What do I do with it? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I miss moving. </joey>
<joey> As a student, you just had like two suitcases. </joey>
<joey> You just Chuck, everything away, you don't need. </joey>
<joey> - The thing is when you're moving, </joey>
<joey> when you have like an apartment stuff, </joey>
<garnt> you just forget how much is hidden. So, so you panic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Such a nightmare. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pack the big. And you're like, oh, I'm like 80% done. </garnt>
<garnt> Then somehow you add another three hours of packing on top </garnt>
<garnt> of that because there's such so much. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just accumulated random. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was surprised how much was in my kitchen. </garnt>
<garnt> My kitchen is like two boxes, three boxes. </garnt>
<joey> It was like 15 boxes. Just kitchen. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how is this? </joey>
<joey> Why do I own so many spoons and plates? What is this? </joey>
<joey> I didn't know. I owned that much. </joey>
<connor> I have like four different types of plates. I don't, </connor>
<garnt> I already use one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he like go deep into like Cubs that you open. </garnt>
<connor> Like once every like couple months. And he's like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize I had 17 bottles of dishwashing liquid. </connor>
<joey> Just like sitting back there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Dude, man, </garnt>
<joey> getting rid of all the cardboard after moving was so. </joey>
<garnt> - Dumb. Don't talk to me about that. </garnt>
<joey> - 18,000. </joey>
<joey> I probably had a Japanese forest worth of cardboard in my </joey>
<garnt> apartment. At one point. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was, we ordered, </garnt>
<garnt> they took all the cardboard with them cause they unpacked it </garnt>
<connor> all for us. </connor>
<garnt> - Don pocket. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't that service cost like 10 grand, </garnt>
<garnt> but we were sponsored. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nice. Nice. </garnt>
<garnt> For some nice. For some, I just. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just can't in good faith. </garnt>
<garnt> Pay 10 grand for them to move my stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - If I didn't get sponsored by it, I wouldn't have paid. </joey>
<joey> - For it. Just like the one that they charged me, like two, </joey>
<garnt> I think to rent, which I was like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, that makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess it's a full day of work. It's a full tank. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a truck. </garnt>
<garnt> You thrown away stuff to get. That makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - It makes it somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they got to make a profit man, but cycling out here. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I saw your moving company. </garnt>
<connor> Someone was moving into my building and it was like, </connor>
<connor> the whole place had been like taken over by them. </connor>
<garnt> There was like 15 of them on. </garnt>
<garnt> - The elevator. And like the outside is like. </garnt>
<connor> - No wonder they cost like 10 grand. </connor>
<connor> They they've got the whole dark Japanese workforce here </connor>
<garnt> doing this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - They really they're really all like, I don't know why. </garnt>
<connor> I guess they're really prideful of they company or </connor>
<connor> something. </connor>
<connor> But like they love plastering their logo all over the, </connor>
<connor> I mean, it seemed like a. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it seems like a military operation. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, </joey>
<connor> let's see from the anime where they call the SDF like, oh, </connor>
<connor> get the STF down here, man. </connor>
<joey> This the, this is a real job. </joey>
<connor> Now. </connor>
<garnt> - I understand, man. </garnt>
<garnt> If you've got a family, </garnt>
<connor> you've got kids and and you're doing pretty well for </connor>
<joey> yourself. I get it. </joey>
<joey> I trying to move with my kids. Like I would like, </joey>
<connor> I would not want to be in my situation that I was in plus </connor>
<garnt> kids. I understand that. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, yeah, just bring in the SAS, </connor>
<joey> bring in the Marines, bring in John senior that do it. </joey>
<connor> Like I do not want. </connor>
<connor> - Especially if you were, you know, like, you know, </connor>
<joey> in your 60 seventies, it's like, you just do it. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I guess as you get older, you know, </joey>
<joey> you won't be moving nearly as often. You know, </joey>
<joey> I still don't know if I'm going to move into a years, </joey>
<joey> four years, but it, once I'm like 40, </joey>
<garnt> I'm probably going to be staying there for a good amount of </garnt>
<connor> time. </connor>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<connor> - That is a late time to settle. </connor>
<connor> - Down anytime soon you kidding me, </connor>
<joey> but I get you unless I become a billionaire hedge fund, man, </joey>
<garnt> then I'll just buy 15 properties, live 11, </garnt>
<garnt> whichever suite I want to. </garnt>
<joey> - Private jet. </joey>
<joey> - What's my one day these stocks are going to turn green. </joey>
<connor> And I tell you, man, I tell you that. </connor>
<joey> - I can't settle down. </joey>
<connor> If you're settled in five different countries, same time, </connor>
<connor> great. </connor>
<connor> - Big brain. </connor>
<joey> - I I'm still going through that phase where I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I'm in my thirties now. </connor>
<connor> I should probably think about where I want to settle down. </connor>
<connor> But just like, that's just like. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like settling down is when your, you know, </connor>
<garnt> when you're stopped, </garnt>
<connor> when you're working in a place that you feel like it's going </connor>
<garnt> to be your end. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I'm going live in Japan forever. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't speak the language. </garnt>
<connor> And even if I did, I'm like what? </connor>
<garnt> I want to raise a kid here. Probably not. </garnt>
<garnt> So I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. There's like a lot of, </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of different factors that go into like my </connor>
<connor> longterm sediment, like where would want to settle down? </connor>
<garnt> Like I do like Asian culture and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I do like live in Japan, </garnt>
<joey> but a big thing about Asia is that I don't want my kids to </joey>
<garnt> go to school here because my God, </garnt>
<garnt> they put so much pressure on exams and schooling here that </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like this, this is too much. </garnt>
<garnt> This is too much. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw a post on Facebook. Like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan per capita has like the least exams of any country. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like before high school, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh that's great. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So just let them be happy until age 12 and then just them. </garnt>
<connor> - They're really happy. And it's like, </connor>
<joey> give them heaven for about 12 years and then give them hell </joey>
<joey> for the next three. </joey>
<joey> - That makes so much sense </joey>
<joey> because Japanese kids like so cute. </joey>
<joey> You like whenever you see school kids, they're so nice. </joey>
<joey> Say hello. You know, they, they just, </joey>
<joey> they're just so inquisitive and everything. And then like, </joey>
<joey> you start some of these, </joey>
<garnt> like it's before they learn like a flip. </garnt>
<garnt> But I swear like every Japanese teenager goes through the </garnt>
<joey> same moody teenager phase. Like it's, it's like, there, </joey>
<joey> there is no exception. </joey>
<joey> - I'm telling my kids get cocky when they, </joey>
<joey> when racism is the same as it is. Right. </joey>
<joey> It's like it's cause like, cause I can tell like, </joey>
<joey> cause you know, sometimes with Japanese kids, right, </joey>
<joey> just from looking at them, you don't know how old these, </joey>
<joey> some of these kids are. Like, there are some like, </joey>
<garnt> ten-year-olds that look 30 and there are some 30 year olds </garnt>
<joey> that look tan. </joey>
<garnt> But like you can always tell though, </garnt>
<connor> when it's like a middle school, </connor>
<connor> Japanese kid and a high school, Japanese kid. </connor>
<connor> No, from the looks, but from the attitude, </connor>
<connor> how happy they are. </connor>
<connor> - How happy they. </connor>
<connor> - Are. </connor>
<connor> And just from the attitude towards how, </connor>
<connor> I guess they like talk to foreigners, </connor>
<connor> I guess in a sense like. </connor>
<connor> - High school students are very scared of talking. They are. </connor>
<connor> - But middle school and like elementary school, </connor>
<connor> Japanese kids love talking to. </connor>
<connor> - Children. </connor>
<connor> - In the street. </connor>
<connor> - Not going around, going like hello to every child. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, in my old, my old apartment block, </connor>
<connor> the only people who would ever like converse with me, </connor>
<connor> I like the little kids whenever I get stuck in the lift and </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, what's the word you want to go to? </connor>
<connor> Where'd you come from? I'm just like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - I'm talking to, and then some, I don't know what happened. </connor>
<connor> Something in high school happens where they just suddenly </connor>
<connor> become paranoid of foreigners. </connor>
<garnt> - Life. Like just they ruin their life. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. And then with the expectation, but you. </connor>
<garnt> - Also know, </garnt>
<garnt> but you also know which high school student dropped out </garnt>
<connor> because they're very happy. </connor>
<connor> They're like, how are you? </connor>
<joey> Yes. I'm not in school anymore. </joey>
<garnt> Doing really good for myself. Thank you very much. </garnt>
<joey> Don't have to go through 17 exams a year. </joey>
<joey> - I just wouldn't want my kid </joey>
<joey> going through the system again. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Same. </joey>
<garnt> Also if Japanese banks are like this, God knows, </garnt>
<garnt> God knows what the rules are like with Japanese schools. </garnt>
<joey> Oh my lowest being a parent. Having to deal with that. </joey>
<joey> - I think, </joey>
<joey> I think though it depends heavily on the score that you go </joey>
<connor> to. Like obviously, </connor>
<joey> like I think public schools definitely have it the worst. </joey>
<joey> I think that's the same with any country out there. </joey>
<joey> But you know, if you go to, like, </joey>
<connor> if you take your kid to like a private school or even an </connor>
<joey> international school, like I think it gets a little. </joey>
<joey> - Bit better. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Totally. </joey>
<joey> Oh, I don't plan on having kids anytime soon. </joey>
<joey> - No. I mean either that's the problem for like future me to </joey>
<joey> figure. </joey>
<joey> - Out the trash tastes episode 5,000 </joey>
<connor> 5,000 kid. himself. </connor>
<connor> Am I right? </connor>
<connor> - Can you relate? </connor>
<connor> - So I went fishing this weekend. I know, </connor>
<joey> I know we were talking about our trash chase fishing </joey>
<connor> special. I'm sorry guys. </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> Lynn Malin was one who invited me. </connor>
<connor> I blame, I blame Merlin. </connor>
<connor> I. </connor>
<connor> - Trusted you. Melaine. </connor>
<connor> - Malin. Just invited us, me and Sydney. </connor>
<connor> If we wanted to have like a kind of kind, </connor>
<connor> kinda like a double day where we go fishing together and </connor>
<connor> I've really enjoyed. It looked like you were. </connor>
<garnt> - Enjoying it. Like you were about to shoot your shot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. So like, okay, so this is, </garnt>
<connor> so this is the first time where I went sea fishing. </connor>
<garnt> So it wasn't like it wasn't a fishing in a river or a lake, </garnt>
<garnt> which I've done before on a boat before. So, so it is, </garnt>
<connor> it is an entirely different experience, right? </connor>
<connor> Mostly because I've never been seasick in my life. Right. </connor>
<joey> And we were talking about this. So on, </joey>
<joey> on the journey up there, everyone's like, oh, </joey>
<connor> does anyone here get seasick? </connor>
<connor> Which is if you get seasick and you're about to go fishing </connor>
<joey> on the sea pro probably a bad idea at time. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But none of us had ever been seasick before. </joey>
<joey> So we're like great fishing on and see easy. </joey>
<garnt> What we didn't realize is what I didn't realize is that when </garnt>
<garnt> you're actively doing, </garnt>
<joey> doing things and having to concentrate things on top of </joey>
<joey> being on the sea and being on the edge of a boat, </joey>
<garnt> it like amps up your sea sickness to 10. </garnt>
<connor> So this is the first time I'd ever felt queasy on a boat. </connor>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean the, the entire thing was like, </garnt>
<garnt> aside from having to deal with the sea sickness, it was, </garnt>
<garnt> it was pretty fun. So what happened is we, </garnt>
<connor> we went down to Yokohama and we went to the port there. </connor>
<connor> And so we are the, we have, </connor>
<connor> they have this package where you basically go out to sea for </connor>
<joey> about four hours. </joey>
<joey> I think it was like, yeah, about, </joey>
<joey> about four seven at a time, these amount of time. </joey>
<joey> And basically whatever you catch, </joey>
<joey> you can keep and you can do whatever you want with the fish. </joey>
<joey> So back when I went fishing in Wisconsin, we, </joey>
<joey> whatever we caught, we could only keep a certain amount, </joey>
<joey> but here you can like keep whatever you want and you can </joey>
<garnt> cook them afterwards as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So we went out to see, and I remember at the beginning, </garnt>
<garnt> so it was me, Sydney Malin and marquee. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. And so obviously he was our first time. </garnt>
<garnt> So the fishermen was trying to teach us how it was done. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And within the first hour Maillian catches too immediately. </garnt>
<connor> Right. And, and she's, she's just, </connor>
<connor> she's just on fire right now. She's like, I'm a natural, </connor>
<connor> I'm a natural. Imagine how smart she was. </connor>
<connor> So smug didn't catch anything for the rest of the trip. </connor>
<connor> and like, and like on the opposite side of things, </connor>
<connor> which was Sydney and while Malin was like catching her first </connor>
<joey> two with a now city, </joey>
<joey> he was like struggling to get like the real town. Right? </joey>
<joey> Like, like the, </joey>
<joey> the fishermen was like next to her for like a full-on hour, </joey>
<joey> like explaining to her then explained to her again. </joey>
<joey> And like, like here, he was like Eagle lied on her, </joey>
<joey> just try and try to make sure that she was doing everything </joey>
<garnt> correctly because she was not getting any catches. </garnt>
<garnt> And then somehow like offer an hour in. </garnt>
<garnt> She just starts reeling and fished. Like it's no business. </garnt>
<garnt> She starts catching like four or five fish at the end of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Once the controller finally play the game. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's McKee, </garnt>
<garnt> which Paul Guy who's made in his husband McKee poor guy </garnt>
<garnt> courts. I think, I think he caught like one fish at the end. </garnt>
<garnt> And so did I? No, actually I caught like three or four, </garnt>
<garnt> but most of them were two big different. The one I caught, </garnt>
<garnt> I caught one fish that I could keep and the rest were just </garnt>
<garnt> like too small to even be worth </garnt>
<garnt> because stabs and because marquee unfortunately was like way </garnt>
<garnt> too seasick to be able to function for most of the trip, </garnt>
<joey> which is the thing, which is the thing where Malin, </joey>
<joey> Malin also was seasick. And so aside to be fair, </joey>
<joey> Malin being Malin was didn't want to admit it. Cause she, </joey>
<joey> she, she was, </joey>
<joey> she was like really silent after about an hour, </joey>
<joey> she was just sitting down and I was like, man, </joey>
<joey> and you're right. And she was like, yep. </joey>
<joey> Yep. I'm cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm just, I'm just, just a little bit tired, </joey>
<joey> a little bit tired. </joey>
<joey> She told me afterwards that she just didn't want to admit </joey>
<garnt> she was sea sick in case like you, Cindy would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh no little baby on one of your medicine for seasickness, </garnt>
<garnt> which we totally would have done anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> But as soon as soon as Marcie mentioned that he was feeling </garnt>
<joey> seasick, she turns to me and Cindy was like, Marquis, </joey>
<garnt> seasick. She sees sick. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm taking care of Marquis. </garnt>
<joey> Wow. I'm like, wow, what an. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, I'm seasick as well. </joey>
<joey> You know, obviously I'm not, I, you know, it's, </joey>
<joey> it's normal to get season just like the blinking light. </joey>
<joey> But it was so funny. Cause McKee did a Markey's first catch. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<garnt> He, he, he reeled in two little, like super small fish. </garnt>
<joey> They were like baby fish. Right. </joey>
<joey> They were like this big, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can't do anything with them. </joey>
<joey> So it's like at this point you just catch and release </joey>
<joey> everything. </joey>
<joey> And it was the first like baby fish we caught on the day and </joey>
<joey> this was about two hours in. </joey>
<joey> And so he caught them and I was like, oh, </joey>
<connor> look at the little baby fish though. You know, </connor>
<joey> we should probably probably release them. So we, </joey>
<joey> he takes the hook out and he starts like, </joey>
<joey> he puts them back in the ocean and they start swimming off. </joey>
<joey> I know, I swear to God, this thing is like, </joey>
<joey> this is like a scene from the Simpsons. Right. </joey>
<joey> Or you can see them swimming off and Sydney in her little </joey>
<joey> and her little, you know, Sydney is just like, </joey>
<joey> talks about a dog or it talks about any animals. </joey>
<garnt> She's like go swim, little baby swim, swim. </garnt>
<garnt> And then as soon as she finishes saying that out of nowhere, </garnt>
<connor> a seagull peers and just dive bombs to fish out of the </connor>
<garnt> water. </garnt>
<garnt> And he'd said, </garnt>
<joey> the four of us were just standing there looking at this </joey>
<garnt> atrocity in silence. </garnt>
<joey> Like, well, </joey>
<joey> has been restored. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. But it was actually like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was actually like a really fun experience. </garnt>
<garnt> I've how much was it to go on the boat? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like about a hundred dollars. So the person, </garnt>
<garnt> and you could catch as much fish as you want. And, </garnt>
<garnt> and afterwards, so you, </garnt>
<garnt> you go catch the fish and afterwards you, </garnt>
<garnt> they have different services so off. </garnt>
<garnt> So you can go to an area where they can cook the fish or you </garnt>
<garnt> can go to an onset. </garnt>
<garnt> And so there was this onset that we went to, </garnt>
<garnt> which is perfect. Like if you're fishing for four hours, </garnt>
<garnt> it's surprisingly tired. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like way more fishing on the sea is way more active </garnt>
<connor> than doing lake fishing or a river fishing. Right. </connor>
<connor> Because you're, you're, </connor>
<connor> you're batting against the current and your constantly like, </connor>
<connor> it's way more, </connor>
<connor> it's way more active because I don't know what they call it, </connor>
<connor> but they, they give you the, you the like this little cage. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> So you've got the bait, </connor>
<connor> which is on the hook or the next to the Bates is this little </connor>
<connor> cage where you basically stuffing stuff in like fish, </connor>
<connor> like dead fishes or, oh, is that what it's called? </connor>
<garnt> Okay. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, oh. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why it's called a chum bucket. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. It makes so much sense. </garnt>
<garnt> Now camera's like just mashed up fish. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So they gave us a chum bucket. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I was struggling to find the worst. </garnt>
<garnt> Describe this thing. It's a chum bucket man. </garnt>
<garnt> Discover SpongeBob. </garnt>
<garnt> So we had a chum bucket. </garnt>
<joey> And so we had to fill up this cage full of charm. </joey>
<joey> And the cage itself would attract the fish school with the </joey>
<joey> smell. </joey>
<joey> And the bait itself would like attract the fish to bite on </joey>
<joey> it. Unfortunately like the chum would like disintegrate. </joey>
<joey> Well then like, you know, within a good five, five minutes. </joey>
<joey> So like every, every, </joey>
<joey> every five minutes you'd have to like put it down, </joey>
<joey> pick it back up, put it down and pick it back up, </joey>
<joey> fill it out, fill it up again and fill up the Chomper, </joey>
<joey> fill up the chum cage with more chum from your chum buckets. </joey>
<garnt> And so it was actually like way more of an accurate yes or </garnt>
<garnt> Ganson. Your favorite word is now. </garnt>
<connor> - You're going to be feeling </connor>
<joey> we're going to be hearing this a lot. </joey>
<joey> - And so it was a way more active. </joey>
<garnt> It was way, way more active than the other kind of fishing I </garnt>
<garnt> experienced. So I was actually pretty tired. </garnt>
<garnt> I, it was, I worked up a good sweats and my God, </garnt>
<garnt> the onset afterwards, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you know how you know how after a hard day's work or how </garnt>
<garnt> you've done, like, you know, after a hard day's work on. </garnt>
<garnt> - It catches one baby fish, that was a hot, </garnt>
<garnt> sweating up a storm getting again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I, I did catch one fish. </garnt>
<garnt> I caught the biggest fish of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney caught the most fish, but I caught the biggest fish. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tastiest though. Huh? </garnt>
<connor> Was yours. </connor>
<connor> - The taste? Of course it was mine. </connor>
<connor> Of course. What fish did you catch? </connor>
<connor> The tasty ones you have? Oh, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the type of fish I had. </connor>
<connor> I believe it was a sea fish. </connor>
<joey> Do you remember the type of fish that we were catching? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's not the cheap fish, right? </joey>
<joey> That's like the though, right? </joey>
<joey> That's the you put in the can, but that's like the cheap, </joey>
<joey> like when you go to sushi places, </joey>
<joey> that's like the cheapest one. </joey>
<joey> it's the white one, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It's the cheapest. </joey>
<joey> When you cut it open, it's like really, </joey>
<joey> really white with the silver outline. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the blue with like a little bit of yellow </garnt>
<garnt> in the fish. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'm totally wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Like. </garnt>
<garnt> - They do have like different services where you can catch </garnt>
<garnt> different types of fish, but like the good fish. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds cool. Let's do that. </garnt>
<garnt> The good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. Next time. </garnt>
<garnt> Next time. </garnt>
<connor> Because you go to this onset and while you're in the onset </connor>
<connor> and just chilling out with the boys or whatever, </connor>
<garnt> they're preparing your fish, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So they take your fish and so they take, </garnt>
<garnt> take your catch and they feed it to you afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> - You said that, that just made me, </garnt>
<garnt> I had the immediate image of somebody coming out of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Open your mouth open. He comes here, which is, </garnt>
<garnt> which is great. I mean, what better? </garnt>
<garnt> What better splice can you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Monkfish in ruins scape. </garnt>
<garnt> That is a high level of fish or shark. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or something. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't high enough level. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't catch it. The level. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of that fish. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't catch different types of fisheries, </garnt>
<garnt> but the best fish come out at like 7:00 AM. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like a 7:00 AM when I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd like to try fishing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fishing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's that's, that's like after, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> five tries or something, that's when you're like dedicated, </garnt>
<garnt> that's one where you have like your own fishing rods and all </garnt>
<garnt> that, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you're, you know, you're legit. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you got your own equipment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fishing order is just one of those devices </garnt>
<garnt> that I feel like is such a big investment </garnt>
<garnt> because of how knowing it is to </garnt>
<garnt> maintain that break. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also like when you get like super serious, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like different roads for different fish. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I learned that from tales of rice. </garnt>
<joey> - You know, one of the short, when I'm fine, </joey>
<joey> if I'm 50 and I haven't decided the hobby, </joey>
<connor> I think as a white person, that is the default hobby I have. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I think when I get to 50, we'll see that in. </connor>
<connor> - Golf. Oh wait the suitcase. </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to be like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll see Bob have a hobby by then. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I want my hobby. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now. </garnt>
<garnt> - A couple of streaming when I'm 50, I'll be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be like, let's get my dentures and myself. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I can't. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not that old guy </connor>
<joey> who's like used to stream or escape a lot. </joey>
<connor> - The guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Tried to cancel. </garnt>
<garnt> He's still streams. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure. I think so. </garnt>
<connor> So there's a future, man. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, maybe I'm already like low in energy now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh man, you say that, </connor>
<joey> but you stream more than me and Joey. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like I'm really low on energy, </garnt>
<garnt> but then you guys are always don't sleep much. So. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think there's a difference between law and energy </garnt>
<joey> and con you know, not being. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's like, I'm not low in energy. </joey>
<joey> I just can't be. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Maybe, maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I, I can't tell if I'm learning, </joey>
<joey> like I am alone and just. </joey>
<joey> - Throw my kidney. </joey>
<garnt> - I have to conserve my energy for trash tastes. </garnt>
<garnt> People think I talk a lot and then no, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can serve all my, </garnt>
<garnt> all my like social energy for trash tastes every week. </garnt>
<garnt> And then not like I've reset every week. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's hard work in this, in this show. </garnt>
<garnt> But honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - Though, if I stream, </connor>
<connor> then that's my work done for the day because I can do it in </connor>
<joey> the night. </joey>
<joey> How do I have energy after I've been working all day to also </joey>
<joey> stream, which is to me work. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you start streaming </joey>
<joey> and then you just kind of get </joey>
<joey> energy. That's just streaming. </joey>
<garnt> It's just that sometimes it happens. </garnt>
<garnt> Like sometimes I'm really dreading. It's called. </garnt>
<connor> - And extra for like, literally it's like your gig. </connor>
<garnt> You're gaining the energy. </garnt>
<garnt> You're siphoning the energy from social interaction. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> For me, it's the opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I have a certain amount of energy and I have to expel </garnt>
<garnt> that during the day. Basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - I be it out. What do you bring out? </garnt>
<connor> Have no more shooting. They promise no more. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like gone, goes to the toilet. </garnt>
<connor> And Sydney's like, are you expelling your energy honey? </connor>
<joey> Yesterday, </joey>
<joey> Tony dropping me during my energy expiration period. </joey>
<garnt> - How else are the moving stuff going? </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of getting settled in, is it you dreading. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because this is, </garnt>
<connor> it's a bit different now because I lived in apartment and </connor>
<connor> this one's a house and it. </connor>
<joey> This was actually where I was actually really lucky to get </joey>
<joey> this house because the previous owner has gotten a job </joey>
<joey> abroad. And so he was very desperate to find a tenant. </joey>
<connor> So we got it out like a amazing price. Cause we were like, </connor>
<joey> when we were looking for other places, we were, we were, </joey>
<garnt> we didn't even know if we were going to move because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember talking to you guys because you both were moving, </garnt>
<joey> you wanted bigger places. And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I'm actually really happy with my place. </joey>
<joey> I suppose, a good size. </joey>
<joey> It was a good size. And I was just like, </joey>
<joey> I'm only going to move if I can find like a decent enough </joey>
<joey> upgrade. </joey>
<joey> And we saw other places which for the budget that was set </joey>
<connor> and nothing was really like, nothing really standing out. </connor>
<joey> I was just like, whatever. </joey>
<connor> Maybe I'll just stay for another year. </connor>
<joey> And then this was like the last house that we looked up </joey>
<joey> because the estate agent was like, yeah, we have, </joey>
<joey> we have one more on offer. </joey>
<joey> That's essentially we saved the best for last. </joey>
<joey> And so we looked at this house and it was like twice the </joey>
<garnt> size of any other place they'd shown us for the same price. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're like, what the though? </garnt>
<garnt> Is there is a catch though, which is, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what the exact contract was called, </garnt>
<garnt> but we only have it for a maximum of two years. </garnt>
<connor> So that was the catch after the hour. </connor>
<connor> So after two years we have to get. </connor>
<joey> - Our switches. If you're like, </joey>
<garnt> get really settled in you really? Like. </garnt>
<joey> - When we were looking for places for the trash taste office </joey>
<joey> that we, one of the places we will consider, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if we talked about this on camera, </joey>
<connor> but one of the places we were considering was exactly the </connor>
<joey> same. The first place we found, </joey>
<connor> it was like this like three story house that was like, </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah, this is like, it looks like a perfect space. </garnt>
<connor> But then we found out that, oh yeah, it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was owned by an ex-pat who was overseas now. </connor>
<joey> But he was like, I'm coming back in two years. </joey>
<connor> So you better get the out. But I. </connor>
<joey> - Think this one's actually better in the end. I think. </joey>
<garnt> - Definitely, definitely better in the end. </garnt>
<joey> But like initially when we were looking at new studios, </joey>
<joey> that was one that we were really happy with because it was </joey>
<joey> like good price, good location. </joey>
<joey> - So in the end, what, what made you move there? </joey>
<garnt> Was it just cause the like the house, the house. </garnt>
<joey> - So the location was amazing. The house is amazing. </joey>
<connor> And I was just like, I, </connor>
<connor> I move on average every two years anyway. </connor>
<garnt> So like I do it as we just discussed. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not one to settle down. So I. </joey>
<garnt> - Mixing it up, you know, I like, </garnt>
<joey> I like getting as annoying as it is. Like I do like it. </joey>
<garnt> - Two years is a long time. If you think about it, </garnt>
<garnt> to me at least three, two years is like a long time, </garnt>
<garnt> especially for. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's something exciting about upgrading a little bit as </garnt>
<garnt> well. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been working hard. </garnt>
<joey> This is a little bit of an upgrade and give myself a pat on </joey>
<connor> the back three times more expensive than my old one. </connor>
<joey> But that's because I didn't know how I was going to do </joey>
<joey> financially when I moved here. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, when I first moved here, I had. </joey>
<connor> - One. </connor>
<garnt> - Bedroom. I don't want. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, same here because when I moved here, </garnt>
<connor> Sydney just didn't have a career yet. So it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was a lot of, it was on a lot of, it was on me to like, </connor>
<connor> well, she, she sh you know, she, </connor>
<connor> she obviously paid for it as well, but a lot of it, </connor>
<connor> a lot of it was if it rested on you, if like, </connor>
<connor> if Sydney falls through and her YouTube career, </connor>
<joey> doesn't take off, then all of this is going to fall on me. </joey>
<joey> And that's why I was like, that's what I was thinking about. </joey>
<joey> But now it's a lot more comfortable. We can vote, </joey>
<joey> share the costs. </joey>
<joey> So we were able to have like a bigger budget, </joey>
<joey> but still not stupidly large. </joey>
<connor> And yeah, we just found a nice, really nice house. </connor>
<connor> And then Sidney's. </connor>
<connor> - Career took off and we went stupidly lost. </connor>
<connor> - And my, my mind, I was like, </connor>
<connor> cause we were living so far away. </connor>
<joey> We had to say where we live now. Kind of like, say, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to go on. </joey>
<connor> I'm just wondering it was. </connor>
<connor> - It was, we didn't live in the center. </connor>
<connor> It was very. </connor>
<connor> - Far away, very far away. </connor>
<garnt> It's kind of was kind of, </garnt>
<connor> and I also live really far away from the station. </connor>
<joey> So I felt like double damage. </joey>
<garnt> - For me. I lived literally three minutes away from this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually had like the nicest insights. </garnt>
<connor> And then I lived like, ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> Like, I didn't. </connor>
<joey> - Know, like halfway between two stations. </joey>
<joey> I. </joey>
<connor> - Remember. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<connor> And so I had the really annoying case of just like I'm 15 </connor>
<joey> minute walk to one station, 20 minutes to the author. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Which like, doesn't seem like a big deal. </connor>
<connor> But when you, </connor>
<garnt> some days when you have to go back and forth multiple times, </garnt>
<garnt> it really felt dreadful. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just got to the point where I'm like, okay, </garnt>
<connor> I'm doing well for myself. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just going to spend the extra money just to get </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere that's super close and that I can focus more on </garnt>
<joey> work. Don't have to worry about traveling. </joey>
<garnt> Like now I don't have to worry too much about before. </garnt>
<connor> I always had to plan it precisely when I was leaving the </connor>
<joey> house because I had to, I had to look what the train was. </joey>
<connor> I had to make sure I was getting the express train because </connor>
<connor> it was so far away that you could get an express train that </connor>
<connor> saves you quite a significant amount of time. </connor>
<joey> And so normally commutes for about an hour for me, </joey>
<joey> which is quite a long time. </joey>
<connor> And did you have to really think, okay, </connor>
<garnt> what am I leaving the house? But now, </garnt>
<joey> now I can just kind of be like, all right. </joey>
<connor> I generally know what time I need to leave. </connor>
<connor> - I kinda liked the commute though. </connor>
<garnt> Cause like may currently I'm also like just like travel </garnt>
<garnt> distance for me, like to the office, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> is like pretty much the same as it was. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not that much different. Time-wise, </garnt>
<connor> it's just in a different. </connor>
<connor> - I always complained about it the most, because for me, </connor>
<connor> I definitely valued distance from where I was going along. </connor>
<connor> - I really liked the commute though for somebody because it </connor>
<connor> puts my mind off of work for even just having. </connor>
<connor> - But I, </connor>
<connor> I liked it until a certain point because commuting here was </connor>
<connor> fine. </connor>
<connor> Commuting back is a nightmare because like, </connor>
<connor> I would always dread it. Right. </connor>
<connor> Because commuting, I don't mind staying on the train, </connor>
<connor> but when it's like, when you're going back off, </connor>
<garnt> we finished filming trash tastes normally like in London, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the rush hour is from, </garnt>
<garnt> let's say five o'clock till seven o'clock right. </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's like, the Chub is parks. </garnt>
<connor> You're not getting a seat. </connor>
<joey> And you're like a sardine for some reason, </joey>
<connor> the rush hour in Tokyo starts from like four till like nine </connor>
<garnt> 30 or nine. </garnt>
<connor> - Right? Yeah. </connor>
<joey> No it doesn't, it doesn't name it goes on until midnight. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So, so like, </connor>
<connor> so like the commute back was just like a nightmare. </connor>
<joey> I would like dread it. </joey>
<garnt> So I would dread the commute back every time. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was just normally if I was in London, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just wait out the rush hour. But in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> there is no waiting of the rush hour. You just, </garnt>
<connor> you just got to deal with it. </connor>
<connor> - Well, it depends. </connor>
<connor> Right? Because like some, like you said, </connor>
<connor> you don't mind the commute. That's good. </connor>
<connor> I mean, very Opie for you. </connor>
<connor> You can get a much bigger place. Would you ever, </connor>
<garnt> you have a much better place than me. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's, it's kinda like, I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> I just, I hated commuting. </connor>
<connor> And to me I felt like I could spend my time better and I did </connor>
<connor> want to spend my time differently, like streaming, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like an extra hour of streaming is a big difference, </garnt>
<connor> like a long way. So yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I think for me as well as, </connor>
<connor> because like an hour commute for me now is so much better </connor>
<connor> than what I first had when I first moved here. </connor>
<connor> When I first moved here, </connor>
<garnt> I lived in a place that was a 25 minute walk to the closest </garnt>
<garnt> station I up. </garnt>
<connor> And it was like way out of Tokyo kind of thing. So like, </connor>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<connor> commuting into Tokyo would be like an hour and a half, </connor>
<connor> two hours. </connor>
<connor> - Which is the walk don't get me wrong. It's fine. </connor>
<joey> Walking is not the problem it's walking in the summer. </joey>
<garnt> Sometimes, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't always be what you'd like you sometimes you have </garnt>
<garnt> to carry a bunch of. </garnt>
<connor> And that's where it really sucks. </connor>
<connor> - The have so glad that finally I'm able to wear a sweater. </connor>
<joey> It's so nice. Now, like speaking of whether the, like, </joey>
<connor> where did autumn go? Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just, it just was like tea for two days. </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, all right. </connor>
<garnt> So you just turn into winter. It's. </garnt>
<joey> - Always like that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm so glad though, </joey>
<joey> because I can finally wear some drip without dripping </joey>
<connor> myself. </connor>
<connor> It's disgusting for like the middle of September was. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, like, </connor>
<connor> I just like how Japan decided that it was going to be hot </connor>
<connor> until it wasn't one day and then it just decided it wasn't. </connor>
<connor> - Well, </connor>
<connor> it went from 25 to 14 in one day and it doesn't look like </connor>
<connor> it's going back, but how does that happen? </connor>
<connor> Whether. </connor>
<connor> - Japan has full seasons, everybody. </connor>
<connor> That's what they tell you. No. </connor>
<connor> - It has a pain for six months, </connor>
<connor> then mild discomfort for two and then the restaurant. Okay. </connor>
<garnt> I guess it's kind of, it's kind of that right? </garnt>
<garnt> - One biggest thing, </garnt>
<garnt> going back to the house at one biggest thing that I've had </garnt>
<joey> to go to get used to living in the house is a living on the </joey>
<joey> ground floor. Now I've only lived, I've only lived in Japan. </joey>
<joey> I mean, </joey>
<joey> it's though I've only lived in apartments in Japan before, </joey>
<joey> and I was like quite high up in my old apartment. </joey>
<joey> So you know what? </joey>
<joey> I could stand next to the window and be pretty confident </joey>
<joey> that no one was going to Sue me. You know, you know, </joey>
<garnt> especially, you know, when you sleep, you, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you just sleep in boxes as, as, as you do. </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you just out of the shower and you don't dress </garnt>
<garnt> exactly. You didn't get dressed straight away, </garnt>
<garnt> you put on your boxes or whatever, </garnt>
<joey> and you just walk around the apartment. </joey>
<joey> And I, I kind of realized that you can't do that in houses. </joey>
<joey> So our house has like pretty big windows. Right. </joey>
<joey> And so I have a shower put on my boxes and so the bathroom </joey>
<garnt> or my shower room and my wardrobe is on different floors. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So finish some shower, </garnt>
<joey> go up to go up to my living room and just, you know, </joey>
<garnt> chilling, you know, before I put on some clothes, </garnt>
<garnt> go up Souk, </garnt>
<connor> go up to my window to like admire the view as you do </connor>
<connor> sometimes just admire the sunshine and ground floor, </connor>
<connor> admire the pavement on the first floor on the first floor. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So a little elevation, a little bit of direction, </connor>
<joey> because sometimes when I was on, when I was on the, </joey>
<joey> when I was on the eighth floor, back in my own apartment, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you just like, look down, breathe in the sunshine. </joey>
<garnt> And I thought I'd do the same routine. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was just standing in my window and then someone opens </garnt>
<garnt> their, </garnt>
<garnt> someone goes up to the balcony to put out some clothes and </garnt>
<garnt> me and them meet high contacts. And I, </garnt>
<garnt> I totally not used to this because back then when you're in </garnt>
<connor> apartments, </connor>
<garnt> I was used to just being by the window and nobody could see </garnt>
<garnt> you because you're too high up to be seen. </garnt>
<joey> And then, </joey>
<joey> so we make eye contact and then they immediately just close </joey>
<joey> the close sliding door again. </joey>
<joey> And then I realize I'm just standing next to my window with </joey>
<joey> my boxes out. And people can very visibly see me. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, was the, </joey>
<joey> this person they were like across the road. </joey>
<joey> So 10 minutes away, it's like 10 minutes away. </joey>
<garnt> So they had 4k definitions, literally, literally Cohen 4k, </garnt>
<garnt> my God, if it was made in, she would like be, </garnt>
<connor> she would have seen my nipples and everything scarred for </connor>
<joey> life there. I fallen right off the bat. </joey>
<garnt> He's shock like a new place. So, so far. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Everybody liked him. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Nice. </connor>
<connor> Also another thing I had to go back to my house by myself to </connor>
<connor> pick up some stuff pretty late at night. And it's, it's, </connor>
<connor> it's pretty scary to go back. It's, </connor>
<connor> it's creepy as to go in the house. And I didn't, </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize that until I went in, </connor>
<connor> because when you're in an apartment, there are like lights, </connor>
<connor> like outside of your building, </connor>
<connor> there are lights and our people live next to you. </connor>
<connor> You go in this house and it's just pitch black and you're </connor>
<connor> just by yourself. And you're like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I wasn't afraid of the dark until I experienced this. </connor>
<connor> And I'm going to sound creepy about an empty apartment. </connor>
<connor> Pitch-black there was something really weird about the </connor>
<connor> apartments. </connor>
<connor> Like I can handle in an apartment because the worst thing, </connor>
<garnt> if you, if something happens, </garnt>
<garnt> if like a murder is there or a burglar is there, </garnt>
<garnt> you can scream and people are people around too. </garnt>
<garnt> It's confidence in people. </garnt>
<garnt> I think, I think you like your neighbors a little too much. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. It's probably just like a placebo, </garnt>
<garnt> but tons of motorists in Japan, but I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe it's a placebo, but it feels safer. </garnt>
<garnt> It just feels, I don't dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like having a nightlight, you know, it feels like, </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like it's not too far away from your front door, </garnt>
<garnt> whereas in the house, you're kind of just there by yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> And we, we have a detached house as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So, so it feels like you're just completely there isolated, </garnt>
<garnt> whereas in an apartment, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> there there's the apartment block where there's people </garnt>
<garnt> outside sometimes going in and out there's lights, </garnt>
<connor> even at nighttime. </connor>
<connor> So I just, I dunno, right. </connor>
<connor> It just, it just feels like you're a bit more isolated. </connor>
<garnt> It feels scarier. </garnt>
<garnt> I could see why people can't get scared of ghosts now in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan, Because this is creepy as. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want to talk about cars. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Like I've rinsed from the comments last time they were like, </connor>
<connor> did you say, oh, when I talked about garish, </connor>
<connor> people were very angry that I spoke about. I was like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> But then it was just one of those. </connor>
<connor> That was another one of those times. I was like, </connor>
<garnt> I wish I could like go write a script on why I don't believe </garnt>
<joey> in ghosts and why that stupid didn't come back. </joey>
<joey> - I don't. </joey>
<garnt> - Believe in ghosts. There was a, </garnt>
<joey> it was a guy who made like a, </joey>
<joey> he made a followup video about us talking about cars, </joey>
<joey> basically, really basically saying my point, </joey>
<connor> but eloquent and actually, </connor>
<connor> and actually explaining what is this video called? It's by, </connor>
<connor> what's his name? Dark Viper. </connor>
<connor> I think you've watched his trash tastes a lot. </connor>
<connor> He's a speed runner. And while he was speed running games, </connor>
<connor> he was just giving us amazingly, </connor>
<connor> amazingly eloquent explanation as to why people believe in </connor>
<connor> Garrison, </connor>
<connor> why it's generally like a coping thing and whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And yeah. You know, it's stuff that I normally agree with, </connor>
<connor> but it's one of those things that you can never change. </connor>
<connor> If someone believes in ghosts, </connor>
<connor> you'd never going to change their mind. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, but for me to be like, I don't believe in it. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes people get offended by that because they've never </connor>
<connor> experienced it. Even if I did, I wouldn't care. </connor>
<connor> But. </connor>
<connor> - The thing is I've never experienced it, </connor>
<connor> but I still believe in it because it's, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> It's, it's cool. </connor>
<connor> - I understand that. It's nice to believe in, </connor>
<connor> but it's just one of those things that I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> maybe I'm just too boring. I don't know. </connor>
<connor> To me, it just doesn't make sense to me, I believe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But that's, </connor>
<connor> I didn't believe until I experienced something and then I </connor>
<connor> did believe it. So. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But again, </connor>
<connor> I always think there's a logical explanation of everything. </connor>
<connor> I think there's, </connor>
<connor> there's always an explanation that might be boring. </connor>
<connor> Might not be immediately obvious that can explain it. </connor>
<connor> - Every, </connor>
<connor> every mystery ever in history that's ever been solved as </connor>
<connor> turned out to be not magic. Right. </connor>
<connor> It's like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's always, there's always something like, </connor>
<connor> we just don't have the capability to understand certain </connor>
<connor> things. And yeah. </connor>
<connor> I guess the people use that argument for, you can put that. </connor>
<garnt> That could mean that we don't ghost could be real. </garnt>
<garnt> And we don't understand that. We're like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But everything else in our world thus far as is proven to be </garnt>
<garnt> the case, that stuff like that doesn't tend to be wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I believe in like the supernatural or the paranormal, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't believe in 99% of the media that comes out that </garnt>
<garnt> says like, here's. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that I really despise, </garnt>
<connor> and this is one thing that I absolutely hate about and which </connor>
<connor> really leads me to feel strongly against. </connor>
<joey> It is the whole industry that's propped up around no, </joey>
<joey> no exact ghost. </joey>
<joey> You know, I. </joey>
<joey> - Don't agree watching teller's spirit. </joey>
<joey> - Show predatory at times. </joey>
<joey> It makes me just want to like, just get rid of it all. </joey>
<joey> Just yeah, no, </joey>
<joey> no one don't believe in ghosts because if one person </joey>
<joey> believes in ghosts, </joey>
<joey> then there has to be someone who then gets into believing </joey>
<joey> into ghost and then falls down this whole rabbit hole. </joey>
<joey> Their husband dies. Someone comes to him, tells me, </joey>
<joey> I'll let you speak to your husband for $50 an hour. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That is, that is, that is predatory. </joey>
<joey> That's predatory. And that's like, that's kind of different. </joey>
<joey> That's just people taking advantage of people who are like </joey>
<joey> very vulnerable and very just looking for answers. </joey>
<connor> - But I believe there are people out there who I wouldn't </connor>
<connor> class as vulnerable, but maybe gullible more, sorry. </connor>
<joey> Oh, there's nothing bad happened to them. </joey>
<connor> There may be more likely to believe this kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I suppose you can't argue that they're not getting what </connor>
<connor> they want. They're paying for some, </connor>
<garnt> but that's kind of what in my eyes is, but I guess to them, </garnt>
<garnt> well, maybe they'll ask for, so I have friends, </garnt>
<joey> very good friends who go to fortune tellers and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I just flat out just do not believe fortune tellers. </joey>
<joey> - I don't believe. </joey>
<joey> - In that shady deal. I just, you know, I think there is, </joey>
<joey> there are a lot of questions that would be a raise. Oh. </joey>
<connor> So you know how to read fortunes then why don't, </connor>
<connor> why are you not very fortunate? </connor>
<connor> It's why are you not using this to your ability? </connor>
<connor> If you know, why. </connor>
<connor> - Do you not own about. </connor>
<garnt> - 10 Points a Fortune's able to be changed? </garnt>
<connor> Is this something, you know, and if not, why, </connor>
<connor> why has God bespoke bestowed you with this knowledge of </connor>
<connor> people and. </connor>
<connor> - Why you're not using it to your own advantage? </connor>
<connor> - I just find that there are so many questionable actions </connor>
<connor> and ultimately it all comes down to the fact that you're </connor>
<connor> charging money and you're getting paid. Well. </connor>
<connor> - I said, you'll, </connor>
<connor> you'll free to believe in whatever the you want, </connor>
<connor> as long as you don't like extorting people. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, when you, when you add, </garnt>
<garnt> when you add money into the mix, of course, </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to get messy, especially, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you try to like monetize this. And I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you want to give away a fortune for free, go ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but like, I, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> to like claim that you have some kind of special power or </garnt>
<garnt> something, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's no way to prove that it's there right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Whether you believe in ghosts or not, </garnt>
<connor> there is no tangible proof for, or against for me. </connor>
<connor> Like I believe, I believe in the supernatural, </connor>
<connor> I believe in supernatural things, because to me, </connor>
<connor> I believe that at the moment there is so much about the </connor>
<connor> universe and the worlds that even science context. </connor>
<connor> - I believe that I'm, I'm near certain, </connor>
<connor> that alien species out there exists that we have not been </connor>
<joey> able to come across because the university too big, </joey>
<joey> but like the whole concept of modern ghosts and the way that </joey>
<joey> we understand them, I think is completely incorrect. </joey>
<joey> - But what is the cons? What is the concept of modern NGOs? </joey>
<connor> - Like the idea that someone would die </connor>
<connor> and they're just going to hang around a place, haunting it. </connor>
<connor> Like, are you serious? </connor>
<joey> No, no, that's not good. </joey>
<connor> I believe in it. No, no, God, no. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also because like a lot of like Shintoist belief, </connor>
<joey> revolver. </joey>
<joey> - Right? I understand that. </joey>
<joey> And that's why, that's why I, you know, it's one of the, </joey>
<connor> it's very tough for me to argue again, </connor>
<connor> like I'm not prepared. I think we got to talk about it. </connor>
<garnt> I look at it enough, go watch this video. </garnt>
<connor> This that's great. I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like I, I just generally am of a scientific mindset. </connor>
<connor> That's. </connor>
<garnt> - I've I'm most of the time I am generally favorable towards </garnt>
<garnt> the science soft science. It's not like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't believe in like like people who can read like star </connor>
<garnt> signs and Gordian lines. I'm sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, if you, </garnt>
<garnt> if you presented some kind of panel activity that we had, </garnt>
<garnt> and we really sat down and we really went through it and we </garnt>
<garnt> really started poking holes in it, we could probably, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, debunk most things I'm sure. </garnt>
<joey> And any of the stuff that is generally, </joey>
<joey> when you say it's unsolvable or nothing to explain, </joey>
<joey> there's generally a massive lack of information or not </joey>
<joey> enough stuff. </joey>
<connor> - But that's what I mean. Right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's, it's a lot like, </connor>
<connor> like UFO footage where it's like, I believe in UFO's, </connor>
<garnt> but I don't believe in 99% of the world's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a lot of the scandalous stuff first, for sure. </garnt>
<garnt> Because we know that they exist. </garnt>
<connor> There are tons of identities, </connor>
<joey> objects where they'd done married. </joey>
<joey> - But there are also a lot of like, you know, </joey>
<joey> haunted videos and like paranormal activity, </joey>
<connor> like videos and photos that are just like, </connor>
<connor> no matter how you look at it, it's inexplainable becomes. </connor>
<connor> - Such a and I, I think. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like you just hate the culture around it. </connor>
<garnt> I really do. </garnt>
<garnt> Rather than I hate the culture. I never talk about this. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I'm just like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I believe in ghosts on that. </garnt>
<garnt> Hardly mentioned it because it's just like, I believe in it. </garnt>
<joey> Cause I've seen it. I don't really like, </joey>
<joey> like to talk about it. Cause it's just, it's my experience. </joey>
<joey> Right? It's just, it's just. </joey>
<connor> - You can't force someone to believe in it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't want other people to believe well, </joey>
<connor> like experience what I experienced. </connor>
<connor> That's just my experience with. </connor>
<connor> - It gets done personally, but I will never be like, </connor>
<connor> you're a stupid person for believing in that. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm not going to be like, how dare. </connor>
<connor> - You guys? You guys have some form of some belief in it. </connor>
<connor> I would never be like, </connor>
<joey> I think you guys are stupid because you believe in it. </joey>
<joey> I personally, to me it feels dumb. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. The idea of it. </joey>
<joey> - And I, </joey>
<joey> and I am completely fine with people who don't believe in it </joey>
<joey> because you know, they can't be helped. </joey>
<joey> Right. It's like you haven't experienced it. </joey>
<garnt> Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause like, </garnt>
<garnt> to me it's like the opposite sense where yes, I, </garnt>
<garnt> and I completely agree that culture is very messy. </garnt>
<garnt> It's very, very sensationalized, which I hate sense. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? And I mean, there's been so many, </garnt>
<garnt> like people who have debunked, </garnt>
<garnt> people who have monetized their staff, </garnt>
<garnt> how can you not know that a lot of people are just </garnt>
<garnt> predatory, but at the same time, </garnt>
<connor> I do believe there is a lot of things that have not been </connor>
<connor> able to explain with current science. And I think it's even, </connor>
<connor> I think, </connor>
<connor> I think it's naive to not think that there is something not </connor>
<connor> something more out there that hasn't been explained yet </connor>
<connor> because there's so many, there's so much about, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's so much, we don't understand. </connor>
<connor> We take for granted because science has science has evolved </connor>
<connor> and progressed so much that we forget how much we still do. </connor>
<garnt> Not understand. </garnt>
<garnt> - About. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just the unit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess like generally my, </garnt>
<garnt> my thought process along that is if we don't understand the </garnt>
<garnt> situation and we don't have the tools to get to explain it, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think that a paranormal explanation is the correct </garnt>
<garnt> one because you know, we didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> We didn't know what caused like cholera for a long time, </garnt>
<connor> you know, I'm sure at some point they thought it was, </connor>
<connor> it was the devil. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - It's one of those things where it's like, </connor>
<connor> generally when we've come to at least my belief is that when </connor>
<connor> we, </connor>
<connor> we just don't have the tools or the knowledge of subsequent </connor>
<garnt> fields of physics or math to understand certain things. </garnt>
<garnt> But also most of the time it's so minuscule what happened. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if your door closed one night and it was real spooky, </garnt>
<connor> it's like, </connor>
<connor> why would anyone delve deep into trying to disprove you your </connor>
<connor> door uncomfortably close. It's called a draft. </connor>
<garnt> - Paranormal activity. Once I can see the. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pressure differential between one of us, it's a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> But like there is so many things that are so not worth </garnt>
<connor> explaining generally, </connor>
<connor> most of the that is spooky is so not worth wasting time on </connor>
<connor> trying to figure out because it's so little information that </connor>
<connor> we have. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's not worth explaining anyway. Well that's the problem. </connor>
<connor> Oh, sorry. </connor>
<garnt> One more, one more time. </garnt>
<garnt> I also do want to acknowledge that there is, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the whole psychic stuff and all that. </garnt>
<garnt> I do understand that there is a market that is pure </garnt>
<garnt> entertainment. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. I could go to a fortune teller. </garnt>
<garnt> They could tell me a bunch of nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't believe what they said, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was fun to hear the funny words and they tell me, </garnt>
<garnt> I understand that's an angle and I'm fine with that. </garnt>
<garnt> I like your funny hoods magic magic, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you for telling me that I'm going to be wealthy. </garnt>
<garnt> I appreciate that. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm also like going to here when I've, </garnt>
<garnt> I've I've gone to a fortune teller before. Cause I like, </garnt>
<garnt> I like to experience what kind of generic way they're going </garnt>
<garnt> to tell me about my future. </garnt>
<garnt> I love to understand the way that they're trying to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's not of a place of me generally believing it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I do think that is kind of the bit, </garnt>
<garnt> there are a lot of people out there who really believe in </garnt>
<garnt> this stuff. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I, I, I, my mom's one of those people and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm like sometimes a mum's like tasted me to a fortune </connor>
<connor> teller and I'm like, mom, again, I'm mom again, </connor>
<connor> do you get the same spiel. </connor>
<connor> - Every time? You know, </connor>
<joey> they say generic things that can apply. </joey>
<connor> - To anyone it's cold reading, cold, </connor>
<connor> cold reading is a technique is a psychological technique. </connor>
<connor> But that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - I have. I almost have an appreciation for these psychics. </connor>
<connor> Not so much in the supernatural sense, </connor>
<joey> but more on the psychological sense of. </joey>
<joey> - Well, like Darren brown is more along. </joey>
<joey> I'm not, he always sees not psychic, </joey>
<joey> but like just using the faults of the human. </joey>
<joey> - Psychology. </joey>
<joey> - Anyone who's good at that </joey>
<joey> would never claim to be psychic </joey>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> They understand that it's a lot more than that. </joey>
<joey> Cause claiming the psychic really undervalues what you're </joey>
<joey> doing. </joey>
<joey> Magic brain thing. </joey>
<joey> - Do I do I believe in like psychics and people who can cold </joey>
<joey> read and stuff like that? No. </joey>
<joey> Do I believe there are people out there who can maybe sense </joey>
<connor> some supernatural things? Yes I do. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I do. </joey>
<joey> That's fair enough. I mean, I mean, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Again, like gotten, </joey>
<garnt> I have personal experience of either ourselves. </garnt>
<garnt> - Th this comes from just my understanding. </garnt>
<garnt> The brain is just so flawed in many ways and that we, </garnt>
<joey> you know, there's been like, </joey>
<joey> I know if someone gave an argument, this, </joey>
<connor> I saw a comment that was arguing about this. </connor>
<connor> And it was just like, if you can't prove it's, what's the, </connor>
<connor> what's the really horrible argue method where it's like, </connor>
<connor> if you can't prove it's not real than it than it Israel. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And it's like, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> You need the burden is proving that it's real. </connor>
<connor> Not that it isn't. </connor>
<garnt> - Real. </garnt>
<connor> - This is what I find the most annoying about arguing the </connor>
<connor> subject is that for some reason, </connor>
<connor> it's on the burden to me to prove that you don't have </connor>
<connor> magical sixth sense. No. </connor>
<connor> Prove to me like concretely that you do. </connor>
<connor> - The people who say like, oh yes, </connor>
<connor> proof is a synonym for truth. It's like, no, it's. </connor>
<connor> - Really not. </connor>
<connor> That's the thing. That's, </connor>
<connor> there's no way to pressure right now. </connor>
<connor> - And that's why it's we call believing it. </connor>
<connor> But there's the so many things, right? </connor>
<connor> so many, like I'm trying. </connor>
<garnt> - To argue a point here, cut all your points here. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's just so many clips of people. You know, </garnt>
<garnt> they go to people who are like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I can talk to the dead or I can feel the dead. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they showed them pictures of people who aren't dead </garnt>
<garnt> the other two. And they're like, Hey, they're not dead. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, oh, well, you know, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> this happens so many times. So it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> at what point are we just going to be like, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> This is just. </garnt>
<garnt> Literally everyone who claims that they can do this </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere and other, when they put the test that they fail, </garnt>
<connor> like rarely, no one ever passes these tests. </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<garnt> - But like most of the time, like most, </garnt>
<garnt> most of the people I've met who have stories around this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got nothing to do with the sensationalized you see on </garnt>
<garnt> TV. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's, </garnt>
<garnt> that's what also makes it very difficult to have this </garnt>
<garnt> discussion. </garnt>
<garnt> People have their beliefs. </garnt>
<connor> They're so strong in my beliefs that they don't consider </connor>
<connor> that they could have maybe experienced something that wasn't </connor>
<connor> that more often than not, they never. </connor>
<garnt> - And it was like arguing about someone with their religion. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Which is like, you never, like it's, it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a lose, lose argument. </garnt>
<connor> Cause either you believe in religion or you don't. </connor>
<connor> And according to the other side, neither is right. </connor>
<connor> Or. </connor>
<joey> - And herbal admitting our own faults as human being. Right. </joey>
<joey> There's so many, like, you know, you go to criminal cases, </joey>
<joey> there's so many like trials and stuff where my witness </joey>
<joey> testimony has been given and they swear a hundred percent. </joey>
<connor> They have nothing to lose by lying about this, </connor>
<connor> that they saw something happened that turned out it didn't </connor>
<connor> happen. </connor>
<connor> And the memory because memory is so unreliable and feelings </connor>
<connor> are so unreliable. </connor>
<connor> And what you see is never exactly what you remember it to </connor>
<connor> be. This thing, </connor>
<joey> we are so terribly inconsistent as humans that I find it </joey>
<joey> hard to believe that one person who experienced sank. So, </joey>
<joey> so wildly kind of outer worldly and that we don't remember. </joey>
<joey> - That's a worldly though. I mean, there are big, there are, </joey>
<connor> there are bigger mysteries out there in the world. </connor>
<connor> - It's case by case. </connor>
<connor> There are some times I've heard stuff where I'm like, no, </connor>
<connor> and there's some things I'm like, you know, </connor>
<joey> that just sounds like you had an experience that I wouldn't </joey>
<connor> describe as like, that's like a ghost thing. </connor>
<connor> It's like, </connor>
<joey> you just had an experience that isn't like a ghost or </joey>
<joey> haunted. </joey>
<joey> You felt something. And I felt that was a youth thing. </joey>
<joey> I don't think that was the world, but you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's us. That's like. </joey>
<joey> - The youth. </joey>
<connor> - As in, like, </connor>
<connor> I was in the same room with you at the exact same time, </connor>
<connor> I would not have experienced the same thing as you, </connor>
<connor> because it is entirely a thing that is happening to you. </connor>
<joey> It's, it's, it's a mental thing that's going on. </joey>
<joey> I don't think it's the thing that's in this physical world </joey>
<joey> or this material world or whatever. </joey>
<connor> I think it's something that if you put two people in the </connor>
<connor> same room and one of them is having that kind of experience </connor>
<joey> and that you're things like when you, </joey>
<joey> when you went on that tour or whatever, you know, </joey>
<joey> there's like, if you go on a tour and you, you know, </joey>
<connor> haunted house and why one person feel things in one desk, </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's a ghost choosing, Ooh, spooky on God. </connor>
<connor> I it's. You are setting your, your mind is capable. </connor>
<connor> You believe that that could happen. </connor>
<connor> You are a person who is subset susceptible to feeling that </connor>
<connor> you could be haunted. So you go into a place expecting, </connor>
<garnt> maybe I could be haunted, I'm open to this idea. </garnt>
<garnt> Something happens. You feel something. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you, your mind is like haunted or. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I could argue with the, </garnt>
<joey> I could argue the complete opposite, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I would. </joey>
<joey> - Never, yeah, totally. </joey>
<joey> - Agree. No, no, because like you, </joey>
<joey> you are going to the mentality that this susceptible to </joey>
<joey> believing in this thing, but right on the opposite side of, </joey>
<connor> on the opposite side side of the fence, </connor>
<connor> you are someone who is so adverse to this idea that you </connor>
<connor> would, you just shutting it out, </connor>
<connor> that you would shut out whatever experience, </connor>
<connor> if there wasn't experience, if there was right. </connor>
<connor> So. </connor>
<connor> - You never know you might've perhaps experienced a similar </connor>
<connor> paranormal thing in your head. It's just like, oh, </connor>
<joey> that just happened. That was a bit weird. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I brush it off possibly. </joey>
<joey> I think that it's, it's really tough because like you said, </joey>
<joey> if it did happen, I, I would probably just, </joey>
<joey> I would probably think of a logical conclusion as to why </joey>
<joey> that happens more often than not. </joey>
<joey> I feel like I can adequately explain what happened, where, </joey>
<joey> well, the people around me, </joey>
<joey> whether there was a noise or something that happened, </joey>
<joey> I can normally be like. </joey>
<connor> - This whole, like, I guess, </connor>
<connor> culture to be interesting about. </connor>
<connor> Right. It's that like, we don't know, </connor>
<connor> like both sides don't know. </connor>
<connor> And it's the conversation of the believer. </connor>
<connor> Most of the non believer who is right. Who the knows. </connor>
<joey> - I want to talk about. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I think unfortunately there's people who argue my side more </connor>
<connor> often than not argue the point that people who believe the </connor>
<garnt> are dumb. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> And so it kind of makes this really horrible. </connor>
<connor> - Whole sensationalized. </connor>
<joey> - That's just, that's just an image problem, right? </joey>
<joey> It is, </joey>
<joey> it is so much of an image problem because so much of the </joey>
<joey> media around the supernatural is like sensation. Especially, </joey>
<joey> especially like with like Halloween, </joey>
<joey> you like TV is unfucking, </joey>
<joey> watchable and Halloween because everything is like ghost </joey>
<joey> specials, but that's why. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. That's what I like. </joey>
<joey> Even though I wasn't, I wasn't saying like, you're stupid. </joey>
<joey> If you believe the. </joey>
<joey> The last time we still got this, </joey>
<joey> I got like the comments people were saying to me, </joey>
<joey> there was some that were like really rude about it. </joey>
<joey> They were like, Connor's just, </joey>
<joey> he just thinks everyone's stupid. If they don't believe it, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, they didn't say that. </joey>
<connor> It's like, I personally, I think that stuff to me is, </connor>
<connor> is dumb, but I would never be like, you're a dumb person. </connor>
<garnt> I believe. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the important thing is that you like people </garnt>
<garnt> recognize it is a belief and people have experienced it as </garnt>
<joey> some people can believe different things, </joey>
<joey> but you never want to make them feel like they've been </joey>
<joey> discredited for reading. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's why we have such a tough political climate </joey>
<joey> because for a long time, </joey>
<garnt> all these really extreme beliefs were like, no, </garnt>
<garnt> you're stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's the problem. As well as that, </garnt>
<garnt> there's really a difference between people who have a belief </garnt>
<garnt> of like, this could be true. </garnt>
<joey> And then the people who swear that it's true. </joey>
<connor> And like, like I'm one of those people mixed together. </connor>
<joey> And it's like, and that's where like the bad image comes. </joey>
<joey> Like, </joey>
<joey> I'm definitely one of those people who is the former where </joey>
<joey> it's like, I believe this could be a possibility. </joey>
<joey> And I find it more fun personally to think it in that sense, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not going to come out and say like go surreal </joey>
<joey> hundred percent, no counter. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I'm not going to say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't prove ghosts are not real, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can't prove go. </garnt>
<garnt> So. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have more enjoyment. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate the argument. You can't. </joey>
<joey> - I personally have the enjoyment of thinking, </joey>
<joey> you know what? </joey>
<joey> There is a possibility we just don't know. </joey>
<joey> And that's what I find exciting about believing in this </joey>
<joey> thing. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, for me, it's like, it's, it's less of just, it's, </joey>
<connor> it's less of just like, </connor>
<connor> this is a fun thing for me to believe. </connor>
<connor> And it's more of just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> everyone's had different experience. </connor>
<garnt> I've had like my own experience as well. And I couldn't, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, like, I couldn't logically explain it. </garnt>
<garnt> And so what happened was well at, </garnt>
<garnt> at this moment with my experiences and what I've seen, </garnt>
<garnt> it's more likely for me that it exists, </garnt>
<garnt> then it doesn't exist. </garnt>
<garnt> And am I open to the fact that maybe what I experienced </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't real and you know, I'm open either way, </garnt>
<garnt> but right now, based on my experience, I'm just like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe it. And that's the thing I believe. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. It's all about whether, you know, cat facts, </garnt>
<garnt> no printer. It's all about, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess like whether you're just like naturally susceptible </garnt>
<garnt> to, I guess like believing in things like spirituality and. </garnt>
<garnt> - All that kind of stuff. It's definitely is if you didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Grow up with that side, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - A little harder. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> It definitely comes to, I mean, </connor>
<connor> everyone around me was quite religious Christian or </connor>
<connor> Catholic, et cetera, et cetera. </connor>
<connor> I just, </connor>
<connor> I think my probably probably where I started to grow a </connor>
<connor> disdain towards that stuff is I just didn't enjoy it when I </connor>
<connor> was younger. Like I hated church. </connor>
<connor> I had all that stuff. Right. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you get older and you've discovered the internet, </connor>
<connor> you're like, oh, I can do my own research. </connor>
<connor> And then you start like Googling stuff. And then I dunno, </connor>
<connor> I think. </connor>
<connor> - I was very. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think it's entirely reflective of how I view the world. </connor>
<connor> Like I, you know, I guess like, what's the meaning of life, </connor>
<garnt> rock boy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro. You got to bring that out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right now. Like why, why, what are we, what is, </garnt>
<garnt> what is our purpose, man? </garnt>
<garnt> What are we doing? Rick and Morty it's too deep. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you know the same reason why, when I look at it, </garnt>
<garnt> I look at a fish. What's the, what's the fish doing? </garnt>
<garnt> What's the fish's purpose. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what. </garnt>
<garnt> - To get getting my stomach exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Be eaten by someone else. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I sit here and I look at like all these animals </garnt>
<garnt> that just there to be eaten, no to survive. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that in some senses, we're just the same. </garnt>
<garnt> We're not, we're not, we don't have some grand purpose to, </garnt>
<garnt> to have some spiritual experience. It's just, </garnt>
<garnt> we're just here to, eat and get on with our life. </garnt>
<joey> If I want to play some league of legends for 12 hours a day, </joey>
<joey> that the universe has allowed me because I've done my duty, </joey>
<joey> which is survive. </joey>
<joey> And now I can mentally destroy my life really. But you know, </joey>
<joey> I think once you've done, once you've survived, that's it. </joey>
<joey> I believe. </joey>
<joey> - I believe they call that a nihilist. </joey>
<joey> - The problem is is that now we just have, now, </joey>
<joey> now survival is just, the rules have changed, man. </joey>
<joey> You used to being a Sigma male man. It's hard. </joey>
<joey> They've got to pay bills. man. </joey>
<connor> - I can't be Sigma mail while I pay the bills. </connor>
<connor> - Don't pay your bills. </connor>
<connor> Bills paid you. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I've done it because that's, you know, </connor>
<connor> I don't really believe there's a lot of, </connor>
<connor> a lot of going on in life. </connor>
<connor> I just kinda think that you just kinda popped and you just, </connor>
<connor> just what you're doing. That's fine. </connor>
<connor> I wish that I could have some more enjoyment out of it, </connor>
<connor> but that's just not how I feel. I don't know why, man. </connor>
<connor> I wonder what made me feel that way. Well, </connor>
<connor> how do you guys feel about it? </connor>
<joey> It's just uncomfortable talking about it. Yeah, yeah, sure. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I guess like, I don't know, for me, it's like, </joey>
<joey> at least with like the whole ghost thing for me is like, </joey>
<joey> obviously I had that story. I told you guys about my sister. </joey>
<joey> - Do you feel like it reflects your kind of spiritual? </joey>
<connor> I believe more. </connor>
<connor> I have a lot more respect for spirituality than I do </connor>
<garnt> religion. I think organized religion, </garnt>
<garnt> not too fond of the podcast we're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like take, </garnt>
<connor> we're taking on every topic that you shouldn't be talking </connor>
<joey> about right now. </joey>
<joey> - No, I feel like for me personally, it's like, again, </joey>
<garnt> because I did grow up in a, I mean like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like the whole Shintoist belief and you know, </garnt>
<connor> used to go to temples all the time and you know, </connor>
<garnt> would hear stories about, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> my grandparents like being very, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> Shintoist and just believing in again, </garnt>
<garnt> like the whole spirituality and like spirituality. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I like something, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I can get behind anything that the general belief is a beat. </garnt>
<garnt> Good. And you all get good. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I was a kid, you know, my grandma would tell me like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, like don't throw the rubbish in the river. </garnt>
<connor> Not because it's bad for the pollution, </connor>
<connor> but because the river God is going to get angry at you and </connor>
<connor> don't come back to bite you in the. And I'm like, oh, well, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to angle them. </connor>
<connor> I'll do that. </connor>
<connor> It might be a little bit of an OSS back was legit. </connor>
<connor> But you know, </connor>
<connor> as a kid like that is I think a healthy way to like look at </connor>
<connor> a logical. </connor>
<connor> - Let's get behind anything, </connor>
<connor> but it's generally just be a nice person. That's like, </connor>
<connor> just give back. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's like, I feel like I'm, I want to do that just myself. </connor>
<connor> I don't need some kind of a belief system for me to do that. </connor>
<connor> I just want to be a good person and do that because I want </connor>
<connor> to give back. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not walking around as a 27 year old going, oh. </connor>
<connor> I've been in an angle. </connor>
<joey> Like at the back of my mind, there is a pot where it's, </joey>
<joey> you know, </joey>
<joey> it builds like not only respect for surroundings around you, </joey>
<joey> but also just becoming a better person. And it's like, </joey>
<connor> you do what you have to believe in. </connor>
<connor> As long as you're not hurting anyone else believe what you </connor>
<connor> have to believe in to be a better post. </connor>
<connor> - No, because like my experience was, you know, </connor>
<connor> obviously I was raised up to be a Buddhist and everything </connor>
<connor> like that and in my life. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, okay. </connor>
<connor> So I was so here's his, </connor>
<connor> here's a bit more behind that backstory. Right? </connor>
<connor> So I was a monk when I was like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Write it down, write it down. </connor>
<connor> - So as I said before, I was among two times in my life. </connor>
<connor> One time I was a kid, one time it was an adult. </connor>
<connor> So the kid thing was basically doing it. So I could like, </connor>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<connor> give good karma to my family because that's just how the </connor>
<connor> that's just how I was raised. You know. </connor>
<connor> - There's two Jensey. </connor>
<connor> I thought you were on about Reddit then for. </connor>
<connor> - Funnily enough karma was the concept that existed </connor>
<connor> So, so then I, you know, </connor>
<connor> so then after that I went to university, </connor>
<connor> grew up in everything and then I had this, I had this, </connor>
<garnt> you know, spiritual experience with, with, with, </garnt>
<garnt> with some people. And then after having that experience, </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of just like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what the right word or the right term to like </connor>
<connor> coin the SAS, </connor>
<connor> but I just kind of realized that I didn't know what the I </connor>
<connor> believed. Right. </connor>
<connor> Because, because, </connor>
<connor> because I had this experience that I couldn't explain </connor>
<garnt> logically, and I was like an engineer before, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm like everything scientific, </garnt>
<garnt> everything can be explained logically had this experience. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I kind of realized, what do I believe? </garnt>
<connor> And then there's one. </connor>
<connor> And then at that point I realized everything that I believed </connor>
<garnt> wasn't because I actually believed it. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was just because that was what I was raised to be. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. That's, </connor>
<joey> that's one thing that's really difficult because I mean, </joey>
<garnt> you have to be raised, will be raised by wolves. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's kind of hard to get an unbiased view of like a </garnt>
<garnt> religion or spirituality, </garnt>
<garnt> because you often have so much baggage or kind of backstory </garnt>
<joey> that kind of thing. So it's often hard to look at it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So like that, </joey>
<joey> that was like actually a huge turning point in my life that </joey>
<connor> like basically pull my Clate Sleen put me like, </connor>
<connor> put me on a clean slate. And I was like, okay, </connor>
<joey> I'm going to become a monk now that, and that was like, </joey>
<garnt> that was like the actual point when I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to become a monk. </garnt>
<garnt> Not because my parents told me to, </garnt>
<garnt> but because I need to like figure this out myself and figure </garnt>
<garnt> out is this what I actually believe? Or is it, </garnt>
<garnt> or is it something that was instilled to me as a kid? </garnt>
<garnt> And so that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> that was like the big decision maker to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to start something new in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to like try to experience this lifestyle. </garnt>
<garnt> Not because not because anyone told me to, </garnt>
<joey> but because I chose this, </joey>
<joey> I chose to experience this and whatever comes out of this </joey>
<garnt> experience and whatever comes out of these beliefs are my </garnt>
<garnt> own. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why right now I, you know, so I became a monk. </garnt>
<connor> When, </connor>
<connor> when you were alone by yourself with your thoughts for, for, </connor>
<connor> for four weeks or a month, two months, you have, </connor>
<connor> you have a lot of time to think about, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And so in these, in these like two months, you bet, </connor>
<connor> I basically had just like had time to rewind my entire life </connor>
<joey> and basically break down why I believe the things I do and </joey>
<joey> why I'm the person I am. And like, after becoming a mom can, </joey>
<joey> after having that time to myself and, you know, studying, </joey>
<joey> you know, I already knew about, you know, Buddhist, </joey>
<joey> the British religion and the Buddhist beliefs and the, </joey>
<joey> and so I, after that, I knew what I believed out of. </joey>
<garnt> Let's say, what's the traditional religion teaches you. </garnt>
<garnt> But I also had my own beliefs and my own views on top of </garnt>
<garnt> that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It should be there. I think that's, </garnt>
<garnt> you should take the calls of something like a structure that </garnt>
<connor> you have a spirit or whatever you like, </connor>
<joey> and then just kind of add your own of things that you really </joey>
<joey> want to Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Is pretty. </joey>
<joey> - Notorious for that. Right? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, yeah, this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is what we believe the whole thing </garnt>
<garnt> with like calmer as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I, I almost in like a scientific way. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that if, you know, if, if generally, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're a good, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you're a positive impact on people. I think just, </garnt>
<garnt> it just comes back like every. </garnt>
<connor> - Reaction as an </connor>
<connor> Do I believe there's this cosmic system? </connor>
<connor> - I don't have to think so. </connor>
<connor> I can just go and do whatever the I want it, but yeah, </connor>
<connor> it's got the soup kitchen. </connor>
<connor> - The kitchen. </connor>
<connor> But do I believe in, like in general, </connor>
<connor> if you're a good person that it will come back to you a </connor>
<connor> hundred percent? I believe, I truly believe that I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> that's that I guess is the biggest thing. </garnt>
<garnt> The biggest change before, like, </garnt>
<garnt> before me just being told what to believe and actually like </garnt>
<garnt> deciding what I believe it's like once you decided it, </garnt>
<garnt> or once I decided that nothing can change my opinion, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so like set in my beliefs because this is basically </garnt>
<garnt> everything that I've built from my entire experience of </garnt>
<garnt> life. </garnt>
<garnt> And the only thing that can change this is new things I </garnt>
<garnt> experienced. Because like, because that, and to me, </garnt>
<connor> that's why I guess nothing really phases me when it comes to </connor>
<connor> like, arguing about my beliefs, like my core beliefs, </connor>
<connor> because I'm I'm so I'm very set in it. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I have anything controversial either. </connor>
<connor> I've just got to be good. I mean, like you say, you, like, </connor>
<connor> you had all this whole experience, but I mean, </connor>
<joey> ultimately we, we came to the same conclusion right. </joey>
<joey> Through our own means. Right. </joey>
<joey> I think that's what it's about. I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I don't have a problem with how however you want to do your </garnt>
<garnt> life. Just don't. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. Don't be a negative impact. </joey>
<garnt> - Again, </garnt>
<garnt> you're free to believe whatever the you believe just don't </garnt>
<garnt> like hurt or inconvenience others. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what, </garnt>
<garnt> what me off is when people would try to put their beliefs on </garnt>
<garnt> other people. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I have my core beliefs and I firmly believed them, </garnt>
<connor> but I would never try to say, Hey, this is my experience. </connor>
<connor> And you should experience and believe exactly the same </connor>
<joey> things as me. Because, because to me, you can't, </joey>
<joey> you can't force that upon someone, you know, you can, </joey>
<garnt> you can raise a kid, </garnt>
<connor> but I hope my kid goes to the exact same thing that I went </connor>
<garnt> through when they realized, I know I need to like, </garnt>
<connor> decide the for myself. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's a lot of people watching this. </connor>
<joey> I've never thought about that this deeply. And you know, </joey>
<joey> that's, </joey>
<connor> that's not exactly a bad thing because it's something that I </connor>
<joey> never had to think about until I had some experience that </joey>
<joey> forced me to like, put myself, put me in this position. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, there's nothing. </joey>
<connor> You can just go your whole life. And you've been, </connor>
<connor> you've been raised to believe a certain thing and you just </connor>
<connor> never questioned it. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's what I always found quiet. Like, oh, </connor>
<connor> cause I always always questioning everything from like the </connor>
<connor> get-go like anything they told me, I was like, nah, I to, </connor>
<connor> you know, which is strange. </connor>
<connor> Cause I T I guess that's why I'm so adverse to stuff like </connor>
<connor> that. Because ever since a young age, </connor>
<connor> I can remember I was the annoying kid who was like, no, </connor>
<connor> I don't, I don't think that's right. </connor>
<connor> But that's just, cause I didn't know how I, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know why I got that mindset from, </connor>
<connor> but I've always been like that. </connor>
<connor> - This is some people just don't really question things </connor>
<connor> because they just think, oh, </connor>
<joey> if I just follow what everyone else believes, </joey>
<joey> and if I just follow the crowd, then nothing can go wrong. </joey>
<joey> Right. So you're. </joey>
<joey> - Telling me I'm a Sigma man. </joey>
<joey> I'm saying that you're a. </joey>
<joey> - Lead a Sigma. </joey>
<joey> You're a leader in your own mind. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just think some people </garnt>
<garnt> just have never thought that deeply </garnt>
<garnt> about it. And that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of people I've met. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of people I've met who are just happy and </garnt>
<garnt> they've, they've never like they've honestly, </garnt>
<connor> I wish I was more like that </connor>
<garnt> because my God likes some people. </garnt>
<connor> - Existential crisis in the bathtub. </connor>
<garnt> - Members of the church of the flying spaghetti monster. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what happy dude, we got spaghetti most thrown outside. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. For me, for me, I just think just, </connor>
<garnt> don't try to put your beliefs on other people. </garnt>
<garnt> Try to accept what anyone else believes. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if it's like different from yours, </garnt>
<garnt> you can believe what the you want. </garnt>
<garnt> You can like if people want to hear about your experiences </garnt>
<garnt> and give you the opportunity, then go ahead, </garnt>
<garnt> tell your experiences, tell your beliefs. </garnt>
<garnt> But if, if, if they're not interested, </garnt>
<garnt> which a lot of people are not going to be interested, </garnt>
<garnt> then just give them that don't get offended and don't get </garnt>
<connor> offended and don't get offended when they believe something </connor>
<connor> different as well. He understood. </connor>
<connor> - That whole aspect of it getting really angry about other </connor>
<garnt> people's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well like being like how dare you don't believe the same </garnt>
<garnt> thing I believe in. </garnt>
<garnt> I ain't never got that either. </garnt>
<joey> It just seems very like, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's like very like, </joey>
<joey> like self concerned about like feeding animals and like </joey>
<garnt> that. It's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just want people to be comfortable. So I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> I guess if you have a dietary requirement. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's not a big deal. </joey>
<joey> It was like one meal of my life that we won't be able to eat </joey>
<joey> pork. I think, I think I'll be all right. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm not offended. </joey>
<joey> It's fine. I'm good. </joey>
<joey> I'll I'll you know, and even then it's like, it's, it's, </joey>
<joey> it's, it's kind of strange. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Steve to I'll go in a bit of a lighter topic, but before. </joey>
<joey> - Where's the poop. There's not enough poop in this episode. </joey>
<joey> I just. </joey>
<joey> - Shipped myself. </joey>
<joey> - So I've been addicted to like a new type of video </joey>
<joey> reasonably. </joey>
<joey> - I know you tweeted about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. You're just like, it's like sometimes, </joey>
<joey> sometimes the YouTube algorithm just works in mysterious </joey>
<joey> ways. </joey>
<joey> - You know what, </joey>
<garnt> you know what sent a story that starts off with that </garnt>
<garnt> sentence? Isn't going to lead to anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. So like, so like grandiose. </garnt>
<garnt> So like I, I get this video recommended on my YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> I watched someone sharing cow hooves and like, </garnt>
<garnt> they get instant relief from bubbles. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, what's the? </garnt>
<garnt> What, what is, what is, what is YouTube thinking? </garnt>
<garnt> We'd be interested in. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have that section of like videos that I never subscribe </garnt>
<garnt> full, </garnt>
<garnt> but a pleasantly surprising when I watched them stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> restoration cleaning cars. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> There was one that was like testing mouse traps. </garnt>
<garnt> And this guy worked on a farm and he just had like every </garnt>
<garnt> single mouse trap. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. And it was just like, weirdly, </connor>
<connor> like weirdly like kinda like, oh, </connor>
<connor> that's cool how the trap works. So I'm watching my style. </connor>
<connor> So I of feel bad. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel the same way about like guys who want to link massive </garnt>
<connor> ant farms and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - Like. </connor>
<connor> - That makes me so anxious. </connor>
<connor> - Like, like I want one, up. </connor>
<connor> And like, you're just, it's just ants everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Just to say, I mean, he, he doesn't have to invite people, </connor>
<connor> whatever. </connor>
<connor> I think he gets out of having to have the friends over </connor>
<connor> by you, but I've got the end phone. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I remember just watching the Calhoun videos </connor>
<connor> and I was, </connor>
<connor> I've never been, I've never seen something that I've been, </connor>
<connor> that is like disgusting, but weirdly relaxing as well. </connor>
<connor> It's it's. </connor>
<connor> - This it's because that comes off so. </connor>
<joey> - Clean, it comes off so clean and just, it's kinda like, </joey>
<joey> you know, it's, </joey>
<joey> it's kinda like scratching an H or something like that. </joey>
<joey> Whereas. </joey>
<joey> - Videos. I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Like seeing the, </joey>
<joey> seeing the pus come out of like the cowl hooves. </joey>
<garnt> It's like disgusting. But like, for some, for some reason, </garnt>
<connor> when you see the words, instant relief in the title, </connor>
<connor> you're just like, I'm happy for the cow man. </connor>
<connor> I'm, I'm happy. </connor>
<connor> Something about instant relief. And the title is just like, </connor>
<connor> I feel better. I feel better for the cow. </connor>
<connor> It's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - We used to just do with cows. If we did, </connor>
<connor> wouldn't doing this, they just like chilling. </connor>
<connor> Just would that look disgusting? Terrorists. </connor>
<connor> - Just know, standing out in the paddock, </connor>
<connor> just chewing grass being like, well, </connor>
<connor> I'm an insufferable pain right now, but you know, what am I. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Evolution. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of up. Then I feed them. </connor>
<connor> Just collect. </connor>
<connor> Unable to clean them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because like these cattle hooves are like hard because what </connor>
<connor> they have to do, you use to share them. </connor>
<connor> It's like raise a shop and they can like barely, </connor>
<connor> barely get through them. </connor>
<connor> So how the these cows can survive without humans is just </connor>
<connor> beyond me. Cause I've seen some of the cow videos. </connor>
<connor> - Put them in like cages. </connor>
<connor> - Well maybe the reason why, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when cows tip over and they can't get up, </connor>
<connor> it's not because they can't get it just because they. </connor>
<connor> - Don't want it. </connor>
<connor> They're like, oh, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> Cause like I imagine it it's just like the worst ingrown </connor>
<connor> toenail you've ever had, </connor>
<connor> but you don't have anything to cut it. </connor>
<connor> And like I've, I've had some pretty bad ingrown toenails. </connor>
<connor> So I feel some kind of spiritual connection to the cow. </connor>
<connor> Just seeing this pus come out right. If God. </connor>
<connor> - And make a video like that, he put like instant relief. </connor>
<garnt> Hashtag relatable. </garnt>
<garnt> If it's relatable. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The me using a toilet instantly satisfying. </garnt>
<garnt> - 30 Minute compilation. You're using different. </garnt>
<garnt> - Per days. </garnt>
<garnt> Instant. </garnt>
<garnt> - Relief for J complex. </garnt>
<garnt> Relatable. This place is very special. </garnt>
<garnt> I went to a restaurant. I did want to vote it down. </garnt>
<garnt> One star. The toilet had an every day. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a really nice restaurant. They'd never seen it. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, what the? </connor>
<connor> What the got to go good at my meal after I've just wiped my. </connor>
<connor> Like an animal disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - Well maybe they expected you </connor>
<connor> to like finish the meal first. </connor>
<connor> Going. </connor>
<connor> - Back to It's not. </connor>
<connor> It's not. It's. </connor>

<garnt> I'll be down for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so bad. I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> It depends on you. Cause you know, </connor>
<connor> cause some people like different strengths and stuff and </connor>
<connor> some machines can't quite get the strength. Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Well, so it was like, how accurate is that? </connor>
