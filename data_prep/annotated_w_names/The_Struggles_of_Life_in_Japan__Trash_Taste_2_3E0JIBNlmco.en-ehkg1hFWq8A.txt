<connor> - I fell asleep in the bath once </connor>
<connor> with a nose bleed and it
was scary waking up to that. </connor>
<connor> You ever fell asleep in a bath? </connor>
<connor> - No, that's how people die. </connor>
<connor> - No, it was like a shallow bath. </connor>
<garnt> - You could still die.
- You could still die. </garnt>
<garnt> - How am I gonna like...
(guys laughing) </garnt>

<joey> - I know, right?
- Yeah, I just like came in </joey>
<joey> nonchalantly like I guess
welcome to the podcast. </joey>
<garnt> - Hey guys. </garnt>
<joey> Welcome to Trash Taste Podcast. </joey>
<connor> I should be like that 'cause
I'm gonna say right now, </connor>
<connor> apologies if I'm a bit out of
it, I'm slightly hung over, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it was my birthday
celebrations yesterday. </garnt>
<joey> - Woo!
- How old are you? 47? </joey>
<joey> I am, well, in YouTube years,
yes, because I've been around </joey>
<joey> since the beginning of YouTube basically, </joey>
<joey> but no, I've finally
hit my dirty thirties. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> That's scary, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I always forget the huge
age gap between us three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because between Connor
and Garnt, there's what? </garnt>
<joey> - Seven.
- Seven years? </joey>
<connor> - Seven years.
- I'm 23, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's fucking insane. </connor>
<garnt> I forget all the time that you are 23. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone thinks I'm like
30, especially in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I mean, it's the beard. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone is just beard, </connor>
<connor> you immediately have like four mortgages, </connor>
<connor> a car and two kids. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<joey> - But because it is or
it was Garnt's birthday, </joey>
<joey> I got him a gift. </joey>
<garnt> - I wonder what this could be. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wonder.
- I wonder. </garnt>
<joey> - It's manga. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - See, we've just reached that age </garnt>
<garnt> where this just a acceptable
gift that you can give anyone. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So let's do the unboxing, </connor>
<connor> shall we?
- ASMR unboxing. </connor>
<joey> - ASMR unboxing time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And you see we've already got wine glasses </joey>
<garnt> 'cause we had no idea what
this could possibly be. </garnt>
<connor> But ooh.
Ooh, ooh fancy. </connor>
<connor> - Ooh, okay.
- Yeah, it is fancy. </connor>
<connor> So basically at our supermarket, </connor>
<connor> I'll tell a story while
you're opening that. </connor>
<garnt> So basically at the supermarket
that we all live near </garnt>
<garnt> which I'm not gonna say, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a booze section,
like a liquor store section. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't know for the longest time </garnt>
<connor> that not only is there
a liquor store section </connor>
<connor> but there's like a
dedicated section to wine. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Like a wine room, I guess. </connor>
<joey> So I got an Italian one I think. </joey>
<joey> - Barolo.
- Barolo. </joey>
<garnt> - I misread this, at
first I was like Boruto? </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, is this the anime one? </garnt>
<connor> - Boruto wine.
- Boruto wine. </connor>
<garnt> - It just sounds like a
generic "Dragon Ball" villain. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Barolo.
- Barolo. </garnt>
<connor> - Goku Barolo. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you very much, Joey.
- Yeah, no worries. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know too much about wines </joey>
<joey> apart from if they're in- </joey>
<joey> - Red or white.
(guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what color is it? </joey>
<joey> - If they're red or white
or if they're one of the 10 </joey>
<garnt> from "Drops of God."
(guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think it's
that but Barolo is like, </joey>
<garnt> I think it's like pretty
well known in Italy, I think? </garnt>
<garnt> The guy was like, "Oh yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> if you want like a well known
Italian wine, get Barolo." </garnt>
<garnt> So hey, if anyone's watching this episode </garnt>
<garnt> or listening to this
episode and you're Italian </garnt>
<joey> let us know if you know Barolo. </joey>
<connor> - I just think they're gonna
be like the fuck is a Barolo? </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> We don't drink Barolo. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what they call Boruto in Italy. </garnt>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I just think it's funny
because how I got into wine, </garnt>
<garnt> because how I got into wine initially </garnt>
<garnt> was literally "Drops of God." </garnt>
<garnt> Because before that I was like </garnt>
<connor> why does anyone drink wine? </connor>
<connor> I just want a cold beer. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to like, </connor>
<garnt> but you read "Drops of God" once </garnt>
<connor> and you're like, I love wine! </connor>
<garnt> Wine's great! </garnt>
<connor> - I read "Drops of God" on a flight. </connor>
<garnt> I think it was, when was the flight? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know it was from
like America or somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remembered reading "Drops of God" </garnt>
<garnt> and you know when like
the little cart comes by? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And they're like, "What
do you want to drink?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like of course I want wine. </connor>
<connor> I'm a connoisseur of fine tastes. </connor>
<connor> Of course, why even ask me the question? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I was about to ask, </joey>
<connor> I hope you were drinking
wine on the flight </connor>
<connor> while you were reading it. </connor>
<connor> - So she gets out the
little bottle of wine, </connor>
<connor> they crack open, and pours it
into this plastic cup for me. </connor>
<connor> And it was like the most
pathetic drink I'd ever had </connor>
<connor> because I was sitting there
like swirling this plastic cup </connor>
<connor> that like a 10 year old
would drink a drink out of. </connor>
<connor> Just being like, "Yeah, that's good." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because table wine,
we all know table wine </joey>
<joey> on flights is basically
just like grape juice </joey>
<joey> with hand sanitizer in
it, like it's disgusting. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, 'cause you, you can't even taste </connor>
<garnt> like things that aren't like
super salty on flights anyways. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like wine is the worst thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it's that
point when you're watching </garnt>
<garnt> something that's super good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like for example, when
you're watching "Shokugeki"- </garnt>
<garnt> - And you just wanna cook. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like this food looks amazing </garnt>
<garnt> and you're sitting there </garnt>
<garnt> with your fucking takeaway convenient meal </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like "Mm, this
is this is kind of like </garnt>
<connor> A5 beef that I'm eating now." </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's A5 beef if I just
imagine hard enough. </connor>
<joey> - There's nothing more orgasmic
than Kraft Mac and cheese. </joey>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, thank you, wow.
- Oh yeah, let's pour that. </garnt>
<joey> Ooh.
- It's quite light. </joey>
<joey> - From such a height!
- From such a height. </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Which was another meme that originated </garnt>
<garnt> from "Drops of God." </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, come on. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sorry, okay? </joey>
<garnt> - Absolute amateur hour.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love how you're like tilting that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry, okay? </garnt>
<joey> I'm sorry!
(guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm not a waiter. </joey>
<connor> - When is the podcast
actually gonna start? </connor>
<joey> - The podcast is starting now. </joey>
<joey> Happy birthday. </joey>
<joey> - Cheers.
- Cheers. </joey>
<joey> - Happy birthday, Garnt.
- Thank you very much. </joey>
<joey> - Congratulations. </joey>
<connor> - So boys, what are we discussing today? </connor>
<connor> What are the topics on mind? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, on the topic of, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we talked about, 'cause we live
quite close together, right? </garnt>
<garnt> We live within walking distance. </garnt>
<joey> - A five minute walking distance. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I guess I think
a good topic would be </joey>
<garnt> what our experiences are
like living here in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> now that we've all finally moved here. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we just moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> how many months have we
been living here now? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually like eight.
- Eight months. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is crazy 'cause-
- Really? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> October so it's just hit June. </joey>
<joey> So it was like, and this
was like middle of June. </joey>
<joey> It was like seven and
a half months I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah.
- That's scary. </garnt>
<connor> It does not feel like it at all. </connor>
<connor> - No, no.
- Well, to be fair, </connor>
<connor> the last two months I might as well </connor>
<garnt> have been living in fucking Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Quarantine does things to you. </joey>
<garnt> I hadn't heard anyone speak Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> for like about two months </garnt>
<garnt> except for like that brief moment </garnt>
<garnt> when you'd go out to buy groceries, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just forget that
I was living in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Legit. </joey>
<joey> I remember catching the train </joey>
<joey> for the first time in like two months. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, </joey>
<joey> the world is full of wonder! </joey>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I felt like I was, like "Cast Away." </connor>
<joey> Like when he like came back- </joey>
<joey> - Tom Hanks. </joey>
<joey> - Tom Hanks after "Cast Away" </joey>
<joey> when he came back to humanity. </joey>
<connor> He's like (gasping). </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<joey> Wilson, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if you guys have yet </garnt>
<joey> but I still haven't gone into Tokyo yet. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I went there for-
- Like central Tokyo. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think the first time I
went there was like yesterday </joey>
<joey> and that was literally
just 'cause it was like </joey>
<joey> quarantine was over just on
like the day of my birthday. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm like woo, this is fate. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna go out and have some nice food. </garnt>
<garnt> But even now, there's like a
lot of places are still closed </garnt>
<garnt> so it's still not like
everything's open yet, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, it's been a
really fast eight months. </garnt>
<garnt> It hasn't felt like eight months at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess my first question to you guys- </garnt>
<garnt> (glass dings) </garnt>
<joey> My first question to you guys is like </joey>
<joey> what made you decide to move
to Japan in the first place? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you've been here
for how many years now? </joey>
<joey> - I've been here four years now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I guess for you,
it's more obvious though. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, 'cause I've spent what? </joey>
<garnt> Like half my life here </garnt>
<garnt> and I have family up north and in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> At least with me like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure I've said
this in videos before, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I was gonna move to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> after I graduated from uni anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think this
was like back when I had </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like 20K, 30K subs. </garnt>
<garnt> So I wasn't doing it full-time at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was in my second year of university </garnt>
<garnt> and I was interning at
like a Japanese IT company, </garnt>
<connor> which I believe is now defunct. </connor>
<connor> Like it doesn't exist
anymore I don't think, </connor>
<connor> so glad that internship
never went through. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- But yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> so I was gonna move to Japan anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> because like it just makes sense for me </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm fluent in
both English and Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> which is such a huge plus here. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you know both languages, </garnt>
<garnt> you can pretty much get a job anywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll get to that. We'll get to that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like no one in
Australia gives a shit </garnt>
<garnt> if you can speak Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- Like my dad works </garnt>
<garnt> at like a Japanese IT
company for 30 years. </garnt>
<garnt> He can't speak a word of Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because no one in the
office can speak Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> but here it's like if
you can speak English, </garnt>
<garnt> you can do business with
anybody in or out of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> So it just was like a natural
process for me to like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, I get my paper, </garnt>
<joey> I work at some fucking IT company in Japan </joey>
<joey> and then we're all good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's funny </garnt>
<garnt> because I reckon one of the few industries </garnt>
<garnt> where Japanese can be
super, super important </garnt>
<joey> is anime and manga, right? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. Exactly.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You maxed out your luck there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> So either way, It was
just a natural path for me </joey>
<garnt> to move here. </garnt>
<garnt> But instead of doing that desk job </garnt>
<garnt> that I had set my plans on, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube, for me, blew up
like in my third year of uni </garnt>
<garnt> when I graduated. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was just like, all right, I'll- </garnt>
<garnt> - Guess I'll do this. </garnt>
<joey> - Guess I'll do YouTube
for as long as I can </joey>
<garnt> and then-
- You're still doing it. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm still doing it,
somehow I'm still doing it. </joey>
<garnt> I know, it's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> The story of or I guess
like the original plan </garnt>
<garnt> that was brought up to
you guys about moving here </garnt>
<joey> was like a year ago? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I wanted
to move here for a while. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember since we first met each other </garnt>
<garnt> and since my first trip to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like I could really
see myself living here. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is not like the
typical weeb kind of fantasy. </garnt>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> I actually never had that. </joey>
<connor> I remember back in the day
when it was like mid 2000s, </connor>
<connor> the weeb dream was to live in Japan and- </connor>
<joey> - Work in the anime industry.
- Work in the anime industry. </joey>
<joey> It was just like a fucking dream </joey>
<joey> that nobody had ever proven or, you know? </joey>
<joey> So it was just that weeb dream, </joey>
<joey> but I never really wanted that. </joey>
<joey> I was like I'm happy with a normal career. </joey>
<joey> I'd never really fantasized
about going to Japan. </joey>
<joey> But I remember the first time I came here, </joey>
<garnt> it was so eye-opening for
me because it was like </garnt>
<garnt> you know that feeling
when you're like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> this country just works in a lot of ways </garnt>
<garnt> and it's do with my job
so I'm like this could be </garnt>
<garnt> a really good opportunity for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I definitely felt the same thing </connor>
<garnt> with how I thought about Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't have cared
less about living here. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought people who
were learning the language, </garnt>
<garnt> at the time I was like 15, 14, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, that's kind of cringe, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But like now, that I've
actually started to learn it- </garnt>
<garnt> - God, I regret it so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - I regret that I didn't learn any </garnt>
<connor> because I could have been like
a few months ahead at least </connor>
<connor> of learning the language. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I was more weeaboo. </connor>
<connor> Like now that the cringey
weeaboo phase is over. </connor>
<connor> I wish I was that cringey weeaboo </connor>
<connor> because that would give me so much more </connor>
<garnt> of an advantage now
that I'm her ein Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And a part of me, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I used to think that way, </garnt>
<connor> like anyone who's learning
it, is was just like wow. </connor>
<connor> It's so sad, you're never
actually gonna learn it. </connor>
<connor> But to be fair if you're
learning anything, </connor>
<connor> any other kinds of language, </connor>
<connor> especially if you only speak one, </connor>
<connor> I think that's like good on
you, better yourself, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like who gives a shit? </connor>
<connor> And I really regret that
I thought that everyone </connor>
<garnt> who's learning Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> because of anime's pathetic. </garnt>
<garnt> But then again, I was like
an edgy teenager, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And we all think that
and yeah, like you said, </garnt>
<garnt> I had no intention or want to live here. </garnt>
<garnt> I was pretty content in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> And even when I visited
here, I thought, wow, </garnt>
<garnt> this is an amazing place
to come visit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't think I was
still sold yet on moving here </garnt>
<garnt> because I think, I don't
know about you guys, </garnt>
<garnt> but I really need friends. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I need that social interaction. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not speaking for every weeb, </connor>
<connor> but I do need to have
friends that I see often, </connor>
<connor> otherwise I really get like upset. </connor>
<joey> - You're like the
antithesis of every weeaboo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I need to socialize </connor>
<connor> or it really starts to take a toll on me. </connor>
<garnt> I was just like, I really like worried </garnt>
<garnt> that I wouldn't be able to
have a good social circle </garnt>
<garnt> and meet people
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, luckily that
hasn't been the case, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I guess the big
difference between you and me is </garnt>
<garnt> that I've already like, before Japan, </garnt>
<joey> I had already lived in Thailand
for a good like three years. </joey>
<garnt> So I had experience moving
to a different country </garnt>
<joey> and finding new friends and
to me it was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> I'm just starting the
process all over again. </joey>
<joey> Then it's just a new adventure, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> So it was a lot easier for me to decide, </garnt>
<garnt> hey, I'm gonna move to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess the biggest thing
that made me think is that, </garnt>
<garnt> do I really want to go
through this process again? </garnt>
<garnt> How long do I see myself
actually living here? </garnt>
<garnt> And to me it was like,
this is the last big move </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna do before I kind
of start to think about- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's crazy.
- Staying in one place </joey>
<joey> instead of flying to different
countries every few months, </joey>
<garnt> which is what I was doing before. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how you
were doing that for like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- 'Cause you were going </garnt>
<garnt> from Thailand's a UK to America and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - Full triangle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had three offices. </garnt>
<garnt> I had one in Thailand, one
in the UK and one in America. </garnt>
<joey> - That's major entrepreneur
moves right there, dude. </joey>
<garnt> I have three offices all over the world. </garnt>
<connor> - Look how many corner
offices this man has. </connor>
<connor> - The traveling just gets to you, man. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know when you're at university, </joey>
<joey> you're like I just want to travel, </joey>
<joey> I want to get out, I want
to experience new things, </joey>
<garnt> but you do it every year
for about a good four years </garnt>
<garnt> and it fucking gets to you.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I think I'm definitely
starting to phase out of that </connor>
<garnt> like just any excuse to travel is great, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause now I'm really starting
to detest some travel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Remember when traveling
to AnimeCons was exciting </garnt>
<garnt> and now the thought of
having to go on a plane </garnt>
<garnt> to get somewhere, </garnt>
<garnt> to me, it's a lot harder
than it used to be. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess, because it was just, </connor>
<connor> of because how it's become, </connor>
<joey> it's always a 10 plus hour flight </joey>
<joey> and that's like the thing
that is really draining. </joey>
<garnt> We must sound, God, I'm so annoyed </garnt>
<joey> we have to travel so much. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I hate it when these
cons pay for our travel. </joey>
<joey> Ugh!
- Right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I guess it happens
when you travel a shit ton. </joey>
<connor> I'm sure anyone who has
like parents or family, </connor>
<connor> friends who work, their
whole business has to travel, </connor>
<garnt> it does become draining pretty quickly. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it is a job
at the end of the day. </connor>
<garnt> People want to travel, but if
you've ever had a office job, </garnt>
<garnt> which I did for the BBC and
you had to travel to Europe, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to travel to these places </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just hours and hours
of traveling for the job. </garnt>
<garnt> It drains you no matter
where you're traveling to, </garnt>
<joey> if you travel there enough, </joey>
<garnt> it'll eventually drain you. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a massive difference </garnt>
<garnt> between traveling for pleasure
and traveling for business. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it might not seem
there's a huge difference, </garnt>
<garnt> especially to someone
who doesn't travel a lot. </garnt>
<joey> But after a while,
you're just like, oh man, </joey>
<joey> I have to go on this flight. </joey>
<joey> Versus yay, I get to go on this flight. </joey>
<connor> - I think the only time
I'm excited for a flight </connor>
<garnt> is when Netflix drops a whole show </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm like super hyped for. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, sweet, I got 10 hours </garnt>
<garnt> of no one bothering me.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I can watch this, hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's like the only time. </connor>
<connor> But the worst is when you get to the app </connor>
<garnt> and you're like fuck, I
didn't download anything. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh God.
- And you're like oh no. </connor>
<connor> I have to pay for shitty wifi </connor>
<connor> to scroll on Twitter for 12 hours. </connor>
<joey> - Cool. I have to play this
solitaire game for 10 hours </joey>
<joey> that doesn't require any internet. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like when you sit down for a shit </garnt>
<joey> and you realize your phone's on 1% battery </joey>
<joey> and you're like what do I do
when this battery runs out? </joey>
<garnt> - So.
- Oh, go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Another thing is time differences </garnt>
<connor> and adjusting sleep schedule. </connor>
<connor> I got a question for you </connor>
<connor> because we went through
the same kind of flights. </connor>
<connor> How did you find the traveling </connor>
<connor> to the Crunchyroll Anime Awards? </connor>
<garnt> Because to put things in perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> we were there for like one day, two days. </garnt>
<garnt> And we had to travel, how
long did you have to travel? </garnt>
<connor> - 16 ish hours I think it was </connor>
<garnt> for the Crunchyroll Anime
Awards, yeah, it was around that. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me it was 21 hours of traveling. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because you were
in the UK at the time. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, I was in Thailand
which is even worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the straw that
broke the camel's back. </garnt>
<garnt> After that, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm traveling too far, </garnt>
<garnt> there's gotta be something, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember hanging out with you </connor>
<connor> after you came back from that </connor>
<connor> and you were still pissed off about </connor>
<joey> that you had to endure that. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, all right, well. </joey>
<connor> - I just want to say cheers Crunchyroll </connor>
<garnt> for not inviting me to that. </garnt>
<connor> You saved me a lot of trouble. </connor>
<connor> - It's a great experience. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to be brand friendly here. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you brand. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not saying the experience is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> The thing that was bad was me
having to adjust immediately </garnt>
<garnt> to like a 16 hour time difference </garnt>
<joey> and then two days later
have to adjust back </joey>
<garnt> and try to be in a working state. </garnt>
<joey> - Not to mention, in between
that you have to go on stage </joey>
<joey> in front of thousands of
people and be like, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<connor> just nail this, don't
act like you're sleepy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- No pressure. </connor>
<joey> - It was fun overall though. </joey>
<garnt> I liked networking with people </garnt>
<garnt> and meeting other YouTubers
you don't get to see often </garnt>
<garnt> is pretty fun. </garnt>
<garnt> But anyway, cycling
back to the Japan stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> When in your timeline, did you get </garnt>
<connor> I guess presented with the
idea or the offer of moving? </connor>
<connor> Like when was that? </connor>
<connor> Do you remember the date-ish? </connor>
<garnt> - I can't remember the dates. </garnt>
<connor> - The exact time and
location, like roughly. </connor>
<garnt> - When was it for you
because if you remember- </garnt>
<connor> - I know that you knew, </connor>
<connor> the offered had presented
itself to you before me. </connor>
<connor> And I think it must have been </connor>
<connor> in either like February, March-ish. </connor>
<connor> It was like three or months
before AX I know that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I remember it was
like at least a year ago </joey>
<joey> when I heard about it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so it was, I think,
I guess from the timeline </connor>
<connor> where it came up to me
knowing it was a possibility </connor>
<connor> to me actually like finishing the move </connor>
<garnt> is probably like what? </garnt>
<connor> Seven, eight months.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's been well over a year for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I knew
that you knew before me. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah, how it happened for me was </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I was just sitting
in a BookWalker meeting </garnt>
<garnt> and we were just talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember, some random stuff </garnt>
<garnt> about what BookWalker
wants to do in the future. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the person who I
was talking to, which is, </garnt>
<garnt> can I mention your name Meilyne? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't throw me under the bus. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna throw you under the bus. </garnt>
<connor> - I will.
(guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So Meilyne, who is
basically our manager, </connor>
<connor> one of our managers now,
she basically just asked me, </connor>
<connor> "Have you ever thought
about moving to Japan?" </connor>
<garnt> And that was just kind of a, </garnt>
<garnt> it just kind of came
out of nowhere for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know how to react to that. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like that's a loaded question, </garnt>
<connor> but I mean, I'm not gonna say no, </connor>
<connor> but you know when you're
like asked a question- </connor>
<connor> - And it's obviously for a purpose, </connor>
<connor> like it's not a hypothetical. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, oh, this
could actually be a thing. </connor>
<garnt> And so I went away, I thought about it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm not gonna do it
now than when in my life </garnt>
<garnt> am I gonna do it?
- Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I guess the
idea just grew from there </garnt>
<garnt> from it being a hypothetical question </garnt>
<connor> to what needs to happen to
be able to bring an anituber </connor>
<connor> to Japan as a job? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - And so that started my whole process. </connor>
<garnt> When did you hear about it? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it was, </connor>
<connor> It must've been around March or February. </connor>
<connor> I'm not a 100% sure. </connor>
<connor> I think I was on call with Meilyne </connor>
<joey> and I think Meilyne brought it up to me </joey>
<joey> and it was basically the same thing. </joey>
<joey> Where it was like the hypothetical- </joey>
<joey> - Do you like Japan?
(guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, something like that, right? </joey>
<joey> And I think I was just like "Oh wait," </joey>
<garnt> well maybe I was in Japan at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> It was something, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The thing where it was like not concrete </garnt>
<connor> And it was like, hey,
think about it, you know? </connor>
<garnt> Like do you want to do it? </garnt>
<connor> And then I think two or three months later </connor>
<garnt> it became a bit more serious of like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, do you want to do it? </garnt>
<garnt> I think, was that similar thing to you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we had time to think about it </garnt>
<connor> and then seriously they asked us. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and it went from a hypothetical to, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, oh, this is actually happening. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm moving to Japan and this- </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause yeah, I don't
think I've spoke to you </connor>
<connor> about your thoughts on it. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I might have at the
time, but I can't remember. </connor>
<garnt> But were you like from the
first time you got heard </garnt>
<garnt> or you were given the offer,
were you gonna take it or? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think I was always
going to take it I think </garnt>
<garnt> because I had wanted to
move to Japan for a while </garnt>
<garnt> even if it was for a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> hadn't really put much
thought into how long </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to stay here but I was thinking, </garnt>
<joey> you only get this chance
once in your life. </joey>
<joey> If I hated it, then like great, </joey>
<garnt> at least at least I've done it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I was pretty concrete
when I got the offer </garnt>
<garnt> that I was gonna take it. </garnt>
<garnt> What I was more worried about was how </garnt>
<garnt> it was actually going to happen </garnt>
<garnt> or what the process is- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think there's
a lot of stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> where I guess 'cause we'd only interacted </connor>
<garnt> with BookWalker through Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> I think maybe we were a bit like skeptical </garnt>
<joey> about what goes on in the back end, right? </joey>
<connor> We were like I don't know
what's happening, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But they're great </connor>
<garnt> by the way, they took
care of us very nicely. </garnt>
<garnt> And Meilyne will kill
me if I say otherwise. </garnt>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's against the contract
to say anything negative. </garnt>
<connor> But I think the huge
advantage for at least you two </connor>
<connor> was the fact that and
I know a lot of people </connor>
<connor> who don't do this and definitely should </connor>
<connor> is that you guys visited
Japan enough times to- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, twice. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean, you know. </connor>
<connor> - I was there for a while- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but I know a lot of stories </connor>
<garnt> of like people who move here </garnt>
<garnt> just thinking like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan is this wonderful place </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, like nothing could go wrong </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone's so friendly. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they move here </garnt>
<joey> and their expectations are
just completely rejected. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. There's a lot of
stuff that's different </connor>
<connor> between visiting and moving here, </connor>
<connor> which we can get into later. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because for me, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it goes back to the mentality of </garnt>
<garnt> I never felt like moving here </garnt>
<garnt> or I never thought I
would want to move here </garnt>
<garnt> because of the fact that I liked anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's the biggest thing. </garnt>
<garnt> If you want to move to
Japan just purely for anime, </garnt>
<joey> you're gonna have a bad time. </joey>
<garnt> - Throw away the weeaboo dreams, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not real. </garnt>
<joey> - There's pretty worse reasons, </joey>
<joey> but it's pretty one of the worser ones. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like for me, in terms
of my exposure to anime, </garnt>
<garnt> it hasn't actually increased too much </garnt>
<garnt> compared to when I was living in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> because there is like a massive
anime fandom in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> and just Asia in general. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a big difference
between say England to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> but from Thailand to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I still have to watch anime online </garnt>
<garnt> because you can't watch on TV </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't understand it yet. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and even If you did, </connor>
<connor> the schedule of airing is so weird. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm not gonna stay up till 3:00 am </joey>
<connor> to watch-
- It's so sporadic. </connor>
<joey> - It's just not worth it.
- Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It kind of like reminds me of </connor>
<joey> like old cartoon
broadcast schedule, right? </joey>
<joey> Like it's all over the place
and repeats constantly. </joey>
<garnt> Like it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, anyway, I think when I
was presented with the offer </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't initially want,
I wasn't that keen on it </garnt>
<connor> mainly because I didn't
really know anything. </connor>
<connor> And when someone's like, "Hey, </connor>
<connor> do you want to come here to this country?" </connor>
<connor> And it's like, okay, I mean, Japan's cool, </connor>
<connor> but I don't-
- It's a big decision. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I literally don't know anything. </joey>
<garnt> I think over time, I just,
especially when I found out </garnt>
<garnt> that you were gonna go 100%, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that was like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> well at least I have my boys here. </garnt>
<garnt> So if I do get lonely, we good. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, yeah, meeting
friends wasn't a problem anyway </garnt>
<joey> but I think-
- It is scary though. </joey>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<joey> I think I'll go into later with like </joey>
<connor> what I think is important
when you move here </connor>
<connor> and then just got to the point </connor>
<connor> where I had nothing better going on </connor>
<garnt> and then people gave me so much shit </garnt>
<garnt> for saying that on my video, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I literally said in my video, </garnt>
<garnt> I said, "I just had
nothing better going on, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I moved here." </garnt>
<garnt> And people think that
I'm being like nonchalant </garnt>
<garnt> or joking, like I didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're a YouTuber you
don't have anything to do </garnt>
<garnt> other than YouTube and
hang out with your friends </garnt>
<connor> and do whatever you
need to do to be happy. </connor>
<connor> But I literally had
nothing better going on, </connor>
<connor> so I'm in my head </connor>
<connor> there's no reason why I wouldn't take this </connor>
<connor> 'cause it gives me a purpose
to just better myself </connor>
<connor> as a person, I get to learn new things, </connor>
<connor> get to meet new people. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's a huge
reason why I moved as well as </connor>
<connor> is because like in Australia like- </connor>
<connor> - What are you doing?
- Right. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I had like great friends
from uni and high school </garnt>
<garnt> who I would hang out with
every now and then, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I had places to go to </garnt>
<garnt> but it wasn't exciting anymore for me, </garnt>
<connor> it was just routine.
- Yeah, that's how it is. </connor>
<garnt> - And I hate getting into
routine with anything, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, yeah, I mean, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't like, yes I've spent
half my life here technically </garnt>
<garnt> but I haven't really like gone out </garnt>
<garnt> to fully explore the country </garnt>
<garnt> and even four years later, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm nowhere near close
to exploring this place. </garnt>
<garnt> There are so many more
places I want to go to. </garnt>
<connor> - I still haven't left Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> It's been like eight months
and I haven't left Tokyo. </connor>
<garnt> - That road trip that
we planned is happening. </garnt>
<joey> All right? Once the rona
is gone, it's happening. </joey>
<garnt> - I've left Tokyo once. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> The decision to move
to Japan funnily enough </joey>
<garnt> was probably the easiest
part of the process. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, well, first of all,
I mean, you're very lucky. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> If you're half Japanese and
have a Japanese passport, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna be easy to move here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Easy move, baby. </garnt>
<joey> - For anyone else who's
thinking about moving to Japan, </joey>
<garnt> whatever visa you're
thinking about coming on, </garnt>
<connor> it is going to be-
- It's hell, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's tough. </garnt>
<connor> - And this year or this
year from, oh, sorry, </connor>
<connor> from April this year I
believe they changed the rules </connor>
<connor> to make visas more or easier to get </connor>
<connor> because they need more
immigrants to work here </connor>
<connor> because the population is getting older. </connor>
<connor> And they allocated 40,000 worker permits. </connor>
<connor> And in the article, they only
managed to allocate 4,000 </connor>
<joey> this year of the 40,000. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, it's 40,000 per year? </joey>
<joey> - For some specific kind of visa </joey>
<joey> for this year I think or something </joey>
<garnt> and they only managed to do 1/10th of that </garnt>
<garnt> which is like not a problem </garnt>
<connor> because I don't think there's like, </connor>
<connor> there's not demand to move here. </connor>
<connor> This is probably one of the countries </connor>
<connor> that I think people have most interest </connor>
<garnt> in moving to out of a lot of places. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just, I think
that if anything says a lot </garnt>
<garnt> about how difficult it is to move here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I can't speak on
any other visa processes, </connor>
<connor> but you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone I've talked to
has had a difficult process </garnt>
<garnt> unless you're just coming
here for a tourist visa. </garnt>
<garnt> - Super easy.
- Super easy. </garnt>
<connor> - Just walk in, literally just turn up. </connor>
<connor> - Or if you're one of those countries </connor>
<connor> that has working holiday visa.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Which unfortunately America does not. </garnt>
<joey> So sorry Americans. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, if you want advice
on how to move here easily </garnt>
<garnt> get a working holiday visa. </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably gonna be- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think those last a year and a half? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it a year and a half? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it depends on the country. </garnt>
<garnt> At least Australians
have a year and a half. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow.
- I don't know about UK, </garnt>
<joey> maybe UK has like six months
to a year maybe, depends. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of paperwork we had to fill out. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the
hardest part of the process </garnt>
<joey> was finding an apartment. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm a Japanese citizen </garnt>
<joey> and it was still a pain in
the ass for me to do it. </joey>
<connor> - You hear about on YouTube
and Twitter and everything </connor>
<connor> like it's hard, it's hard. </connor>
<connor> And then you see some people saying like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, people are over exaggerating." </connor>
<garnt> It is 100% hard.
- No, it's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is fucking difficult. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially if you're
a foreigner as well. </garnt>
<garnt> You basically play under different rules. </garnt>
<garnt> It's sad to say like you know, </garnt>
<connor> and you kind of think if you have money, </connor>
<connor> you get an apartment. </connor>
<joey> - I think more importantly,
especially if you're a YouTuber- </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - Because the hardest
thing, at least in Japan, </connor>
<connor> from my experience about why it's so hard </connor>
<garnt> to get a fucking apartment here is </garnt>
<garnt> because freelancing is not a job here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Freelancing, </garnt>
<connor> you might as well be unemployed </connor>
<joey> according to this government's- </joey>
<garnt> - The government's like
that typical Asian parent. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Who's like, "What? </joey>
<garnt> You're not a doctor or
an engineer or a lawyer?" </garnt>
<joey> Get out of here. </joey>
<connor> - You're unemployed, right? </connor>
<joey> You're working part time. </joey>
<joey> - And that's due to,
because they're worried </joey>
<connor> about if you can pay all whatnot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<joey> But the thing is, is that
they don't even like, </joey>
<joey> you know, at least in like,
I don't know about the UK </joey>
<joey> or Thailand, but at least in Australia, </joey>
<joey> when you sign up for
like an apartment, right? </joey>
<joey> Usually the landlord will be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, can I see your bank account?" </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like just to see how much money </joey>
<garnt> you have saved up, you know? </garnt>
<joey> Regardless of what job you
do, we just want to see </joey>
<joey> that you have money in
the bank and if you do, </joey>
<garnt> then you're like okay. </garnt>
<joey> But here in Japan, they
don't check your bank. </joey>
<joey> They check your work status to make sure </joey>
<joey> that there's like a constant
flow of money coming in. </joey>
<joey> - And it's not just that as well, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause if you're not Japanese </garnt>
<connor> and especially if you
can't speak Japanese, </connor>
<connor> most places aren't even gonna
talk to you or consider you. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that was a big problem we had </connor>
<connor> because we went through an agency </connor>
<connor> and we just made a list of
about 10 to 20 apartments </connor>
<connor> that we were interested in. </connor>
<connor> And we sent it off and applied- </connor>
<connor> - Rejected from all of them.
- Rejected from all of them. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - And we had a company as a guarantor </connor>
<connor> so having the payments
secured wasn't the issue. </connor>
<connor> It was like a lot of the time
it was really dumb stuff. </connor>
<garnt> Like can you sort the bins
properly and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like yes, we're not 12 year olds. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the main concern
you'll hear all the time </connor>
<connor> is can you sort your trash properly? </connor>
<connor> And it's like, okay, it might be different </connor>
<connor> from where I'm from but like- </connor>
<connor> - I can learn.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's like the government
councils in the area </connor>
<joey> give you an English manual
that tells you how to do it. </joey>
<joey> It is tedious and it is a lot more complex </joey>
<joey> than most places, but it's not like- </joey>
<joey> - It's not rocket science. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's not like you're having to do </joey>
<connor> the weirdest stuff
imaginable to this stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like it's basically just rinse your stuff, </connor>
<connor> separate all of it, that's pretty much it. </connor>
<joey> And I know there's some places in Europe </joey>
<joey> that do it way more thorough </joey>
<joey> that probably don't have this concern </joey>
<connor> when they're letting people rent houses. </connor>
<connor> It's just like- </connor>
<connor> - Because it's the least of your concerns. </connor>
<joey> It's, you know? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It's ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah and the thing is that
if you go through an agency, </garnt>
<garnt> for example, that
specializes in foreigners </garnt>
<joey> and people who can't speak Japanese, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be paying
so much more as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you pay a premium for that bill. </joey>
<joey> - You pay like a premium
for that bill and that rent. </joey>
<joey> So you either have a
fucking difficult time </joey>
<garnt> finding a place and getting
past all the barriers </garnt>
<garnt> or you're just gonna
pay a shit ton of money </garnt>
<garnt> and those aren't two very good options. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> The only concern that they often cite, </connor>
<connor> building managers, etc, </connor>
<connor> that I find is like somewhat,
all right, that's fair enough, </connor>
<connor> is their worried that you'll run away, </connor>
<connor> run away and not pay the rent. </connor>
<connor> But if you have a guarantor,
that's the whole fucking point </connor>
<connor> of that problem, which- </connor>
<connor> - You can't run away. </connor>
<connor> - If you run away, you're
still getting your money </connor>
<connor> and the house is vacant. </connor>
<connor> Great, no damage to it. </connor>
<connor> This is a win-win for the company. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand. </connor>
<connor> You play by their rules in every way. </connor>
<joey> - It's because it's just like typical, </joey>
<connor> this is like one aspect
of Japanese work culture </connor>
<connor> that I learned very quickly is that </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter what the business is. </connor>
<connor> If they're not 100000000% sure </connor>
<connor> that this is going to go through, </connor>
<connor> it might as well be 0%. </connor>
<connor> - No risk, yeah, they don't risk here. </connor>
<connor> - There's no risk in any business venture, </connor>
<garnt> whether that be paying
for rent or anything, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like if they not 100000000% sure </garnt>
<garnt> in every possible avenue ever, </garnt>
<connor> it's just not happening. </connor>
<joey> And you know, it's ridiculous. </joey>
<connor> - I think that'd be interesting
to talk about later on </connor>
<garnt> when we get to more of the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that we've experienced here, </garnt>
<garnt> but was there any part of the
visa process applying for it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm sure people are
wondering, I got a lot of emails. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure you did as well. </garnt>
<garnt> People asking, "Hey,
how did you get a visa? </garnt>
<garnt> Was it hard?" </garnt>
<garnt> Et cetera, et cetera. </garnt>
<garnt> If there's any advice you can give someone </garnt>
<garnt> who's watching who wants to come to Japan, </garnt>
<connor> what would you say is like
the main piece of advice? </connor>
<connor> If they want to get a working visa? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I didn't
apply for a working visa </garnt>
<connor> so I don't have too
much experience with it. </connor>
<connor> - We didn't apply for it. </connor>
<connor> We had an immigration lawyers help us. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. We had immigration
lawyers help us, </connor>
<garnt> but I mean, I've applied for visas before. </garnt>
<garnt> And the worst, the most
painful part is just waiting. </garnt>
<joey> - And you're gonna be waiting a lot. </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna be waiting a long time </joey>
<garnt> and you're just gonna be
in this limbo kind of- </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause we had what? </connor>
<connor> It was like the initial
thing where they file </connor>
<connor> for something called a
Certificate of Eligibility </connor>
<connor> which is basically if
the government decides </connor>
<connor> if you can have a visa,
which isn't the visa itself, </connor>
<connor> which already sounds to me like, </connor>
<joey> that sounds like we're adding steps </joey>
<joey> where steps don't need to be. </joey>
<joey> But as you move to Japan, </joey>
<joey> you'll learn that's what they love to do. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, we had to wait, what was it? </joey>
<joey> Six weeks for that, six to eight weeks? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, six to eight weeks. </joey>
<joey> - It could have been six to eight weeks </joey>
<joey> for this piece of paper to arrive, </joey>
<joey> which then they send by post </joey>
<joey> which makes you feel so uneasy </joey>
<joey> because you're like they're
sending me a piece of paper </joey>
<joey> through the mail that
I've waited two months for </joey>
<garnt> and you're just like
something's gonna go wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Someone's gonna take it. </garnt>
<garnt> So you get this piece of paper, right? </garnt>
<garnt> To get this thing you need to prove </garnt>
<garnt> that you have a good
reason to work in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> that the job or, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you have to say what your work is. </garnt>
<garnt> They need to check that </garnt>
<connor> you are actually in that
field, et cetera, et cetera. </connor>
<joey> - We had to send so much evidence </joey>
<connor> that we were doing
valuable work that could- </connor>
<connor> - Which I'm sure some people would argue </connor>
<connor> YouTube isn't, but you know? </connor>
<connor> At the end of the day,
if we bring in money </connor>
<connor> to the government and pay taxes,
it's valuable work, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically just how many
companies we've worked with, </garnt>
<garnt> what's work that's notable that- </garnt>
<connor> - And then why we need to be in Japan </connor>
<garnt> to do more work. </garnt>
<garnt> - What it felt like was
I was applying for a job. </garnt>
<connor> It was like here's all my achievements. </connor>
<garnt> Here's what I can bring for your country. </garnt>
<connor> Please, please, please- </connor>
<garnt> - Let me play on your team, coach. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<connor> And then yeah, so we get that
Certificate of Eligibility, </connor>
<connor> which is we get that. </connor>
<connor> And then you have to go to the embassy. </connor>
<garnt> - So you turn that into a visa </garnt>
<connor> and then they'll put a- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which again, there's more steps </connor>
<connor> 'cause first of all,
if you live in the UK, </connor>
<connor> the only embassy is in London. </connor>
<connor> Now I would feel bad for someone </connor>
<connor> who lives in the North of Scotland. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they have
an Embassy in Scotland. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - In Wales, I had to go all
the way from Wales that, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, luckily there's
fast train, doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> But point is one embassy, </garnt>
<garnt> so you're going to be taking
a day trip to get this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Worst part is, is that then
if you go to the embassy, </garnt>
<garnt> which you might've have to
traveled to across country for, </garnt>
<joey> you have to wait five days
to then actually get the visa </joey>
<joey> which is a little thing
they just print out </joey>
<joey> and staple in your passport. </joey>
<joey> - So you have to go back to the embassy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. You have to go back, right? </joey>
<joey> So I just went home, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I'm like not staying
in London for five days. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're poor, you haven't got much money </garnt>
<joey> and you can't, you know, </joey>
<joey> the train tickets in the
UK are expensive, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of things
where it's just like, my God, </joey>
<connor> why are we doing this? </connor>
<joey> - But then again like realistically, </joey>
<joey> how many people in the butt
fuck middle of Scotland </joey>
<connor> is going to apply for a visa- </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure, I bet there's one person from </connor>
<connor> like the North Island in like Scotland, </connor>
<connor> who's like, "Dude, I had
a fly, fuck that shit." </connor>
<joey> - If you are that one
person watching, subscribe. </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - And to make matters even more stressful, </garnt>
<connor> you lost your passport.
- I did. </connor>
<connor> - You lost your passport. </connor>
<joey> - This mother, we were
meeting up at the embassy </joey>
<joey> to collect our visas </joey>
<garnt> and this mother fucker lost his passport. </garnt>
<joey> - When I heard that story,
I couldn't fucking believe. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> That was like one of the
worst days of my life. </joey>
<joey> - Like you can't write that shit. </joey>
<connor> - I know, it was horrible. </connor>
<joey> - All because you didn't
have a fucking backpack. </joey>
<connor> - I carry my passport in my jeans pocket, </connor>
<garnt> which I'm hearing people like oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - The worst!
- Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - The worst idea. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like cringing hearing that, man. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - So okay, I've traveled
like all over the world </connor>
<connor> just having my passport in my pocket. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I have lost it before
and you guys know I have. </connor>
<garnt> I lost it in America as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I found it though luckily, but anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> so I was going to the train
station to go to the train, </garnt>
<garnt> go to London. </garnt>
<garnt> And as my train arrived, I
always tap my pockets, right, </garnt>
<garnt> just to make sure it's there. </garnt>
<garnt> I tap my pockets. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not in there, it's not I'm there. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And what's running through my head is </garnt>
<garnt> all of this months of work, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad for the company,
they paid for lawyers. </garnt>
<connor> All these people who
have banked on me coming </connor>
<garnt> and I've put so much work into this, </garnt>
<garnt> myself and other people. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like having a mental breakdown. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've ever had that much </connor>
<connor> of a quick mental breakdown in my life. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's to be expected. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like gradually getting worse </connor>
<garnt> in the hour I couldn't find it. </garnt>
<garnt> I scoured this train station,
a tiny train station in Wales. </garnt>
<connor> It's called Flint. </connor>
<connor> You can look it up. </connor>
<connor> It's literally just like a platform. </connor>
<connor> There's no where this should have gone </connor>
<connor> where I couldn't have found it, right? </connor>
<connor> Could not find it. </connor>
<connor> Check my car, quickly drove
home to find it, didn't find it. </connor>
<joey> Came back to check
again, couldn't find it. </joey>
<joey> Go in to the police station. </joey>
<joey> Literally everything. </joey>
<joey> I could not find my passport. </joey>
<joey> - So you have no idea what happened to it? </joey>
<joey> - I have no idea what
happened to my passport. </joey>
<joey> And then eventually it was
getting like three, 4:00 pm </joey>
<joey> and I was like, okay,
I'm gonna just call up </joey>
<joey> the British government and tell them, </joey>
<joey> hey, can you just cancel my passport. </joey>
<joey> I wanna apply for another one. </joey>
<joey> And that whole thing was an ordeal. </joey>
<joey> And then my main concern
was like, all right, </joey>
<joey> well, I lost my passport. </joey>
<joey> Do I have to restart the
whole visa process again? </joey>
<joey> Luckily the embassy were like, </joey>
<joey> "No, as long as you have the certificate", </joey>
<connor> which I didn't lose. </connor>
<connor> Great. I could redo it. </connor>
<connor> - You lucky fucker. </connor>
<connor> - I had to scramble to get a new passport </connor>
<connor> and that was a whole thing. </connor>
<connor> And I got one within
like five days luckily. </connor>
<connor> And luckily it all went well,
but it was just so stressful </connor>
<connor> on top of already the stress that, </connor>
<connor> I was already at my limit with stress </connor>
<connor> that whole period, because
of this whole thing </connor>
<connor> and that was just like the full, </connor>
<connor> I had a full breakdown that that day. </connor>
<connor> That was horrible. </connor>
<garnt> And I think I like joked
about it on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I was like not okay that day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the worst part is, right, </garnt>
<garnt> is when you fuck up this badly, </garnt>
<garnt> you can accept that yo fucked up </garnt>
<garnt> but it's messaging your
friends being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, I'm not gonna be
in London in two hours." </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, "Oh, why, what's up?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "I lost my passport." </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I remember reading that text, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was waiting for
you outside the embassy </connor>
<connor> when you were like, I get a
message from Connor being like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna be a bit like 30 minutes late." </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Little did I know. </connor>
<connor> - Was like oh, all
right, I'll get a coffee. </connor>
<connor> And I see the event unfold
as he's just texting me. </connor>
<garnt> So he goes, "Yeah, I
can't find my passport. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna go look for it quickly." </garnt>
<garnt> And then it was just you
like just breaking down </garnt>
<garnt> every message and it just ends with, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I don't think I can come." </garnt>
<connor> - And I'm still annoyed to this day </connor>
<garnt> because I went around, </garnt>
<connor> this is a very small town where I lost it. </connor>
<connor> I went around like
every shop in that area. </connor>
<connor> I asked literally everyone in that area. </connor>
<connor> Hey, if you find this passport,
can you call me right away? </connor>
<connor> Because if not, I'm gonna
just cancel it today. </connor>
<connor> I still never heard anything. </connor>
<connor> I was crazy and I don't
know how I lost it. </connor>
<garnt> - So from your experience
for anyone who's listening </garnt>
<garnt> if there's anything they need to know </garnt>
<garnt> to make the process easier,
what would you guys say? </garnt>
<connor> - Get a degree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a degree helps a
lot, especially if it's- </connor>
<joey> - Not an associate's,
like a bachelor's degree. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think a lot of their forms </connor>
<connor> didn't recognize associate's. </connor>
<connor> I think it actually said, it's
specified like bachelor's. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think associates
is a thing in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - It's not a thing in
the UK, I don't think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's not a thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's not a thing in Japan, right? </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it is a thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but like it's not as heavily emphasized </garnt>
<joey> on as a bachelor's degree. </joey>
<connor> - I saw a lot of people are asking like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, how do we get it, et cetera. </connor>
<connor> You need to have, especially
with a country that's strict, </connor>
<garnt> you need to have concrete proof </garnt>
<garnt> that you can do something here. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't just come here on a whim. </garnt>
<garnt> - That you're worth something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless you are like
extremely, extremely rich </garnt>
<joey> and they want your tax money
I think the only other reason, </joey>
<joey> like you need some good reason. </joey>
<joey> - Even then you need a
degree for something anyway. </joey>
<joey> - They'll find a way to- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause then they'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "Where are you getting
this money from, bro?" </joey>
<joey> - And I imagine just having
like a fair amount of experience </joey>
<garnt> in what you're doing </garnt>
<garnt> and the reason for coming
here will help a ton. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I can't talk about most, </connor>
<connor> just what we went through. </connor>
<garnt> - Or basically just come
here to teach English. </garnt>
<connor> - That is like the instant get in button. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> It's like I can speak English
and I can teach it somewhat </joey>
<joey> then they're like you're hired. </joey>
<connor> - It's probably not a bad way to, </connor>
<connor> if your goal ultimately is
living in Japan forever, </connor>
<connor> it's probably not a bad way to
transition into living here. </connor>
<joey> - No, because I know a
lot of friends personally </joey>
<garnt> who did start off with teaching English </garnt>
<joey> and then gradually moved
on to something else. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause by teaching English, </garnt>
<garnt> you can gain connections in the country </garnt>
<joey> and then maybe that transitions </joey>
<joey> to an like a normal office
job or something like that </joey>
<joey> or working with a company. </joey>
<connor> But if you just want to get
your foot through the door, </connor>
<connor> I think teaching English
would be the easiest way </connor>
<garnt> for anyone to be able to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> But you still need a degree. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I agree, you need a degree. </garnt>
<connor> - But they pretty much
accept everyone on that, </connor>
<connor> as far as I'm aware as long as,
again, if you have a degree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, It doesn't matter how good </connor>
<connor> your high school essays were. </connor>
<joey> If you don't have a degree in that, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which is why I'm so glad
to drop out of university. </connor>
<garnt> - Listen to your Asian parents, go to uni </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to go to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys have all got degrees, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Engineering baby, let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really?
- Yeah. Engineering. </connor>
<connor> - I never actually have known what degree, </connor>
<joey> you have an engineering degree, right? </joey>
<connor> - I have. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he has an electrical engineering </joey>
<joey> and I have mechanical engineering. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, wow.
- But he has a master's, </connor>
<garnt> I have a bachelor's. </garnt>
<joey> - I got a fucking master's mother fucker. </joey>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Look at this boy spending
more than four years at uni. </joey>
<connor> - I got to the third year, </connor>
<joey> I was like, I can't do it anymore. </joey>
<joey> I can't do this. </joey>
<joey> I gotta get out, I gotta get out. </joey>
<connor> - Connor's like have I
got the required minimum? </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. Get me out of here. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> I don't want to be here
for another year, dude. </joey>
<joey> - So now that you guys moved to Japan, </joey>
<garnt> what would you say are the pros and cons </garnt>
<garnt> of actually living here? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I want to know
from you guys, right? </joey>
<connor> Because I mean, I've experienced Japan </connor>
<connor> pretty much for half my life so I know, </connor>
<joey> to me the pros and cons are
just very natural to me. </joey>
<connor> - And I feel like you,
the most of the cons </connor>
<connor> that we might, me and Garnt might have, </connor>
<garnt> you won't ever experience because one, </garnt>
<garnt> you can speak the language
and read it fluently. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man, I have
the face of a foreigner. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I'm just gonna say it. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of discrimination here. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - But I mean, what country doesn't? </joey>
<garnt> - I would say, I like understand it more </garnt>
<garnt> because growing up in an Asian country, </garnt>
<garnt> there's definitely discrimination in Asia. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just very different from
what you see in the West. </garnt>
<joey> I think.
- That's the thing, </joey>
<joey> it's not racism. </joey>
<garnt> It's more xenophobia.
- Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, and if you guys
don't know the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between that, racism is where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, you're a different race to me </garnt>
<garnt> so therefore you are worse than me. </garnt>
<garnt> And xenophobia is like,
oh, you're not from here </garnt>
<garnt> therefore you're, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it comes more
from a place of ignorance. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just ignorance I think. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's just, you know, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause you guys didn't
open the country for ages. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, Japan has been a closed island </garnt>
<garnt> for like the past 2000 years, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- So it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> what do you expect?
- Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So it makes sense to me. </garnt>
<garnt> But like for example,
finding an apartment, </garnt>
<garnt> that was my first experience with that </garnt>
<garnt> where if you didn't,
if you're not Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and if you didn't speak Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> then they were very scared
to even touch you, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Or even consider you in that case. </garnt>
<connor> - Especially when you have
a company backing you. </connor>
<garnt> In my mind, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't see what the problem is here. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like the model tenant here. </connor>
<joey> I'm single. </joey>
<joey> - The problem is we can't
write your name in Kanji. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
- That's the problem. </joey>
<connor> - Kata Connor name? Ew, gross. </connor>
<joey> - But I mean, I have a problem too, </joey>
<garnt> because even though I am Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and I have a Japanese name, </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that I don't look it, </garnt>
<garnt> is already a huge wall </garnt>
<garnt> that regular Japanese
people find a difficulty </garnt>
<garnt> in getting over because,
it's really funny as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because during my intern days as well, </garnt>
<garnt> I had to be the guy to like </garnt>
<garnt> if there was like a business
partner coming to the office, </garnt>
<garnt> I had to be the one to
get on the phone with them </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, "Okay, you
guys are coming at this time </garnt>
<garnt> and this day, okay, I'll
come down to meet you guys </garnt>
<garnt> and greet you up to the office." </garnt>
<garnt> But when I speak Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have an accent
and my name is Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> So there were so many
times where I would go down </garnt>
<garnt> to greet them and they'd
be like who the fuck- </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<connor> She's like, "You're not the
person on the phone, right?" </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Yeah, I am." </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh, Oh, we
thought you were Japanese." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "I am Japanese." </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like. </garnt>
<garnt> To so many of like the older
generation, especially, </garnt>
<garnt> they just can't fathom that there are </garnt>
<joey> these things called hafus. </joey>
<joey> It's just not a thing. </joey>
<joey> It's like you're either
Japanese or you're not Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the way I it is that, </garnt>
<garnt> I treat it like exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> how I would treat my
grandmother or my granddad </garnt>
<garnt> who lived in Thailand
in this small village </garnt>
<garnt> their entire fucking life, </garnt>
<garnt> knew nothing about the outside world. </garnt>
<garnt> So they just didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same way with
a lot of Japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> where some of them,
especially like older people </garnt>
<garnt> who've never interacted with a foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> or even like got to
know them or even knows </garnt>
<garnt> what the outside world is like </garnt>
<garnt> beyond what they see on the
news and what they see on TV. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - And you don't want
to like input anything </joey>
<garnt> from Japanese TV. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, you don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - My god. </garnt>
<connor> Some of the stuff they air is like- </connor>
<connor> - We're called Trash Taste Podcast. </connor>
<connor> If there's anything trashier
than Trash Taste Podcast </connor>
<connor> it is fucking Japanese TV. </connor>
<connor> It is full of absolute garbage. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's something I wish that </connor>
<garnt> like a lot of YouTubers whose channel </garnt>
<garnt> is focused all about Japan </garnt>
<garnt> would speak about it a little more. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's not something you can ignore. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're foreign or even
look foreign and live here, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna experience it like totally. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't know anything about this </garnt>
<joey> because no YouTubers talk
about it or anything. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like it's
such an important topic </joey>
<joey> especially when you talk
about living in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be a factor,
you're gonna be stared at. </joey>
<connor> And it's not like you've said, </connor>
<connor> it's not a place of
like hatred or anything. </connor>
<connor> It's just like they don't
see kind of people a lot. </connor>
<joey> - I think the problem
was a lot of J-Vloggers </joey>
<connor> that do cover the topics like that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause when you live here, </connor>
<garnt> you pretty much get to
know every J-Vlogger. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just natural, it's
such a small community. </garnt>
<garnt> So I know pretty much every
like notable J-Vlogger here. </garnt>
<connor> And there's been a number
of them that I know </connor>
<connor> that have made topics on
the blatant xenophobia </connor>
<garnt> here in Japan.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the problem is I
think a lot of those videos </garnt>
<garnt> aren't taken seriously by the internet </garnt>
<garnt> because it's seen as like
a privileged problem. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like you get to
live in Japan, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> So therefore you should just be able </garnt>
<garnt> to put up with this shit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you get to experience
all this other cool stuff. </garnt>
<connor> When that's not the point
of the video, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's still a problem
regardless of how privileged </connor>
<joey> you may seem living here. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the worst
thing that happened to me </garnt>
<connor> was the time, one time we
got the police called on us. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do you wanna explain why
we got the police called? </connor>
<connor> We didn't do anything illegal. </connor>
<connor> We just played Mario Party really loud. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah at like two in the morning. </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> Very drunk. </joey>
<connor> - That was our bad. </connor>
<connor> We can't really complain about that. </connor>
<connor> Okay, so basically we've
got a noise complaint. </connor>
<garnt> So the policeman came and
he basically asked Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> who is he with?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember you saying like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, there's one American,
one British person." </garnt>
<garnt> And then there was me, who I'm Thai. </garnt>
<joey> So he mentioned that
I'm with a Thai friend. </joey>
<joey> And as soon as he mentioned
that he was with a Thai friend, </joey>
<joey> the policeman was like, "Oh." </joey>
<joey> - "Can we see your Thai friend?" </joey>
<joey> - "Can we see your Thai friend?" </joey>
<joey> And I go up there and I
started getting grilled </joey>
<joey> about why I'm here. </joey>
<joey> They want to see my
passport and everything. </joey>
<joey> And they asked me for my visa. </joey>
<joey> - But you showed them your
British passport, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, as soon I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I have a British passport though." </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Okay, you're free to go." </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It was so messed up. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, "Oh, what
the fuck just happened? </garnt>
<garnt> What was that?" </garnt>
<joey> - It was so messed up. </joey>
<joey> And the fact that they
only called you up there, </joey>
<joey> even though there was like, </joey>
<joey> it was like the most multicultural room </joey>
<joey> in probably the entire apartment building. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna say it now. </garnt>
<garnt> I wasn't making the noise. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You were like the
quietest there, if anything. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was the first time
I ever experienced that too. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, Jesus Christ, </garnt>
<garnt> like they couldn't even
be subtle about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And I'm like you do know like </joey>
<joey> this is like not cool, right? </joey>
<joey> But to them it's just, you know? </joey>
<connor> - I think you just, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I know I get starred at a
lot which is weird for me </connor>
<connor> because obviously coming </connor>
<garnt> from like the whitest place on earth, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like another person. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've never experienced
this in my life, </garnt>
<garnt> which I guess is also strange. </garnt>
<garnt> And also, </garnt>
<garnt> this is gonna sound so
odd, but okay, in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> not exactly known for the best
legal system, if you will. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Normally if you're arrested
or whatever or convicted, </connor>
<connor> charged with a crime,
you normally get like, </connor>
<connor> it's like a 98, 99% conviction rate. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know where this is going but- </joey>
<connor> - Right, but also this is
the first time I've ever been </connor>
<connor> around police where I'm like, shit, </connor>
<connor> please don't stop me,
Please don't stop me. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> I guess this is like Connor
checking his white privilege </connor>
<connor> for the first time ever. </connor>
<connor> But like, because if the
police stop me, right? </connor>
<connor> I can't explain to them why I might, </connor>
<connor> like I don't know what
I might do that's wrong. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna get fucking arrested </connor>
<connor> 'cause like how do I get
myself out of that hole? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then, yeah, it's just
a weird experience for me </connor>
<connor> that I've never felt before. </connor>
<connor> And I'm sure people are like, wow, Connor, </connor>
<connor> really seeing his white
privilege for the first time ever </connor>
<connor> in his life. </connor>
<connor> But it's weird though, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that's like stuff
that I never considered </connor>
<connor> I'd have after like worry about ever. </connor>
<joey> - Right, you have to like
kind of experience it </joey>
<garnt> unfortunately firsthand to
fully understand it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And that's the problem is
that there are so many, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I guess, controversial
topics like that </garnt>
<garnt> concerning being a
foreigner, living in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm sure a lot of
J-Vloggers want to talk about, </garnt>
<garnt> but because from the
position that they're talking </garnt>
<joey> about it for them, it's
very difficult to make- </joey>
<connor> - Hard to bring it up like,
oh, they hate Chinese people. </connor>
<joey> - Right, because it's
also like for someone, </joey>
<garnt> for a foreigner who's never lived in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> it's very hard to like swallow
and understand being like, </garnt>
<garnt> no, that doesn't happen, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That must be just you. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas it's very much a common occurrence </garnt>
<joey> for any like foreigner who
lives here unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> - It's unfortunate, but it's just a thing </garnt>
<connor> where you move here and
you realize there's- </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty quickly.
- Yeah, pretty quickly </garnt>
<garnt> that it works differently </garnt>
<garnt> and people view you differently as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think to me, that is
the worst experience I've had </garnt>
<garnt> about moving to Japan apart from, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Can we talk about how slow
Japanese businesses work? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - My fucking god. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone has this image that
Japan this like super tech- </garnt>
<connor> - Optimized place, the most
optimized system on earth. </connor>
<connor> They figured it out. </connor>
<joey> - Speed running business. </joey>
<joey> - Things just work. </joey>
<joey> You go to a restaurant, you
press a button on a tablet </joey>
<joey> and the food just appears in front of you. </joey>
<joey> You're like this is the future. </joey>
<joey> And then you go to a Japanese business </joey>
<garnt> and you're like, "Oh,
is that a fax machine? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you using a fax machine right now?" </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Or just like stuff you
never even considered </connor>
<connor> a problem or asking for permission </connor>
<connor> for the slightest thing on earth. </connor>
<connor> It's just like you show a
logo or something in a video, </connor>
<connor> we got to find permission to do that. </connor>
<connor> It's like just fucking upload it. </connor>
<connor> If it's a problem,
they'll tell us, you know? </connor>
<joey> - See, but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<connor> Is that Japan doesn't understand- </connor>
<connor> - No risk.
- Well, no risk as well </connor>
<connor> but at least with like
what we do business wise, </connor>
<connor> Japan doesn't have fair use. </connor>
<connor> - No, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's so difficult to
get permission for any, </connor>
<connor> like if you ask like as you said, </connor>
<connor> it's like can I just show
this logo of your company </connor>
<garnt> that is like publicly
available to anybody? </garnt>
<garnt> Just like slap it on for like two seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not even gonna mention
your name, just slap it on. </garnt>
<garnt> It has to go through like 100 layers </garnt>
<garnt> of the company just to get a simple yes. </garnt>
<garnt> And that could take like a
couple of days if you're lucky, </garnt>
<joey> usually a week to maybe a month. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like ugh. </joey>
<connor> - It's a business model
where there's like, </connor>
<joey> imagine if every employee was a boss </joey>
<joey> and everyone had to ask
for permission constantly. </joey>
<joey> It's like employees can't
make their own decisions. </joey>
<joey> They have to ask their boss
who then asks their boss </joey>
<connor> and their boss and that takes a week. </connor>
<connor> And that's just to see </connor>
<connor> if you can sharpen your pencil, right? </connor>
<connor> We haven't got to business yet. </connor>
<connor> Like we're just trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> what the fuck's happening. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not even just business. </garnt>
<connor> It's just signing up for- </connor>
<connor> - Everything.
- It's everything. </connor>
<connor> Everything moves so slowly. </connor>
<connor> I remember when we signed
up for our gym membership. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - It took us an hour- </connor>
<connor> - An hour and a half I think. </connor>
<joey> - An hour and a half to
sign up for a fucking, </joey>
<joey> to get a gym card, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know in America
or like basically everywhere </joey>
<joey> where you get the terms
and conditions, right? </joey>
<joey> You fucking scroll
through, you click accept. </joey>
<garnt> No, in Japan, you're gonna sit there </garnt>
<garnt> and you're gonna read every term </garnt>
<garnt> and you're gonna agree to every
fucking term individually. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're gonna sit there with you </garnt>
<garnt> to make sure you read it all. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you're not only
subject to going through </joey>
<joey> the fine print, which is no longer fine, </joey>
<joey> it's just print. </joey>
<garnt> But they're like, "Let
me read it out for you </garnt>
<garnt> in case you're a fucking
illiterate piece of shit." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like no, see that's
why like when I signed up </garnt>
<garnt> for the gym membership </garnt>
<garnt> because it's all written
in Japanese, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I straight up just said
like, "I can read it." </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I saved myself like an hour
of pain of just like listening </connor>
<joey> to this fucking hour long
monologue from this like- </joey>
<joey> - I think that's 'cause we are foreign, </joey>
<connor> he was like, he really,
really wanted to make sure </connor>
<connor> we understood and bear in mind </connor>
<joey> these weren't terms and conditions </joey>
<garnt> of any like social things. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like literally the
bare bones of what a gym </garnt>
<garnt> needs to make sure you know. </garnt>
<garnt> like don't run on the treadmill </garnt>
<garnt> if your legs don't work, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Just stuff like, basically
don't sue us stuff, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Stuff you wouldn't take for granted. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember he was like asking us, </garnt>
<garnt> our translator, if we
understood every single point, </garnt>
<connor> and every one of them was like, </connor>
<connor> "Do you understand that on the treadmill </connor>
<connor> you have to have your hands on
the treadmill at all times?" </connor>
<connor> And I looked at like our friend Nabby, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Is he serious?" </connor>
<connor> It's not a joke, right? </connor>
<connor> He wants me to like agree-
- He legally has to say that. </connor>
<connor> - I have to agree that
I'm gonna put my hands on, </connor>
<connor> have you ever seen like anyone, </connor>
<connor> like a crippled old man
run on the treadmill? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yes, because that's how I run, </joey>
<joey> just like free hands. </joey>
<connor> - No one does that and
you're literally like, </connor>
<connor> you're signing this agreement </connor>
<connor> and you turn your head to see
10 people on the treadmill, </connor>
<connor> none of them holding their hands. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Yes, I agree." </connor>
<connor> It's just, it's all bullshit. </connor>
<connor> That's all you do. </connor>
<connor> And this is the stuff
that you never experience </connor>
<garnt> as a tourist, because it's
like perfectly separate </garnt>
<garnt> the stuff that you
experienced as a tourist </garnt>
<garnt> to the stuff you experienced living here. </garnt>
<garnt> And the moment you do something
that is remotely permanent </garnt>
<garnt> or reoccurring in a contract, </garnt>
<connor> you better be ready to
bring every document </connor>
<connor> that you've ever had in your life </connor>
<connor> and the hanko which you'll lose a lot. </connor>
<joey> - I'm surprised they didn't ask </joey>
<joey> for our fucking birth certificate </joey>
<joey> when signing up for the gym, </joey>
<garnt> because it's so formal with everything. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, you don't need
to know my life story. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the perfect word. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything in Japan is so formal </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't see it as a tourist, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause when you're here
in Japan on tourism </garnt>
<connor> and you're just sight seeing,
everything just works, right? </connor>
<connor> You go to a restaurant, it just works. </connor>
<connor> Living here, all the little intricacies </connor>
<connor> and all the little things
you take for granted </connor>
<connor> that should be quick, </connor>
<connor> just takes a million processes </connor>
<joey> when it's just the most
un-optimized thing in the world. </joey>
<joey> And there's just a lot of
things that don't make sense </joey>
<connor> in contracts, like going
back to paying rent. </connor>
<connor> There's this thing called a key fee. </connor>
<connor> What was it like? </connor>
<garnt> - The fucking, this is the most obnoxious, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like key money, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Key money.
- Key money. </garnt>
<joey> - And I mean, you can
explain it if you want. </joey>
<garnt> Go ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's the most
obnoxious thing on earth. </garnt>
<garnt> - What can I explain? </garnt>
<connor> - It's two months of rent, sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - So the amount is
about two months of rent </garnt>
<garnt> that you pay to the rent
owner to say thank you </garnt>
<garnt> for renting me your place. </garnt>
<connor> - For free, you don't get it back. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not a deposit, you
just pay two months of rent. </garnt>
<connor> - Which you also have to
pay a deposit and then. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, on top of the
deposit that you have to pay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically a dick suck fee. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, thank you so much </garnt>
<joey> for letting me stay in your apartment. </joey>
<joey> That's what it is. </joey>
<connor> - And then it doesn't end there </connor>
<connor> because you then have to pay the rental, </connor>
<connor> the agency that got you the house, </connor>
<connor> you have to pay a month's
rent to them as a fee, </connor>
<connor> which is just stupid because I
think in every other country, </connor>
<connor> they take that split from
the person renting the house. </connor>
<joey> Not from you because renting
a house shouldn't be, </joey>
<joey> you shouldn't have to pay like
six to eight months upfront. </joey>
<joey> That's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> And I think it's the reason
why a lot of homeless people </joey>
<joey> here also struggle to get housing </joey>
<joey> because how the fuck are
you gonna get six months </joey>
<joey> worth of rent and money? </joey>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> Like that's insane. </joey>
<joey> - When you look at the
rent you expect like, okay, </joey>
<connor> this is how much I'm gonna
pay for the first month. </connor>
<connor> - I pay a deposit, maybe two months. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like maybe like
a month or two deposit, </garnt>
<garnt> but like no, it's like
double or triple that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - It's ridiculous.
- Yeah, stupid. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, yeah, six months
worth of rent in one sitting. </garnt>
<connor> And you're not gonna get two
months of that back at all. </connor>
<connor> - Because they want you
to stay in that apartment. </connor>
<garnt> They don't want you to leave. </garnt>
<garnt> And I like going around. </garnt>
<garnt> I like moving, getting a new place, </garnt>
<garnt> seeing how things are, knowing
what I like and don't like, </garnt>
<garnt> but now it's pretty much just solidified </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm not leaving this </garnt>
<connor> because I'm gonna charge
out the ass if I wanna move. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's like a minimum of two years </joey>
<connor> to stay in one place.
- Two years, yeah. </connor>
<joey> And even then if you're moving, </joey>
<connor> like the amount that you
paid in that first month, </connor>
<joey> that if you split that
across two years of rent, </joey>
<joey> it'd be way over paying for what you got. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> I think that's why,
that's one thing, right? </joey>
<joey> About like living in
Japan that I've personally </joey>
<connor> never understood for the longest time. </connor>
<connor> But I think finally now I do understand </connor>
<connor> is when people say like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, Japan is such an expensive place." </connor>
<garnt> But when you think about it, it's like no, </garnt>
<connor> cause when I think, "Oh, Japan
is such an expensive place", </connor>
<connor> I think like- </connor>
<garnt> - Eating out, drinking.
- Eating out or drinking. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, no, it's relatively cheap. </connor>
<garnt> But then you think about- </garnt>
<garnt> - All the bills.
- Six months worth of rent </garnt>
<connor> in the first month kind of bullshit. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, okay, maybe, yeah, </connor>
<joey> it is a little bit
ridiculous and expensive. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, you
can live frugally here. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not too hard to live frugally. </garnt>
<connor> - No, you can live cheap. </connor>
<garnt> It's like not a problem. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, konbinis you can live off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can do a whole episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's basically the
best thing about Japan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like no matter where you are, </garnt>
<garnt> you are in with like 100 meter radius </garnt>
<connor> of everything you need
like no questions asked. </connor>
<joey> - Japan is the only country
where the word convenience store </joey>
<garnt> actually lives up to its name </garnt>
<garnt> because it is actually one
of the most convenient places </garnt>
<joey> that you could go. </joey>
<garnt> - God, I love konbini
so fucking much, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Like not even the
food, the food's amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like you expect this, like
if you go to a gas station </connor>
<connor> in any country in the world </connor>
<joey> and you try and convince
me to buy something </joey>
<joey> that's been cooked in that building, </joey>
<joey> I would rather like just get salmonella. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna risk
seeing what they give me. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Those nasty hot dogs that
have been in rotation </connor>
<connor> for like 20 hours at least. </connor>
<connor> But the one thing that I thought was just </connor>
<garnt> the most genius thing that Japan does, </garnt>
<garnt> which I do not understand
why every other country </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't do this, is the
fact that they just have </garnt>
<joey> a printing machine in there. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, a printer, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So no one needs to
buy a printer or buy it, </joey>
<joey> you can just go to this place </joey>
<connor> that's probably within 100 meters of you, </connor>
<connor> 200 meters at most. </connor>
<connor> - Max.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You pay like 10 cents or whatever </connor>
<garnt> and you can get a printed
A4 copy of whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> because no one needs to
print that much shit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never needed to print
more than like one document. </garnt>
<garnt> - And ink's fucking expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? And it dries as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So you might print one
thing, it's gone dry. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel so bad for
admitting that I've done this </garnt>
<garnt> but in the UK, in university,
when we had to have a printer </garnt>
<garnt> and I was printing a of documents, </garnt>
<garnt> I used to like, the ink
was more expensive to buy </garnt>
<garnt> on its own than just buying a new printer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So every time I ran out of ink, </garnt>
<garnt> I bought a new printer. </garnt>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Are you serious?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like 200 IQ move though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Bear in mind, right, </connor>
<connor> this is the time when
you're in university, right? </connor>
<connor> Where losing 20 pounds, </connor>
<connor> which is like like 30 bucks at the time, </connor>
<connor> was like a big deal, right? </connor>
<connor> You don't get any money. </connor>
<connor> I can't afford to lose 30 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - That's like 10 instant ramens, dude. </joey>
<connor> - Right, that's like two
nights out if I'm good. </connor>
<connor> So I would go to like the charity shop </connor>
<connor> and just give it to them. </connor>
<connor> And every single month on cue,
I'd come in with a printer </connor>
<connor> and just the exact same Amazon
basics printer and give it. </connor>
<connor> And I just thought like I can
appreciate this so much now </connor>
<connor> that in Japan if you
want to print anything, </connor>
<connor> you don't have to buy a printer, </connor>
<connor> you don't have to fuck
around worrying about </connor>
<connor> which ink cartridge
matched with your printer. </connor>
<connor> You just go to the convenience
store and you print it off. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, it makes sense. </connor>
<joey> - And the best thing is if
you do need to print out </joey>
<garnt> a document or anything,
you can just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, I can do that, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, I can also buy a drink. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, at the same time, right? </connor>
<joey> - Or I can stock up my
fridge. It's all there. </joey>
<connor> - I can pay my bills. </connor>
<joey> You can pay your bills. </joey>
<joey> - That's the best thing, </joey>
<garnt> you can pay your bills at-
- The convenience store, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's wild to me.
- It's insane. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't anymore because
that just takes time </connor>
<garnt> but I did at first. </garnt>
<connor> It was a novelty at first. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think the best
and worst part of Japan to me </garnt>
<connor> is that it's like a dichotomy, </connor>
<connor> it either works exceedingly well, </connor>
<garnt> it's well exceedingly optimized, </garnt>
<garnt> or it's just 100 processes
to do the simplest shit. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no middle ground. </garnt>
<garnt> Nothing here works okay. </garnt>
<garnt> It either works exceedingly well </garnt>
<garnt> or it just doesn't work at all. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's normally
like a public demand, right? </connor>
<connor> Convenience stores, trains. </connor>
<connor> Everyone is using them 24/7. </connor>
<connor> We want this easy as
possible, (indistinct), </connor>
<connor> all that, it all works flawlessly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I think where it comes </connor>
<connor> into play mostly is with
government agencies, </connor>
<connor> big companies that have higher ups </connor>
<connor> that don't want to change
things very fastly. </connor>
<connor> And if you thought like
companies in the West </connor>
<connor> don't want to change things, my God, </connor>
<connor> you are in for like a surprise. </connor>
<joey> - Most Japanese companies haven't changed </joey>
<joey> since like the 70s. </joey>
<connor> - Because not only do they
not want to change things, </connor>
<connor> even if the person before them dies, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Well, they
didn't want to change it </connor>
<connor> and I really don't want
to step on their toes, </connor>
<garnt> even though they don't exist anymore." </garnt>
<connor> It's like, we've got to keep
everything the same way it was </connor>
<joey> that's been working. </joey>
<connor> - That's the problem though </connor>
<joey> is Japan has such a double edged sword </joey>
<connor> in terms of like maintaining culture. </connor>
<connor> - It does. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it works in great ways. </garnt>
<garnt> - And maintaining tradition </garnt>
<joey> is the word I was looking for, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's very traditional in
a lot of ways like, man, </joey>
<garnt> I'm looking at Japanese web design. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I take it for granted
how good we had it. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't realize that I
cared about user interface. </connor>
<joey> - I was interning, I was in
the web division department </joey>
<connor> because that's what I
majored in at uni, right? </connor>
<garnt> So I had to like go around fixing </garnt>
<garnt> basically clients old websites </garnt>
<garnt> and anybody who ever did
anything like HTML or CSS related </garnt>
<joey> can relate to this. </joey>
<joey> But I almost had a stroke when
I looked at the source code </joey>
<joey> and I saw a table
(guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, that's
something we haven't used </joey>
<joey> since like the early 90s. </joey>
<garnt> This is like early 90s type of web design </garnt>
<garnt> and they're still using it to this day. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I've
seen a single animation </connor>
<garnt> on a webpage in Japan.
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's no graphics at all. </garnt>
<joey> It literally looks like the
first windows iteration. </joey>
<joey> - It just looks so fucking cluttered. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Weirdly enough, </garnt>
<joey> the best web design I have seen </joey>
<garnt> is landing pages for new anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the only good
websites that I've seen. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like damn. </garnt>
<joey> They used JavaScript for the shit, Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Before we move on to the logistics, </garnt>
<connor> I want to talk about staying to the pros, </connor>
<connor> how good the fucking food is here, man. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- Moving here from England. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Where good food is you either, </connor>
<connor> it's you either have to pay a lot </connor>
<connor> or you have to cook it yourself. </connor>
<garnt> Everything here tastes good. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just true, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You never have a bad
experience in Japan with food. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like the difference </connor>
<connor> that I tell my parents the most, </connor>
<connor> I'm like in the UK, I
don't know about Australia, </connor>
<connor> but when you go to the
restaurant, it's not a gamble, </connor>
<garnt> but it kind of is. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't know if it's
gonna be okay or amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's always a coin flip. </garnt>
<garnt> You just don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> And you have to go to find out- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no, that's 100% how
it works in Australia. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it might just
be a restaurant owned </joey>
<joey> by a guy who has no idea what he's doing. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't give a shit about the food. </joey>
<connor> But in Japan it is like guaranteed </connor>
<connor> no matter where you go,
you will get good food. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You are never overcharged either. </connor>
<connor> You always pay a fair amount. </connor>
<garnt> - And when you are overcharged, </garnt>
<garnt> it is like the taste and
experience is worth it. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I remember saying very
harsh words to my mom </connor>
<joey> when she used to just, you know, </joey>
<connor> I'm like how dare you give me
this bland food all my life </connor>
<garnt> when this stuff existed. </garnt>
<garnt> How many times must I have
beans and toast, mother? </garnt>
<garnt> How many times can a
man eat beans and toast? </garnt>
<garnt> I actually still like beans and toast. </garnt>
<garnt> - When the konbini food here is better </garnt>
<garnt> than a lot of the restaurant food </garnt>
<garnt> you can find in British
restaurants I go to, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, man, there's
something wrong from here. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something wrong here, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the insane thing is that </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if Japan is the
only country that's like this </joey>
<garnt> but it's cheaper to eat out </garnt>
<garnt> than it is to cook your own food. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same thing in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think a lot of the Asian
countries are like that, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, because at least in
Australia, like Jesus Christ, </garnt>
<garnt> no one goes to restaurants
because it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to gamble if this $25 pasta </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna be good or not like I'm sorry. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like I'm not that rich. </connor>
<garnt> I'd rather just go to a supermarket </garnt>
<garnt> and just cook a $5 pasta myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here in Japan and to
get like a single lime, </garnt>
<garnt> a single lime, </garnt>
<garnt> I pay $2. </garnt>
<garnt> $2 for a single fucking lime. </garnt>
<connor> What the fuck! </connor>
<connor> - I don't think anyone's
mentioned that on YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> People don't tell you how
expensive it is to cook here. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know if this is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe in America it's different. </garnt>
<connor> We're not from America </connor>
<connor> and I know the prices
for fresh food in America </connor>
<garnt> is like ridiculous.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in the UK, I don't
know about Australia, </garnt>
<joey> in the UK buying ingredients
is so incredibly cheap. </joey>
<joey> - Same in Australia, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is why nobody, </joey>
<garnt> eating out is not so much
you do it for the food. </garnt>
<garnt> It's more of like an
experience with your friends. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not for an event, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's a luxury.
- Yeah, it's a luxury. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't do it because
like you have the money. </garnt>
<connor> It's like you do it for a reason. </connor>
<connor> If you speak to someone in the UK </connor>
<connor> and I know that if you say
like you eat out every day </connor>
<connor> in the UK, everyone's like
what's the fuck wrong with you? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because it in the UK, </garnt>
<connor> you don't eat out alone, right? </connor>
<connor> It's very rare to do something </connor>
<connor> like eating out alone. </connor>
<connor> And here, more people eat out
alone then cook, you know? </connor>
<connor> Because it's just more convenient
and it's cheaper as well. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause my God, vegetables
here, meats are okay, </garnt>
<garnt> but vegetables are so expensive. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> And the biggest offender in
my mind, limes, terrible, </connor>
<garnt> peppers, you know like
normal bell peppers? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the UK, I distinctly
remember in like Aldi </garnt>
<garnt> or even Tesco, it's like
one pound 29, right, </garnt>
<garnt> for a pack of three bell peppers, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's like what, $1.60. </garnt>
<garnt> In Japan for like a single bell pepper, </garnt>
<joey> which comes with its own packaging, </joey>
<joey> it's like 180 yen. </joey>
<connor> So if you want to have three peppers. </connor>
<connor> - It's like two bucks.
- So that's two bucks. </connor>
<connor> - It's like $6 for three bell peppers. </connor>
<connor> Are you fucking kidding me? </connor>
<joey> - Can we talk about the
biggest offender though, </joey>
<garnt> which is fruit? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Fruits- </joey>
<connor> - Okay, they're good, they're good, </connor>
<garnt> first of all, they're good. </garnt>
<connor> - They're amazing.
- They're good. </connor>
<connor> - But Jesus, talk about overpriced. </connor>
<garnt> Like I know like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan has this like weird obsession </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to fruits where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, it's from this- </garnt>
<garnt> - You gotta massage it.
- No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, oh, it's from
the specific prefecture </garnt>
<garnt> that specializes in that, therefore, </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to buy an apple
from like Aomori prefecture, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like known for their apples, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a regular Apple,
like I don't know about the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> but at least in Australia it's like </garnt>
<connor> if you want like a freshly grown- </connor>
<connor> - We don't fucking know
where it's come from. </connor>
<connor> - Good quality, like a home grown apple, </connor>
<joey> the most you'd pay is maybe like a buck. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I've never paid more
than 50 cents for an apple. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> - I think I'd be shocked if I
paid more than like 30 pence. </connor>
<joey> - Where as here, if you want
a specialized branded apple </joey>
<joey> which is like the only kind of apples </joey>
<joey> they have here for some reason, </joey>
<joey> it's like, oh yeah, 600 yen, please. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's no cheap brand here. </joey>
<joey> Every brand has a certain story. </joey>
<connor> And it's like that, it's like, you know, </connor>
<joey> when you have Asian
grandparents or something, </joey>
<joey> everything they feed you has
health benefits or something. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They feed you like this
vegetable or this fruit. </joey>
<connor> And then you're like, oh,
this is really good for X. </connor>
<garnt> It says, it's not proven,
but it's like a wives tale. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - The amount of like fat
products they sell here </connor>
<connor> is like incredible. </connor>
<garnt> You think that we're in
the age of science, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that people like
knew that half the shit </garnt>
<garnt> they see on packaging is bullshit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The amount of just weight loss things </garnt>
<garnt> that I've seen here is incredible. </garnt>
<connor> Like put this pad on your belly </connor>
<connor> and it will just magically
go because of the gels. </connor>
<connor> And it's like that's just
not how the body works. </connor>
<joey> - You know what's kind
of incredible as well </joey>
<garnt> when it comes to weight
loss culture here in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> apparently I saw somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know, don't quote me on this, </garnt>
<garnt> but I saw it a while ago that
Japan is really interesting </garnt>
<connor> when it comes to weight loss </connor>
<connor> because we're one of the most- </connor>
<connor> - Healthiest country. </connor>
<connor> - Healthiest countries in the world </connor>
<connor> and yet I think it's something ridiculous, </connor>
<joey> like one in three people diet. </joey>
<connor> - It's crazy, I don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm like you don't need to diet </joey>
<connor> and that whole thing comes from the whole </connor>
<connor> ridiculous standard of
beauty here in Japan </connor>
<garnt> where everybody needs to be bulimic </garnt>
<garnt> otherwise you're not considered beautiful. </garnt>
<garnt> But going back to the fruit thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember me and Arki went
to this new supermarket </garnt>
<garnt> that opened up near our place. </garnt>
<garnt> And I wanted to check
out the fruit section </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm always curious. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like how can we
get ripped off anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> And there were like these packet of, </garnt>
<garnt> there were these cherries, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I love eating cherries.
- Oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> - There were these packet of
like cherries from America. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which are like, there
was 30 of them in there </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like 400 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, okay, a tad
expensive, but not too bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Right next to there, </garnt>
<garnt> there was a pack of another 30 cherries, </garnt>
<connor> but they were from like
Ibaraki or somewhere local. </connor>
<connor> And it was obviously some
kind of brand, right? </connor>
<joey> Guess how much these cherries were? </joey>
<connor> - Just going off Japan
experience, like 30 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. So like 3000 yen. </joey>
<garnt> How much do you think it was? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like 2,500 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - 2,500 yen, right?
- 25 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, think of 6,500 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, Jesus.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - For 30 cherries home grown. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like what? </garnt>
<garnt> I was really tempted to
buy it just being like </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God if one cherry
doesn't give me an orgasm, </garnt>
<garnt> like it's not worth it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I know right?
- It's just not worth it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's good fruit, don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> But is it worth the fucking
premium that I'm paying? </garnt>
<joey> - Right.
- I don't think so. </joey>
<garnt> I don't think so.
- It's so stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> It's already a luxury just
to buy regular fruit here, </garnt>
<garnt> regular non-branded fruit.
- Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like who is buying this? </garnt>
<garnt> That's my biggest concern is like </garnt>
<joey> what kind of fruit elitist is
buying these like $60 cherries </joey>
<joey> from like down the road? </joey>
<garnt> - Five star Michelin fucking cherries. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like who is buying these? </garnt>
<garnt> And being like mm, yes, </garnt>
<joey> I can definitely taste the
homegrown quality in this. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the fucking elderly. </garnt>
<joey> It's the grandma that's like, </joey>
<joey> "This is hidden health benefits." </joey>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - This is low GMO. </garnt>
<connor> - This cherry will fix
your erectile dysfunction. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<joey> - This isn't from America. </joey>
<garnt> It's home grown. </garnt>
<connor> - Going back to people
who stay thin in Japan. </connor>
<connor> I think one preconception I had is that </connor>
<connor> I would just move to Japan </connor>
<connor> because Japanese food is so healthy, </connor>
<garnt> you just like lose weight automatically. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd like zero effort,
lose weight automatically. </garnt>
<connor> - Most restaurants have a menu. </connor>
<garnt> Surprise. Surprise. </garnt>
<garnt> And i you just pick the unhealthy option, </garnt>
<joey> you get the unhealthy option. </joey>
<connor> - Yep, you gain just as much weight. </connor>
<connor> I think the whole
preconception is that like, </connor>
<garnt> I think especially when
it comes from Americans- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not so much about the actual fact </garnt>
<garnt> that like the food is healthier </garnt>
<connor> and I'm sure like if you
like constantly go eat out </connor>
<connor> of like traditional Japanese restaurants </connor>
<connor> that serve traditional Japanese food, </connor>
<garnt> yes, you're probably
getting healthier stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think it just seems healthier </garnt>
<joey> especially when compared to like Americans </joey>
<joey> because the portion
sizes are just smaller. </joey>
<connor> - That and like the whole konbini, </connor>
<joey> all that stuff is definitely not healthy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, no, no, no.
- That stuff's awful for you. </joey>
<joey> - It's delicious, but it's not healthy. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the problem,
everything's delicious </garnt>
<garnt> so you just want to keep
eating more and more. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I think we mistake it as
like a food culture thing </connor>
<garnt> as to why everyone's so thin here </garnt>
<garnt> but it's definitely like
when you've live here </garnt>
<garnt> you realize really quickly
it's a lifestyle thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It's definitely a lifestyle thing. </connor>
<connor> - Because they walk so much, </connor>
<connor> most people do exercise unless
they're super busy with work, </connor>
<connor> and I mean, that's
already draining enough, </connor>
<garnt> but I've noticed that people
don't really eat lunch </garnt>
<connor> or breakfast much here. </connor>
<connor> It's like a light bite most of the time, </connor>
<connor> unless it's a business meal, </connor>
<connor> then that's when they'll eat lunch. </connor>
<connor> But most people I think
just have like an onigiri </connor>
<joey> or like a small snack. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like a CalorieMate?
- Right. </joey>
<joey> And even then I think most
people are just too exhausted </joey>
<garnt> by the time they finish work, </garnt>
<garnt> they just have something
just 'cause they need to </garnt>
<garnt> and then they go to bed. </garnt>
<garnt> Where, I mean, when you're a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> I eat because I'm bored and trust me, </garnt>
<connor> there's more than enough stuff to eat here </connor>
<connor> that is like terrible for you. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure the amount of food </joey>
<connor> they're just like are
used to eating as well </connor>
<connor> is greatly different to any
standard of a Westerner, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no, like for me, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I have like a
sweet, like an ice cream- </garnt>
<connor> - Everything is sweet here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, everything.
- Everything. </connor>
<connor> - And it's so good.
- It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Normally I hate sweets, </connor>
<connor> but now when I go to a konbini </connor>
<garnt> I have to get at least
one snack or one sweet. </garnt>
<joey> - But like the one thing I can't forgive, </joey>
<joey> especially, this is not just Japan. </joey>
<joey> This is all Asian
countries is sweet bread. </joey>
<connor> - Oh.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> I just think they- </connor>
<joey> - I don't understand it. </joey>
<connor> - I can't speak of other Asian countries, </connor>
<connor> but this country's bread is a joke. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's still bread. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Half the bread that you can choose, </connor>
<garnt> I have not seen a single bread </garnt>
<garnt> that is like multi-grain bread. </garnt>
<garnt> Like just brown bread, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Finding anything but white bread </garnt>
<connor> and then sometimes like
bread with custard in it. </connor>
<joey> Who the fuck wants bread
with custard in it? </joey>
<connor> - Okay, I fuck with
bread with custard in it. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - I fuck with it because I
grew up eating that shit. </joey>
<connor> - And then there's other stuff, </connor>
<connor> and it's like in the UK, </connor>
<connor> the one thing that I realized
now I took most for granted </connor>
<connor> was just a loaf of bread.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the one thing
that everyone feels entitled to </connor>
<connor> in the UK is a loaf of bread. </connor>
<connor> It is like the staple of the house, right? </connor>
<garnt> Everyone has a loaf of bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just go to like
fucking Tesco's, Waitrose. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one pound at most. </garnt>
<garnt> You could even get the cheaper option, </garnt>
<garnt> still a whole loaf of bread
for like 80 cents, right? </garnt>
<connor> 80 cents, ADM, whatever. </connor>
<joey> - How many slices of bread
do you get in the UK? </joey>
<joey> - You get like 12, like
12, you get a full loaf. </joey>
<connor> It's like this big. </connor>
<connor> In Japan, you get half the fucking loaf </connor>
<joey> and they've cut it. </joey>
<garnt> - You get six slices. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get six slices, but
it's not only six slices, </garnt>
<joey> it's like a brick of fucking like- </joey>
<joey> - It's not even a slice. </joey>
<garnt> It's too thick to make a sandwich out of. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so thick that the toaster struggles </joey>
<garnt> to toast it all the way through. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to like put that
bitch in for like 10 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like lightly brown. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, I just want toast! </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think bread has been the thing </connor>
<connor> that I've missed the most. </connor>
<connor> If not that, cheese. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, don't get me started on cheese. </connor>
<connor> - You can get good cheese here, </connor>
<connor> but for the same block
of cheese in the UK, </connor>
<connor> like a kilogram of cheese, </connor>
<connor> I would pay like two, three pounds, right? </connor>
<joey> So that's like, what? </joey>
<connor> Four or five bucks. </connor>
<connor> Here, if I want like
200 grams or 500 grams </connor>
<connor> of good actual cheese, </connor>
<connor> not that God awful shit they have here, </connor>
<connor> it's like 15 bucks. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not paying that much for cheese </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just can't like In my head. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's a bigger struggle for me </joey>
<joey> considering that Australia
is known for its cheese, </joey>
<joey> like all supermarkets in
Australia have an aisle </joey>
<joey> specifically for cheese, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Here, you have to go to a
specific specialized supermarket </garnt>
<garnt> for foreign cheese and
everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> - I just want to grate cheese on shit. </joey>
<joey> - Or it's in a tiny corner
of the dairy section. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's like the
most processed fucking cheese. </garnt>
<connor> - It's American cheese. </connor>
<connor> - They'll have like 10000 meters of tofu. </connor>
<connor> Don't you worry about it. </connor>
<connor> They'll have every single tofu imaginable. </connor>
<joey> They'll have like, it's the same tofu </joey>
<joey> but it's like instead of
0000F on the color grade, </joey>
<joey> it's 000.1F. </joey>
<joey> - It's one shade whiter. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally like
the shit they'll sell. </joey>
<connor> But like cheese, no way. </connor>
<connor> Get that shit out of here. </connor>
<connor> We don't need cheese. </connor>
<joey> - You know it's fucked when we
have more variations of natto </joey>
<garnt> than we do cheese. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, not that I'm
complaining, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how you handle natto, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just grew up with it, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm open to things.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think I have a really good palate. </joey>
<joey> I can eat anything but natto, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the fuck that is. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to be that guy,
but it's an acquired taste. </joey>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You can say that again. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I feel that
I'm pretty international </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm open to try new things. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a few things in the
world that I just don't get. </garnt>
<joey> Natto is one of them. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry to betray my own country. </joey>
<joey> Durian is another one. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry, guys. </joey>
<joey> - I've never tried real durian. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never tried durian as well. </garnt>
<joey> - But I've always wanted to. </joey>
<joey> - What are some like, </joey>
<joey> I guess while we're talking about it, </joey>
<joey> what are some misconceptions about Japan </joey>
<joey> that you think you experienced? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause for me, I know, I
thought for some reason </connor>
<garnt> I thought I was gonna eat way more fish </garnt>
<garnt> by just being, I mean, in comparison </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I do eat slightly more fish </garnt>
<garnt> but I thought fish was gonna be way more </garnt>
<garnt> of a factor in my life
than it actually is. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like if you want
to avoid fish in Japan, </garnt>
<joey> it is so easy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, very, very. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I think that also
comes from the whole fact </joey>
<garnt> that because there were
more foreigners living here, </garnt>
<garnt> like there were just like, </garnt>
<connor> especially between the four years </connor>
<garnt> that I've been living here, </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many more vegetarian
and vegan places open now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's incredible, especially in Tokyo, </garnt>
<connor> but like, yeah, no, I agree. </connor>
<connor> I love me my fish don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Same, same. </connor>
<connor> - But I'm definitely not
going to eat sushi every week </connor>
<joey> like most my fans think I am. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I can't eat sushi every day. </connor>
<connor> It's like a nice little treat. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what you guys are on about. </garnt>
<garnt> If I could eat sushi every week, </garnt>
<garnt> I would and I do most weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> Pre-quarantine, </garnt>
<garnt> going to this dollar sushi chain, </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking love it because
you get better sushi </garnt>
<connor> than you do for paying 30 quid
or whatever you do in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- For a fucking dollar. </joey>
<joey> And it's fucking amazing </joey>
<joey> and I do eat quite a lot fish </joey>
<connor> mostly because I eat sushi a lot </connor>
<connor> and when you cook at home,
you know cooking salmon. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I love cooking salmon, cod </connor>
<garnt> like that's so good.
- Yeah, yah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And because there's so
much fish, like in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you could get like meat </garnt>
<garnt> that's been like seasoned already. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can get like fish
and supermarkets here </garnt>
<garnt> that's already been
pre-seasoned, everything, </garnt>
<garnt> so literally all you gotta
do is open that bad boy up, </garnt>
<garnt> throw it in a pan and you've
got an amazing tasting fish. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so good.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's just habit basically, </connor>
<garnt> because if you don't have
the habit of eating fish, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many other
shit that you could eat </garnt>
<garnt> because it's so readily available. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pizza potato, that's the best. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't know what pizza potato is, </garnt>
<joey> come to the Japan, it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> I fucking stand by it.
- But that's the thing right- </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry, I interrupted you. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think most people think that like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> all there is to eat is just
like sushi is because like </garnt>
<connor> as obvious as this is gonna sound, </connor>
<joey> Japanese food culture is
just so much more than that. </joey>
<joey> It is so much more than fish. </joey>
<connor> - I have consistently had
the best Italian food here </connor>
<garnt> as opposed to-
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's someone Italian
out there just cringing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's like what the fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Going to Italy, it's no contest, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But compared to the UK where
it was literally like again, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a coin toss, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You'd go to a place and the
pasta was like god awful. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's the saddest
carbonara, which you know, </garnt>
<garnt> how can you fuck that up? </garnt>
<garnt> That's like pasta 101, right? </garnt>
<connor> You come here and I feel
like you just always </connor>
<connor> consistently have a good
experience with every kind of food. </connor>
<connor> Right?
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you know this, Chinese
food in the UK is a joke. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not gonna get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I could spend a lot
talking about Chinese food- </garnt>
<garnt> - Any kind of cuisine you can imagine, </garnt>
<joey> except maybe like American
food like portion heavy- </joey>
<joey> - Like diner food. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah meat, like really ribs and stuff. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's hard to get that, </connor>
<garnt> but I'm fine with going to
America or going back to the UK </garnt>
<garnt> and having that myself every now and then </garnt>
<garnt> for the overall trade-off of all right, </garnt>
<connor> consistently I get better meals, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there anything else that
haven't met your expectations </garnt>
<garnt> or haven't met your preconceptions? </garnt>
<joey> - I want to know as like
a non-resident, right? </joey>
<joey> Or like non-Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - This is gonna sound
dumb as fuck, all right? </connor>
<connor> And I know it's going to sound dumb, </connor>
<garnt> but I knew things were
going to be difficult </garnt>
<garnt> that I couldn't speak
Japanese or read Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> More so read than anything. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like for some
reason you can be fine </connor>
<connor> not speaking Japanese
here, but if you can't read </connor>
<connor> like you're in for a storm of trouble </connor>
<garnt> because there are so many things, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think we all can agree on this. </garnt>
<garnt> If Amazon didn't exist here and- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - If Amazon didn't have
English settings here, </garnt>
<connor> I genuinely don't know what I would do </connor>
<connor> because the websites here in Japanese, </connor>
<connor> like I don't know if
they've done this on purpose </connor>
<connor> or due to the old interface, </connor>
<connor> they do not work well
with Google Translate. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's all going
back to that 90s web- </joey>
<garnt> - No, they don't know how
to design their websites. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not user-friendly. </garnt>
<garnt> So if you can't speak
Japanese or read Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> you're kind of fucked.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> And Google Translate does not help. </connor>
<connor> - No, it doesn't help. </connor>
<garnt> It can help you kind of
feel your way through </garnt>
<garnt> but you cannot tell what
the fuck you're doing. </garnt>
<garnt> The only reason we've been
able to get through it </garnt>
<garnt> is because we've had a fucking- </garnt>
<connor> - Got friends, we got
a company helping us. </connor>
<garnt> It makes it so much easier. </garnt>
<connor> Oh yeah, Joey, shout out to Joey. </connor>
<connor> - I am that friend.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Joey helped me a lot when we moved here, </connor>
<joey> like helped me out doing all the dumb- </joey>
<joey> - I had to go to the town hall with you </joey>
<joey> to fill our your papers. </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like you think like
in the big population areas </connor>
<connor> they'd have like a lot of English support, </connor>
<connor> but I think they said if you
come on these certain days, </connor>
<connor> like setting up internet, </connor>
<connor> do you remember how much
of a hassle that was? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - I remember the AU, right? </connor>
<connor> They say they have an
English location in Shinjuku. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- That's a fucking lie. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, their English location
is that they have a tablet </garnt>
<connor> which can call a call center </connor>
<garnt> that can translate the
person for you kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> but not really but that's the closest- </garnt>
<garnt> - But did you even get that far? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I didn't even get
to the guy on the tablet. </connor>
<garnt> I just turned up saying on the website, </garnt>
<connor> this says this is the English location. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, no. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, well, what do I do? </connor>
<connor> How the fuck do I get internet now? </connor>
<garnt> Help me! </garnt>
<garnt> - Luckily I had a cousin
who worked in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> so she could speak Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> She helped me through so much </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know what
I would do without her. </garnt>
<connor> And same with you.
- Yeah, same, same. </connor>
<connor> I need a lot of help. </connor>
<joey> - You feel like a baby. </joey>
<joey> - I genuinely don't know how, </joey>
<connor> there are some foreigners here </connor>
<connor> who can't even speak English </connor>
<connor> who somehow made it here on their own. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, how the
fuck did you do that? </joey>
<connor> - Because at least they have
a lot of English words, right? </connor>
<connor> And a lot of English options sometimes </connor>
<joey> but if can't speak English,
fuck, I don't know what you- </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how they do it. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, like English
is hard enough as it is. </connor>
<connor> If you can't speak Japanese </connor>
<garnt> then I think you're pretty much fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Real positive message
coming out of this episode. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, because that's the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people don't talk about </garnt>
<garnt> which is how hard it is to live here, </garnt>
<garnt> actually live here
without speaking Japanese </garnt>
<connor> because coming on, like
we said, it's so different </connor>
<connor> living here as working here </connor>
<connor> and just live visiting here as a tourist. </connor>
<connor> There's a world of difference. </connor>
<connor> And there's so many little
things like for example, </connor>
<connor> registering with the town hall. </connor>
<garnt> How the fuck am I supposed to do that </garnt>
<garnt> if I don't speak Japanese? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they don't speak English. </garnt>
<garnt> And all the forms were in Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the forms, they tell
you that you need to do that </connor>
<garnt> within two weeks of moving
here are also in Japanese. </garnt>
<joey> - It's simple, just learn Japanese </joey>
<joey> in the two weeks that you're here. </joey>
<joey> - The only reason we knew is
because the lawyers told us, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, you've got do this." </joey>
<joey> But if we didn't know
that, I don't know what, </joey>
<connor> I would have just carried on living- </connor>
<garnt> - You need a dedicated
agency just to help you </garnt>
<garnt> with all the admin stuff- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I can understand the language </joey>
<joey> and I still have to learn
from my cousins who live here, </joey>
<connor> like this is just how it works. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like oh shit, I have
to go to the town hall </connor>
<connor> and register for my address </connor>
<garnt> and my health certificate
and all of that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I never had to experience
that living in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> I never had to experience that
while visiting here, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So it's just, it's overwhelming. </garnt>
<garnt> And like it's like massive kudos </garnt>
<connor> to people who don't know Japanese </connor>
<connor> or even don't know English. </connor>
<connor> gain, I don't know how the fuck they do it </connor>
<connor> without the help of an agency. </connor>
<connor> - To clarify, you can live here </connor>
<connor> if you don't speak any Japanese
or for if you're learning. </connor>
<connor> But I think if you're
somehow coming here alone </connor>
<connor> without anyone helping you,
it's gonna be hell on earth. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it was hell enough </connor>
<connor> with multiple ways of
us having help, right? </connor>
<connor> And I felt so bad for Joey, </connor>
<connor> the amount of times I
have to ask him for help. </connor>
<connor> I was like, he fucking
hates me at this point. </connor>
<connor> - It's okay. </connor>
<connor> - Every day I'm coming over with a form. </connor>
<connor> - I still like you, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like hey Joey, what does this say? </connor>
<connor> And then also until you
figure this out, right? </connor>
<connor> If you miss a package in the post, </connor>
<connor> you get a little form through your mailbox </connor>
<garnt> that's all in Japanese
and you need to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> how the fuck you're gonna
reschedule this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily, I found a way eventually </garnt>
<garnt> which was scan the barcode
with whatever thing you have, </garnt>
<garnt> it'll take you to a website, </garnt>
<garnt> use Google translate to translate it </garnt>
<joey> and then hope that the
translation are rough enough </joey>
<joey> where you can like figure
out what's being said </joey>
<joey> and that's what I do every time now. </joey>
<joey> But for the first week
where I didn't know that, </joey>
<connor> every time I missed a package, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Hey Joey,
can you call them up </connor>
<connor> and tell them I'm gonna be home by 12?" </connor>
<joey> - There was like a month where
I was calling up these guys </joey>
<connor> more often for his packages
than it was for my own packages. </connor>
<joey> - I felt so bad, but I was
like I need the package. </joey>
<connor> It's my fucking desk. </connor>
<connor> And again, okay, let's
trace it back again. </connor>
<connor> And I hate being like nice
to a trillion dollar company </connor>
<connor> like Amazon, but without
them and the English, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can just change
it to English, right? </connor>
<connor> And they also they have
support in English. </connor>
<connor> I'd know, 'cause I've had to
like return items and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> It's literally no different </garnt>
<garnt> from using Amazon in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Except maybe sometimes the translations </garnt>
<garnt> don't work one for one, </garnt>
<connor> but you can pretty much
find what you want. </connor>
<connor> You can type it in in
English and it comes up. </connor>
<garnt> - We basically furnished our entire- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, my whole house is Amazon. </connor>
<connor> - Using Amazon.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Because they have like a Japanese Ikea </garnt>
<garnt> which is called Nitori, </garnt>
<garnt> but you have to go to the store, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to register, you
have to put in your address </garnt>
<garnt> and all that stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - And it takes like 20
days to deliver anything. </connor>
<connor> Did you know that? </connor>
<connor> How crazy is that? </connor>
<connor> If you want like their version of like, </connor>
<connor> there's Ikea here as well,
but it's very expensive. </connor>
<connor> If you buy stuff from Nitori, </connor>
<connor> which is like their version
of Ikea like you said, </connor>
<connor> it's like, there's a lot,
there's a lot of waiting time, </connor>
<connor> like 20 days I think for some products. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Geeze. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like I can't
wait 20 days for a bed. </connor>
<connor> I want to sleep. </connor>
<joey> Like what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - Let me just sleep on the
hard floor for 30 days. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what am I gonna do? </joey>
<connor> And yeah, just also any advice
to someone moving to Japan, </connor>
<connor> please make sure your house
has AC before you move in, </connor>
<connor> because I didn't and I had to
pay I think it was like 2005- </connor>
<joey> - Your previous tenant jacked the AC. </joey>
<connor> - He gutted, he fucking
gutted the whole place. </connor>
<connor> He took everything. </connor>
<connor> He took the light bulbs. </connor>
<connor> Who takes light bulbs? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's a frequent
occurrence you'll see, </joey>
<joey> like going into a new apartment, </joey>
<connor> there won't be any lights. </connor>
<connor> You'll have to buy your own lights. </connor>
<joey> - When I move out of a place, </joey>
<connor> I'll leave stuff that I
think is like super generic </connor>
<connor> that you don't need to think about. </connor>
<connor> I'll leave the bulbs in. </connor>
<connor> If I have like a doormat,
I'll just leave the doormat. </connor>
<connor> Like whatever, they can throw
it away if they don't want it. </connor>
<connor> But like they took everything. </connor>
<connor> They took everything. </connor>
<connor> - They took everything from me! </connor>
<connor> - So I moved in with no AC </connor>
<connor> and it was getting really cold. </connor>
<connor> And I think there's one cosplay video </connor>
<connor> where I was fucking
freezing during this video </connor>
<connor> and I was getting like naked for it. </connor>
<joey> And I was like (shivers). </joey>
<connor> - Not only that, </connor>
<connor> but you were in like the
coldest rooms in the house. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> The tatami room. </joey>
<joey> - The tatami room, which retains no heat. </joey>
<connor> - So just like before you move, </connor>
<garnt> please, before you move into an apartment </garnt>
<connor> please make sure there's AC there </connor>
<garnt> otherwise that's gonna be
a huge cost when you move. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had to pay 2000 plus
dollars for two AC units. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I don't know what
I'm gonna do with that </garnt>
<garnt> if I ever move back to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jack it, dude, jack it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess I have to sell it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bring it with you, UK could use AC. </garnt>
<garnt> - But okay, let's say you
pay for an apartment, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You paid for the AC in
that apartment, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's part of your bill. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas I had to pay 2000 independently </garnt>
<garnt> so that you could argue
that my rent has gone up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like dumb shit like that </garnt>
<connor> that I didn't consider. </connor>
<garnt> - No. So, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> One thing that was different for me </garnt>
<connor> is how much I thought I
would go to Akihabara. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> Versus how much I
actually go to Akihabara. </connor>
<connor> - Onsens too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. Because every time we- </connor>
<connor> - We haven't gone since you guys moved. </connor>
<joey> - I know, I know. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I know! </joey>
<joey> - It makes me so sad. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember like
every time we visited here </joey>
<connor> on holiday, we'd spend half our time there </connor>
<garnt> or something like that.
- Akihabara, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, of course. </connor>
<connor> - Going to Akihabara is
the proper weeb experience. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not proud should
admit that but it was like, </connor>
<connor> imagine every single anime
convention shoved into one. </connor>
<connor> - It is like the mecca of the weebs. </connor>
<joey> It is just the holy land for weebs. </joey>
<garnt> - But then you move here
and you're like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> Akihabara is not only a long way away, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can get a lot of shit
better online for cheaper </garnt>
<garnt> if you can figure out
Japanese websites, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not only that, but there are cities that </garnt>
<joey> are better for all round experiences. </joey>
<garnt> That's why I love like Ikebukuro. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because with Akihabara, you
only go there for anime. </joey>
<joey> And if you want to do something else, </joey>
<joey> then it's not the best place to go. </joey>
<joey> But if you go to somewhere like Ikebukuro, </joey>
<joey> you can still shop for anime figurines. </joey>
<joey> You can still go down- </joey>
<joey> - Go down Otome Road.
- Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<connor> Go go to the Animate there,
which is also in Akihabara. </connor>
<connor> But then you could also
go to Izakaya afterwards </connor>
<connor> or go karaoke or you know? </connor>
<connor> A lot of other things,
it's a lot more varied. </connor>
<garnt> There's a lot more variation
outside of Akihabara </garnt>
<garnt> then if you want just- </garnt>
<joey> - Not to downplay Akihabara though. </joey>
<garnt> - No.
- It's amazing. </garnt>
<joey> It's great. </joey>
<garnt> - Every weeb should go to Akihabara. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's an experience. </garnt>
<joey> - You'll have a spiritual awakening </joey>
<joey> when you go to Akihabara. </joey>
<connor> - It is crazy like the
first time you go there. </connor>
<connor> It's like holy shit, what? </connor>
<joey> - This is what I dreamed about. </joey>
<connor> - Three Sega Arcades right
next to each other, why? </connor>
<garnt> - It's just kind of like
information overload, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You get blasted with so many lights </garnt>
<garnt> with so much shit just around you, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know where to go. </garnt>
<connor> You can spend an entire fucking
day in one store easily. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if you want to
look for deals, right? </connor>
<connor> And figures, you got to
pull out the whole shelf </connor>
<connor> 'cause they hide shit
like way in the back. </connor>
<connor> And sometimes you might find that one deal </connor>
<connor> that is like all you fucking talk about. </connor>
<connor> When I found that one thing
for like 20 bucks, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I want to get a figurine
for like the best price </joey>
<garnt> you got to create a Google Spreadsheet. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, this still
has it for this price </garnt>
<garnt> but the store down there
has it for 10% cheaper. </garnt>
<joey> So you just gotta like
keep track of everything. </joey>
<connor> - And then you ultimately realize </connor>
<connor> that it's cheaper on Yahoo Auctions. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like half price on Amazon. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's way better to buy online. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, even Amazon here, </garnt>
<connor> the figures are way cheaper
sometimes than the stores, </connor>
<joey> which is like weird. </joey>
<joey> - See, because for me like Amazon itself </joey>
<connor> was just like a huge revelation </connor>
<garnt> because we don't have Amazon in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow.
- Oh, you don't? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, we don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so weird to think
there's a world without Amazon. </garnt>
<garnt> - How does a country
function without Amazon? </garnt>
<garnt> - We have eBay. </garnt>
<garnt> And we have like our own
version of Amazon called Gumtree </garnt>
<garnt> which is just- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, we have Gumtree.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Gumtree is where I used
to sell sketchy stuff </garnt>
<garnt> to sketchy people. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the
Craigslist of Amazon though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> But like Gumtree, I'm pretty
sure was an Australian company. </garnt>
<garnt> And so we have Gumtree
and eBay and that's it. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't have Amazon. </garnt>
<garnt> So back when I was living in Australia </garnt>
<garnt> and talking to American YouTuber friends </garnt>
<garnt> who were like, "Oh yeah, I
just got that off Amazon." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, yeah, about that. </garnt>
<garnt> I, uh, they're seeling it for
three times the price on eBay. </garnt>
<garnt> Does that count?
(guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> So when I moved here,
Amazon was just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Whoa.
- Holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna arrive tomorrow?
- Next day delivery? </garnt>
<joey> - Fucking hell, yeah, so that was amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Because the thing about Akihabara </joey>
<joey> I feel it's more of an
experience than the actual, </joey>
<connor> you don't go there to actually shop, </connor>
<connor> you go there for like
the Akihabara experience. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like I remember
one of the biggest things </connor>
<connor> that I noticed going to Akihabara is that </connor>
<connor> you can walk into one shop </connor>
<garnt> and you think it's like
this single store shop </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just gonna
come in and come out. </garnt>
<connor> And then it turns out to
be seven fucking stories. </connor>
<connor> - Of shops.
- Yeah, of shops. </connor>
<connor> And then you waste five hours there </connor>
<garnt> 'cause there's so much
stuff in this one shop. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so tightly packed in. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Buy used figures as well. </connor>
<connor> Their version of used here is a joke. </connor>
<connor> It's immaculate, it's immaculate. </connor>
<connor> - Like I feel bad now </connor>
<garnt> because when I use something,
it's fucking messy as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I have books that have
like one single folded page </garnt>
<garnt> or something that I like
placed it down wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's just unusable here. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. They'll be like
damaged goods, looks very used. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Used in the UK is like if
it's just barely functioning. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, barely functioning, </garnt>
<garnt> probably has like an STD. </garnt>
<joey> I don't fucking know
what it's been through. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas here it's like
have you opened the box? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, it's used. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is fucking amazing how Connor, </joey>
<joey> you found probably the
only used product in Japan, </joey>
<joey> which was your fridge. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, God.
- Can we talk about that? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'll let you tell the story, </connor>
<connor> but it definitely was
not in immaculate shape. </connor>
<garnt> - So we had spent A lot
of money on moving, right? </garnt>
<garnt> As anyone knows moving is very expensive </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd heard of these like Sayonara Sales </garnt>
<garnt> as they're called. </garnt>
<garnt> People who move from Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> they basically sell all that stuff- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that what they're called? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Sayonara Sale. </garnt>
<garnt> And so they sell all
their stuff on Craigslist </garnt>
<garnt> and Meilyne, kept
telling me at BookWalker, </garnt>
<joey> kept telling me like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, just buy all your
stuff on Craigslist. </joey>
<joey> It's like dirt cheap." </joey>
<joey> And I thought, wow- </joey>
<joey> - Great idea, Meilyne. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow, call her out on this. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, I thought, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> well, Japanese people are really great </garnt>
<garnt> with like keeping their stuff immaculate. </garnt>
<garnt> So I order, I speak to
someone on Craigslist, </garnt>
<connor> a sauna fridge and a laundry machine, </connor>
<connor> is that what you call it? </connor>
<connor> - A washing machine.
- A washing machine. </connor>
<connor> - I don't fucking know.
(guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - A laundry machine. </connor>
<connor> - A laundry device machine. </connor>
<connor> Anyway, I bought it for like,
it was like 50 bucks, right? </connor>
<garnt> For a fridge and a laundry-
- That's already a red flag. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<connor> But there were some people who were giving </connor>
<connor> their stuff away for free.
- Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause they
we're gonna get charged </connor>
<garnt> by the local council. </garnt>
<garnt> - To get rid of the stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I didn't pay for anything else, </garnt>
<garnt> not the moving fee or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> So you were there when
my houseman turned up </garnt>
<garnt> like a guy from New Zealand. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he was a Kiwi, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he just turned up and he was like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I'll fucking
install the machine. </joey>
<joey> - Is that your Kiwi accent?
- Yeah, fuck it. </joey>
<connor> He's just like "I'll
fucking install it for you." </connor>
<connor> And so he was like I'll install it for you </connor>
<connor> and I think I discussed with
the person on Craigslist. </connor>
<garnt> They were going charge me
like 10er for installing it. </garnt>
<garnt> So the guy was like,
"Oh no, fuck it, mate." </garnt>
<garnt> And so he installed it
and then I got like, </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember? </garnt>
<garnt> I got like angry fucking texts </garnt>
<garnt> off the person off Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like bombarding my phone. </garnt>
<connor> I picked up the phone </connor>
<connor> and then there was like an
Indian woman shouting at me. </connor>
<connor> Being like, "Why didn't
you pay him the 1000 yen?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What the fuck? Shut up." </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause he said it was cool. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "He said it was fine, </connor>
<connor> why are you fucking spamming my phone?" </connor>
<connor> Yeah and so I was like, </connor>
<connor> I just hung up the phone. </connor>
<connor> I was like, yeah, no, he left now. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck you want me to do? </connor>
<connor> What am I supposed to do? </connor>
<connor> Stop shouting at me. </connor>
<connor> And I told her, I messaged her. </connor>
<connor> If you send me one more
message shouting at me, </connor>
<connor> I'm blocking you. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Giving it a hard block. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I was like, "I'm gonna block you, </connor>
<connor> don't you fucking dare talk..." </connor>
<connor> - Don't at me.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And the guy, the Kiwi called me up </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like, "All
right, mate, listen here. </garnt>
<connor> She wants the money. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna come back and get it." </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, "All right, fine. </connor>
<connor> I'll just give you the 10er, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> Can you just all stop calling me?" </connor>
<garnt> I just enjoy my evening. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I met him at the konbini, </garnt>
<garnt> gave him the 10er and then went back. </garnt>
<garnt> Next day I opened my fridge, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like five
cockroaches in my fridge. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, holy fuck, right? </garnt>
<connor> No wonder they didn't want
a foreigner in their house. </connor>
<connor> Imagine being the only
foreigner in your building </connor>
<connor> and that guy has cockroaches. </connor>
<garnt> - The cleanest country
in the fucking world. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm the asshole who brought
cockroaches into this place. </connor>
<garnt> So I bought a cockroach fridge. </garnt>
<connor> I fucking tore this fridge apart, right? </connor>
<connor> I literally tore, you know the felt </connor>
<connor> that you have on fridges?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I tore all that shit off. </connor>
<connor> I took everything out. </connor>
<connor> I bleached the fuck out of this thing. </connor>
<connor> My house must've smelled </connor>
<connor> like a murder scene being cleaned, right? </connor>
<connor> I bleached the hell out of this thing. </connor>
<connor> And it was the most vile thing. </connor>
<connor> You know the felt thing, right? </connor>
<connor> I was shaking it out </connor>
<connor> and maybe like 100
cockroaches must've fell out. </connor>
<connor> - Ugh! </connor>
<connor> - I don't even want to know </connor>
<connor> the living conditions of the person </connor>
<connor> who sold me this fridge. </connor>
<connor> But fuck you if you ever watch this. </connor>
<connor> You are horrible. </connor>
<connor> Do not sell people your fridges </connor>
<connor> if they are in that condition.
- Exposed! </connor>
<connor> - How can you get cockroaches
in the most cleanest country </connor>
<garnt> that I've ever been to? </garnt>
<garnt> You go on the streets here </garnt>
<connor> and you don't see any fucking rubbish. </connor>
<joey> - There are less cockroaches </joey>
<joey> in the back of like a fucking Denny's here </joey>
<connor> then there were in fridge.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that was my first
experience buying used in Japan. </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yeah and it was awful
because I just thought </connor>
<connor> like God damn it. </connor>
<garnt> Like I just got this house
and I've cockroaches now. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I had to like
scour my whole apartment </garnt>
<garnt> just making sure these
cockroaches didn't go anywhere. </garnt>
<connor> And two months after I
kept finding one or two </connor>
<connor> and I'm like How? </connor>
<connor> I bleached everything. </connor>
<connor> There is no reason these
things should be existing. </connor>
<joey> - That's cockroaches 101, man, </joey>
<joey> once you thought you got rid of 'em all, </joey>
<joey> they're still around. </joey>
<joey> - So now I got rid of the fridge </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just thought enough is enough. </joey>
<joey> This thing looks disgusting. </joey>
<joey> I threw it out. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't a nice looking fridge anyways. </joey>
<joey> - It was gross. </joey>
<connor> It looked like something like
a homeless man would sleep in. </connor>
<garnt> - Your apartment probably
has a cockroach infection </garnt>
<connor> that you just put into there. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I got 'em all. </connor>
<garnt> - It's somewhere in the building. </garnt>
<garnt> I got 'em all. </garnt>
<garnt> I got all those fuckers, I'm just saying. </garnt>
<joey> I spent a lot of time.
- That's what you think. </joey>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But before we end this episode, </connor>
<garnt> I'd like to know especially from you, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I know I experienced this. </garnt>
<garnt> When you announced that
you moved to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I kept mine
secret for like a month. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't tell anyone about the process, </garnt>
<garnt> I only really told close friends but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just kind of dropped it down like. </garnt>
<connor> - I just kind of like made a tweet </connor>
<connor> being like I live in Japan now. </connor>
<connor> What's up?
- Everyone was like what! </connor>
<connor> - What reaction did you
experience when you tweeted that? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, everyone just assumes that, </garnt>
<joey> I was following that weeb dream
that we talked about earlier </joey>
<joey> where I'm just like,
oh, you're finally being </joey>
<joey> the final form of every weeb. </joey>
<garnt> You're finally in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> You're gonna watch so much anime. </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You're basically Japanese now. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm basically Japanese.
- Konichiwa. </garnt>
<connor> - And everyone assumes I
could already speak Japanese </connor>
<connor> because I've been to Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same.
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of people
just rightfully just, </connor>
<connor> okay, not rightfully, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I would never assume if
someone moves to a country </garnt>
<garnt> that they can automatically
speak the language. </garnt>
<garnt> But I got so many comments
of people being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "But you can't speak Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> so why would you move there?" </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like I don't read. </joey>
<connor> It's not really that much of an issue. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna learn it.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but It did become an issue </garnt>
<connor> and it is an issue if we
didn't have someone to help us. </connor>
<connor> - It is an issue but if you have agency </connor>
<garnt> or friend's helping you- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not a requirement. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you have Amazon. </garnt>
<connor> - If you have Amazon.
Jeff Bezos, shout out. </connor>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I mean carry on, </connor>
<connor> is that all you got? </connor>
<connor> Like everyone just assumed
the weeb dream, etc? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I didn't get
too much of like a reaction </garnt>
<garnt> apart from just everyone was happy for me, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone wanted to know how I moved here </garnt>
<connor> or what I went through- </connor>
<connor> - Now you know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, now you know. </connor>
<connor> Much of the advice I can
offer isn't too helpful </connor>
<garnt> because we were kind of
the first of our kind. </garnt>
<garnt> We were like some of the first YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> to be able to move here
for being an anituber. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically we got so good at being a weeb </garnt>
<garnt> the Japanese government allowed
us to continue being weebs </garnt>
<garnt> and we're being paid. </garnt>
<connor> They gave us a visa for
being a super fucking weeb. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<garnt> - We're the anomaly. </garnt>
<garnt> We're the exception. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, Arki technically was- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no she was the first. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm saying like we're one of the first. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause Arki was the first. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, no, it's kind of incredible how, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I felt the same way with RQ, </garnt>
<garnt> but with you guys as well </garnt>
<garnt> that like, wow, like anitube
has gotten to that point now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause even like three years ago </garnt>
<garnt> it was fucking unheard of.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, it's like oh
yeah, you talk about anime </garnt>
<garnt> on the internet for a living. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, good luck staying in your country </garnt>
<garnt> for the rest of your life, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like now it's just an
actual viable career option. </garnt>
<connor> - If you can give back
more than you take out, </connor>
<joey> then there's no reason why </joey>
<joey> I guess a government agency would not want </joey>
<connor> to have that job there </connor>
<connor> if you're giving more money </connor>
<connor> and you're not doing any harm </connor>
<connor> and you're respectful like
why wouldn't they want you? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's been really humbling
to actually be working here </garnt>
<joey> officially doing anime YouTube. </joey>
<joey> And it's been really weird. </joey>
<connor> Especially talking to people
who work in the companies, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like directly. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, how'd you feel your
careers have been affected </garnt>
<garnt> after moving here? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I think mine's
increased dramatically </joey>
<garnt> because now I do have access directly </garnt>
<garnt> to a lot of these productions. </garnt>
<garnt> I knew like a lot of people in
the industry, quote unquote, </garnt>
<garnt> while I was living in Australia- </garnt>
<garnt> - The anime industry.
- The anime industry. </garnt>
<garnt> But like it is a
completely different story </garnt>
<garnt> when you move here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like most of
these Japanese companies </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what the fuck an email is. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they require you to meet in person. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, want you to meet in person. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, if you're gonna
do business in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> you need to have a face-to-face meeting, </garnt>
<garnt> no email, no fucking Zoom call. </garnt>
<joey> - Not even a phone call. </joey>
<garnt> It's like you need to come to our office </garnt>
<garnt> and we need to make sure
that you're a real person. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's all very traditional here. </garnt>
<garnt> So to do business with any anime company </garnt>
<garnt> which is why things move so slowly is that </garnt>
<garnt> you have to follow the tradition. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to do that face to face meeting. </garnt>
<garnt> They call a meeting
for any fucking reason. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Somebody sneezed in the office. </garnt>
<garnt> We need to discuss </garnt>
<garnt> whether this is a potential
anthrax infection. </garnt>
<joey> - Get HR on the phone.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, career wise, I
guess for me the biggest thing </joey>
<garnt> is that I just want to
experience something else </garnt>
<garnt> and also maybe learn another language. </garnt>
<garnt> Although it's painfully
difficult to learn Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just think getting more
life skills can only be a plus, </garnt>
<connor> right?
- Of course. </connor>
<connor> - If I continue doing what
I was doing in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I was doing a lot of voiceover which sure, </connor>
<garnt> I could probably go and maybe go into that </garnt>
<garnt> when for some reason I stop doing YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think I just want to
learn more skills in my life </garnt>
<garnt> while I'm still young as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And while I'm still open to doing things </garnt>
<garnt> and putting myself out there.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think if anything from my career </garnt>
<connor> definitely that benefit
of hopefully learning more </connor>
<connor> and making new connections with, </connor>
<connor> maybe not the industry. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what I'll go into, </joey>
<joey> but I mean, we've definitely
made connections as well </joey>
<joey> just from being in a company under- </joey>
<joey> - yeah, not even the anime industry, </joey>
<joey> just like lots of industries. </joey>
<garnt> - You meet people that you
never knew that you would. </garnt>
<connor> - A lot of creatives, right? </connor>
<connor> A lot of cool people. </connor>
<connor> - But like I think the biggest barrier </connor>
<connor> is the language barrier. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Japanese really need to
fix their difficulty curve </connor>
<connor> because you go from fucking
playing Animal Crossing- </connor>
<garnt> - To Doom Eternal Nightmare. </garnt>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Like Katakana and Hiragana </garnt>
<garnt> is like you're play just
playing Animal Crossing. </garnt>
<joey> And then suddenly you're
doing like a no hit run </joey>
<joey> in Dark Souls or something
when Kanji gets in. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, what
the fuck is going on? </joey>
<garnt> This is not the difficulty curve I wanted. </garnt>
<connor> - And the problem is with Kanji at least, </connor>
<garnt> not problem, I mean,
it's a really beautiful </garnt>
<joey> system of writing and
I've come to appreciate it </joey>
<joey> more and more, but it's like, </joey>
<garnt> if you don't understand a baseline amount, </garnt>
<connor> you just can't read anything </connor>
<connor> because the moment you do,
you're like what's that? </connor>
<joey> - Welcome to the past 25 years of my life. </joey>
<joey> - And it's not like if
I was learning French </joey>
<garnt> where I can sound it out and maybe like, </garnt>
<garnt> I just can't like, I'm like
what the fuck is that thing? </garnt>
<garnt> And then you're like, oh,
I know what this Kanji is. </garnt>
<connor> Turns out the Kanji has five
different pronunciations </connor>
<connor> and meanings and you don't
know which one's which </connor>
<connor> 'cause you just got here. </connor>
<joey> - You just have to know that shit. </joey>
<garnt> - This is bullshit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's what's
the most difficult, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that like Japan is like an
anti-phonetic country, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you can't spell shit out. </connor>
<connor> You just have to know it. </connor>
<connor> And that's why it's so
difficult for a lot of people. </connor>
<joey> I mean, like- </joey>
<connor> - We know a lot of people
who can speak Japanese </connor>
<joey> but I have not even attempted
to learn to read Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> - It is a completely different ball game. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, it's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even like me having learnt it, </garnt>
<garnt> pretty much my first language, </garnt>
<garnt> I still struggle with
it every now and then. </garnt>
<garnt> It is like a constant
learning process for me. </garnt>
<garnt> And like thank God that
my mom did whip my ass </garnt>
<garnt> to learn it when I was
little, because Jesus Christ, </garnt>
<joey> my life has been a million times easier </joey>
<joey> that I can read it and understand it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one time when she said, </garnt>
<joey> "You'll appreciate it when you're older." </joey>
<joey> And you did actually appreciate
it when you were older. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like thanks, mom. </garnt>
<joey> You helped build my career essentially. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone said that with Welsh. </connor>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> Didn't quite pan out. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I appreciate the culture </joey>
<connor> but that's about as far
as the usefulness goes. </connor>
<joey> - But here's the question
I want to ask you guys, </joey>
<garnt> well, now that you've
experienced living here for what? </garnt>
<connor> Essentially seven, eight months now, </connor>
<joey> how long do you intend to stay here? </joey>
<connor> - Mhm, that's a good question. </connor>
<connor> I think I've lived here
long enough to know </connor>
<garnt> that I don't want to live here forever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think there's just at least right now </garnt>
<garnt> in how Japan is a lot of stuff </garnt>
<connor> that I just like don't gel with. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I can definitely
see myself 'cause I've- </garnt>
<garnt> - But a long time though.
- Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I've lived there for eight months. </garnt>
<garnt> It's felt like I've
lived here for a month. </garnt>
<connor> I haven't even reached
close to my final form. </connor>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Is that an anime reference? </joey>
<garnt> - I know we've hardly talked
about anime on this podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, I mean, I feel like
I want to explore Japan more. </garnt>
<joey> I want to learn the language
way more proficiently </joey>
<joey> than I have now. </joey>
<joey> I want to take advantage of it way more </joey>
<joey> and I want to experience
Japanese cultures more. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, same. </joey>
<joey> - Because the one target
I've set myself I should say </joey>
<connor> is being able to have a conversation </connor>
<connor> with some of the businesses </connor>
<connor> and go into some of the office parties </connor>
<garnt> and actually being able to participate </garnt>
<garnt> in the conversation and
everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my goal when it
comes to learning, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Same. </connor>
<garnt> I just wanna be able to communicate </garnt>
<garnt> and learn a bit of Kanji, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Learn the basics just
so I can like figure out </garnt>
<garnt> what the McDonald's menu
says, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like yeah, </garnt>
<connor> I can definitely see it being
like a second home to me. </connor>
<connor> Like a place where maybe
I can easily go back </connor>
<connor> to it months periods. </connor>
<connor> But I think like when
I'm like 50 or whatever, </connor>
<connor> I think I'm gonna miss the how, </connor>
<connor> because I think I've been really ingrained </connor>
<garnt> in British culture of like
how friendly and open it is. </garnt>
<connor> I really like that, especially in Wales, </connor>
<garnt> you just rock up to a pub and
you can speak to anyone there </garnt>
<garnt> in the small pubs in Wales. </garnt>
<garnt> I love that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I kind of miss that a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think, yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I'm eight months in,
maybe in a podcast in a year </garnt>
<garnt> we'll talk about it and our
minds will have changed. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be like I want to
live here forever, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think 'cause right now I
feel like a foreigner still. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> And I think that's
probably never gonna change </connor>
<connor> but maybe at some point I'll finally feel </connor>
<connor> like I can call this place home. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> It might smoothen out a little bit more. </joey>
<connor> - Probably, I imagine it will. </connor>
<connor> Unless I get arrested
and convicted of a crime </connor>
<connor> that I was accused of and
I'm in prison for 100 years, </connor>
<connor> but what are the odds of that? </connor>
<garnt> - Before we end the podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> there was one story I wanted to end on, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like it completely
shattered what my preconceptions </garnt>
<garnt> of moving to Japan would be. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was one of the company
parties that we attended </garnt>
<garnt> with a look BookWalker and GeeXPlus </garnt>
<garnt> and Kadokawa in general </garnt>
<garnt> and it was to do with my fiance, Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> So what happened was we
went to a company party, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone got pretty merry. </garnt>
<connor> And then we went a bar afterwards, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I think I know
what you're gonna say. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(guys laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And so it was like a very intimate bar. </garnt>
<garnt> So it didn't fit a lot of people. </garnt>
<connor> - Room for like 10 people maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, a good 10 people. </garnt>
<garnt> And there were a lot of
people from the company, </garnt>
<garnt> some pretty high up from the company </garnt>
<connor> and then we started
singing karaoke together. </connor>
<connor> And so Sydney being the drunken
little weeaboo that she is. </connor>
<connor> - She's such a weeaboo. </connor>
<connor> - Unlike us, unlike us </connor>
<connor> she went through her weeb phase, right? </connor>
<connor> She went proper full cringey
weeb phase, unlike us. </connor>
<connor> - Sydney, I love you if you watch this. </connor>
<garnt> Isn't she like kind of the face </garnt>
<joey> of the cringey weeb person on a video? </joey>
<joey> - According to the internet, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Sydney is gonna fucking
kill me for saying that. </connor>
<connor> - She had that phase where she went there. </connor>
<connor> So we started singing karaoke </connor>
<connor> and she starts singing
the Anohana end, right? </connor>
<connor> - And me and Garnt were
like fuck, why, why? </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck are you doing? </connor>
<connor> You're in front of a lot of
important people in the company. </connor>
<connor> And she starts bailing
the fucking Anohana ending </connor>
<connor> and then the fucking
businessmen start clapping </connor>
<garnt> and cheering her on and
started singing along. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just sitting there like- </garnt>
<connor> - We were both shocked, I remember. </connor>
<garnt> - I couldn't believe what I was seeing. </garnt>
<garnt> I looked at Connor and I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> "Is this r/really happened right now? </connor>
<garnt> Are we living a 2007 Tumblr post?" </garnt>
<joey> Like oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So like I moved to Japan and yeah, </joey>
<joey> I was in a important business
meeting, a business party. </joey>
<connor> And then we started singing
the Anohana opening, </connor>
<connor> ending even. </connor>
<connor> And then everyone started clapping </connor>
<connor> and cheering and it was amazing. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like this is so surreal right now. </garnt>
<connor> - It's literally an r/that
happened post, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like this definitely happened. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - But it's great </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like when you
do sing stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> they never like, "Oh my God </connor>
<connor> they're trying to be like us." </connor>
<connor> They're like "Oh my God,
they care about our culture. </connor>
<connor> That's so cool."
- Yeah, they really do. </connor>
<garnt> And I guess that's what I want to end on </garnt>
<garnt> which is like I think it's, </garnt>
<garnt> we started on the good sides
and the bad sides of Japan </garnt>
<garnt> but I think they really
do care about our culture. </garnt>
<garnt> They really care about learning more </garnt>
<connor> and they are open to foreigners. </connor>
<connor> There's just sometimes a lot of barriers </connor>
<garnt> that come between that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I guess one of the
biggest things you can do </garnt>
<garnt> is learn Japanese because that's such a- </garnt>
<garnt> - They love it. </garnt>
<connor> They love it if you speak Japanese. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - To them, it's like,
you've made an effort </garnt>
<connor> to learn their culture. </connor>
<joey> - No, I mean, and likewise, right? </joey>
<garnt> If somebody comes over to your country </garnt>
<garnt> and they can understand your language </garnt>
<connor> like that immediately, like, oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, dude, if you
could speak Welsh in Wales, </connor>
<connor> like you're immediately like loved, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause people in Welsh can't even Wales. </garnt>
<garnt> Welsh people can't even
speak Welsh, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I can imagine it's like
one of those, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think like you said, right? </garnt>
<garnt> All differences aside and
all complaints that we have, </garnt>
<garnt> like at the end of the day, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I've ever
spoken to a person here </garnt>
<garnt> who's been rude to me and
everyone has super nice </garnt>
<joey> and you might get stared at or anything </joey>
<joey> but that's not a place of
aggression or anything. </joey>
<joey> They just don't see it often. </joey>
<joey> And at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> they're really, really nice people. </joey>
<joey> - No, the positives definitely
outweigh the negatives. </joey>
<joey> - Oh 100%. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm just British, right? </joey>
<joey> So to me, it's like 1%
negative, 99% positive. </joey>
<connor> I only see this, right? </connor>
<connor> That's what your raised as British. </connor>
