<joey> like Mal is either like 10 or two. </joey>
<connor> - That's, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was definitely one of
those people who put it at 10. </connor>
<joey> - I know you did it you piece of shit </joey>
<joey> 'cause I knew exactly what my- </joey>
<garnt> - What is going on here? </garnt>

<connor> Then we get into the topic. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but you got have like, </joey>
<joey> we need to come up with some kind of like, </joey>
<joey> you know like, how Good
Mythical Morning does it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like the let's talk about that, </joey>
<joey> like we gotta have something like that. </joey>
<connor> - I was going to, </connor>
<joey> but you interrupted me
with the you know... </joey>
<joey> - What? I didn't interrupt
you with anything. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - I was gonna say your
names then the topic </joey>
<garnt> is gonna be smooth as fuck.
- There was no prefix </garnt>
<garnt> to interrupt.
- Professional. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, exactly right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, wow, okay, ruining my turn to host. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay well then go for it.
- All right go. </connor>
<connor> - This is my time to shine. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - [Anime Zone] Go for it. </connor>
<connor> - What I would like to discuss
today with you gentlemen </connor>
<joey> is your anime origin story, if you will. </joey>
<joey> How did you get into anime? </joey>
<garnt> And how you discovered
that you were gonna go </garnt>
<garnt> down this rapid hole of never coming back. </garnt>
<joey> - This beautiful medium
that's we all love and... </joey>
<joey> - And hate
(laughing softly ). </joey>
<joey> At the same time.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Who'd like to go first. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, do you wanna go first Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I feel like you
have the most unique- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Most likely. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel you're putting the
pressure on me, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably have all that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay, having a follow up his story </garnt>
<joey> is gonna be fun, but- </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - I mean it's not that exciting. </joey>
<connor> - Whatever. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah, </connor>
<joey> I guess like mine is unique
in the sense that like, </joey>
<joey> would you say I'm the only
anituber that has like </joey>
<joey> grown up with anime? </joey>
<joey> And when I say growing up </joey>
<joey> I mean like from age
of conceptual thought. </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly)
- You know. </joey>
<garnt> - Age of conceptual thought. </garnt>
<connor> - I think just being raised in a household </connor>
<garnt> to the Japanese parent, </garnt>
<joey> probably has an immediately
different attitude towards anime </joey>
<connor> than one that we would
experience in Western. </connor>
<joey> - Right, because like you know, </joey>
<joey> when most people say like </joey>
<connor> "Oh I grew up with anime, </connor>
<joey> anime was my childhood." </joey>
<joey> Like you know that usually
start age 12 maybe 10. </joey>
<joey> - I mean the real question is, </joey>
<garnt> did you know what anime was growing up? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, that's all I ever knew. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so when you were
growing up in your head, </connor>
<joey> even at like age five or six, </joey>
<connor> there was a clear distinction between like </connor>
<joey> "Pokemon" and like I don't know </joey>
<joey> like Cartoon Network shows.
- Yeah like Batman. </joey>
<joey> - That there was a difference. </joey>
<joey> - Or "Ed, Edd and Eddy
or something like that." </joey>
<joey> - But you knew that they
wanted them as Japanese? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah because unlike
a lot of kids in Australia </joey>
<connor> and like probably around my age group. </connor>
<connor> I grew up watching "Pokemon" </connor>
<joey> and like "Dragon Ball" in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - I have thought "Pokemon"
was an American cartoon... </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] A lot of people did.
- And my mind was blown </joey>
<joey> at like age 10 when I
heard the Japanese version </joey>
<joey> Because it's on YouTube clips, right? </joey>
<garnt> And then you're like, oh
wait, this is the original? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- How? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because to me "Pokemon"
when I was growing up, </garnt>
<joey> just seemed like this very weird genre. </joey>
<joey> Like I couldn't put my finger on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I felt it was a genre, </connor>
<connor> like it was "Pokemon",
"Digimon", "Cardcaptor Sakura", </connor>
<garnt> which was "Cardcaptors"
in the UK and America. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it actually? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah it was called Cardcaptors. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sakura, that's too Asian
sound get rid of that. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing softly) </connor>
<joey> - And it wasn't even Sakura, it's Sakura. </joey>
<connor> - Sakura.
(laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - And the other girl was like, </connor>
<connor> they changed her name to Madison, I think. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember what
her original name was </connor>
<connor> but this is back in the
age of four kids dubbing. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it was a given even for kids </connor>
<connor> that dubbed "Cardcaptor Sakura." </connor>
<connor> But it was in the day that's
localization was a thing. </connor>
<garnt> We were eating jelly donuts. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly)
- Except only Garry. </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't believe
that at the first time. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know like, being, as you said </joey>
<joey> like growing up in an Asian
household, Japanese household. </joey>
<garnt> Onigiri was just like the
most like normal concept </garnt>
<joey> I've ever seen.
- Yeah, that's like </joey>
<joey> your bread.
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly)
exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like you know-
- What did you do to my boy? </joey>
<joey> - I know it's like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> as you said, it's like bread, </joey>
<joey> it's like watching an American cartoon </joey>
<joey> like "Dexter's Laboratory." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And like a scene of them </joey>
<joey> making toasts, for example. </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> And it gets over dubbed into Japanese </joey>
<joey> like you know I'm making a rice bowl. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<joey> a flat rice ball. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's just 'cause at that time, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember a lot of my friends </garnt>
<connor> just didn't really know the
concept of just eating rice. </connor>
<connor> If you weren't Asian you're like, </connor>
<connor> "why would you eat rice with every meal?" </connor>
<connor> That doesn't make sense. </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly)
Right, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I guess so.
- Yeah, I think I can remember </garnt>
<connor> what my family thinking rice was </connor>
<connor> exotic isn't that-
- [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Well I mean it was something you had </connor>
<joey> with foreign foods. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I get. </joey>
<connor> - So, you just don't really eat rice- </connor>
<joey> - But like that's on the
contrary though, right? </joey>
<joey> Like do you eat bread with everything? </joey>
<joey> Because at least in Japan, </joey>
<joey> the concept of eating bread
with everything is like, why? </joey>
<connor> - I feel like at least in British culture </connor>
<joey> you could put bread with anything, </joey>
<joey> like you get away with it.
- Well that's true. </joey>
<connor> I guess like the food culture </connor>
<connor> of that country revolves around- </connor>
<connor> - Anyway, we're getting off topic. </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly)
We're like the food culture. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but so like basically, </connor>
<connor> I grew up watching "Pokemon" </connor>
<connor> and like, what else can
I remember watching? </connor>
<connor> I guess like before that
though, before "Pokemon" </connor>
<connor> or anything like that, </connor>
<connor> or you know, </connor>
<connor> before I started watching
"One Piece" or "Dragon ball" </connor>
<connor> or like all the Shaun and jump stuff, </connor>
<connor> Japanese kids grew up with this like </connor>
<joey> very certain array of kids anime, </joey>
<joey> which is just absolutely
not known overseas at all. </joey>
<connor> - Like "Doraemon." </connor>
<connor> - "Doraemon" is probably
the most well-known. </connor>
<connor> But like you don't like see </connor>
<connor> an anetuber like reviewing "Doraemon." </connor>
<connor> - Episode 5,000 review
"Doraemon" let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Right, or like you know, </connor>
<garnt> like one series that I grew up watching </garnt>
<garnt> like alongside "Doraemon" , </garnt>
<joey> was this show called "Sazae-san." </joey>
<joey> - Which is like the longest </joey>
<joey> running Japanese anime-
- Longest running anime ever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and nobody outside
of Japan has heard of it. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't know about it until you... </garnt>
<joey> I was having a conversation with you. </joey>
<joey> - I mean just to put it in perspective, </joey>
<garnt> my mum grew up watching that show. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing softly) </garnt>
<joey> And I grew up watching that show. </joey>
<joey> So, it's been going on since the 60s </joey>
<connor> and I think this is like </connor>
<connor> 5,000 episodes or something?
- It's ridiculous, </connor>
<connor> it's absurd.
- It's still going, </connor>
<connor> till this day.
- Yeah, I know. </connor>
<connor> - Like I don't know how, </connor>
<connor> I don't know because
like it's really weird </connor>
<connor> because the concept of that show is like, </connor>
<joey> it's just revolving around
this family living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like the most like </joey>
<joey> normal slice of life
show that I've ever seen. </joey>
<joey> But I also think to myself like, </joey>
<joey> how can you come up with like
40 years worth of topics? </joey>
<joey> And not be like maybe
we did cover this topic </joey>
<joey> like 25 years ago, </joey>
<joey> in one of those episodes. </joey>
<connor> - There must be episodes that overlap. </connor>
<connor> Like I feel you can't
make that many episodes </connor>
<joey> and not overlap. </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- I mean they probably </joey>
<joey> could overlap but no one's
gonna be bothered to like </joey>
<joey> watching and cross referencing. </joey>
<joey> - No one's re-watching that show, right? </joey>
<joey> It's one of those things, </joey>
<connor> if it's on TV you watch it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's like, oh oh, they covered
this topic in episode 1,743. </joey>
<joey> - There's you know, there's
one super fan in Japan, </joey>
<joey> that's just seen every episode. </joey>
<connor> - Of course yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And just knows everything
about every episode. </garnt>
<connor> - That seems to be "Sazae-san?" </connor>
<joey> - "Sazae-san." </joey>
<joey> - And "Doraemon" seem to
be the one thing where </joey>
<joey> if you ask anyone in
Japan, do you watch anime? </joey>
<joey> They'll be like, oh yeah,
"Doraemon" and just- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I grew up with
"Doraemon" and "Sazae-san." </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I'm like, I
mean the other anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right, because-
- Like anime, anime. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a distinction. </garnt>
<connor> - There's no boobs in that, what the fuck </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly). </connor>
<joey> - I don't wanna imagine
Doraemon with boobs. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - No God. </connor>
<garnt> - That exists somewhere on the internet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - But watching "Doraemon"
and like "Sazae-san" </garnt>
<connor> and I could list off a number of shows </connor>
<connor> but no one would probably know. </connor>
<connor> But like there's just like
a certain number of shows </connor>
<connor> that I think like it's
just become tradition now, </connor>
<connor> no matter what generation </connor>
<joey> or like if you're born
and raised in the city </joey>
<joey> or you know, the middle of nowhere. </joey>
<joey> Every kid grows up watching these </joey>
<connor> like really specific set of shows. </connor>
<connor> And that's just like normal to them. </connor>
<joey> That's like watching you know "Peppa Pig." </joey>
<connor> - [Both] Yeah.
- It's just like </connor>
<garnt> you don't even think about
like, oh yes it's a cartoon. </garnt>
<connor> It's just something on the TV. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a show. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, yeah, I guess like
the concept of anime, anime, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't hit me until maybe like, </garnt>
<joey> at least when I started
watching "One piece" </joey>
<joey> and "Dragon Ball." </joey>
<joey> And probably around the
like "Pokemon" time. </joey>
<joey> So I reckon when I was
like five or six years old. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - So when you started
realizing what anime is </garnt>
<garnt> and probably getting into it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's when probably we started to </garnt>
<garnt> watch our first animated,
which was "Pokemon." </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<joey> But like in my head I'm like,
yeah, "Pokemon" is an anime </joey>
<connor> and like "Samurai Jack" is a cartoon. </connor>
<connor> Because at that time around
five or six years old </connor>
<joey> that's when I started like
watching Cartoon Network. </joey>
<joey> And I'd like to think </joey>
<joey> that we grew up in like the
golden age of cartoon network. </joey>
<connor> - I mean...
- I'd say so. </connor>
<connor> - We had "Samurai Jack." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We had "Samurai Jack," "Dexter's Lab," </connor>
<connor> "Cow and Chicken," "Ed, Edd n Eddy," </connor>
<joey> so many amazing shows. </joey>
<joey> And to me it's like, okay </joey>
<joey> things on Cartoon Network are cartoons. </joey>
<joey> But things that are on like the VHS tapes </joey>
<connor> that my grandma would send to me </connor>
<connor> is anime. </connor>
<connor> - Is anime. </connor>
<connor> - So, for me there was a
really clear distinction. </connor>
<garnt> So like, I didn't have like
one day this sudden realization </garnt>
<garnt> that like oh shit "Doraemon" is an anime. </garnt>
<joey> Because it was just so natural to me. </joey>
<garnt> - See I don't even remember
when I got that realization. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think I must have got it </garnt>
<garnt> when I properly started getting into anime </garnt>
<garnt> with "Naruto" was my
first like anime anime. </garnt>
<joey> And that was purely because
I just kept seeing avatars </joey>
<joey> and GIFs on the internet. </joey>
<joey> And I was like this kind of
looks like "Dragon Ball Z," </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> which I grew up on, </joey>
<garnt> which that cartoon now I was really into. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do they have ridiculously spiky hair? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing softly)
Yeah, probably the same thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think because
I was on the internet </garnt>
<joey> way before I started watching anime. </joey>
<joey> And I think obviously
being on the internet, </joey>
<joey> you see a lot of anime. </joey>
<joey> I was just thinking
like, what is this shit? </joey>
<connor> What I'm trying to play B.R.U.C.E Escape, </connor>
<connor> why are they talking about this stuff. </connor>
<connor> I don't get it. </connor>
<joey> All I knew is that their
opinion didn't matter </joey>
<joey> because they had anime profile pictures. </joey>
<joey> - Which I guess still is
like entertaining to say- </joey>
<garnt> - It's a timeless thing. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - That's just a meme now </connor>
<garnt> it's generational now is generational. </garnt>
<connor> - No man, I mean "Pokemon"
was the first one for me. </connor>
<garnt> I must've been like, God. </garnt>
<joey> I mean "Pokemon" was always
one of my favorite shows. </joey>
<joey> And I think we've mentioned this </joey>
<joey> in like episode zero or something, </joey>
<connor> that it had like an overarching story. </connor>
<joey> Which you only really got, </joey>
<joey> you didn't really get it actually </joey>
<garnt> in any except for like "Avatar,"
but that came way later. </garnt>
<garnt> Like an olds '90s. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just called "Avatar" an anime? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay like cartoon, so
I was comparing cartoon. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - I was about to fucking. </joey>
<connor> - Because you don't watch
"Courage the Cowardly Dog" </connor>
<connor> for the overarching story, right? </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - You watch it 'cause
every episode is great </connor>
<joey> and you have a good time. </joey>
<joey> But then I remember "Pokemon" was like, </joey>
<connor> oh, they're actually
working towards something. </connor>
<joey> - I think as well, </joey>
<connor> that era of anime as well </connor>
<connor> on like a lot of cartoons, </connor>
<connor> yes there was like episodic moments. </connor>
<connor> But as you said, there was
like an overarching story. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, even if it was a filler, </joey>
<joey> you knew they had a goal. </joey>
<joey> And that seemed to be the case where </joey>
<joey> that kind of structure really spoke to me </joey>
<joey> as if for whatever reason. </joey>
<joey> I really enjoyed that as a kid. </joey>
<joey> And then "Yu-Gi-Oh!" had the same thing </joey>
<connor> and then I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh well what are these things </connor>
<connor> with all the spiky head people, </connor>
<connor> and they're really well-drawn things, </connor>
<joey> I like these kind of cartoons. </joey>
<joey> - It's so weird that for me
at least with "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </joey>
<joey> is that I didn't know
"Yu-Gi-Oh!" was an anime </joey>
<joey> because I grew up with
the card game first. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah, same I got </joey>
<joey> the card game and then watch the anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah right?
- Everyone in your school </joey>
<garnt> was playing Yu-Gi-Oh.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't get that phase, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't get that Yu-Gi-Oh phase. </garnt>
<joey> Because when I was in school </joey>
<joey> everyone was like trading Pokemon cards, </joey>
<joey> and nobody knew how to
play the actual game. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, no, no. No one did. </joey>
<joey> - We have like a black market </joey>
<garnt> like trade deal with Pokemon cards. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<joey> - I had a really dark Yu-Gi-Oh phase. </joey>
<joey> I was legit like fucking, </joey>
<joey> 'cause my dad like used to work
for like a printing company. </joey>
<joey> So what he would do is he
would find like high res </joey>
<connor> like pictures of Exodia. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no.
- My parents </connor>
<joey> did that one time it was wrong. </joey>
<joey> - And he would print them out </joey>
<joey> and I would come to school and I'd be, </joey>
<joey> y'all I got all five pieces of Exodia </joey>
<joey> and they'd be like "a 10 year
old doesn't know, right?" </joey>
<joey> So, "they'd be like oh
no way, you got Exodia?" </joey>
<joey> But it was funny as well because like </joey>
<garnt> Yu-Gi-Oh! Pokemon cards, no
one knew how to play Yu-Gi-Oh! </garnt>
<joey> It was just like, "cool you have Exodia?" </joey>
<joey> - Because I feel the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh! </joey>
<connor> were easier to understand
the rules of Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Pokemon was hard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I don't think anyone </connor>
<connor> in my school played the Pokemon card game. </connor>
<connor> - You just collect them.
- Yeah, you just </connor>
<connor> collected them, right? </connor>
<connor> It was easy to understand you had a Shiny </connor>
<connor> and you just-
- Shahzad. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah once you get Shahzad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well that's the thing though, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like in order to play
the Pokemon card games </joey>
<joey> you need it to like not
throw away the energy cards- </joey>
<connor> - Which no one wanted.
- Everybody did. </connor>
<garnt> - Everybody was the
energy card and all that. </garnt>
<joey> - Which like in my school like, </joey>
<joey> in my school everyone was just like </joey>
<connor> yep, go, go, go. </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly)
have and go. </connor>
<connor> - It was just collecting them.
- That's was just lunch time </connor>
<connor> everyday at my school. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've I started to realize </connor>
<connor> that I've really liked anime </connor>
<joey> when everyone got into Pokemon, </joey>
<joey> when we had the Pokemon
card game phase as well. </joey>
<joey> So it was just like a global craze. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And that how long did that last? </joey>
<garnt> That lasted like a year
or something, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I think-
- Or like a few months. </connor>
<connor> - The year I was born 1996, </connor>
<joey> I think Pokemon was the most
Googled thing of that year. </joey>
<joey> - Well because the game had just came out. </joey>
<joey> - Had just came out </joey>
<joey> and obviously since that point onwards </joey>
<joey> through the mid 2000s
it was pretty insane. </joey>
<joey> Pokemon was like </joey>
<connor> and arguably still today
is one of the biggest like- </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I just kept watching "Pokemon" </garnt>
<connor> even after when the craze gone. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Same. </connor>
<connor> - And my mum and dad wondering like, </connor>
<connor> why is this kid still into Pokemon? </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly)
What the fuck is going on? </connor>
<connor> - I had the same thing, </connor>
<connor> my parents they were worried for me. </connor>
<connor> They were like, </connor>
<connor> do we need to like do
something about this? </connor>
<connor> Like he's still watching cartoons </connor>
<connor> and my older brother
had forgotten cartoons. </connor>
<joey> It was a sign of pride </joey>
<connor> that he'd stopped watching cartoons. </connor>
<connor> He was like, </connor>
<connor> I only watch reality TV
show now with my parents, </connor>
<joey> I don't want to watch this kid show. </joey>
<joey> - I watch MTV, but not for the music. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And I fucking loved "Samurai Jack" </joey>
<connor> like I would always try
and watch "Samurai Jack." </connor>
<connor> "Courage the Cowardly Dog" anime as well. </connor>
<connor> And my parents genuinely
were concerned for me. </connor>
<joey> I don't know if they still
are still concern for me. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> I'm watching just a little bit. </joey>
<joey> - I think much less so
now that you've made one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's the exact point 'cause
all the way up to university </joey>
<joey> and when I rediscovered what anime was, </joey>
<joey> my parents were like, </joey>
<joey> "He's doing it again, why?" </joey>
<joey> We thought we're past this fucking phase. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - When they found out I was
watching more anime than ever, </connor>
<joey> they were even more concerned. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, oh he's
caught even harder into this. </joey>
<connor> We thought it would stop. </connor>
<connor> - I remember my dad, </connor>
<connor> like the funniest thing my dad ever said, </connor>
<connor> I think I was like maybe the
last year of high school. </connor>
<connor> And that was like when I was like, </connor>
<connor> this is right before I
made my YouTube channel. </connor>
<connor> And I was like watching every anime ever. </connor>
<joey> And my dad would be like, </joey>
<joey> "what are you doing in your room?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he thought I was
doing something else. </joey>
<joey> And when I told him that
I was watching anime, </joey>
<joey> I remember my dad saying like, </joey>
<joey> "okay, at this point I think
I'd rather you just do drugs." </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> It's like I would've
been less disappointed </joey>
<joey> if I found that you were
doing drugs in your room. </joey>
<connor> - Which one's more life crushing. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Arguably they're both around the same. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
- Exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but like I don't know like, </garnt>
<joey> I guess like, </joey>
<connor> I don't really have like a phase of like, </connor>
<connor> when I discovered anime or anything </connor>
<connor> because as long as I've known. </connor>
<joey> - I do.
- Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Even Manga as well like, </joey>
<joey> I started reading Manga like </joey>
<joey> around the same time that
I discovered Doraemon, </joey>
<joey> which is probably around when I was like </joey>
<joey> four or five years old. </joey>
<connor> - Oh damn, so you've been
reading Manga since four or five? </connor>
<connor> - Probably, maybe earlier than that. </connor>
<joey> But I specifically remember
the first ever volume </joey>
<connor> of Manga I ever got was
volume two of "Doraemon", </connor>
<connor> I don't know why my mum didn't get me </connor>
<connor> volume one of the Doraemon, </connor>
<connor> that would've been cooler? </connor>
<connor> But I didn't know that it
was an overarching story. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, okay I'll
just start reading this, </connor>
<joey> had no idea what the fuck
was going on at first, </joey>
<joey> until I got volume one and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "oh now it makes sense." </joey>
<joey> It's like-
- Wow, </joey>
<connor> man I feel like my anime thing was like </connor>
<connor> there's three points
in my life where like, </connor>
<joey> I can very vividly
remember watching anime, </joey>
<joey> first was like "Pokemon." </joey>
<joey> And occasionally seeing a
"Yu-Gi-Oh!" episode of the cards. </joey>
<joey> But I think maybe when I
got access to the internet </joey>
<garnt> I think that's when another one came, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I remember watching like "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was GX. </garnt>
<garnt> My parts, three parts. </garnt>
<garnt> - The three parts on YouTube.
(laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know is an OG anime fan, </garnt>
<garnt> because they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "oh yeah don't you hate it </garnt>
<garnt> when you find an espanol sub </garnt>
<garnt> of "Yu-Gi-Oh!"" </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so envision it right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's 2000, right? </garnt>
<connor> You watch episode one,
part one of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" </connor>
<connor> And you're like okay, cool. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna watch episode one, part two. </connor>
<connor> You click it, it's the
next recommended video. </connor>
<connor> It's an espanol, what do you do? </connor>
<connor> Do you keep looking or do you just give up </connor>
<connor> and go to the next part? </connor>
<connor> I remember so many times I had to do that </connor>
<connor> and I was confused as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - You know what? </connor>
<joey> I think what's worst than that, </joey>
<joey> is when you like could
someone uploads like </joey>
<joey> a full anime movie onto YouTube, </joey>
<connor> but because it had to be
split into like eight parts </connor>
<joey> - No.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - And like always, always like
either part six or part five. </joey>
<joey> - Always one of them. </joey>
<garnt> - Always fucking one part.
- There's always one part. </garnt>
<joey> - There's always one part that was missing </joey>
<garnt> and you couldn't find it. </garnt>
<garnt> So you just had to give
up and just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> all right I'll just skip 15 minutes </garnt>
<joey> and just hopefully try and catch it. </joey>
<garnt> - I think there's 15 minutes
of the first narrative movie </garnt>
<connor> that I've just never seen, </connor>
<joey> because I've watched it on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's happening. </connor>
<joey> It might be the best 15 minutes
of narrative of the story. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> I don't fucking know,
'cause I haven't seen it. </connor>
<connor> - What was it? </connor>
<connor> It's like the max upload
time was 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> on YouTube right before.
- 10 yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so that's why it split into three. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember that was like </garnt>
<connor> one of the biggest phases of me. </connor>
<garnt> - And the third part would always just be </garnt>
<connor> five minutes or something. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<garnt> - There was the outro
whose half off of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh man yeah, </garnt>
<connor> that was definitely a big phase for me. </connor>
<connor> And I could have been
around 13, 14 at that point. </connor>
<connor> - Question to you then </connor>
<garnt> did you grow up during
the "Toonami" phase? </garnt>
<joey> Because I feel like "Toonami"
has played such a big factor </joey>
<joey> into making the anime fans of today. </joey>
<joey> - No, for some reason, </joey>
<garnt> did we have "Toonami" in the UK? </garnt>
<garnt> [Joey]We did. </garnt>
<garnt> - We did, but you needed Sky TV. </garnt>
<garnt> So you needed Cartoon Network, </garnt>
<connor> to be able to watch "Toonami." </connor>
<connor> - So Sky is basically cable in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, you guys didn't get </joey>
<connor> Cartoon Network just free to you. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no.
- No, no, no, </connor>
<connor> you had to pay for Carton Network. </connor>
<joey> - Really, 'cause I'm pretty
sure in Australia was free- </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow yeah, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember my parents paid, </joey>
<joey> 'cause my dad wanted to pay </joey>
<joey> for the football matches in the UK </joey>
<joey> and you basically got the whole bundle. </joey>
<joey> So I would watch the cartoon stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I remember there
was loads of cartoons. </joey>
<joey> I never saw anime. </joey>
<joey> I think it was airing really late. </joey>
<connor> And by then my parents were like, </connor>
<joey> "why aren't you in bed son? </joey>
<joey> What are doing?" </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause what was on "Toonami." </joey>
<garnt> - It was like "Dragon Ball Z, </garnt>
<connor> " Gundam Wing." </connor>
<garnt> - I remember seeing "Dragon Ball." </garnt>
<garnt> Never watched it there, </garnt>
<garnt> cause it was always a mess </garnt>
<garnt> Cause they had it out of order. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know what was going on. </garnt>
<connor> So I thought it was cool, </connor>
<connor> but I couldn't get into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think "Dragon Ball Z" </connor>
<connor> and "Gundam Wing" were the only two </connor>
<connor> I was able to watch whenever, </connor>
<connor> cause our family didn't have Sky TV. </connor>
<garnt> So I could only watch it when
I go to my cousin's house </garnt>
<garnt> and I'll be watching
episodes out of order. </garnt>
<garnt> "Gundam Wing" made no fucking sense to me. </garnt>
<connor> - "Gundam Wing" still makes no sense. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you can watch
"Gundam Wing" all day </connor>
<connor> and it will still make no sense. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Like I'll be watching a scene </joey>
<joey> and for some reason the
guy wants to kill this girl </joey>
<joey> but the girl still wants
to get with the guy, </joey>
<joey> makes no fucking sense to me as a kid. </joey>
<joey> "Gundam Wing" already
confusing enough as it is, </joey>
<connor> "Dragon Ball Z" was okay, </connor>
<connor> because I could skip five episodes </connor>
<connor> and they'd be still- </connor>
<connor> - It'd still the same fight. </connor>
<connor> - It'd be still the same fight, you know. </connor>
<joey> - Goku would just be like
three steps closer to Frieza. </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> - Cause I remember like, </joey>
<garnt> I would have to be watching
these scenes in "Dragon Ball Z." </garnt>
<connor> - And Goku was like
powering up the spirit bomb. </connor>
<connor> And then I'd not be
able to go to my cousins </connor>
<connor> till like two weeks later. </connor>
<connor> Then Goku was still
powering that spirit bomb. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> So, I was like this is
just the next episode. </connor>
<connor> No, it was like I missed
three four episodes </connor>
<connor> and it was just still the same shit. </connor>
<connor> - And to this day he's
still powering it up. </connor>
<connor> Still hasn't finished, man. </connor>
<joey> - If he hasn't died for the seven times. </joey>
<joey> Come back to life. </joey>
<garnt> - Because my exposure
to anime has got like </garnt>
<joey> now that I think back to it, </joey>
<garnt> there's the main phases of
like the "Pokemon" phase. </garnt>
<connor> And then there's the "Toonami" phase. </connor>
<connor> Well, I'd see it on Toonami and TV. </connor>
<connor> And then there was this huge gap. </connor>
<connor> - I have the exact same thing. </connor>
<connor> - And then like I realized
now that in this huge gap, </connor>
<connor> I still had like small exposures to anime. </connor>
<connor> Like whenever I go to
Thailand we'd always have </connor>
<connor> these shitty Thai dubs, </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> like "Ultraman" was like
a massive in Thailand </connor>
<joey> even though that's not an anime, </joey>
<joey> but we'd have like "Dragon Ball Z" dubs </joey>
<joey> and man having listening to Thai dubs, </joey>
<garnt> they've already got five
voice actors and actresses </garnt>
<garnt> and they voiced every
character in every anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I respect it, I respect it. </garnt>
<joey> - We got to play it for the audience </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
I just want to hear it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyone whose grown up in Southeast Asia </garnt>
<garnt> knows what I'm talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> When you have five voice actors </garnt>
<joey> who plays every character in every show. </joey>
<joey> And then my cousin showed me, </joey>
<joey> I think it was "Princess
Mononoke," just as it came out. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know it was anime Just like, </joey>
<joey> was this animated film. </joey>
<garnt> I thought it was Disney. </garnt>
<garnt> - How old are you when you
watch "Princess Mononoke?" </garnt>
<joey> - I mean it came out in '97. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, so I must've been </garnt>
<connor> it was the year after it came out, </connor>
<connor> cause it was out on DVD. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty gruesome
movie to watch, it like... </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly).
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That was the first movie I watched. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that movie was just Disney. </joey>
<connor> And then just,
(laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> before I discovered narrative
and everything like that, </connor>
<connor> I went through the LimeWire phase. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I had that. </connor>
<connor> It was just from music though. </connor>
<connor> I didn't, I don't know-
- No, just for music, </connor>
<connor> same era. </connor>
<joey> So I would be browsing LimeWire for music, </joey>
<joey> I probably would like
downloading Linkin Park </joey>
<joey> or Papa Roach or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - As you do in 2004. </joey>
<joey> - As you do in 2004 </joey>
<connor> and then something else like, </connor>
<connor> you know sometimes you download a file </connor>
<connor> and it's not the file you aim for, like- </connor>
<joey> - It's like you mean
very file in LimeWire. </joey>
<garnt> - The Bill Clinton file like-
- Bill Clinton file. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God, so good. </joey>
<joey> - So, in LimeWire someone
was just circulating </joey>
<connor> Bible Black clips. </connor>
<connor> (laughing softly) </connor>
<connor> - The dub. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah the dub, it was the dubbed as well. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> I never knew that Bible
Black was a Japanese anime. </joey>
<joey> Cause I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> what is this shitty
porn that I'm watching. </joey>
<joey> As a kid I'm like,-
- Yeah, it's kinda hot though. </joey>
<garnt> - Holy fuck, this is fucking amazing! </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - That's exactly how AKI
discovered it as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - She said in multiple videos </connor>
<connor> that going through LimeWire </connor>
<connor> obviously looking for the
new Linkin Park album. </connor>
<connor> - I mean you just trust people, right? </connor>
<connor> - And it was the technical
scene of Bible Black. </connor>
<connor> And she's like, </connor>
<garnt> this is like she had like an epiphany. </garnt>
<garnt> She was like, "This is the
most amazing thing ever." </garnt>
<joey> I can imagine though, like
because I don't even remember. </joey>
<connor> I don't want to get onto the topic </connor>
<connor> but like I don't remember
how I discovered that site. </connor>
<joey> - People are like get on
the topic, get on the topic. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - Because I didn't I obviously
didn't know it was hentai </connor>
<connor> or I didn't even know it was anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - But holy shit I'm having a
fucking epiphany right now. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing softly) </garnt>
<garnt> "Bible Black" wasn't the only
hentai I downloaded on there. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - What else? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I remember downloading full length </garnt>
<connor> and "Hansei", that came out in the '90s. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the name, but I- </connor>
<connor> - Why are you downloading
a full length hentai pal? </connor>
<connor> - Because I like you said, </connor>
<connor> you're just downloading random files. </connor>
<connor> And I got one of these
files that I downloaded </connor>
<joey> was this hentai that I
can't remember the title, </joey>
<joey> had angel in the name. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of '90s-
- In a million, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It had an angel on the name, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> what if I just put this
title into LimeWire </joey>
<connor> and see what comes up? </connor>
<connor> And there were like six
titles that came up. </connor>
<connor> So as a kid, I'm like- </connor>
<connor> - I'll download all of them. </connor>
<connor> - I'm downloading all of these. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - How to destroy your laptop, speed run. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ruin any laptops or PCs? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh fuck yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I blamed it on my brother </joey>
<joey> and he totally </joey>
<joey> got blamed for it, but it was
totally me the first time. </joey>
<connor> - I couldn't blame it on anyone </connor>
<connor> cause I'm the oldest in the family so. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - I think the reason why
and I just realized this now </connor>
<connor> I was just wondering </connor>
<connor> what the fuck was I doing
between like 13 and 18? </connor>
<connor> I couldn't think about it. </connor>
<connor> And I just realized, </connor>
<connor> I was cripplingly like addicted to Xbox. </connor>
<joey> It was like every second I got free. </joey>
<joey> I was playing Call Of Duty. </joey>
<joey> That was like- </joey>
<connor> Cause as you're with your
friends as well, right? </connor>
<connor> And that's the golden
age of playing games, </connor>
<connor> where you have to play with
your friends after school. </connor>
<joey> It was like immediately when I was done, </joey>
<connor> I'd go home play games
until I had to go to bed. </connor>
<joey> - And that was like the
golden age of card as well. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, that was perfect, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like Modern Warfare two.
- Modern Warfare two </joey>
<joey> came out when I was like 15, 16, </joey>
<joey> which is like the perfect time to play it. </joey>
<joey> - I think I had an age like, </joey>
<connor> a gap as well that I didn't watch anime </connor>
<connor> and it was around the same time. </connor>
<connor> I know exactly why I wasn't </connor>
<connor> but I'm not gonna say
it cause it's probably </connor>
<connor> not appropriate for YouTube.
(laughing softly) </connor>
<connor> - Oh god. </connor>
<joey> But you can take a guess
to what that might be. </joey>
<joey> But weirdly enough, even
though like during that gap </joey>
<joey> until like probably the
last year of high school, </joey>
<joey> I was still reading Mongo religiously. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so I don't know what it is, </joey>
<connor> it's like I had this burnout with anime </connor>
<connor> or maybe just like a loss
of interest with anime. </connor>
<connor> But for some reason, </connor>
<connor> Mongo was always one thing </connor>
<connor> that I would just come home </connor>
<joey> and just read the shit out of. </joey>
<connor> - Which is a little more engaging almost </connor>
<connor> you have to like actively make an effort. </connor>
<joey> - Probably. </joey>
<joey> And also because I was just </joey>
<joey> like reading in general, I think so. </joey>
<garnt> - So I mean the question to you guys, </garnt>
<connor> what drew you to anime over
like cartoons or other things, </connor>
<connor> Like what drew you to
this medium specifically? </connor>
<joey> - As a child or like-
- As a kid </joey>
<garnt> and growing up as well? </garnt>
<joey> - For me, it was just the fact </joey>
<connor> that my mom would just push it a lot </connor>
<connor> because she knew that it was </connor>
<connor> the easiest way for me
to keep my Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Appreciate the Japanese culture, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - God, I'm just fucking jealous. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
- Yeah and so, </garnt>
<garnt> every time I realize Joey was
born on Japanese household, </garnt>
<joey> speaks Japanese, God I... </joey>
<joey> - My mom knew that </joey>
<joey> if I just kept talking to her in Japanese, </joey>
<joey> it would most likely stick, </joey>
<connor> but she wanted me to like not
just be competent in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Like appreciate the whole culture. </connor>
<joey> - Really like, </joey>
<joey> not just appreciate the culture, </joey>
<joey> but also excel in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And like thank God
because now I think I have. </garnt>
<garnt> And like you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I have learnt like appreciate the culture </garnt>
<garnt> and just anime in
general and the language. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I did like you know </garnt>
<garnt> learn fucked up of Japanese. </garnt>
<joey> Even though I say it in a lot of videos, </joey>
<joey> don't use anime to learn Japanese. </joey>
<joey> I kind of admit </joey>
<joey> I learned a lot of Japanese
from watching anime. </joey>
<connor> - I mean any amount of language </connor>
<joey> that you take in to learn, </joey>
<joey> like if you're watching anything
in a language it's good, </joey>
<garnt> you know it'll help. </garnt>
<connor> Is it the best way?
- I feel Like, </connor>
<joey> as a kid, you just
absorb it through osmosis </joey>
<joey> or something like like that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember learning Thai </joey>
<connor> just because whenever I'd go to Thailand, </connor>
<connor> I would just absorb it, </connor>
<garnt> whenever I was talking to my family </garnt>
<garnt> or just watching TV shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you learn any Thai from Thai dub? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd love to hear a comic in Thai. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing softly) </garnt>
<joey> - It's probably the same, right? </joey>
<connor> - You know it's the same. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay, okay.
- It's the same. </joey>
<joey> It's just very bad quality. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, there wasn't a lot of money </connor>
<garnt> put into the dubbing industry </garnt>
<connor> I reckon, so-
- Back then as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Still not that much to your fact. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that should be true. </connor>
<connor> - We all learn in our
second language then purely </connor>
<connor> because we were just raised in
an area where it was spoken. </connor>
<connor> But the thing is, </connor>
<connor> well when you were a kid you know, </connor>
<connor> you have way more time to just sit there </connor>
<connor> and absorb it when you're an adult, </connor>
<connor> I get 10 minutes a day on Jeweling </connor>
<connor> well, maybe right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas a kid it's like eight hours </connor>
<joey> of just you're hearing this stuff. </joey>
<joey> So obviously you're gonna pick it up. </joey>
<connor> - Right.
- I mean that was just </connor>
<connor> from as far as I can
remember with my childhood </connor>
<connor> like the only memories I have </connor>
<connor> is just like either watching anime, </connor>
<joey> reading Mongo or like
watching cosmic books. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah </joey>
<joey> - So, already just from that </joey>
<joey> like two thirds of my
childhood essentially </joey>
<joey> is me just absorbing the Japanese language </joey>
<connor> in any way possible. </connor>
<connor> So, I think that just helped me... </connor>
<connor> If I never got into anime or Mongo, </connor>
<joey> I would like to think that I would be </joey>
<joey> nowhere near as good at
the language as I am now. </joey>
<joey> - I think definitely for me </joey>
<joey> when I was watching anime
the thing that appealed to me </joey>
<joey> especially my younger age is that, </joey>
<connor> like I said earlier like there's
more of a structure, right? </connor>
<connor> And there's always an
overarching like point, </connor>
<joey> and there's normally a journey to go on. </joey>
<joey> And also I felt like, you know I mean, </joey>
<joey> this wasn't a problem back
then when with all cartoons, </joey>
<joey> you know the ones that
we grew up with, but. </joey>
<garnt> I felt like anime didn't
treat the audience stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> You know like if you're like 16, 18. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe you don't want to watch "Pokemon" </garnt>
<joey> but you can still
appreciate it and enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - And I felt that some cartoons, </connor>
<joey> I mean, you can watch
"Samurai Jack" any age, right? </joey>
<joey> It's time, it's part-
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There was a lot, </joey>
<joey> when I was growing up the very
treated you as a kid, right? </joey>
<joey> - Mmh. </joey>
<garnt> Whereas "Pokemon" was
like, "you're a teenager, </garnt>
<garnt> you're going on the journey, </garnt>
<garnt> you can catch Pokemon." </garnt>
<connor> And it was so cool to
imagine yourself as that. </connor>
<connor> Like it sounds dumb, but- </connor>
<garnt> - How old was Ash again?
- 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ash 10, but I mean he
had his shit together </garnt>
<garnt> for a 10 year old right?
- No, he did. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and Brock is like 35 or something. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- I'm like, </connor>
<connor> why is he hanging with this kid, </connor>
<joey> like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Like you imagine a mom
just letting a 10 year old go </joey>
<connor> into the fucking world by
himself with a fucking rat </connor>
<joey> to keep him company. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, wasn't the whole joke </garnt>
<garnt> that like the mom sent her also </garnt>
<joey> that she can like have a
family with professor Oak, </joey>
<joey> wasn't that the whole thing? </joey>
<connor> - Brock commits crimes and like, </connor>
<connor> yeah I guess that was
really irresponsible of us </connor>
<connor> to let him go with a 45 year old man. </connor>
<joey> - And how is Misty okay with like </joey>
<joey> Ash hanging out with this 10 year old kid </joey>
<joey> like throws your bike into a river. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "I'll pay you back." </joey>
<connor> - How also as like a 10 year old Ash, </connor>
<joey> do you have any concept </joey>
<joey> of Brock constantly hitting on people? </joey>
<connor> How do you like perceive that? </connor>
<garnt> Like what does that to
you as a 10 year old. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine being Brock and
just leaving your family </garnt>
<connor> and your job to like
follow this 10 year old. </connor>
<connor> - He just totally ditch his job, </connor>
<connor> that is so irresponsible.
- Remember he missed Illa. </connor>
<connor> He had a massive family as well. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> like what the fuck are you doing Brock? </connor>
<garnt> He had like 10 brothers and sisters, </garnt>
<garnt> what are you doing? </garnt>
<connor> - Needless to say that
kind of reckless behavior </connor>
<joey> really appealed to me as a kid, you know. </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> I'm just often leaving my family </joey>
<connor> that I was supporting with my job. </connor>
<joey> - Leaving my family for what? </joey>
<joey> To follow this ten-year-old
so I can go slay some posts. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - It's like strangely
reminiscent of like "Hisoka" </connor>
<joey> from hunt to hunter. </joey>
<connor> It's like grown man just
wants to follow a kid around </connor>
<connor> and see him grow. </connor>
<joey> - The biggest thing for
me though with "Pokemon" </joey>
<garnt> that just made no sense to me, </garnt>
<garnt> is how Gary Oak is like
essentially the same age as Ash, </garnt>
<garnt> And yet he can get like all these pus. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it bad that I actually
liked Garry more than Ash </connor>
<connor> and I loved it when he was a dick to Ash. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, you should
be catching Pokemon Ash. </connor>
<garnt> - Because he was actually
achieving the goal </garnt>
<garnt> of trying to become a Pokemon master. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what? </connor>
<connor> I feel like as a kid, </connor>
<connor> maybe you appreciate Ash more, </connor>
<connor> but as an adult you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Gary is kind of got his shit together." </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> Like Gary's achieving his dream. </connor>
<connor> - No, no.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, it was cool that
you saved that Butterfree </joey>
<joey> and reunited it with Ash. </joey>
<joey> But like-
- But Gary has 10 bags, </joey>
<joey> there are not even 10 bags in the game. </joey>
<connor> - Did Butterfree start a
patron to pay your bills? </connor>
<connor> No he didn't, go and get a job Ash. </connor>
<garnt> - Gary's on like a gold split speed </garnt>
<connor> running this entire shit. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<garnt> - He was doing 80% Pokemon, </garnt>
<connor> if most speed was a thing. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - 80% it like getting all the pussies. </connor>
<connor> You're just doing it all. </connor>
<connor> That man did it all like. </connor>
<connor> And yet we still we're
supposed to hate him. </connor>
<connor> Like are you okay? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] You got to fucking
cheerleaders with him as well. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
- [Anime Zone] Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember there was one episode </garnt>
<garnt> like I think when they were like </garnt>
<garnt> when Ash was about to
like go to Kyogre I think, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And Gary just rocks up </joey>
<joey> in a fucking like..
- [Connor] Lamborghini. </joey>
<connor> - Lamborghini. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> With like 10 chicks just to be like, </joey>
<joey> "you're still here? </joey>
<joey> I already got all the badges." </joey>
<joey> cause I'm just like
"who's driving the car?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, not only is he
an expert Pokemon master. </connor>
<joey> He's a logistic expert. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Getting all these women around, </joey>
<joey> always in his Lamborghini, </joey>
<joey> but he doesn't worry about
parking tickets, come on. </joey>
<connor> I mean like, Ash is walking everywhere. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> Point being I think Ash's kind of shitty. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah definitely as a kid, </connor>
<connor> that whole kind of structure </connor>
<joey> and the kind of you know, </joey>
<joey> going on a journey I was like. </joey>
<joey> Did you guys feel really disappointed </joey>
<joey> when Ash got beaten in the Pokemon? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah.
- I was like, </joey>
<connor> this is our destiny. </connor>
<connor> He formed these artificial
bonds with these Pokemon, </connor>
<connor> and fucking Shahzad had the balls to sleep </connor>
<connor> at the final fight. </connor>
<garnt> Are you serious Shahzad? </garnt>
<garnt> - As a kid, it was like </garnt>
<connor> top 10 anime twist of all. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, it was-
- Top 10 anime twist </connor>
<garnt> at all time.
- All time. </garnt>
<connor> - Shahzad he saved you bro, </connor>
<joey> he saved you help him please
(laughing softly). </joey>
<joey> - There's actually this really funny thing </joey>
<connor> I've found the other day </connor>
<connor> when I was looking at the
like "Pokemon" speed runs. </connor>
<joey> You know, there's a
thing called Ash percent. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - I think I yeah I saw that.
- Where you have </joey>
<joey> to play the game exactly, </joey>
<joey> like catch every Pokemon
exactly the same as Ash did. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to release your Butterfree, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to release your Charizard, </garnt>
<joey> and then you have to
purposely lose at the- </joey>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - That would drive me mental man. </garnt>
<connor> - I know (laughing softly). </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like shirtless Mario speed run, </garnt>
<garnt> on Super Mario Odyssey.
- [Joey] Odyssey. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah you basically just do a speed run </joey>
<joey> on Super Mario Odyssey. </joey>
<joey> Where you try and get Mario
shirtless quick as possible. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Nipple percent, it's the best. </joey>
<connor> - I love the troll speed runs. </connor>
<joey> - Anyway, we got off topic.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, okay and I don't know, </connor>
<connor> was it the same thing as
well for you as a kid? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't quite put my finger on it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was this huge overarching plots. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they had a goal and they
were working towards a goal. </garnt>
<garnt> Like "Pokemon" turned out to me, </garnt>
<connor> as I watched more anime </connor>
<connor> I started liking "Pokemon" less and less. </connor>
<connor> Like when I see things
like "Digimon" came out </connor>
<connor> and they had an actual like story arc </connor>
<joey> instead of being cut by Charizard. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly)
at the most crucial moment. </connor>
<garnt> "Digimon" for me was probably </garnt>
<garnt> the moment when I actually
fell in love with anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You wanna know something? </joey>
<garnt> I never watched the "Digimon" anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you not? </garnt>
<connor> - I watched it. </connor>
<joey> - Anything "Digimon" that I ever consumed </joey>
<joey> are the two movies. </joey>
<connor> - I played the games as well as a kid. </connor>
<connor> And the only thing I remember
is them being hot as fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, they are.
- There are games with that? </joey>
<joey> - There's games and I think at
least the Digimon world games </joey>
<joey> I don't know how old they are. </joey>
<joey> I remember some of the
hardest games to get </joey>
<joey> full completion of any games ever. </joey>
<joey> Like they're like insane. </joey>
<joey> And I remember as a kid thinking like, </joey>
<connor> "what the fuck, why can't
I get past the first level? </connor>
<connor> I beat all the Pokemon in French. </connor>
<connor> what the hell like?" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I never, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is, </joey>
<joey> maybe because I was just
so obsessed with "Pokemon." </joey>
<connor> But I always knew "Digimon" was a thing. </connor>
<joey> But I never watched any of- </joey>
<connor> - It was always the joke as a kid, right? </connor>
<garnt> You were like the fucking comedian </garnt>
<garnt> if you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I guess you're the Digimon." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing softly) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're the Digimon kid.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - No one want's to be the Digimon kid. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have a question for you specifically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Cause obviously this </garnt>
<connor> doesn't apply to you, </connor>
<connor> but did you as a kid have a sense of like, </connor>
<connor> I kind of liked this whole
like Japanese culture thing. </connor>
<connor> Whenever it propped up,
in like TV or anything. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean to me it was less exotic. </garnt>
<connor> 'cause to me it was Asian culture. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I guess, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because I had seen more of it </joey>
<joey> 'cause I didn't exactly
grow up in Thailand </joey>
<joey> but I would visit there
at least once a year. </joey>
<joey> So I'd spend like my summer
holidays in Thailand every year. </joey>
<connor> So, seeing some of the
more Japanese culture </connor>
<joey> or the more Asian oriented culture, </joey>
<joey> it's not that different from what you get </joey>
<joey> from flying to Asia. </joey>
<joey> Like Japanese specific, like say onigiri </joey>
<joey> I had no idea what the fuck-
- Onigiri donuts. </joey>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, onigiri donuts,
but I could see that, </joey>
<joey> it was just a ball of rice. </joey>
<connor> I know what rice is, I
can see what this is. </connor>
<connor> - I guess that's the
difference of me coming from, </connor>
<connor> the whitest place on earth. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> And not being exposed to any other, </connor>
<connor> especially Asian cultures. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The only Asian exposure I had, </connor>
<garnt> apart from media, it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> the shitty Chinese stuff, </garnt>
<connor> that you know down the road </connor>
<connor> we've had awful Chinese. </connor>
<connor> And so I think whenever
I saw Japanese stuff </connor>
<connor> in media I thought it was so cool. </connor>
<joey> It's gonna sound so fucking
dumb that I will say this, </joey>
<joey> - Go on.
- Do you remember </joey>
<joey> "Jackass:The Movie" or whatever? </joey>
<joey> Where one of them goes to Japan </joey>
<connor> and it's all just stripping
in a store and dancing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The whole time, I just ignore that. </connor>
<joey> I was like, dude look at
those fucking appliances, </joey>
<joey> they're having. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was so cool, </joey>
<joey> they had all these appliances in the store </joey>
<joey> that I have never seen them. </joey>
<connor> Because in the West we never got those </connor>
<connor> TV and radio built-in things. </connor>
<joey> And they had the numbers on the side. </joey>
<joey> I thought those were
cool as as fuck as a kid. </joey>
<joey> And then obviously watching
like Samurai stuff. </joey>
<connor> And then "Samurai Jack" was a
huge thing that made me think </connor>
<joey> I fucking love Samurai's as a kid. </joey>
<connor> They were like they were like
the coolest things to me. </connor>
<connor> - I think it was either, </connor>
<connor> depending on if you
were into anime or not. </connor>
<connor> The two things that
got people into Samurai </connor>
<joey> were at the "Samurai Jack" </joey>
<joey> or "The Last Samurai"
- I can still watch </joey>
<joey> "Samurai Jack" today and
like fucking love everything. </joey>
<joey> - Dude the newest season
was fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God the fuck
make you cry like a baby. </connor>
<connor> - "Samurai Jack" is just a fucking </connor>
<joey> great show period.
- Amazing, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "Samurai Jack" was like
the one Cartoon Network show </joey>
<garnt> other than "Ed Edd n Eddy" </garnt>
<joey> that my dad would be just
as excited to watch with me. </joey>
<connor> - It was so good. </connor>
<connor> - It was like, </connor>
<connor> dude, "Samurai Jack" is
on move out of the way. </connor>
<connor> - I remember the episode
with like the assassin. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember this one? </connor>
<connor> He had the robot dog. </connor>
<connor> I love that episode. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's one of my favorites. </connor>
<connor> But I think in my head looking back now </connor>
<joey> I feel like it was inevitable </joey>
<joey> that I was gonna get into anime. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I had a fondness
for Japanese culture. </joey>
<joey> Well it wasn't like intense
or weepy or anything. </joey>
<connor> I liked the movies, I liked
all the culture that I saw. </connor>
<connor> I loved video games and
being a video game fan. </connor>
<joey> You're gonna run into
stuff so you're like, </joey>
<joey> huh, why is it like this? </joey>
<joey> And you're like, oh it's Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And then also watching anime
from a young age and like. </joey>
<joey> So I felt like it was
inevitable at some point </joey>
<connor> in my life I was gonna find anime </connor>
<connor> and be like I fucking love this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I completely forgot about video games </garnt>
<connor> and just JRPGs in general. </connor>
<connor> - It's a big push, </connor>
<connor> you don't realize how
much you're like pushing. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, and I realized a
lot of the same story tropes </connor>
<connor> that drew me to anime,
like I liked in JRPGs </connor>
<connor> and that's why I really
get into JRPGs as well. </connor>
<connor> I guess, </connor>
<joey> do you remember the time
when Japan just felt </joey>
<joey> like this foreign concept?
- Oh, yeah (laughing softly). </joey>
<joey> - This is way past even
when me discovering anime. </joey>
<connor> But I remember after discovering anime </connor>
<connor> I started discovering
narrative and everything, </connor>
<connor> it was so weird to find
anyone who went to Japan </connor>
<connor> or see any kind of like Japanese media, </connor>
<garnt> even outside of the Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like it's only recently </connor>
<garnt> become a tourist destination.
- [Anime Zone] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Definitely yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If my parents who never
wanna leave Europe, right? </joey>
<joey> They're like, if it's not
Europe, it's not a vacation. </joey>
<joey> If they're considering
career in Japan sounds cool. </joey>
<joey> If that don't like that, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, okay </joey>
<joey> well now I guess everyone's up to it now. </joey>
<joey> - Are they thinking that?
- Yeah, they were planning </joey>
<joey> not just 'cause I lived here, </joey>
<joey> but they wanna come anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Oh okay. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah I feel like there's </joey>
<joey> that kind of mainstreamness of it anyways </joey>
<connor> is really had a big impact recently. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember when I first started </connor>
<connor> watching stuff on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> there was no like vloggers. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] No.
- [Anime Zone] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Except for like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember watching a Chris Broad video </garnt>
<garnt> from like years ago. </garnt>
<joey> And he was like the only guy, right? </joey>
<joey> - He was one of the OGs.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'd like to think, yeah.
- And I remember back then </joey>
<joey> if you wanted to find
something in Japanese </joey>
<joey> it would have to be
like a BBC documentary. </joey>
<connor> Someone going there, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was not a YouTube thing. </joey>
<connor> - The weird working world of Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Right, whereas now </joey>
<garnt> you can find out anything
you want about this country. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Exactly.
- It's not hard, </garnt>
<connor> but I remember yeah, like same thing </connor>
<garnt> I had no fucking clue.
- You'd see, </garnt>
<garnt> these weird commercials. </garnt>
<garnt> You'd see these clips
from these talk shows </garnt>
<joey> or the variety shows. </joey>
<garnt> And you're like, what the fuck
is going on in this country? </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean there was like that
giant "Takeshi's Castle." </joey>
<garnt> - I totally forgot that.
- I forgot about that. </garnt>
<connor> - "Takeshi's Castle" at 7:00
a.m. every day on challenge. </connor>
<joey> And I used to wake up early before school </joey>
<joey> and I would like watch every episode. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't think you
guys get this excited. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - I just totally glossed over it. </connor>
<connor> I literally watched "Takeshi's castle" </connor>
<garnt> all throughout high school. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what same here.
- Even though it's reruns. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking loved it every time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you just watch the
same episodes over and over. </garnt>
<connor> It's like watching "Top Gear" on Dave, </connor>
<connor> it's something you can
always watch over and over </connor>
<connor> and it was just so fucking weird- </connor>
<joey> - It's recently that I found out though </joey>
<joey> that like "Takeshi's castle", </joey>
<connor> you guys had reruns
with "Takeshi's Castle?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- And I found that </connor>
<joey> really interesting because
that's a show from the '80s. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it's strange </connor>
<joey> 'cause I think America has
their own version as well. </joey>
<joey> But like "Takeshi's
Castle" is this kind of, </joey>
<joey> what is it called? </joey>
<connor> The most extreme game show is it called- </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much, it's like "Ninja Warrior," </garnt>
<garnt> something like that. </garnt>
<connor> That's like the modern anime- </connor>
<garnt> - It's like "Ninja warrior,"
but imagine if it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> all the contestants were
just everyday people </garnt>
<garnt> and it was horribly
unfair, it was so unfair </garnt>
<connor> and it was so fun and it was just brutal. </connor>
<connor> These courses they would just send people </connor>
<joey> and they would all fail.
- Especially "Ninja Warrior" </joey>
<joey> across the Jackass.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it looked dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of the courses look
so fucking dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean there's a reason why </garnt>
<joey> they don't do that show anymore. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no.
- Because it's like </connor>
<joey> legit OHNS.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That show had a huge following </connor>
<connor> in the UK because of that. </connor>
<connor> And I think in America did as well, </connor>
<connor> but each localization had
a different style to it. </connor>
<joey> So, the Japanese
obviously showed the show, </joey>
<joey> the British one had like this- </joey>
<garnt> - Craig Charles.
- Craig Charles who's </garnt>
<connor> quite a famous person
back in the '90s, right. </connor>
<connor> - Because he did "Robot Wars" and- </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right, and. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It was really big and in
America they had a kind of </connor>
<connor> imagine a pseudo kind
of football commentators </connor>
<connor> being like, what do
you think of that Jeff? </connor>
<connor> It was supposed to be
kind of like jokey things, </connor>
<connor> I actually watched clips of it. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's as good, </connor>
<connor> but each country got its own localization. </connor>
<joey> And the one that UK was huge, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember there was petitions </joey>
<joey> even when I was like 16, 17. </joey>
<connor> People wanting to bring it back. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, how can you bring it back when </connor>
<connor> they're just dubbing over the old clips. </connor>
<connor> But Thailand actually had, </connor>
<connor> I think a version like
a few years ago as well. </connor>
<connor> - Did they?
- They made their own version. </connor>
<garnt> - I have no fucking a clue.
- 'Cause I remember watching </garnt>
<garnt> and thinking like, nope, not the same. </garnt>
<garnt> I just didn't think, quite catch it, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was a huge factor </garnt>
<garnt> in why also I love Japanese culture </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you watch that show and like- </joey>
<joey> - It's crazy.
- It's hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - It's amazing and it's also a blatantly, </joey>
<connor> extremely Japanese.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're seeing Katakana Kanji everywhere. </connor>
<connor> It's purely Japanse. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like '80 HD, like
editing, you know anime. </garnt>
<connor> - It's pure, </connor>
<garnt> yeah that was my first introduction </garnt>
<garnt> to like crazy Japanese.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's pure chaos, I don't know </connor>
<garnt> what it is about Japanese variety shows, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just about having as
much information on screen </garnt>
<garnt> to distract your eyes as possible. </garnt>
<connor> - After making YouTube videos. </connor>
<garnt> I've come to feel sorry
for every Japanese editor. </garnt>
<garnt> With the sheer amount of texts </garnt>
<garnt> they have to put on the screen. </garnt>
<connor> Changing colors and shit
popping up everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Because everybody's
dialogue has subtitles. </connor>
<joey> (laughing lightly) </joey>
<garnt> And it's like we can hear them fine. </garnt>
<joey> Don't worry about it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Do you know what I hate? </joey>
<garnt> Whenever I see an anime trailer </garnt>
<joey> and it's from Japanese TV. </joey>
<joey> So they always got this guy reacting to it </joey>
<joey> or something like that.
- In the corner right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> And then not even reacting that much. </joey>
<joey> They're just like. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the thing that
Jordan said about game shows. </connor>
<connor> They'll have a really normal thing </connor>
<connor> and they'll have a guy in the corner like. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing softly) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like a really
interesting behind the scenes clip </garnt>
<garnt> of this anime or show </garnt>
<garnt> I remember seeing the journal
clip of the guy doing MOODA. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<garnt> And it's just the guy
reacting in the corner. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like I don't give
a shit about that guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Taking a valuable screen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I know, just
let me see the fucking- </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna watch the guy doing the MOODA. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> I mean, I have to say that
with "Takeshi's Castle," </joey>
<connor> I fucking loved growing
up while watching it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, what a show.
- What was your guys' </connor>
<connor> favorite segment of that show? </connor>
<connor> Because for me to this
day if I have a bad day, </connor>
<joey> I'll always watch clips
of Lotion Staircase. </joey>
<connor> - See, I think they have different names </connor>
<joey> to that in UK challenges.
- [Joey And Anime Zone] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it was title screens. </joey>
<connor> You could tell that they
cast tried to mimic. </connor>
<joey> - I mean did you guys watch
like the Lotion Staircase one? </joey>
<connor> It's like a giant staircase </connor>
<garnt> and it's just covered in lotion. </garnt>
<garnt> And they have to try </garnt>
<connor> and get to the top of it.
- Yeah, I remember that one. </connor>
<connor> - I liked the one that they would </connor>
<joey> the Honeycomb Maze, like the Hexagon Maze. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was basically this maze
and you got a up top-down view, </joey>
<joey> which is so good. </joey>
<joey> And you would see them
go through this maze </joey>
<joey> and they're basically these fucking dudes </joey>
<joey> which grab them in the face, </joey>
<joey> and throw them around </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, what the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> And then there's also the rolling things </garnt>
<garnt> that they would try and run
on, that looked impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> - The one, that sticks out to my mind </garnt>
<connor> is the one where they're rock skipping. </connor>
<connor> Like just like
- That was dangerous. </connor>
<connor> - You fucking go full
pelt over these like rocks </connor>
<connor> over a river, and some of
the rocks would just sink. </connor>
<connor> - Ye
- Now just imagine if like </connor>
<connor> you're running full pelts </connor>
<connor> and then one of the rocks
sinks and you just face bonds </connor>
<connor> into a real rock. </connor>
<joey> Oh my God, that looks painful.
- If you haven't watched it </joey>
<joey> you're in for a treat. </joey>
<joey> It's just so good, it's such good fun. </joey>
<joey> I don't think a show like
that could happen today. </joey>
<joey> - No, no and like and it's
not just "Takeshi's Castle" </joey>
<connor> they were like I've realized there's </connor>
<connor> so many shows that
either America or the UK </connor>
<garnt> or like just some Western country is like, </garnt>
<connor> "Silent Library." </connor>
<connor> - And like "Wipeout" </connor>
<joey> and even like "Ninja Warrior," </joey>
<connor> they're all like originally Japanese show. </connor>
<garnt> - I love "Ninja Warrior,"
watching the Japanese version. </garnt>
<garnt> - They could never go as
crazy as the Japanese version. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no.
- You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's crazy. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I think that was
definitely game shares. </connor>
<joey> Everything kind of got
me into anime, right. </joey>
<joey> It was just that kind of buildup of </joey>
<joey> I kind of think this culture
is kind of sick, right? </joey>
<joey> I mean I like what they do. </joey>
<joey> I like all the media that they put out </joey>
<joey> it just jives with me, right. </joey>
<garnt> And I just seem to enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember the
first anime anime, right. </garnt>
<joey> This is what we're talking about. </joey>
<garnt> Like finally getting into like </garnt>
<garnt> the shit, right?
- Modern days. </garnt>
<joey> - Like real shit.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, I really, for
some reason I wanted to be </joey>
<garnt> like a TV and film snob. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, I wanted to be like </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen everything, you know like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you go through
the IMDb top 100 phase? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I think, I feel </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's gone to this point.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone in uni. </garnt>
<connor> Everyone at uni. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like uni was a big. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was in the, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I just finished watching </connor>
<connor> "24" and "Prison Break" </connor>
<connor> and I was feeling like, man
I'm such a TV connoisseur. </connor>
<connor> I've watched "Prison Break" and "24." </connor>
<garnt> So, I went through the list </garnt>
<garnt> and "Death Note" was like
eighth or something at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - This must've been like 2012, 13. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I skipped it initially. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, I don't
watch them cartoons. </connor>
<connor> I'm a grown ass man, I grew up.. </connor>
<connor> - I want some real show.
- 'Cause again </connor>
<connor> my parents and all my family
and cousins and whatever </connor>
<connor> they were telling me dude
stop watching cartoons, right? </connor>
<connor> You're an adult, right? </connor>
<garnt> So, I naturally skipped it. </garnt>
<garnt> But for some reason I did
a double take like two </garnt>
<garnt> or three weeks later, read
the synopsis and I thought, </garnt>
<garnt> okay this sounds pretty
fucking sick actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And if it's in the top 10, </garnt>
<garnt> it's got to be pretty good, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Watched one episode. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to school the next day </garnt>
<garnt> but I stayed up the whole
night up until school. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to leave with two
episodes left to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I binged it the whole
season of "Death Note," </garnt>
<garnt> in one night and oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> I just immediately like became obsessed. </garnt>
<connor> It was like overnight, </connor>
<connor> all my other plans to watch
all these famous movies </connor>
<connor> and TV shows get that outta here. </connor>
<connor> Someone on YouTube said
watch "Code Geass," </connor>
<connor> so I'm gonna do that now. </connor>
<connor> (laughing lightly) </connor>
<connor> And it's just obviously that
phase where you discover </connor>
<connor> all the golden anime. </connor>
<connor> It's just like banger after banger. </connor>
<connor> And it's like three months straight </connor>
<connor> where you're just like </connor>
<connor> all you think about is
watching the next anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Good. </garnt>
<connor> Like remember that phase, </connor>
<connor> I've even missed that phase so much. </connor>
<connor> Everything's you've watched was amazing. </connor>
<connor> I look back at some of the shit now, like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Even the shitty stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Even the shitty like I
remember going through this phase </connor>
<garnt> when I was obsessed with Love Hina right? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - I think everyone had
that phase back in the day. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, if we all have
that phase back in the day </joey>
<connor> can I ask what was the show
that ruined that for you? </connor>
<connor> Do you remember? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I knew exactly what it was for me. </connor>
<garnt> - No because I feel like once
you watched enough anime, </garnt>
<garnt> you start like, </garnt>
<connor> do you remember the
feeling of the void, right. </connor>
<connor> The void where you watch
this really, really good show </connor>
<connor> and you're like no one's gonna top this. </connor>
<connor> Nothing's gonna top this
and you just feel empty. </connor>
<connor> - And then you hit your boom woo. </connor>
<connor> (laughing lightly)
- Come on. </connor>
<connor> (laughING loudly) </connor>
<connor> - And then the more shows you watch </connor>
<joey> the more that void shrinks.
- [Connor] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Till you find the next amazing show. </joey>
<joey> And then you were like,
and then you watch enough. </joey>
<connor> And then you find your
top 10 favorite shows. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- And then that's </connor>
<connor> kind of when it starts cementing for me </connor>
<connor> to the next phase where
you start watching stuff </connor>
<connor> and it's not as good a feeling
as when you first started. </connor>
<garnt> So, what was it for you then? </garnt>
<connor> - "School Days." </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I distinctly remember this </connor>
<connor> and I remember being
really annoyed about it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not saying that for
the meme is totally accurate. </connor>
<garnt> ' Cause-
- Why can I never </garnt>
<connor> escape "School Days."
- Okay, you wanna know </connor>
<connor> what's even worse, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that, so I was watching anime </connor>
<connor> on YouTube still at this point, right? </connor>
<connor> So, and I remember, 'cause
I would got my anime list. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that's what everyone did, right? </connor>
<connor> You would look at which
ones are high rated </connor>
<connor> and which ones you know. </connor>
<connor> For some reason School Days </connor>
<connor> was like one of the highest rated. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> But it was split right, </connor>
<connor> it was either a 10 or a two. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And I thought </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna be in the 10 categories. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah
- Everything I've watched </connor>
<connor> so far I fucking love, right. </connor>
<connor> So, first off I already had a bad start </connor>
<connor> watching School Days because </connor>
<connor> I remember watching "School
Days HQ" or something. </connor>
<joey> And it was like-
- well, like a spinoff. </joey>
<joey> - It was like 40 minutes.
- No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> "School Days HQ" to explain </joey>
<joey> is the original visual
novel of "School days." </joey>
<garnt> But the original visual
novel of School Days </garnt>
<garnt> was basically just a full on anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right, it was all animated. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay.
- I didn't know that </connor>
<connor> I was the first time
I just found that out. </connor>
<garnt> - So you can watch all
the "School Days HQ" </garnt>
<connor> on something like Pornhub or X videos, </connor>
<connor> which if you're ready to just like- </connor>
<connor> - X Hamsters. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - If you're really just looking to watch </connor>
<connor> the clips that you're looking for, </connor>
<garnt> you can just find it over there. </garnt>
<connor> - And they would have
showed the clips in that. </connor>
<connor> I didn't get that far. </connor>
<connor> I got about, cause it was
a 40-minute episode one. </connor>
<connor> And I watched 40 minutes </connor>
<connor> and I was like, this doesn't seem right. </connor>
<connor> Am I watching the right thing? </connor>
<connor> Everyone's saying it's
good, like is this, right? </connor>
<joey> - It's so funny that you say it like </joey>
<connor> the School Days is like mal </connor>
<connor> is either like a 10 or a two. </connor>
<connor> I was definitely one of those
people who put it as a 10. </connor>
<connor> - I know you did you piece of shit, </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, </connor>
<joey> I know exactly what my-
- What is going on here. </joey>
<connor> - I know what mindset you were in, </connor>
<connor> where you were like,
I'm in the fucking hood. </connor>
<connor> I gotta say yes.
- What is going on? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> Why am I sitting next to someone </connor>
<garnt> who gave School Days a 10. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay look.
- Is that sheep, right. </connor>
<connor> Who everyone else has set it at 10. </connor>
<connor> And he doesn't wanna be
that one guy who was like </connor>
<connor> I don't think I have good taste. </connor>
<connor> No, I have good tastes,
I can appreciate it. </connor>
<joey> - Because for me, right, School Days </joey>
<joey> was-
- [Connor] Garbage. </joey>
<joey> - it was crap until the last episode. </joey>
<joey> Because the last episode I was like, </joey>
<connor> first of all I remember
just sitting there. </connor>
<connor> We're obviously not gonna say it </connor>
<connor> but I'm sure there's
lots of people who know- </connor>
<connor> (Connor humming) </connor>
<connor> - If you don't know at the
end of the "School Days." </connor>
<connor> Boat couldn't comes out, right. </connor>
<connor> But like School Days
for me, that ending was </connor>
<connor> the most satisfying thing
I'd ever seen in anime. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I will give you that. </connor>
<connor> It was satisfying, but then I remembered, </connor>
<connor> I just sat through 11 of the
most boring shit in my life. </connor>
<connor> And I don't think this is
big enough to redeem it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, the first 11
episodes was just like </garnt>
<connor> I think I need anger
management, right now. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Because oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I hate the main character so much. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, I hated him. </connor>
<connor> - And then the fucking orgasm,
you've got at episode 12 </connor>
<joey> where what happened, happens. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, </joey>
<garnt> oh thank God. </garnt>
<joey> - That ending for me made it a 10. </joey>
<joey> - No.
- No, no. </joey>
<joey> - I was like for me-
- No. </joey>
<joey> - I specifically remember I'm like </joey>
<connor> I'm glad I went through those 11 episodes. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the I got to watch
the most satisfying ending, </connor>
<joey> I've ever seen.
- That's bullshit. </joey>
<joey> That's recency bias, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you're basing your
review of how it ended. </connor>
<connor> Not the fucking, the absolute shit truck </connor>
<connor> that you have to like
shovel through to get that. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, no, but here's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> I've said this so many times in videos, </joey>
<joey> but the ending for me
is so fucking important </joey>
<connor> because like I had the exact opposite. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you got that goldfish brain, </connor>
<connor> the ones that tunes everything out before- </connor>
<connor> - Because I have the
exact opposite experience </connor>
<connor> with "Deadman Wonderland."
- No, I still liked that </connor>
<connor> "Deadman Wonderland."
- Because "Deadman Wonderland" </connor>
<joey> for me was amazing first 10 episodes </joey>
<joey> and the ending was just the most garbage, </joey>
<joey> bullshit like okay, we
ran out of budget ending </joey>
<joey> that I've ever seen. </joey>
<garnt> That it just completely
ruin the experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that doesn't mean it's a one. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not putting, no, no.
- I mean, it means. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't put "Deadman
Wonderland" like a one- </connor>
<connor> - What did you give "Deadman Wonderland?" </connor>
<joey> - The anime?
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like a five.
- What no, no, </connor>
<connor> it's better than a five. </connor>
<joey> - Because then I read the
"Monga" and the "Monga" </joey>
<connor> is infinitely better.
- You think so? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I thought where the "Monga." </connor>
<connor> - Because the "Monga" actually ends. </connor>
<joey> I like the fucking anime.
- Do you like the ending </joey>
<joey> of the "Monga" though? </joey>
<joey> - It's better than the fucking anime. </joey>
<connor> - I guess, I remember
reading "Deadman Wonderland." </connor>
<connor> And I kind of liked
what it did a little bit </connor>
<connor> but the ending, I wasn't too
big of a fan over the "Monga." </connor>
<connor> - Right, but I enjoyed it </connor>
<connor> even if it was just like
a mediocre ending, right. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] At least you got an ending. </connor>
<joey> - At least I got an okay ending. </joey>
<joey> Whereas the anime just
left me wanting more </joey>
<joey> and I'm like don't cock tease me like that </joey>
<joey> after the 10 amazing episodes. </joey>
<connor> - But would you rather a show that has </connor>
<connor> like 10 amazing episodes with no ending </connor>
<connor> or 24 episodes with 10 amazing episodes. </connor>
<joey> And it starts to go kind of man </joey>
<joey> the ending's a little questionable. </joey>
<connor> - The first.
- I think this </connor>
<garnt> is what we got with Deadman there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- We got 10 bangers, and then. </joey>
<connor> - That's why like- </connor>
<connor> - But I'm just trying
to wrap my head around </connor>
<connor> how he could justify the "School Days." </connor>
<joey> - Okay let me.
- I've just been </joey>
<joey> sitting here for the past few minutes </joey>
<garnt> having a fucking mental
breakdown by myself. </garnt>
<joey> - Let me rephrase, let me rephrase, okay. </joey>
<joey> I had so many opinion changes </joey>
<connor> on the ending of the "School
Days," so many times. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so what would you
give School Days now then? </connor>
<joey> - Now I would give it a six. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, </connor>
<joey> my gosh man. </joey>
<joey> - I had a phase where I'm
like, is this ending genius </joey>
<joey> or is it the worst garbage </joey>
<joey> I've ever seen?
- It's not genius. </joey>
<connor> - If I make a character that is so </connor>
<connor> fucking appealing and then I kill him off. </connor>
<garnt> You shouldn't be-
- He's not even a </garnt>
<garnt> good character, he's not a good character. </garnt>
<joey> - But that's exactly the reason why </joey>
<joey> the ending is satisfying.
- No, but it's satisfying, </joey>
<garnt> but it's just so fucking surface level. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't </connor>
<garnt> watch it again.
- 'Cause </garnt>
<garnt> this protagonist, it's
the one that we follow. </garnt>
<garnt> He made this character
dog shit on purpose. </garnt>
<garnt> But then there's also a
little bits where he tries to </garnt>
<garnt> make you like the guy and
that's the worst part. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's what I fucking hate, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, no, don't
try make me sympathize </garnt>
<joey> with this cunt, </joey>
<joey> you just had a threesome in class three B, </joey>
<joey> like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> You just have a, </joey>
<joey> he's supposed to be a dad </joey>
<connor> or some shit.
- I loved, </connor>
<joey> that's the one character development that </joey>
<joey> what the fuck was, Makoto
had that's that was his name. </joey>
<garnt> - Makoto that was his, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he's so fucking blunt. </garnt>
<joey> I couldn't even remember his, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember any
of the character names. </joey>
<garnt> - I love one character
that all of the Makoto had </garnt>
<garnt> is like, he started out as this </garnt>
<garnt> absolute simp for sake guy </garnt>
<garnt> and then just turned into these most these </garnt>
<garnt> most like fucking-
- Kotonaha, </garnt>
<joey> that was her fucking name.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - He became like the Giga-chat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Giga-chat.
(laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - The episode for me that made me </connor>
<connor> had to pause and go like.
(sighs loudly) </connor>
<connor> When they wanted to have </connor>
<joey> a threesome or something.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly)
- I like paused it </connor>
<connor> and I was like. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
(Joey clapping) </garnt>
<garnt> - Shut them out there,
shut the fucking there. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, what the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> And it was so like porn, </connor>
<garnt> like it was literally a
porn plot, how it happened. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it is a fucking porn plot. </connor>
<garnt> - It is.
- Yeah, it was- </garnt>
<connor> - "School Days HQ" is a porn plot. </connor>
<connor> - That's the worst thing about it, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that they try and sell you
that it's not a porn plot. </connor>
<connor> And then they hit you with
the, in front of my salad plot. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, no,
this isn't what I want. </connor>
<connor> And the fact that people on mal </connor>
<connor> had the fucking balls to be, </connor>
<connor> this is an artistic
masterpiece of our generation. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - I'm definitely that one
guy, I could say that. </joey>
<connor> I'm like this ending is absolutely genius. </connor>
<joey> You guys just throw me </joey>
<connor> at the thin air.
- The timing is impeccable. </connor>
<connor> It's like </connor>
<connor> okay if my dog got rabies
and I've watched it die </connor>
<connor> for three hours. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I'd probably see it put down </connor>
<connor> but it would be satisfying, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's just suffering. </connor>
<connor> That's what the anime was,
it was just suffering. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hated it. </connor>
<connor> And the fact that I had
to then watch 40 minutes </connor>
<connor> of a let's play or
whatever the fuck it was </connor>
<connor> in the first thing.
- See I didn't watch that. </connor>
<connor> - And the worst part was is that imagined, </connor>
<connor> okay, before you could even
start the dog shit pile </connor>
<connor> that is fucking "School Days." </connor>
<connor> You had to watch 40
minutes of the same thing </connor>
<connor> before you started the same thing again. </connor>
<connor> So, I remember watching the first episode </connor>
<connor> already bored out of my mind </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'd seen this shit before </connor>
<connor> in a slightly different way. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, okay,
I hate "School Days." </connor>
<connor> - Listen to this.
- School Days sucks (beep). </connor>
<connor> - I'm just having a fucking
mental breakdown right now </connor>
<connor> because I thought I had left
School Days in the past. </connor>
<connor> I never thought I'd hear
those two words again. </connor>
<connor> And I never thought I'd be
sitting next to the guy who, </connor>
<connor> 'cause, I remember that mal phase </connor>
<connor> and I thought everyone must be trolling. </connor>
<connor> This is like the inter-species
reviewers kind of thing. </connor>
<joey> Everyone's giving this a 10, </joey>
<joey> everyone's being fucking ironic. </joey>
<joey> There's no way that there can be a guy- </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure there were. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure there were, </joey>
<joey> but I can't imagine you
ironically gave it a 10. </joey>
<connor> I just can't, I just.
- I just remember like- </connor>
<connor> - What is happening? </connor>
<joey> (laughing lightly)
- I had a video </joey>
<connor> like this is a video-
- Well yeah you corrected </connor>
<joey> your opinion.
- Yeah, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Not enough.
- So, I made two videos, </joey>
<connor> I had a video. </connor>
<connor> The first video I've
ever made on School Days </connor>
<connor> was right after I finished watching it. </connor>
<joey> And I think it's a six-year-old video </joey>
<joey> and it's called, is the School Days ending </joey>
<garnt> a masterpiece or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - And it was me going
like, yeah, I think it was. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but okay, </connor>
<connor> imagine "Code Geass" is ending, right. </connor>
<connor> You heard that, </connor>
<connor> but then 25 episodes was
just us following Nunally, </connor>
<connor> just her daily life. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> That shit's boring, I don't wanna fuck- </connor>
<garnt> - The ending was satisfying </garnt>
<garnt> but it was just a boring show. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a boring show for half of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the second half was just </garnt>
<garnt> anger management issue. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I gave it such a high score </garnt>
<joey> because I just appreciated the meta behind </joey>
<joey> how the director and producer
chose the literal worst ending </joey>
<joey> of any visual novel in existence. </joey>
<joey> It was a great trolling in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> And I think that's why I
said it was kind of genius. </joey>
<connor> - I mean it's definitely different. </connor>
<joey> That ending like that, </joey>
<connor> I haven't seen anything </connor>
<connor> like that since-
- Because there's a reason </connor>
<joey> why we're still talking about School Days </joey>
<joey> after fucking how many years
of it since it's been out? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah okay, here's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that sometimes
(laughing lightly) </connor>
<connor> what is a good ending, right? </connor>
<connor> Do you think of it as a good ending? </connor>
<connor> Because the story made sense. </connor>
<joey> It really like the whole thing, </joey>
<joey> it was like, wow that's a great ending, </joey>
<joey> it really made sense. </joey>
<joey> All the characters built up to this. </joey>
<joey> No, it's a good ending </joey>
<joey> because the main character
was fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> And everyone in that show was god awful. </joey>
<connor> We just wanted to see
them get like revenge. </connor>
<joey> - But I would argue that an
ending that is good, right. </joey>
<connor> It doesn't necessarily have
to be memorable, right. </connor>
<connor> There is a different
between a memorable ending </connor>
<connor> and a good ending.
- It's a memorable ending </connor>
<garnt> not a good ending
(laughing lightly). </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like pure shock factor, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- That was like, </joey>
<connor> it's just like pure shock factor. </connor>
<joey> And it's got no much substance
behind that shock factor. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - Right, and that was my big
problem with "School Days." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause at least with the visual novel </connor>
<garnt> you could see fucking sex scenes for one. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<joey> - We can watch the Giga-chat in that. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Get some tips, </joey>
<connor> he's getting threesomes like age 16, </connor>
<joey> holy shit. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, </connor>
<connor> 'cause at least in that
point it actually made sense </connor>
<connor> why he was getting all this fucking pussy. </connor>
<connor> - Did he though, did he really- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it made sense </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was a fucking hentai, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- It made sense </joey>
<garnt> in the visual novel, not in the anime </garnt>
<joey> because they didn't explain
the hentai sub plot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or the subtext, I guess
that it is a hentai. </joey>
<connor> - I think that was the
first time as a teenager </connor>
<joey> that I was like, sex again.
(laughing loudly) </joey>
<garnt> Really? </garnt>
<garnt> We're gonna go with sex
again, all right Jeez? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah but like, around that time, right. </joey>
<connor> That's like the age where </connor>
<connor> you start to be beyond those kinds of </connor>
<connor> like sex and poop jokes. </connor>
<joey> Where it's all about, </joey>
<joey> if this isn't challenging
my 16 year old atheist brain </joey>
<joey> then it's not good material. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm pretty sure I watched </connor>
<connor> that like pp ppoo poo
thing that made me laugh </connor>
<joey> on YouTube like two weeks ago.
(laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> So I don't know if I'm fully gone but. </connor>
<connor> - Right, but it always goes back, right? </connor>
<joey> You'd laugh at poop jokes
at age 10, not at age 15. </joey>
<joey> And then you love a poop
jokes as you get to age 20. </joey>
<connor> - Being a teenager is fucking weird. </connor>
<garnt> That's just like, that's all I can say. </garnt>
<connor> - It is fucking weird, </connor>
<connor> 'cause teenagers we're
horny as fuck, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - And I guess when you're
a teenager you wanna.. </connor>
<joey> This is weird thing that you
don't do as an adult right? </joey>
<joey> When you're an adult, you
fully accept what you're into. </joey>
<joey> But as a teenager, you're
like trying to mold </joey>
<joey> your interest into what you
think you should be right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I felt like the
shows that you watched </garnt>
<garnt> which is probably why this guy gave </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking School Days a 10 he's like </garnt>
<connor> I wanna be this smart
guy who can see through </connor>
<connor> all the bullshit to see the masterpiece. </connor>
<joey> - I would fully admit
that's exactly what I did. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I'm not gonna sit here </joey>
<joey> and say I did that too, right. </joey>
<joey> There's probably a part
of me that would argue </joey>
<joey> that "Prison Break" was a
masterpiece of our time, right. </joey>
<joey> When I look back now, I'm
like what the was I thinking? </joey>
<joey> I was 15.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When you're a teenager,
you'd have dumb opinions. </joey>
<joey> - Which is why you should never start </joey>
<joey> an anime YouTube channel in your teen age. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no.
- Because you're very </garnt>
<joey> highly regret it later on. </joey>
<garnt> - My first video was on fucking "Bleach." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, how old are you, when
you started YouTube then? </connor>
<garnt> - 17.
- Shit, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> See, I would do still do dumb up until 20. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And I started </connor>
<joey> my YouTube at 19, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was 19 as well when I started. </joey>
<joey> - And I holy crap, some of the stuff </joey>
<joey> that I said that I look back now </joey>
<joey> and you look back and you know the motives </joey>
<joey> as well to why you said the dumb shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah
- You'd never have now. </connor>
<joey> Right.
- Of course. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, I want
to be seen in this way. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm gonna say opinion
that isn't really mine </garnt>
<garnt> but I know people will view me if I. </garnt>
<garnt> - I look back at my,
some of my first videos </garnt>
<connor> and I fucking cringe, man. </connor>
<connor> I could not finish them. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly)
Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm so fucking glad that
the way the internet was </connor>
<connor> it was like the perfect time </connor>
<connor> I think for when I was growing up </connor>
<connor> 'cause there was still
the kind of thing of, </connor>
<connor> you could say whatever the fuck you wanted </connor>
<connor> and you got away with it, right? </connor>
<connor> I'm sure I said some
fucking horrible stuff </connor>
<connor> on Room Escape and Xbox
live to people right? </connor>
<connor> And I was like-
- Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Now I mean kind of stuff
gets hold against you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I'm glad that I had </connor>
<connor> that room to grow, room to know that </connor>
<connor> School Days was garbage. </connor>
<joey> Without having to make a video about it. </joey>
<joey> I mean like School Days
is a masterpiece, guys. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, don't make the
same mistake I made. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you actually make a video on that? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Well you did? </connor>
<joey> - You did?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is it up in your channel? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's on my channel. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a video from six years ago. </joey>
<garnt> And it's like-
- We're watching that tonight. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like five minutes, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I can't watch it 'cause it's so clingy, </connor>
<connor> but it's me in a fucking
(laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> I had this giant chopper
hat for some reason. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I was wearing it. </joey>
<joey> That was during the era </joey>
<joey> where I was known as the guy
as to where the weird hats. </joey>
<joey> I had a chopper hat that
was the huge chopper hat. </joey>
<joey> And I was also wearing this rainbow beanie </joey>
<joey> with a scarf attached to it and shit. </joey>
<joey> I looked gross to say the least </joey>
<joey> I dunno why anyone was like,
Oh yeah, this guy looks good. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, an ironically, I was like </joey>
<joey> you know what, </joey>
<joey> now that I'd like mulling it over. </joey>
<joey> I think School Days is ending
is really freaking good. </joey>
<joey> And it's on my channel right now. </joey>
<joey> Like, dude. </joey>
<joey> I'll keep that up because it is- </joey>
<connor> - It's just getting hard drive, </connor>
<connor> he's gonna.
(laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - I like to keep it up </joey>
<joey> to kind of remind my audience
that I used to be like this </joey>
<connor> but now obviously I've changed
my opinion on School Days </connor>
<connor> and a lot of shows
because I've, as you said </connor>
<connor> I've had the room to grow
now and the room to watch. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's funny to look back </joey>
<joey> at your old videos where
you were clingy as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Just to be like, </garnt>
<connor> this is what I'm like now. </connor>
<connor> I mean you can see clear improvement. </connor>
<connor> - I liked seeing the growth. </connor>
<connor> That feels good. </connor>
<connor> It feels it hurts to watch
some of your older videos. </connor>
<connor> I actually watched it and I'm like </connor>
<connor> I sound so much more British. </connor>
<connor> My accent has changed so fucking much. </connor>
<garnt> And I didn't realize that. </garnt>
<connor> - I had such a Northern accent </connor>
<connor> when I started YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Well when I meet you </connor>
<connor> you had like the thickest
Northern accent and I'm- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah it's kind of </connor>
<joey> been like destroyed now, which is nice. </joey>
<joey> I mean I speak speak clearly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- But I think that's </joey>
<joey> it to coincide with all
like YouTube growth. </joey>
<joey> I think you have that as
well, especially in your taste </joey>
<garnt> and anime when you're a teenager </garnt>
<garnt> and what you like and you
kind of lie to yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're called Trash Taste for a reason. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean Joey's is really </garnt>
<connor> pulling his weight on that
Trash Taste, he's really- </connor>
<garnt> - This episode has been on fucking point. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had to bring the trash in, all right. </garnt>
<joey> If someone someone's
gonna do is gonna be me. </joey>
<garnt> - Why is it every podcast I'm one, </garnt>
<garnt> I can never escape "School Days?" </garnt>
<garnt> Why, why? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it's so fun. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's that
moment as an anime fan, </connor>
<connor> when you watch School Days </connor>
<joey> and it's like two paths, which
one are you gonna go down? </joey>
<joey> Are you're gonna go down like
just admitting your taste. </joey>
<joey> - This is like the modern day, </joey>
<connor> like "Pokemon" versus "Digimon." </connor>
<garnt> It's like School Days
good or School Days bad. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the anime litmus test. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm thinking, was "School Days," </garnt>
<garnt> just way more culturally important </garnt>
<garnt> for the anime fandom than
I've realized it was. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it is.
- At least for, </connor>
<joey> in the mid 2010 that round.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think that was a big taste indicator. </joey>
<connor> - 100%.
- And also anyone </connor>
<connor> who said they liked it </connor>
<connor> was a fucking liar at the time. </connor>
<connor> So, and that means you couldn't trust </connor>
<connor> any of his opinions. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - Anyone subscribed after
that I don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - Because at that time I remember this </joey>
<joey> I felt like I was the idiot. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like the only guy </connor>
<connor> that thinks the show is garbage. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm I going crazy? </connor>
<garnt> - When did School Days come out? </garnt>
<joey> It was like 2007, I think it came. </joey>
<joey> - It was during the golden age. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so its 2007 yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think it was 2007. </garnt>
<garnt> - Saying that, right. </garnt>
<connor> I watched that at like
2013 and that was just </connor>
<connor> that argument was still
going on until 2013. </connor>
<connor> And to some aspect that's
still going on today </connor>
<joey> obviously a lot lesser, but-
- I mean you can argue </joey>
<joey> that we brought it back.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Well, how many anime do you know </joey>
<connor> that have had discussions like that </connor>
<connor> where it's brought up
time and it's so decisive. </connor>
<garnt> - I think this is the only anime </garnt>
<connor> that's properly trashy. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, it's so trashy. </connor>
<joey> - It just keeps being brought up </joey>
<joey> 'cause I can, point shows
like say "Evangelion" </joey>
<connor> or something that, </connor>
<connor> we can discuss till the end of times. </connor>
<connor> And fans probably we'll discuss
that too at the end of time. </connor>
<joey> But in terms of shows that
I count as fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - School Days is just a show
that just doesn't refuse. </joey>
<connor> It's a fucking cockroach,
every time I step on it, </connor>
<connor> every time I think it's fucking died. </connor>
<connor> - It comes back.
- Two other people </connor>
<connor> come back and say, I like
the end of the story. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like shut the fuck up. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> Please, I thought I was past this point. </garnt>
<joey> - You'll never escape from it, dude. </joey>
<joey> That's that's the beauty of School Days </joey>
<joey> - It's 2020, oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - I love how this was just
supposed to be an origin story </connor>
<joey> in terms of the downfall of anime. </joey>
<joey> - It's just the absolute, </joey>
<joey> roasting of my 10 out of 10 opinion. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a Brazzers of anime, </joey>
<joey> that's basically what it is. </joey>
<joey> Imagine if a Brazzers had a good ending </joey>
<connor> we probably all be
arguing about it, right? </connor>
<connor> That's the equivalent of it. </connor>
<connor> It's not, it's fucking shit. </connor>
<connor> God, so heated about it. </connor>
<connor> It gives like a visceral reaction </connor>
<connor> to everyone who dislikes it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This guy's just living it out. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just looking forward
to the giant discussion. </joey>
<connor> This is gonna cause in the sub Reddit. </connor>
<joey> This is gonna be a whole thread again. </joey>
<joey> This is gonna come out. </joey>
<connor> - I'm interested to see what you, </connor>
<connor> the viewers if you have seen School Days </connor>
<connor> think of it and if you're wrong </connor>
<connor> on your thoughts of "School Days." </connor>
<joey> (laughing lightly) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there anything else we
can talk about other than- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's a good
place to end it for today? </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like I just took
the wind out of my sails. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how I can possibly be calm </joey>
<connor> about anything else today. </connor>
<joey> (laughing softly) </joey>
<joey> - But you do have something
important to talk about. </joey>
<joey> - We do have something to talk about. </joey>
<connor> We've actually started
the Trash Taste patron </connor>
<connor> as you can see, </connor>
<connor> the production value is
quite high for this podcast </connor>
<garnt> and we have editors helping us and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a whole system that we have </garnt>
<garnt> and sadly it doesn't fund it's self- </garnt>
<joey> - It cost a lot of money to run. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically, I just
wanna talk about, because </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like when we
were making this podcast </garnt>
<garnt> we didn't wanna settle for
cheap production values, right. </garnt>
<connor> - We wanted this to be, </connor>
<connor> comparable to any other
high budget podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, but like, </garnt>
<connor> to us, this was a passion project. </connor>
<connor> We've put quite a lot of
our own savings into this. </connor>
<connor> That's an understatement.
- It's like super expensive. </connor>
<connor> (laughing lightly) </connor>
<connor> - Like several thousand
dollars to making this </connor>
<connor> and plus, we are renting
out a studio, in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - A lot of time, a lot of money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, near Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> So right now, not to say that we, </joey>
<connor> all three of us are pretty well off. </connor>
<connor> - We're probably fine (laugh). </connor>
<connor> - We're probably fine. </connor>
<joey> We just don't want our passion project </joey>
<joey> to be bleeding money,
which right now it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So any help that </joey>
<connor> you can give to help us just to </connor>
<connor> go even 'cause that's my goal. </connor>
<connor> If I can just do this and not have </connor>
<connor> to worry about-
- to worry about losing money. </connor>
<connor> - Like just constantly losing money </connor>
<connor> and then I would be more comfortable </connor>
<garnt> and I would just be happy. </garnt>
<joey> - And hopefully with
your guys' support too, </joey>
<joey> like we'll be able to evolve this podcast </joey>
<joey> into like bigger and better
things in the near future. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and if you want
us to stand the viewer </joey>
<joey> who doesn't care about patron, </joey>
<joey> anything, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> Nothing will change to your Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna be exact same way. </joey>
<joey> You get everything, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> The patrons don't get anything. </joey>
<joey> We're not gonna pay wall anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- And please, again, </joey>
<garnt> we'll be fine financially </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't support
it, it's totally fine. </garnt>
<joey> It's purely optional.
- Purely optional. </joey>
<joey> - If you like the podcasts.
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And is that, what else
do we have to discuss? </connor>
<connor> Anything else we need to
shout out or anything? </connor>
<joey> - Follow us on Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - We have Twitter, yeah.

<garnt> I'm really hoping by
the time this comes out, </garnt>

<connor> I'm sure we're gonna have
an answer in the description </connor>
<garnt> whether this would be in Spotify. </garnt>
