<joey> - So Connor was like </joey>
<joey> it's 20 minutes home </joey>
<connor> on a comfy taxi.
- It's quicker, it's good. </connor>
<connor> - So then we get in the
taxi, taxi's driving fine </connor>
<joey> and then just some random
police officer just walks out </joey>
<joey> onto the street and kind of flags us down. </joey>
<connor> - Four policemen surround
this poor old man. </connor>
<joey> - And I ask the taxi
driver is something wrong? </joey>
<joey> And he's like ha ha I was speeding. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> (gentle music) </joey>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host once again Garnt </garnt>
<connor> and with me are the boys. </connor>
<connor> - That's us.
- As per usual. </connor>
<connor> - Yep. </connor>
<garnt> - How are you boys doing? </garnt>
<connor> - Good it's the first week we've skipped </connor>
<connor> of recording on Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it felt weird.
- Mm hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - It felt weird because
normally we record on Tuesdays, </garnt>
<garnt> people have probably figured this out. </garnt>
<connor> - Hmm. </connor>
<connor> - Some people have figured out the entire </connor>
<garnt> Trash Taste schedule.
- I think we've mentioned it </garnt>
<garnt> in passing.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - On what we think is a passing comment </connor>
<joey> people like remember. </joey>
<joey> - I remember I got a tweet as well, </joey>
<joey> I was randomly checking Twitter </joey>
<connor> like right before we're about to start </connor>
<connor> and someone tweeted at me saying like, </connor>
<connor> what are you gonna talk
about today Joey? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm just like (joey hyperventilating) </connor>
<garnt> where are you (laughing) your watching me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and people figured
out the recording order </garnt>
<garnt> as opposed to the airing order as well. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) There's probably
like a watch order, </garnt>
<garnt> the official Trash Taste watch order </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere on Reddit I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah because some of them
get mixed around right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause of sponsors and whatnot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But in general you could figure out </connor>
<connor> based on who's sitting where. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally.
- In general. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unfortunately Garnt doesn't
have a guest today with him. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that's how you can tell. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm a little sad about that
Garnt, I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<joey> - No this is my second podcast
in a row without guests. </joey>
<joey> - 2021 is different. </joey>
<joey> - It feels good, it feels
like a weight's been lifted </joey>
<joey> off my shoulder you know. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) Wow. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Just suddenly calling
all our guests weights. </joey>
<joey> - No I'm just here I just
got the space by myself </joey>
<garnt> on the table and it's just good, </garnt>
<garnt> it's good to be on the
hosting side. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Obviously you're lucky right, </connor>
<connor> that you weren't fucking
hosting with Chris </connor>
<connor> 'cause he kept making me down things </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
as I was sitting next to him, </connor>
<connor> he was like go on, go on, drink it, go on. </connor>
<garnt> - To be fair you're a
pussy drinking that sacket. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I would make you down it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I would have done the exact same. </joey>
<connor> - That sacket tastes like shit </connor>
<joey> and I'm not gonna be
forced to consume something </joey>
<joey> that tastes like shit. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Unless it's for a challenge
and I lose then it's my fault. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - So how are you enjoying
your Christmas holiday boys? </garnt>
<connor> - Well that's from we're
recording this right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah that's when
we're recording this. </garnt>
<joey> - Preface we're recording this
during the Christmas holiday. </joey>
<joey> (mumbling) </joey>
<joey> We've had our Christmas episodes </joey>
<garnt> but we are enjoying our
Christmas holidays right now </garnt>
<garnt> even though we're still
technically working. </garnt>
<garnt> - I took two days off and
then I was like right. </garnt>
<connor> - A whole two days. </connor>
<connor> - Back to it then, back to YouTube. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Even like going one day without YouTube, </connor>
<joey> I'm like fuck I wanna do something, </joey>
<joey> fuck I wanna make something, </joey>
<joey> I wanna entertain, I wanna be a clown </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - You're a clown every
day it's all right man. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty some deep insecurity </joey>
<joey> that happened during my childhood. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That makes me strive to wanna entertain. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was nice, it was fun. </connor>
<connor> I think the difference between </connor>
<connor> a holiday that is everyone's holiday. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Mm. </connor>
<connor> - And one that you set for yourself </connor>
<connor> is that when it's like a national holiday, </connor>
<connor> you're like well fuck I have to. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You're like obligated. </joey>
<joey> - But then sometimes your
head space isn't in this, </joey>
<joey> you're like man I kinda
wanna take a vacation </joey>
<connor> but like I don't want to but
then if you do it yourself, </connor>
<connor> you hype yourself up for it. </connor>
<connor> You're like I'm taking this time off. </connor>
<connor> No one's gonna tell me what to do </connor>
<connor> but on Christmas you're like, </connor>
<connor> fuck I kinda wanna like make
a video, wanna fuck around. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know what it is
about the Christmas holidays, </garnt>
<connor> Well I've always ended up working </connor>
<connor> during the Christmas holidays. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah same. </connor>
<connor> - Because I've had my yearly videos </connor>
<connor> that probably won't happen this year </connor>
<connor> but that's mostly what I'm working on </connor>
<connor> during the Christmas holidays </connor>
<connor> and then I realized that as YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> you need to take a fucking break right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah we need some. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes we take breaks
during the weekdays right? </connor>
<connor> - Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. </connor>
<connor> - To us weekends don't technically exist </connor>
<connor> but I've found that taking breaks </connor>
<connor> on the weekends feels a lot better </connor>
<connor> than taking breaks in during the weekdays, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it just feels nice.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When you know that </connor>
<connor> everyone else in the country.
- Most. </connor>
<connor> - Is on a break as well, </connor>
<connor> well most people.
- Well except for Japan. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah except for Japan, </garnt>
<connor> where Christmas Day is
just a regular working day. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And also weekends are a
suggestion to stop working. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's none enforced. </garnt>
<joey> - Every holidays is just a suggestion </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- To stop working </joey>
<joey> let's be honest in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - It's crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - I went up to the north of Japan </connor>
<connor> for about three or four
days to go see Chris. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </connor>
<connor> - And that was really nice, </connor>
<joey> there's so much fucking snow this year. </joey>
<connor> - Did he make you drink shitty sacket? </connor>
<joey> - No he made me drink good sacket. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That's an oxymoron for Connor there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Also it was the first time ever </garnt>
<joey> I did a proper Japanese Christmas aka KFC. </joey>
<garnt> - How was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just KFC ain't it?
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's exactly what I thought man. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> Although it was kind of weird </garnt>
<garnt> because Chris had to
schedule it like or book it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Book KFC.
- Booking KFC. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah we had to book KFC. </garnt>
<garnt> - What has the world come to man? </garnt>
<garnt> - like two or three weeks in advance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's also weird you
not only have to book it </garnt>
<garnt> but you have to book like a day and time </garnt>
<garnt> to go and pick it up as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah I saw. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's like not only do you have to </garnt>
<garnt> come in on a certain
day to a certain store, </garnt>
<connor> but it's like come between a
2:00 to 3:00 pm time bracket. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And we went there
and there was just like </connor>
<connor> a group of about maybe
five or six families </connor>
<joey> just lining up to get
their Christmas chicken </joey>
<connor> from the Colonel. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather die than lineup for a KFC. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah,
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> we got a full bucket of like
just a bunch of chicken wings. </connor>
<connor> - As you do at KFC. </connor>
<connor> - But also at the bottom of the bucket </connor>
<connor> there was this kind of Christmas cake </connor>
<connor> or like Christmas pudding kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know 'cause I don't
think anyone had a slice of it </connor>
<connor> but it was at the bottom of the thing </connor>
<connor> and we're like oh that's a little weird </connor>
<garnt> that it's just been sitting
underneath this like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Greasy chicken.
- Greasy fucking chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's not where you'd
wanna put a cake man. </garnt>
<garnt> - No it was the last
thing we were expecting </garnt>
<garnt> at the bottom of the bucket </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
to be fair </garnt>
<joey> and it was like 5,000 yen for it </joey>
<joey> and it could feed maybe
about three or four people. </joey>
<garnt> - You paid 50 bucks </garnt>
<joey> for KFC on Christmas.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Three or four people.
- I mean I didn't Chris did. </joey>
<joey> - You could have had a
nice roast dinner for that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no we ordered all the food as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay good.
- But we were like </garnt>
<connor> just because it was the
first time for all of us. </connor>
<connor> We've never had a
Japanese Christmas before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So we're like you know
what fuck it, let's do it. </connor>
<garnt> And um wouldn't do it again to be honest, </garnt>
<joey> it's just KFC isn't it. </joey>
<garnt> - There you go wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is this
is I think the fourth year </garnt>
<garnt> that I've been in Asia
celebrating Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I gotta say you
don't really understand </garnt>
<joey> the entire hype behind
this the Christmas spirit </joey>
<joey> you know?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that was just a fucking meme. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a marketing point, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I didn't understand that until
I started spending Christmas </joey>
<joey> outside of where countries </joey>
<joey> that normally celebrate Christmas. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </joey>
<connor> - And you know you can do a lot of things </connor>
<connor> to make it feel Christmassy </connor>
<connor> but having spent a few
Christmases in Asia, </connor>
<connor> I kind of miss that Christmas spirit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah definitely felt that.
- Because there's a few things </connor>
<connor> you can put on the Christmas songs, </connor>
<connor> and you can put up the tree </connor>
<garnt> but there's just something missing. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't put my finger on it </garnt>
<garnt> but it just doesn't
feel fully Christmassy. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I get that.
- I think it just has to do </joey>
<joey> with the fact that at least in Japan </joey>
<connor> Christmas is not a family thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's like a romantic thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And also everyone's working. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah like I got a delivery </garnt>
<joey> as we were having our roast dinner </joey>
<connor> and it was like the
immersion breaking Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- That moment where. </connor>
<connor> - Simulation ruined.
- Yeah (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I had an Amazon package and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> this is not Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the door on
your red hat. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like I refuse to have this right now. </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
- Wine in hand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Christmas simulation over, </joey>
<joey> it was like that Rick and Morty episode </joey>
<garnt> where you're just trapped in </garnt>
<garnt> an alternate (laughing) reality. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To me Christmas is like going back </connor>
<connor> and reluctantly having
to talk to family members </connor>
<joey> about like oh I do YouTube </joey>
<joey> you know this is what I.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I get naked online sometimes you know. </connor>
<connor> - Like yes I make this much
per year thank you uncle </connor>
<joey> for asking me for the seventh time. </joey>
<joey> - You're investing right? </joey>
<joey> In a pension right? </joey>
<connor> Yes yes I am.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> It felt odd 'cause I felt like normally, </joey>
<connor> I didn't appreciate Christmas that much </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't realize that </connor>
<connor> there was a really good way
of like in my head at least, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is how I talk, </connor>
<connor> it was like this is the end of the year. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Now go and restart it.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And then build up to all of this again. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's not just Christmas </garnt>
<connor> it's that period between
Christmas and New Year's, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That is just like the blank period. </connor>
<connor> - We don't do anything. </connor>
<connor> - where it's just like what are the rules? </connor>
<connor> Nobody knows what's going on. </connor>
<connor> Are the buses running? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Are the trains running?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Are shops open? </connor>
<garnt> It's fucking anarchy,
and I love that period. </garnt>
<connor> - Google how long can
I have leftovers for? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> How many Christmas dinners can I eat? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah that was like living in England, </garnt>
<garnt> that was like one of my
favorite parts of the year. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm.
- It was just as you said, </garnt>
<garnt> like the reset of the year.
- Right right. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like the entire society </joey>
<garnt> kinda goes into cool down right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah exactly right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas here it's like </garnt>
<garnt> business as usual.
- It's just business as usual, </garnt>
<garnt> you go out.
- Like supermarkets </garnt>
<garnt> and convenience stores are open </garnt>
<joey> literally 24/7 even on New Year's Day. </joey>
<connor> - My mum won't shut up
about KFC Christmas to me, </connor>
<connor> she's fascinated by it.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> She's like I heard they have
KFC for Christmas is it true? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like yes they do mom. </connor>
<connor> She's like wow how crazy is that? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like yeah it's kinda weird. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> To be fair it is bizarre </connor>
<connor> when you think about it.
- Yeah it is weird. </connor>
<connor> - All the things that
Japan has no interest in </connor>
<connor> from like the West right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We bring our finest things they're like, </connor>
<joey> no no no none of that, none of that </joey>
<joey> and then suddenly the colonel rocks up </joey>
<joey> and he's like listen how
about, let me pitch you this. </joey>
<joey> - Y'all like grease? </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- How about. </joey>
<joey> Let me take this absolutely nothing </joey>
<joey> to do with Christmas food </joey>
<connor> and somehow make it a Christmas food. </connor>
<connor> Like oh my God, how
did they pull this off? </connor>
<connor> Like I'm sure someone knows
the history behind it, </connor>
<connor> but like to me even if you
explained to me how it was done, </connor>
<connor> how the KFC marketing department did this. </connor>
<joey> - I mean I explained it
to you last time right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but even then, it still
doesn't make sense to me. </connor>
<garnt> - I researched it and
it doesn't make sense. </garnt>
<connor> - It was like the marketing
heist of the century, </connor>
<connor> I swear to God.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I swear in Japan just
normal marketing things </connor>
<connor> they just don't care about. </connor>
<connor> There are just like
advertisements everywhere, </connor>
<connor> don't care about that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh there's a collaboration </connor>
<connor> where I can get my favorite character </connor>
<connor> poorly printed on a latte? </connor>
<connor> Oh well 100 bucks, hello. </connor>
<joey> That drives me insane dude.
- When you see it on paper </joey>
<joey> it just sounds like a
great Pretender episode. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- It is. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like how
do they pull this off? </joey>
<garnt> - This is like Heist 5 though.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> This is like the OVA episode man, </garnt>
<garnt> when they sell Christmas to the Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Literally like it is, it's bullshit. </connor>
<connor> It takes some Oceans 11 shit </connor>
<connor> with every marketing department </connor>
<connor> and like they do
collaborations with stuff. </connor>
<connor> So this is a really common
thing in Japan where </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They don't just market things normally, </connor>
<connor> you can't just have adverts. </connor>
<connor> It's like you have to
collaborate with businesses. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I went to the supermarket </connor>
<connor> and I saw like washing detergent. </connor>
<connor> It was like a Bungo Stray
Dogs collaborations. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah We got one with Levi on it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I was like
okay Levi that makes sense </joey>
<joey> but like some shows it's like Why? </joey>
<joey> Why does Bungo Stray
Dogs have a collaboration </joey>
<garnt> with washing detergent? </garnt>
<connor> - To be fair it works,
I'm a weeb, it works. </connor>
<garnt> I see Evan (inaudible) </garnt>
<garnt> I see Oscar's face
plastered on some coffee, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like.
- No, no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - I need that coffee man. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why I hate
it because to me right. </connor>
<connor> You don't go to a fine
dining like restaurant </connor>
<garnt> for example right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And they draw a fucking smiley face </connor>
<connor> on your hamburger.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> You'd be insulted, wouldn't you? </connor>
<connor> You'd be like, no, no,
no, no where's my steak? </connor>
<connor> Why is there a smiley on it?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> This is the way I see stuff </connor>
<connor> and like if you put characters on it </connor>
<connor> or you put these fucking smiley faces. </connor>
<connor> I hate it when Disneyland
does that by the way, </connor>
<connor> when they put fucking
smiley faces on your food. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) Is my food a
joke to you I wanna eat it, </connor>
<connor> fuck never mind I'm
gonna (inaudible speech). </connor>
<connor> But like to me you're making the product </connor>
<connor> seem more childish by putting stuff on it. </connor>
<connor> So when I see these collaborations, </connor>
<connor> like most of the time with like, </connor>
<connor> especially with the anime at the cafes, </connor>
<connor> I'm like this is all disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- You're selling me a $3 latte </connor>
<garnt> for 10 times the price. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm offended.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's very similar </garnt>
<garnt> to what they do in the
West with celebrities </garnt>
<connor> but like you know. </connor>
<connor> - You don't get like a
Kim Kardashian latte. </connor>
<connor> - Um didn't Travis Scott
just do like a fucking </connor>
<connor> - The McDonald's meal.
- A big collaboration </connor>
<connor> with McDonald's? </connor>
<connor> And wasn't that insanely </connor>
<garnt> successful as well?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah but wait okay first of all, </connor>
<connor> I'm near certain and
correct me if I'm wrong </connor>
<connor> they didn't plaster his face on it. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure they had
a specific menu that was </garnt>
<connor> the Travis Scott/McDonald's.
- Travis Scott meal </connor>
<joey> or what it was called. </joey>
<joey> - But it didn't have like his face on it. </joey>
<joey> I went to The Promise Never
land collaboration thing </joey>
<connor> and there was a cafe and you
could get one of the characters </connor>
<connor> of The Promised Never
land printed on your latte </connor>
<connor> and I thought okay fine. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's $10 by the way </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- when I had that. </joey>
<joey> Which would be fucking ridiculous </joey>
<joey> for a subpar latte.
- Yeah but with stuff </joey>
<connor> like that though.
- But. </connor>
<connor> - You have to understand that
the fans will pay any amount </connor>
<joey> of money for that one photo.
- Right. </joey>
<connor> So then I go to have it </connor>
<connor> and I go to drink it and
then as I drink this latte </connor>
<connor> like this film of like the plastic shit. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- That they printed it on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Goes in my mouth and
I'm like (throwing up) </connor>
<connor> like God it's disgusting, it's vile </connor>
<connor> and I don't wanna have to peel
shit off my coffee to eat it. </connor>
<connor> So I'm here scooping it out </connor>
<connor> ruining this picture they printed on it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I just ended up hating all of it, </connor>
<joey> I don't care how much of
a fan I am of something, </joey>
<joey> I don't want that shit
printed on my food or drink. </joey>
<joey> - Oh I mean that's kind of on you then </joey>
<joey> for going to that cafe right?
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like you could have easily
just gone to a Starbucks right? </joey>
<joey> - But the thing is if you go
to the exhibition or whatever, </joey>
<connor> you go to these things there
normally not that like, </connor>
<connor> there's like enough there
if you're a fan right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then you have to obliterary </connor>
<joey> go to the gift shop and
cafe 'cause you know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah of course.
- You have to </joey>
<joey> the gift shop sometimes
has some good stuff </joey>
<connor> but some stuff that I don't care about </connor>
<connor> like they're obsessed with
making coasters of characters. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not just the coasters,
I've noticed that as well </garnt>
<joey> because they're putting
Gacha into it as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's a blind box of coasters </joey>
<connor> yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So if you wanna collect the
character you actually like, </connor>
<connor> you gotta buy more shit right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta buy an extra meal. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that was exactly the same thing </connor>
<garnt> as when I went to the Fate Museum as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Scams man. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
Scams. </connor>
<connor> It's like being a kid all over again </connor>
<garnt> with the Happy Meal Toys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man I remember one time </garnt>
<garnt> Burger King were doing this collaboration </garnt>
<connor> with like SpongeBob toys and
I was like mum listen this is </connor>
<joey> the third Patrick.
- I need to go </joey>
<joey> destroy my body. </joey>
<joey> - This is the third
Patrick Star I've had mum </joey>
<connor> can you please go and
do like a Karen thing </connor>
<connor> and get me the other toy and she was like. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah my parents used
to do that all the time. </joey>
<connor> - She would always go up and ask </connor>
<joey> but sometimes they'd be like no. </joey>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I've never heard of someone saying no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - They're usually just like whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't get paid enough to find it. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
- Yeah exactly right. </garnt>
<connor> - And he's like, I don't
control the Gacha. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I just fucking give it
to you, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> I get paid $6 an hour,
ima just give it to you. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah I'm not a big fan
of the collaboration cafes, </connor>
<connor> I just feel like you don't really get </connor>
<connor> that good of an experience of the show. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like collaboration
cafes are a bit. </garnt>
<connor> - Shit.
- A bit tacky. </connor>
<connor> - Just say it just say shit, it's shit. </connor>
<connor> - It's shit, it's shit.
- Yes it's tacky. </connor>
<connor> I feel like most anime
cafes are like that. </connor>
<connor> I've never been to like an anime cafe </connor>
<garnt> and been impressed by it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like you go into this room </connor>
<connor> that's like a normal sized cafe </connor>
<connor> and you're like oh they've
just plastered paintings </connor>
<connor> of the characters and
the show's on the wall, </connor>
<connor> wow look at that.
- It's like they </connor>
<connor> don't even get creative with it. </connor>
<joey> Like I would say I've been to quite a few </joey>
<connor> because Aki likes to do videos on it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah </connor>
<connor> - I've only ever been to
two collaborative cafes </connor>
<connor> where I was just like I would go back </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's the Pokemon
cafe and the Kirby cafe </connor>
<connor> but that's just because </connor>
<connor> Nintendo has just so
much bigger of a budget. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That they can afford </connor>
<joey> to get a little more
creative with it right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah there's so many of them, </connor>
<connor> you go and watch a
YouTube video of someone </connor>
<connor> like go into a cafe and it's like, </connor>
<joey> you could see these
YouTubers desperately trying </joey>
<joey> to get like seven
minutes out of this cafe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </joey>
<joey> - At the end of the day it's just like </joey>
<connor> it's literally just paintings on a wall </connor>
<connor> and something.
- Yeah I went to </connor>
<connor> the Weathering With You cafe </connor>
<joey> and that shit was so fucking lame. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It causes the same formula every time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And if you come to Japan,
come to like one anime cafe </connor>
<connor> and then realize that that's
the experience for every cafe. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </joey>
<joey> - The way I see it is that you come once </joey>
<joey> as a tourist and you're like that was cool </joey>
<joey> and then you just don't go to any others </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because they're all the same. </joey>
<garnt> - Which is, go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no I was gonna say like also </garnt>
<joey> how they get you with
all these anime cafes </joey>
<connor> is that they're only open for
limited amounts of time right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they wouldn't fucking make money </connor>
<connor> if they've shut down.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah there's a sense of
urgency where it's like, </connor>
<connor> oh The Promised Never land cafe
is only open for two weeks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I want Promised
Never land let's go. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) And then you go
and you get disappointed </connor>
<connor> and before you can file
a complaint it's gone. </connor>
<garnt> - The food was vile as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh they usually are.
- Of course it is </garnt>
<garnt> it's all microwave food or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Kirby cafe though
had some really good food. </garnt>
<connor> I was actually like </connor>
<joey> wow I would actually go back.
- I've never had someone </joey>
<joey> be like you must try this souffle, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You must go to the square
Innings collaboration cafe </joey>
<connor> for the best, it's like no. </connor>
<garnt> - Listen 'Cause it's not
like going to the JoJo bar, </garnt>
<garnt> where there was obviously
like a fan of JoJo, </garnt>
<connor> who would personalize these
cocktails and these drinks. </connor>
<joey> It's a bunch of corporate.
- It's all sponsored. </joey>
<joey> - It's all corporate
businessmen stamping like, </joey>
<connor> hmm yes collaboration.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What can we do? </connor>
<connor> Coasters let's print
the character on a latte </connor>
<garnt> and put some anime posters up.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then sell a bunch of clear files. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
- I realized we're probably </connor>
<garnt> like breaking so many dreams right now </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) by explaining
how shit they are. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Listen if you come
here on like a visiting, </connor>
<joey> you'll probably find it interesting </joey>
<joey> if there's a show you really like </joey>
<joey> but in general.
- But 90% of them </joey>
<garnt> are really lame.
- They're really underwhelming </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like the cafe is
always the lowest point </garnt>
<connor> to any big anime event
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I went to the Fate Cafe </connor>
<connor> but that was The Fate Cafe
- Of course you did. </connor>
<joey> - In The Fate Museum and the museum, </joey>
<joey> the exhibition actually
was fucking awesome. </joey>
<joey> - Yow yeah, yeah, yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause you got to see </joey>
<joey> the entire fucking
history of this franchise. </joey>
<garnt> Like of not just Fate but
the entire Type-Moon Universe </garnt>
<joey> and everything like
that and the Nasuverse. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah see that's cool if it's like, </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I went to the Konasuba Cafe. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that was in par
with the Konasuba movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you can only go to this cafe </garnt>
<garnt> if you bought tickets to the movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that was like oh okay you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a little bonus thing </garnt>
<garnt> but I wouldn't go all
the way to central Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) to go to a
fucking Konasuba Cafe. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no.
- No way. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's just not worth it. </joey>
<joey> - I definitely wouldn't recommend
going to any pop-up cafes. </joey>
<garnt> If something's limited-time,
- No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then they have not put effort into that. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no.
- Dude the best cafe I went to </connor>
<connor> is actually the one I made a video on, </connor>
<connor> which is like the 3D Latte Art. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That cafe is so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - And way to suck your own dick there. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah wow.
Just like ima say that </garnt>
<connor> you know in a good cafe
I bet you it's the one </connor>
<garnt> that I made a video on.
- Well no, (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I wouldn't make a video on it </joey>
<connor> if I didn't think it was good right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah again that's like
a permanent cafe right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that's bad 'cause
you can literally, </connor>
<joey> the best part about that thing </joey>
<connor> is that you can take in
like anything that you want </connor>
<connor> and you're like make it 3D. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like they'll find a way to do it, </connor>
<connor> it's so fucking cool.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also that guy on Twitter shit
posts like crazy, the owner </connor>
<connor> he's so good, so funny.
- Yeah that's the thing </connor>
<joey> it's like again the reason
why I like the Pokemon Cafe </joey>
<garnt> and the Kirby Cafe so good
is because they're permanent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah they're always there right? </garnt>
<connor> - So every season they're like </connor>
<connor> oh we can bring out something </connor>
<connor> a little bit more experimental, </connor>
<joey> if it doesn't work take it out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah Nintendo are
really good at doing like, </connor>
<connor> I mean have you seen the new theme park </connor>
<garnt> they're releasing in Osaka? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it's opening February right? </connor>
<connor> - My God, I saw a picture
of that and I thought, </connor>
<joey> wow Lego land's really
improved, hasn't it? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I didn't think
it was real at first. </garnt>
<connor> - I usually hate amusement parks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no I'm going. </connor>
<joey> - But this the first time
I'm like yeah I'm going. </joey>
<connor> - Well because you wanna go now, </connor>
<connor> before it opens up to tourists. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it's gonna be hell. </connor>
<connor> - But knowing Japan </connor>
<garnt> it's gonna be another fucking
lottery to get those tickets. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh.
- Oh God. </connor>
<joey> - And I fucking hate that,
have we talked about that? </joey>
<garnt> - No I don't think
we've talked about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I watched the video
of what's the guy's name? </garnt>
<connor> Shigeru Miyamoto. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like giving a tour of it </connor>
<connor> and you get like a bracelet </connor>
<connor> that you can like hit shit with </connor>
<connor> and like there's like keys and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Dude it looks badass. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I felt like a ten year old </connor>
<connor> watching him like talk
about it, I'm like yow. </connor>
<joey> - I saw a Japanese YouTuber </joey>
<connor> who got like first
access ever as a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - It's Hikakin the Japanese YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah of course Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - But he's been sponsored by
USJ and Nintendo in the past. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Well he's literally like
Japan's like YouTuber, </connor>
<joey> Oh Hikakin. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause was one time I had a policeman </joey>
<joey> that was asking me like What do you do? </joey>
<joey> And I was like YouTuber </joey>
<joey> and he was like oh, like Hikakin? </joey>
<joey> - It's like no not like Hikakin. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like yeah Hikakin man, </connor>
<joey> like yeah dude, yeah whatever. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like Hikakin and YouTube
are like synonymous, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah pretty much. </joey>
<garnt> - We've never talked about </garnt>
<garnt> the lottery system.
- The lottery system. </garnt>
<garnt> So this is how you get
tickets in Japan basically. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Would you wanna explain it? </connor>
<connor> - This is better than scalping. </connor>
<joey> - Scalping?
- Scalping? </joey>
<joey> - Scalping is people who
buy a shit-ton of things. </joey>
<connor> - And then just jack up the prices. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh I mean no people do that too here. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's in theory to stop
that from happening right? </garnt>
<joey> - Right but like for example
when the Olympics for example, </joey>
<joey> we don't know if that's
gonna be happening next year. </joey>
<connor> - They've already
announced that it will be. </connor>
<connor> I reckon it will happen no matter what </connor>
<connor> but it'll be interesting
to see how they'll do it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah exactly. </connor>
<joey> But like with the Olympics
for example, it's so dumb. </joey>
<joey> So they do a lottery that you enter </joey>
<joey> and it's like a lottery to get
a certain amount of tickets. </joey>
<connor> So this is how we did it. </connor>
<joey> So like when I went to
the Persona 5 concert. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It was a lottery system </joey>
<joey> but it was really weird
because it was like </joey>
<joey> you go into the lottery to get
a certain number of tickets </joey>
<joey> and they're different lotteries. </joey>
<joey> So it's like if you wanna
go in just by yourself, </joey>
<joey> you enter the lottery to get one ticket </joey>
<joey> but there's another
lottery to get two tickets </joey>
<joey> or three tickets or four tickets </joey>
<joey> and just because you
enter into one of them, </joey>
<joey> it's not guaranteed that
you gonna get those tickets. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then what it is,
is that you might think, </joey>
<joey> oh okay so if you win the lottery </joey>
<joey> then you just get the tickets right? </joey>
<joey> No you get the right to
purchase the tickets. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Japan have figured out a way </garnt>
<garnt> to Gachafy every process possible man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I mean I also
saw that you could get </connor>
<connor> some of the tickets but you could only </connor>
<connor> be entered into some of them </connor>
<connor> if you bought like a Panasonic device. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So they were like giving
away some of the tickets to, </joey>
<joey> and I was like What the fuck, </joey>
<joey> this is a fucking mess.
- And also the shitty thing </joey>
<joey> as well is that like say
you enter the lottery </joey>
<connor> to get four tickets right? </connor>
<connor> But you're not sure if
you're gonna get it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you want to enter multiple
times but here's the kicker. </connor>
<connor> Say you win twice right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In that four ticket lottery, </connor>
<connor> you're forced to pay
for those eight tickets. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) You can't
back out of that shit. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like you're actually forced, </joey>
<joey> even if it's only four
people that you're going with </joey>
<joey> and you just did another
lottery for backup, </joey>
<joey> you have to buy eight tickets. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just doesn't make sense to me. </garnt>
<joey> - It just doesn't make sense. </joey>
<joey> - I mean I understand
in theory why they do it </joey>
<garnt> but I feel like this is like trying </garnt>
<garnt> to put out a fire with cooking oil, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - It's just the most roundabout bullshit, </joey>
<joey> time consuming way to do
it and I guarantee you, </joey>
<joey> Nintendo Line is gonna do the same thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Probably. </connor>
<connor> I mean Nintendo haven't got
the best rep at the moment. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> They've been like fucking everything up. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Thanks.
- I can't believe that man. </connor>
<joey> - Nintendo and DMCA are
like that right now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But the stuff with the smash tournament, </connor>
<connor> did you see that as well? </connor>
<connor> That was a while back though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No. </connor>
<joey> - Did you not see that? </joey>
<connor> - No I didn't see that.
- Basically they like just </connor>
<connor> cease and desisted a big tournament </connor>
<connor> that'd been going on for a while, </connor>
<connor> and everyone was like the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Obviously the net code of
the Switch Smash Brothers </connor>
<connor> is pretty garbage. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So people fan-modded
their own version of it </connor>
<garnt> that's much better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm.
- Oh okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's called
like Slippi or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they didn't allow that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because they were gonna use that one. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how it's called Slippi. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because it actually runs smoothly </joey>
<joey> 'cause Nintendo online sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And always has sucked </joey>
<joey> and the fact that they pay
for it is kind of a joke. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you don't really
get anything out of it, </joey>
<joey> like it's awful, it's so bad. </joey>
<joey> Like I love Nintendo but
goddamn does there online suck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah they really need to fix that shit. </joey>
<joey> - And so they cease desisted them </joey>
<joey> and then they were also sponsoring </joey>
<connor> a Splatoon tournament right?. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Guess what the prize was for the, </connor>
<connor> So they were giving the prize, </connor>
<connor> it was like a Nintendo sanctioned event. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They're giving the top prize </connor>
<connor> for a team of five versus five </connor>
<garnt> was a $25 Nintendo eShop gift card. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they canceled the event </garnt>
<joey> 'cause one of the teams had
something like free Smash </joey>
<joey> or something, </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
or like had something </joey>
<joey> along the lines of Nintendo. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- My God. </joey>
<connor> - Like for solidarity with
the Smash bros believe me. </connor>
<joey> - I love how the top prize you
can't even pay for Splatoon. </joey>
<connor> - You can't even split that shit. </connor>
<joey> - you can't even pay for the game </joey>
<joey> used in the fucking tournament is. </joey>
<joey> - It's just funny because it's like </joey>
<connor> for some reason Nintendo </connor>
<connor> just wants their fucking IP's to die. </connor>
<garnt> Like I don't get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude Riot Games is sweating man, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like oh
there's a new competitor </garnt>
<garnt> in e-sports scene now. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's just wild to me </connor>
<garnt> 'cause you just see like
the complete difference, </garnt>
<garnt> again like you said Riot right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you have the fucking, What is it? </garnt>
<garnt> The Baron Red Bull Power Play. </garnt>
<connor> - The Red Bull Baron Power Play. </connor>
<joey> - The Mercedes Drive to Victory, </joey>
<joey> Like they're fully embracing
like becoming sports </joey>
<garnt> and Nintendo's like none of that. </garnt>
<connor> - The State Farm Analyst Desk. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> God I remember watching worlds this year. </garnt>
<connor> - It was so funny.
- And it was so weird, </connor>
<joey> just seeing literally
everything monetized. </joey>
<connor> - It's literally like
watching the American. </connor>
<connor> - I say that drinking my
G-Fuel out of my G-Fuel cap. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Thank you G-Fuel for
sponsoring Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> then we had a nice header. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it is funny how it's
become like American football, </connor>
<connor> where like every single part
of the game is sponsored. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then again you have
the complete opposite right? </joey>
<joey> Nintendo's like yeah we
don't wanna put any of this </joey>
<joey> 'cause Nintendo could make money off it </joey>
<joey> if they really wanted to. They
wanna be in charge of this </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But they've showed no interest in it. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> I mean they're probably already
making enough as is right? </joey>
<joey> - That's the Japanese mindset, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> They're like we've made enough
doing it the way we like, </connor>
<connor> We don't want to make more money. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Which is so odd for a business to say, </connor>
<connor> because I think what was it? </connor>
<garnt> Like last year </garnt>
<connor> Nintendo was the most
cash-rich company in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is insane. </connor>
<connor> - I think that something is slightly </connor>
<connor> wrong with that statement. </connor>
<garnt> it's not that they don't
wanna make more money, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause from my experience
working with Japanese companies, </garnt>
<garnt> they wanna make as much money as possible </garnt>
<garnt> but they only wanna make
as much money as possible </garnt>
<joey> using the methods </joey>
<garnt> that they like.
- They like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not that they
don't wanna make money, </garnt>
<garnt> it's that they don't know how
to make money in other ways. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughing) Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Because they're like esports? </joey>
<joey> What is esports? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's where if
you ask someone like, </joey>
<joey> you know if you asked me </joey>
<connor> Connor you can make $10 guaranteed </connor>
<joey> or Connor you can make 100 dollars </joey>
<joey> by you know pushing yourself
and being a little crazy </joey>
<joey> and it might go horribly wrong </joey>
<joey> of course every time I'm gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> 100 bucks let's do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course but. </joey>
<joey> - But the Japanese companies
don't see it that way, </joey>
<connor> they see that's unnecessary risk. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Japaneses companies
like yeah there's one person </joey>
<garnt> in the company that wants to get creative </garnt>
<garnt> but he has to ask 60 other people for yes. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
- Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - And that might take a while. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly and by the time
they always say yeah, </joey>
<connor> a new trend's come out,
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- I get it, </connor>
<connor> because if you are the
head of these companies, </connor>
<connor> you don't wanna make 100 odd
people lose their job right? </connor>
<connor> So you go with the safe route, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes the safe route can just lead </connor>
<connor> to being stagnated.
- Yeah but also </connor>
<joey> it's like how detrimental could it be </joey>
<connor> if one thing doesn't work out right? </connor>
<connor> Like again Nintendo is the most </connor>
<connor> cash-rich company in Japan right? </connor>
<joey> It's like how much do they have to lose? </joey>
<connor> - It sucks 'cause everyone
like wants Nintendo to just do. </connor>
<joey> - Get their shit together. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause everyone fucking loves it, </joey>
<garnt> everyone wants to fucking
see a Nintendo game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone's cheering for Nintendo, </garnt>
<garnt> just to do the right thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally the opposite of EA, </garnt>
<garnt> where everyone just wants
EA to keep fucking up </garnt>
<garnt> and keep fucking up
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> to the point where laws have to be made </connor>
<connor> but with Nintendo everyone
just wants to see. </connor>
<connor> You know you have those typical shows </connor>
<connor> where you know the brother
is addicted to drugs </connor>
<connor> and the whole family is super nice </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
and it's like come on just, </connor>
<connor> just please stop, just come on </connor>
<connor> get back on your feet man come on. </connor>
<connor> That's the sweet Nintendo. </connor>
<connor> It's like how many chances
do we have to give you? </connor>
<connor> how many rehabs do we
need to put you through </connor>
<connor> to see you get back on track goddammit? </connor>
<joey> - Especially after all the fucking W's </joey>
<connor> that they will taking in
these last couple of years. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah they were killing it. </connor>
<connor> - They were just like killing every E3, </connor>
<connor> everyone was like yep Nintendo King. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck everybody else and
now they're just like, </connor>
<connor> We haven't had an L in awhile </connor>
<joey> let's give out a couple of L's. </joey>
<joey> - People fucking lost their shit </joey>
<joey> when they brought out literal cardboard. </joey>
<connor> (laughing)
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like this is a company
that can release cardboard </connor>
<connor> and we'll eat it up. </connor>
<connor> This is how much.
- The Nintendo Labo right. </connor>
<connor> - We want them to get W. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) I completely
forgot about that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like okay at the end of the day, </connor>
<garnt> they do like the coolest
fucking shit, no other company. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nintendo are just doing
their own thing man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like I played
Ring Fit and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> What kinda crack head
came up with this idea </garnt>
<joey> to like just fucking exercise with a ring </joey>
<joey> and like it works
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's good.
- And it's fun. </joey>
<garnt> like who came up with this shit? </garnt>
<garnt> This is insane, You would never see this </garnt>
<connor> from any other company. </connor>
<garnt> - It seems like creatively </garnt>
<connor> they will take any fucking risks possible. </connor>
<connor> - It's nuts yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like on a business
sense they're like, </connor>
<connor> No, no we do.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not do business here. </connor>
<garnt> We only make things
business is not allowed. </garnt>

<connor> - I think the creative, </connor>
<connor> they obviously trust their
creative people at Nintendo </connor>
<connor> and they obviously let
them do the crazy ideas. </connor>
<connor> Like they released the Mario Kart AR, </connor>
<garnt> did you see that? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You basically get your own RC cars </garnt>
<garnt> with cameras in them that connect to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no I saw that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is again another crazy fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucking cool.
- It's so cool. </garnt>
<garnt> 99% of people can't do this </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I don't have the living room space. </joey>
<connor> I actually do but I mean, </connor>
<joey> most people.
- You can't be both. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah also the thought of
having to put a track down </connor>
<joey> and then clean it up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah exactly.
- You know. </connor>
<connor> - I mean you know just the whole concept </connor>
<garnt> of Mario Maker right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah that's fucking awesome. </connor>
<joey> - Clearly they're embracing
their fans' creative side. </joey>
<connor> - God I love watching Mario
Maker videos on YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's fucking cool.
- They were so fun. </joey>
<joey> - But at the same time they're like, </joey>
<joey> Mario Party Online no never heard of that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh!
- Oh. </joey>
<connor> - That is the biggest missed
opportunity they've ever done. </connor>
<garnt> - You just said three magical words </garnt>
<garnt> that I didn't think I needed to hear </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Why have I never thought of this before? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like that meme of like </joey>
<garnt> whisper the three sexiest
words into my ear. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Mario Party Online. </connor>
<connor> - I can't believe they
released Super Mario Party </connor>
<connor> in 2018 was it?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it didn't have online play </connor>
<connor> and had like four maps
and they were shit sorry. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was so disappointed </joey>
<joey> 'cause I fucking love Mario Party. </joey>
<joey> - I mean Mario Party is still good LAN </joey>
<joey> but you know online
would be fucking amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if you
guys play Mario Party but. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you feel that some part </joey>
<garnt> of the Mario Party experiences
being next to each other </garnt>
<connor> and just sharing with people?
- No I get that. </connor>
<garnt> - But I would like the option especially. </garnt>
<joey> - To play online. </joey>
<joey> - For streaming right? </joey>
<connor> If I need to you got a better option. </connor>
<connor> - But also it's the same
thing with Smash right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah playing Smash
LAN next to your friends </connor>
<connor> and shitting on them IRL is fun as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But we very quickly found out </connor>
<connor> that online is also just as fun. </connor>
<connor> - Especially on like a discord call, </connor>
<joey> like that shit's fun as fuck.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's just sad, I feel like
they just hate happiness </joey>
<joey> sometimes Nintendo. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I thought when Super
Mario Party released, </joey>
<joey> it's giving way too much detail, </joey>
<joey> it had like four maps and they
were all mid and I was like, </joey>
<joey> Okay well they'll release new ones right? </joey>
<joey> They'll update it. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
They'll have DLC right? </joey>
<joey> - What a fucking lie it was.
- Yeah so that never happened. </joey>
<joey> Fuck dude I'm still sad about that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I know. </joey>
<connor> - God that game could
have been something good. </connor>
<joey> - I'm always just hoping next Mario Party </joey>
<joey> is the one that's gonna be online. </joey>
<garnt> - The problem with it is
everyone else are playing chess </garnt>
<joey> and they're just playing
fucking hungry hippos </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
or something like that </joey>
<joey> and sometimes it's fucking fun as fuck </joey>
<joey> but other times you're just like, </joey>
<joey> can you just go back to
like a little bit of chess? </joey>
<connor> You know?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Play by the rules just
a little bit you know? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't get it because you know, </connor>
<connor> we live in Japan and
they developed the games. </connor>
<connor> I do not know of any Japanese people </connor>
<connor> who go around to each other's houses. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - You never hear of
Japanese people meeting </connor>
<joey> in the other people's houses. </joey>
<joey> It's always at an
Izakaya or another place. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Maybe it's cause you </joey>
<joey> don't have that many friends.
- Yeah maybe it's just because </joey>
<connor> you don't have that many Japanese friends. </connor>
<connor> - Oh the ones I do have never do that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I do that with my Japanese friends. </connor>
<joey> - Do you actually? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I stand corrected. </joey>
<joey> - I mean obviously not this year but. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but nowhere near as often </joey>
<connor> as like going out to eat in an Izakaya. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah of course but like
there's been a lot of cases </joey>
<joey> where I would go out to eat </joey>
<joey> and then we would go
back to someone's place. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah right but it's like. </connor>
<connor> I feel like in the West right? </connor>
<connor> We are like 90% of the time, </connor>
<connor> it's like meet up at each
other's house get a few drinks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah because it's quite
expensive to eat out in the West. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas here it's just as cheap. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's like the
opposite where it's like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like for a country
that should value what seems </connor>
<connor> to be like online play more. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - For some reason they don't include it. </connor>
<garnt> - No because they don't need
more reasons to stay at home, </garnt>
<connor> that's already a big
enough problem as it is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Are you saying that.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Nintendo is colluding
with the government, </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> to get all the Japanese people to fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Nintendo is like we're
saving this generation </joey>
<joey> from more hikikomoris that we'll birth. </joey>
<connor> - What if Mario Party is Japanese Twister. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> They're like this is
how we get them to fuck. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Why is Meilyne's face </connor>
<connor> look like I said something
super racist there? </connor>
<joey> - Mario Party and chill. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - They don't have Netflix and chill. </connor>
<connor> - They'd rather create the next fucking </connor>
<connor> Tron VR sex machine toy
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> than they would Mario Party
online let's be honest guys. </garnt>
<joey> - What was the thing we were
talking about before again? </joey>
<garnt> It was the Tenga.
- The Tenga. </garnt>
<garnt> - That operates with VR porn. </garnt>
<connor> - Does it?
- Yeah have you seen that? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - To explain, I can't
believe I'm explaining Tenga. </joey>
<garnt> - Tenga.
- So Tenga is just like </garnt>
<garnt> an own-a-hole </garnt>
<joey> or like a flashlight.
- Flashlight. </joey>
<joey> A flashlight basically,
you stick your penis in it. </joey>
<garnt> - But it's branded so it
doesn't look like a flashlight. </garnt>
<connor> - No it's like really way too
overly stylish flashlight. </connor>
<connor> - It's a classy. </connor>
<connor> - Looks like a deodorant bottle. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like a classy pocket pussy, </connor>
<connor> that's what it is.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Can't believe you called it that. </connor>
<joey> - So gross.
- First class pocket pussy. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I hate that word, pocket pussy. </joey>
<joey> I feel so wrong saying.
- Stop saying it. </joey>
<garnt> - That's why they called it a Tenga right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah just call it a Tenga. </connor>
<connor> But basically Tenga just came
out with this thing where </connor>
<connor> it's machine operated with like AI in it </connor>
<garnt> and it works in tandem with VR porn. </garnt>
<garnt> So you'd put this thing on your willy </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't have to touch it at all. </garnt>
<garnt> You start the VR porn
and the thing will move </garnt>
<connor> in time with what you're
seeing on the VR porn. </connor>
<connor> - That's fucked.
- Jesus Christ man. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want that, that's scary. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want that.
- And I'm just like </connor>
<connor> go to a brothel bro. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> That's the first thing I think, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like just at that point </garnt>
<garnt> just go get laid by a real person please. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're probably paying
more for that tech </garnt>
<connor> than one session at a brothel. </connor>
<connor> - I do you feel like going to a brothel </connor>
<connor> is a bit different I think.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> You gotta be the kind
of person who's like, </connor>
<connor> all right ima go to a brothel. </connor>
<connor> I get it you know, if
you want sex that badly </connor>
<connor> but you're too shameful </connor>
<connor> to go to a brothel I get it.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna pay like
I don't know 20 grand, </connor>
<connor> then it's in your house right?
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Just never have visitors over. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - They'd be like what is
that like medieval device </connor>
<joey> you have in the corner?
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> Oh that's my sex machine. </joey>
<joey> - No dude I saw like a video of it, </joey>
<joey> it straight up looks
like a torture device, </joey>
<connor> if you don't know what it is.
- I'm good, I'm good. </connor>
<connor> I saw that on the news
they had a thing here, </connor>
<connor> where the government was
commissioning AI companies </connor>
<connor> to like match people together </connor>
<connor> because the birth rate
is declining so low, </connor>
<connor> but then I also feel like.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Now that's going into
like dystopian worlds now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah but then I can't.
- That's some JoJo. </connor>
<garnt> - You can't have a world that exists </garnt>
<garnt> where we're AI-matching each other </garnt>
<connor> but then also having sex machines </connor>
<connor> that cater for your every need. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause why would I sign up </connor>
<connor> to the AI matchmaking service?
- Like 50 Shades of Gray </connor>
<garnt> in like 2050.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like this guy just brings </garnt>
<connor> out his VR sex machine.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Rolls it in on a trolley.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Why would I sign up
for an AI matchmaking. </connor>
<connor> - Which Tanga would you like? </connor>
<connor> - He's not romancing a real girl, </connor>
<garnt> he's romancing an anime girl. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Why would I need to
sign up for AI matchmaking </connor>
<connor> when I have the like Cum
tron 7,000 in my office, </connor>
<joey> you know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> - What even would the AI determine? </joey>
<connor> Like how do you even determine that shit? </connor>
<connor> - Hmm I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Your star signs seem
to be matched very well, </connor>
<joey> Capricorns and Sagittarius
tend to fuck very roughly. </joey>
<joey> - Knowing the Japanese it'd
probably be something like, </joey>
<connor> - Blood type.
- Oh it'd be blood type, </connor>
<connor> earning and male to female and
it'll be right that's good. </connor>
<connor> You're compatible with
half the population, </connor>
<connor> fantastic.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing has changed. </connor>
<joey> - I don't get Japan's
obsession with blood types man. </joey>
<joey> - That's weird. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, what is.
- Do you know your blood type? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I do not know my blood type.
- I don't know my blood type. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I think I'm O I think. </joey>
<connor> - Is that good? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Well I mean, I know there's
three different types right? </connor>
<connor> There's O, A, B and AB. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah and AB is the rare one right? </joey>
<connor> - AB is the rare one. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I should know because
I have like a blood disease, </connor>
<connor> so I used to have a medical bracelet. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah you probably should know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah you probably should
know, shouldn't you? </connor>
<connor> - I used to have a medical bracelet </connor>
<connor> that would be like, you know, </connor>
<joey> if I am bleeding please give
me this thing specifically. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what your parents are? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> But then I lost the medical bracelet, </connor>
<connor> so I don't know where it is.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - The one thing you
probably shouldn't lose. </joey>
<connor> - So I haven't got a replacement, </connor>
<connor> it's been a few years
now so it's just kinda. </connor>
<garnt> - Were you meant to like wear that always? </garnt>
<connor> - Not meant to, it's just like
a suggestion from the doctor. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What blows my mind
though is that in Japan, </joey>
<connor> at least in like Japanese schools, </connor>
<garnt> like you can get bullied
for your blood type. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn man, that's next level bullying. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like oh you're an A-type right? </joey>
<joey> - That's just racism with extra steps man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that does sound like an excuse, </connor>
<connor> it's like I bet he's a filthy O-type. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> You can't hang out with us O-types </connor>
<connor> because you're an A-type right? </connor>
<joey> - Why does everyone know
each other's blood type? </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] You'll find out next month. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I think.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's because like when you
do health checks checkups. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah we did that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't done mine yet.
- Yeah we can talk about that. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- It should be written </joey>
<joey> on your thing. </joey>
<garnt> - That was so strange. </garnt>
<garnt> - So to explain since we're
starring with GeeXPlus, </garnt>
<garnt> we are technically under
their health insurance </garnt>
<connor> and their company policy is that we have </connor>
<connor> to get a health checkup once a year. </connor>
<connor> - Which everyone in
Japan has to do as well. </connor>
<connor> - Which everyone in Japan has.
- [Meilyne] Twice a year. </connor>
<connor> - Twice a year okay.
- Twice? </connor>
<garnt> - We've been here for
one year already Meilyne </garnt>
<garnt> but we've only had one
checkup, how does that work? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] You're YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Well that was good wasn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Okay so we're supposed.
- Very professional. </connor>
<joey> - To go twice but we've
only just been once </joey>
<joey> and it was weird because.
- Yeah true so. </joey>
<joey> - It was weird seeing how efficient </joey>
<joey> a health system can be.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah how long did it take?
'Cause I haven't gone yet. </joey>
<joey> - It took about 20 minutes to get. </joey>
<connor> - It was like 30, it was like 30. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay well 30 </garnt>
<garnt> - Still that's fucking quick. </garnt>
<garnt> - So in 30 minutes you do an X-ray, </garnt>
<garnt> your blood pressure, you get weighed, </garnt>
<connor> you get blood taken, you do
a hearing and psych test. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You talk to a doctor who'll talk to you. </connor>
<garnt> - And then you do a cardiogram. </garnt>
<connor> - And a cardiogram.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wow in 30 minutes.
- All in like 30 minutes. </joey>
<connor> - All in 30 minutes
- Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - It was like speed running. </connor>
<connor> We were speed running health checks </connor>
<connor> and they even had like
fucking splits as well. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Because it was just like. </connor>
<joey> - Go and split on that X-ray. </joey>
<joey> - All right X-ray split done, </joey>
<joey> all right blood taking split let's go. </joey>
<joey> It literally felt like that </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was about like. </joey>
<joey> Because I had some problems with my form, </joey>
<joey> so I had to fill out my form again. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm. </joey>
<joey> So I was only about like 5
to 10 minutes behind Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And by the time I had
just started my like. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna call it.
- Yeah I was literally done. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna call it a conveyor belt, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause that's what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> It felt like I was in
chicken run being processed. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So I had just started the process </garnt>
<garnt> and Connor was almost done. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the most efficient. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I saw the list of all the things </joey>
<connor> that get checked up and I was like, </connor>
<joey> oh this is gonna be like an all day thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah you also have
to pee the night before </connor>
<connor> and bring it with you, </connor>
<joey> which I just I always
feel weird carrying my. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah I do have to do that. </joey>
<connor> - Carrying a vial of my piss.
- A vial of piss yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Who knows what might arise. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So you go into this room </joey>
<garnt> and it's like this really
busy place in like Shinjuku, </garnt>
<garnt> which I imagine a lot
of people would go to </garnt>
<garnt> if they were in Japan.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then there's like. </garnt>
<garnt> you go to this reception
area that's like 12 desks, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like all right come here, </garnt>
<connor> you hand the form they're
like right go upstairs, </connor>
<connor> you go upstairs, everyone's
in like medical downs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then like a really fancy
office looking thing. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - It's really odd and it's
basically just a small room </connor>
<connor> not even that big with
like couches in the middle, </connor>
<connor> and then you can see the like sections, </connor>
<connor> like it's a food court </connor>
<connor> of like what's gonna do what.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> You can see everyone </connor>
<connor> getting their blood taken.
- Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You see everyone </connor>
<connor> doing everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then they're like all right </connor>
<connor> go in this room get changed. </connor>
<connor> So you put the medical
gown on you come back in </connor>
<connor> and then they're like
right you have a number. </connor>
<connor> So you are literally like a chicken </connor>
<connor> in a farm.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's like actually chicken right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it is, it is. </connor>
<connor> - You literally are like a
piece of meat being passed </connor>
<connor> around the different things. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta get it sanitized you know, </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
and so you just, </connor>
<connor> they basically just come in they're like, </connor>
<joey> number 124 and then you go in </joey>
<joey> and then you just have to
like hopefully understand </joey>
<joey> what they're saying </joey>
<connor> in Japanese
- Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And then they tell you. </connor>
<connor> Yeah it was just fast, it
was like boom, boom, boom. </connor>
<joey> - Wow.
- But I was like, </joey>
<joey> Fuck dude I hate blood tests, </joey>
<joey> I hate getting my blood taken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - God I haven't done that in a while. </joey>
<connor> - And then I was like, I was just. </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Joey you should do it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I gotta do my next week yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's fun.
- Is it? </joey>
<connor> - No it's not.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's as fun as a health check can be </connor>
<connor> because it was something
that was so alien for me, </connor>
<connor> especially coming from the UK.
- Yeah it was really fast. </connor>
<connor> - Which you know big up the NHS </connor>
<connor> for giving everyone free healthcare </connor>
<joey> but the price you pay for that, </joey>
<connor> is that you have to wait for everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And when I say everything, </connor>
<connor> even just going to the fucking GP, </connor>
<connor> sometimes you're like.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You got a fever or
something I've phoned up my GP </connor>
<connor> and they're like oh we can't.
- Six days. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah we can't book
you in until next week </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like great </connor>
<connor> I guess i'll just try to sleep off </connor>
<connor> this fever then.
- I guess i'll be sick </connor>
<connor> for an entire week then.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And by the time you can
see the GP you've already, </connor>
<garnt> most of the time you've already recovered. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think I never see the doctor in London </connor>
<connor> but I booked three times to see it </connor>
<connor> when I was like dying and every
time before the appointment, </connor>
<connor> I got better and I had to cancel it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) 'Cause it was
like I'm already better. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- 'Cause like </connor>
<connor> it literally takes a week. </connor>
<connor> At least in London it's even, it's worse, </connor>
<connor> but I remember like, I think I fell, </connor>
<connor> I broke my arm one time when I was a kid </connor>
<connor> and I was in the emergency
room and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> fuck dude I'm gonna have to get an X-ray </connor>
<connor> and they're like yep so come
back in a week and a half </connor>
<connor> and we'll give you an
X-ray and I'm like What? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) Like What am I
supposed to do in a week? </connor>
<connor> What about my arm?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> They're like you'll just come
back in a week and a half, </connor>
<connor> I'm like but what I do till then? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) They're like oh
just don't do anything to it, </connor>
<connor> I'm like what do you mean
don't do anything to it? </connor>
<connor> I mean want am I supposed
to do for a week and a half? </connor>
<connor> Not move my arm? </connor>
<connor> So stupid man.
- Well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and it was so weird </garnt>
<garnt> going to the Japanese health checkup </garnt>
<connor> and they started off with the X-ray, </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like when I think X-ray, </connor>
<connor> in my head I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not getting an X-ray
unless it's something serious, </connor>
<connor> So this is obviously like the big checkup, </connor>
<connor> this is the X-ray but no </connor>
<connor> they fucking lubed us up
with a fucking X-ray man. </connor>
<connor> Like we went in there.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They'd go please go
to the X-ray machine. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like a rectangle on a wall </connor>
<joey> and you just put your chest against it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It was really odd. </joey>
<connor> I've never had that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh 'cause when I imagine X-ray, </connor>
<connor> I imagine like the lying down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I've always had that. </connor>
<connor> It was bizarre. </connor>
<joey> - I've never had an X-ray done before. </joey>
<garnt> - What was weird actually
was the cardiogram. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah I've never had that before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I've never had that before, </joey>
<joey> where it's like lie down on the bed </joey>
<connor> and you kind of feel like a mental patient </connor>
<connor> about to get lobotomized. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they put these.
- Suckers on you. </connor>
<connor> - They put these.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> suckers on you and then
they put these appendages </connor>
<connor> on your heart and your arms and legs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah it just kind of feels like </connor>
<connor> you're about to get lobotomized. </connor>
<connor> - I was waiting for
like the electric shock </connor>
<connor> to come or something.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like go hit me arg. </connor>
<connor> but no nothing happened then
they had to lube me up as well, </connor>
<connor> they do it to you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They just put like lube on you </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I think I had chest hair. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right.
- So it doesn't go. </garnt>
<connor> What Meilyne?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (inaudible speech) </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> It's a natural medical procedure. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not talking about my
in-depth colonoscopy Meilyne. </connor>
<garnt> - Meilyne is off-screen
just like blushing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which by the way.
- At the smallest details. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was told if you're over 35, </garnt>
<joey> every year you have to have a colonoscopy. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah every year you have
to have a colonoscopy. </connor>
<joey> - It's because in Japan </joey>
<joey> hemorrhoids is a really common problem. </joey>
<joey> - I'm legit.
- How? </joey>
<joey> - I'm legit serious, I think I
saw something a little crazy, </joey>
<joey> like one in four men in
Japan have hemorrhoids. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah Connor was telling me afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> that he doesn't want a colonoscopy </garnt>
<garnt> because he is afraid that
it'll awaken something in him. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - All I'm saying is like
what if I dig it man? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What you gonna like crack a fart </joey>
<joey> on the fucking
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> surgeon table like.
- I don't know man. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- He's like aah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was momentarily confused </connor>
<connor> when they said colonoscopy, </connor>
<connor> I'm like wait, wait, I'm
like which end is that? </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Which end is that? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I thought about it, </connor>
<joey> would you rather something go up your ass </joey>
<joey> or down your throat? </joey>
<connor> - Up my ass.
- I thought up my ass. </connor>
<connor> - He thought it was
going down your throat, </connor>
<garnt> so they check your throat </garnt>
<garnt> or down like your stomach whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - What's that called? </joey>
<joey> That's a different thing right? </joey>
<joey> - It's something else </joey>
<joey> and I was like totally down. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like all right fine </garnt>
<connor> put it up my ass dude.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Down my throat, Whatever up my ass. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no it's the opposite way. </connor>
<connor> - Oh the opposite way?
- Opposite yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'd rather something up
my ass than down my throat. </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne is in disbelief.
- Don't take that </connor>
<joey> out of context.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne, what would you.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'm kidding. </joey>
<connor> Also when we were doing
this health checkup as well, </connor>
<connor> We had like the blood pressure thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- where you put the arm </joey>
<joey> and like the thing in it, </joey>
<joey> which also always feels weird.
- The thing that </joey>
<joey> squeezes your arm.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then the doctor was like,
yeah you did good on that </joey>
<joey> and I'm like what does
that mean? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> What does that mean I did good? </joey>
<joey> - What is doing bad? </joey>
<joey> Like arg! </joey>
<joey> - I'm like explain what did good means, </joey>
<joey> that your numbers are good.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm like yeah but explain
the fucking numbers to me, </joey>
<connor> what is this supposed to mean? </connor>
<joey> - I put all my attention into my arm </joey>
<joey> to change my blood pressure. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I was doing something
like Hunter Hunted nend shit </connor>
<connor> on that thing,
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like heart rate zero. </connor>
<joey> - You did like Avatar blood-bending shit, </joey>
<connor> it's just like.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like I will now
make my heart rate zero </connor>
<connor> so my enemies cannot find me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And then we've got our blood taken </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember before
we got a blood taken, </garnt>
<connor> we were talking about you know. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
We were talking </connor>
<connor> about how the Japanese health system had. </connor>
<connor> We've all had pretty good experiences </connor>
<connor> with the Japanese health system </connor>
<connor> because we will all have like.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why, we all
have that inherent fear </connor>
<connor> that you know everyone's
had a shitty experience </connor>
<connor> when they have taken the blood </connor>
<connor> and they've just missed the vein. </connor>
<connor> Right?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah oh God.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that happened to me. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like it was foreshadowing,
that happened to me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I knew it as soon
as he stuck the needle in. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you know you can feel it, </connor>
<connor> when it goes straight into your vein, </connor>
<connor> it feels exactly like
the doctor describes, </connor>
<connor> it's just like a prick right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it just comes out,
so he sticks his needle in </connor>
<connor> and I could feel immediately </connor>
<connor> that something was wrong
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was like that's
not a vein that's muscle, </connor>
<connor> and you start feeling pain and I felt, </connor>
<connor> sorry for anyone who has
like a needle phobia, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm gonna, so I can feel him like </connor>
<connor> kind of twitching the needle around. </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- In my arm </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like how do
I tell him it's not there? </connor>
<connor> How do I tell him it's
not there? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And he does it for like a full minute </connor>
<garnt> before he realizes oh
there's no blood coming out, </garnt>
<connor> and I look over.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - He's pulling up fat.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And I look over and
there's like you know </garnt>
<connor> like the vial of blood? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The vial was filled up that much. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
It's like the minute </connor>
<connor> he was poking my arm and am like. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably just a scar tissue blood. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and I'm just like, God
fucking dammit man, I knew it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I felt so embarrassed I was like, </garnt>
<connor> fuck I wanna be cool and
not like shit myself here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then I was like
oh God and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh no the nurse is cute oh no I can't, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna make a fool of myself. </joey>
<joey> - No I think with needles, I
feel needles are the only time </joey>
<garnt> where you can bring out your inner pussy </garnt>
<garnt> and just be like I don't, no, I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't look at the needle going in. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh I have to look at
the needle going in. </joey>
<garnt> - What?
- You do? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like it's on the contrary for me. </garnt>
<garnt> If he's like all right, we're gonna go in </garnt>
<connor> and if I don't see it </connor>
<joey> and I feel a prick that scares me more. </joey>
<connor> - Joey is just like it's going in. </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> No Legit.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I have to go hard but,
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'd just be like
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> do it, do it now!
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Come on!
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Wait What about staring at
you being pierced helps you? </connor>
<joey> - Because I know when the pain is coming. </joey>
<joey> - What?.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You know what I mean?
- No that's worse! </garnt>
<garnt> - No because then you're
expecting the pain right? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no what's worse for
me is unexpected pain, </joey>
<joey> where I'm just chilling and
then suddenly it's like ow! </joey>
<connor> - You barely feel it if
you don't look though. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel it more if I don't look. </connor>
<joey> - What that's? </joey>
<garnt> - Because that's like, have
you ever like cut yourself </garnt>
<garnt> or have like an injury? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't feel that all day.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then suddenly you look at it </joey>
<joey> and you're like wow there's a cut </joey>
<joey> and then suddenly you start feeling it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly.
- That's me and needles. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<joey> Because every time I get cut
it's just immediate pain. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I can't imagine seeing
blood literally gush out </garnt>
<garnt> of my veins and thinking yeah </garnt>
<joey> that looks like a painless experience. </joey>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, like during
the summer for instance, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause like during the summer </garnt>
<joey> your blood pressure is a lot higher. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So when the blood comes out </joey>
<joey> it kinda just like gushes out </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like oh that
looks sick. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I like looking at that, it's kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm like whoa that's coming
out of my body, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when I was a kid </joey>
<joey> they would just give me
this like contraption </joey>
<joey> that was just like filled
with like paint oil </joey>
<connor> and it would just like
all of it would like, </connor>
<connor> you would flip it over and
I'd start playing like crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They should do that to distract me. </connor>
<joey> - (laughing) To distract yourself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause I was like wow
look at that thing go wow hey. </joey>
<joey> - I just look at the vail and
I'm like whoa that's cool. </joey>
<connor> - That's weird I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I was just like I put
my hand on the table </connor>
<connor> and I'm like go ahead.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You smacked it off. </connor>
<connor> - I was like Kawaii man go ahead. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Why'd you have to like smack it out? </joey>
<connor> - I'm like come on get ready boy. </connor>
<joey> - Belt in the mouth.
- Yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm like we using mine or
are we using mine? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- What was weird for me, </connor>
<garnt> because normally when
I get my blood taken, </garnt>
<joey> I'm used to it being like a private place. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it was weird.
- You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - It was only in front of everyone. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and so we had our blood taken, </joey>
<joey> it's like a conveyor belt </joey>
<connor> and I was just like
eyeing up the next guy, </connor>
<connor> the guy next to me
getting his blood taken. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah there was three of
us right next to each other, </connor>
<connor> getting our blood taken, it was very odd. </connor>
<connor> - And neither of us could look
at the blood getting taken </connor>
<garnt> and we just fucking
met eyes and just like, </garnt>
<joey> all right.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - And then we kissed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's like meeting guys in a urinal. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- For you it's just </joey>
<joey> like sir this is awkward. </joey>
<joey> How's your day going? </joey>
<garnt> Oh you look like an O-type there, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck you mean.
(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> What are you meant to say right? </joey>
<connor> - Just trying to strike </connor>
<joey> up any conversation.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I guess it is odd that we made it </connor>
<joey> into a private thing in the West right? </joey>
<joey> Like does it really need to be private </joey>
<connor> getting your blood taken? </connor>
<garnt> - It doesn't but I feel more comfortable. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's that people
would prefer it right? </connor>
<connor> - I prefer it but if that means </connor>
<connor> that I get medical tests way
fucking quicker in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - By all means do my colonoscopy </joey>
<joey> in front of the other patients.
(laughing) I do not mind, </joey>
<joey> Like let's get this done. </joey>
<joey> - It's like oh you cracked
a fart too same high five. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - If that means I can
get it done 20% faster </joey>
<joey> and I can get on with my day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly.
- I'll gladly get my blood, </joey>
<connor> if I faint in front of a
group of 20 people who cares. </connor>
<joey> - That's why in my head I was like, </joey>
<connor> oh this was gonna be an all-day thing. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was gonna
be an all-day thing. </connor>
<connor> - Because a health checkup anywhere else </connor>
<connor> is definitely an all-day thing right. </connor>
<joey> I think the worst part
was that you couldn't eat </joey>
<joey> or drink anything the night before. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - After like 8:00 pm you have
to stop eating and drinking, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And normally </joey>
<joey> that wouldn't be a problem </joey>
<joey> but when you tell me
I can't eat and drink, </joey>
<joey> I'm like well fuck now I wanna to. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) Well now I
wanna just eat and drink. </joey>
<connor> - Wait can you drink water? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh you can drink water. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh right, I was gonna say. </garnt>
<connor> - You can drink but water is
the only thing you can drink. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- You can't have any alcohol. </connor>
<connor> - I was like it has
British people like shaking </connor>
<connor> Tea, tea arg! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah basically no
substance in your bloodstream </connor>
<garnt> the night before.
- Why is it substance? </garnt>
<garnt> What are you taking Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> Garnt's like fuck. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta put the belt and spoon away, </connor>
<joey> it's like fuck damn it.
- Goddammit, </joey>
<garnt> they're gonna see my heroin
veins and everything man. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like Make sure to hit
the heroin vein. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like don't worry I got
this, I've done this before. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kidding.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt's got this.
- And this is a joke. </connor>
<connor> How does you take heroin again? </connor>
<connor> You take a pint of heroin that way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's how </connor>
<garnt> you take it right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a pint, it's a pint definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can't believe the Trash Taste boys </garnt>
<connor> made a light of drug addicts. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, well, In case
you don't get sarcasm, </joey>
<joey> none of us have done heroin okay? </joey>
<connor> It was just like so wanna make that clear. </connor>
<connor> - Yet, Unless. </connor>
<connor> - That's the good dark
art of the Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, okay we should stop joking. </garnt>
<connor> - Trailer Trash Tastes.
- We can stop joking about it. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - I heard you guys had
an exciting taxi journey. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah so I convinced Joey to get a taxi </connor>
<connor> 'cause Joey wanted to get the train home </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's about like half the price, </connor>
<connor> but you know it was like midnight. </connor>
<joey> - It was the day when Connor and I </joey>
<connor> were streaming at the Trash Taste office, </connor>
<connor> if you guys saw on our Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- but it was like 11:00 pm </connor>
<joey> when we finished? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and I was like Fuck
getting the train home, </connor>
<connor> Come on Joey let's get a
taxi, it must be comfortable. </connor>
<connor> it's late you know we just dreams. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know what you see, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why you like
have this massive thing </joey>
<connor> about like the comfort in taxi. </connor>
<connor> It's not that much more comfortable. </connor>
<connor> - It's not comfortable. </connor>
<connor> - Dude it is so much more comfortable. </connor>
<joey> - You say it as if it's like </joey>
<connor> business class versus economy class. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly that's the way I see it. </connor>
<connor> - No, no.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - Because also right now
with the Rona going on, </connor>
<connor> if I can avoid getting a train,
i'll avoid getting a train. </connor>
<connor> - I understand that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But for me, </connor>
<connor> like I would most like 90% of the time, </connor>
<connor> I would rather get like, </connor>
<connor> have a longer journey that
I can actually do stuff on </connor>
<connor> because I can't do anything on a taxi. </connor>
<connor> - Well I can do more on a taxi. </connor>
<garnt> - I look at my phone and I
immediately just get carsick. </garnt>
<connor> - You can't do anything
on a train in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean you can
watch YouTube videos. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- You could do that in a taxi. </connor>
<joey> - No, no I can't because I get carsick. </joey>
<joey> - Because I didn't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry that your natural selection </joey>
<joey> didn't favor you Joey </joey>
<joey> that's not my problem.
- Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not the only one
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Garnt gets carsick as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Both of you.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think most people get car sick </garnt>
<garnt> when they look at stuff.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm focusing on the
YouTube video or the thing. </connor>
<joey> - It's because you can't see outside </joey>
<joey> so the inertia just fucks you up. </joey>
<joey> That's how you get carsick. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not sure about the
exact science of car sickness </joey>
<joey> but like cars are the only
vehicle I get motion sickness in. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything else I can like read. </garnt>
<garnt> - Boat? </garnt>
<garnt> - Boats. </garnt>
<joey> - Well that's not carsick,
is it? It's sea sick. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's.
- He said vehicle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I get seasick. </garnt>
<connor> - Really?
I get seasick sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - I get slightly seasick. </garnt>
<joey> - Of course it's 'cause normally people </joey>
<connor> who are carsick get seasick. </connor>
<connor> - I don't get carsick that easily though. </connor>
<connor> - Unless you're watching something? </connor>
<connor> - But if I'm looking down at my phone, </connor>
<joey> I can't read in a car.
- No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> Like I don't get carsick </garnt>
<connor> if I'm just sitting
there listening to music. </connor>
<connor> - God carsickness must be hell then. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it's fucking boring for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you have to travel
like four hours in a car, </garnt>
<garnt> what do you do? </garnt>
<garnt> - God I fucking hate my life.
- I just turn on my music </garnt>
<connor> and go to bed. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why
I've conditioned myself </connor>
<joey> to be able to sleep so easily in cars. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I literally
can't do anything in cars </joey>
<joey> but sleep and listen to music.
- But it's weird, </joey>
<joey> I can do the exact same thing
on a bus and not get sick. </joey>
<garnt> - On a bus? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I could be on a bus </connor>
<connor> and watch YouTube or whatever or read. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking look at the needle.
- And i'll be fine. </connor>
<connor> do this shit? Look What
happened to you. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> What happened? </connor>
<joey> - If I do that in a car
five minutes in I'm sick. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's the smaller the vehicle, </garnt>
<connor> the more likely I'm to get sick. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the
science is behind that </connor>
<connor> but if it's like a small taxi, </connor>
<joey> especially if it's a small taxi </joey>
<joey> and we're like squeezed in, </joey>
<joey> - And if you're in the back seat right? </joey>
<connor> - And if you're in the backseat. </connor>
<garnt> I just get immediately motion sick. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna be in
the front of the taxi, </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna make eye
contact with the taxi driver. </connor>
<connor> - You don't have to. </connor>
<joey> What, you think you're
just gonna fucking do this </joey>
<connor> the entire ride?
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Well sometimes you know, </joey>
<connor> you might find yourself
wandering and you look at him </connor>
<connor> and it's this awkward moment of like, </connor>
<connor> hi, how are you doing? </connor>
<connor> - No, I've never done. </connor>
<connor> - Good driving, good driving. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I'm awkward, I don't wanna
make eye contact with him. </connor>
<garnt> - I have the same problem in the backseat, </garnt>
<connor> where I accidentally sometimes
look at the rear view mirror. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's the worst.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I sometimes look
- That's the worst. </connor>
<connor> at the rear view mirror.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then I make eyes to
them and then just like, </joey>
<garnt> hi there, hi.
(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - You just has to do it silent like nod. </joey>
<connor> - The worst is when they're a
fucking awful driver as well, </connor>
<connor> you gotta pretend like
they're doing this good job </connor>
<connor> and there just fucking insane. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah and that's why I
prefer to be in the front, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm less likely
to get sick in the front </joey>
<connor> from shit driving
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> than in the back. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you're fucking
thrown around in the back. </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway the story so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, we were talking
about the fucking story. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay we can go back into
taxi (inaudible speech). </connor>
<connor> - So anyway Connor was like, </connor>
<connor> look it's 20 minutes home, </connor>
<connor> on a comfy taxi.
- It's quicker. </connor>
<connor> - It's quicker and we're comfortable. </connor>
<joey> - It's quicker by only
like five, 10 minutes. </joey>
<connor> - We get closer to our house </connor>
<joey> 'cause you would have to go to the station </joey>
<joey> and walk.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Not that much. </connor>
<connor> - So I was like all right, fuck it. </connor>
<joey> i'll fucking humor your taxi ride. </joey>
<joey> So then we get in the taxi, </joey>
<joey> the taxi is driving fine </joey>
<joey> and then we go onto this
kind of bridge thing. </joey>
<connor> - Mm-hmm. </connor>
<joey> - and then just some random
police officer walks out </joey>
<joey> onto the street and kind of flags us down, </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And tells us to go
into one of the roads, </joey>
<joey> and immediately the taxi driver was like, </joey>
<joey> just the Japanese equivalent of Oh fuck. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's like this 90-year-old dude, </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah he's old.
- just being like Oh shit </garnt>
<connor> and he pulls in and Connor and I are like, </connor>
<connor> what the going on? </connor>
<connor> And I ask the taxi driver I'm like </connor>
<connor> Is something wrong? and he's like, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was speeding. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like you got stopped for speeding? </connor>
<connor> And he's like yeah I
was doing 80 down a 60 </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> and this fucking old dude
just walks out of the taxi, </joey>
<connor> fucking like you know Ozzy Osborne style, </connor>
<connor> kind of stumbles out.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Four policemen surrounded
this poor old man. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And like in the middle of the night, </joey>
<joey> as he's filling out this paper for work, </joey>
<joey> and Connor and I are just
kinda sitting there being like, </joey>
<joey> oh we could have been home by now </joey>
<connor> if we went on the train, huh.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> The one time I humor this
man to get on a taxi. </joey>
<connor> - Listen that is the first
time I ever had a taxi driver </connor>
<connor> been pulled over by the police you know, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I was just hoping
that they wouldn't be like, </joey>
<joey> all right let's have a look, </joey>
<joey> well these boys in the
back look pretty foreign. </joey>
<joey> Let's see what's going on with these boys. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I was like Fuck come on. </connor>
<joey> - I was afraid that might happen as well, </joey>
<connor> so immediately like
before the police officer </connor>
<garnt> even started talking to us, </garnt>
<connor> I just immediately bust out the Japanese, </connor>
<garnt> be like what's going on officer? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Yes I am Japanese.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The police officers asked us, </joey>
<connor> they were like is it okay
if we stop you for now? </connor>
<joey> Like the driver. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that was like what if we said no? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I'm like what are
we supposed to say to that? </connor>
<joey> Like no, no fuck you.
- We're in the middle </joey>
<connor> of fucking nowhere,
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> there's no taxis anywhere. </connor>
<joey> What do you expect us
to do like walk home? </joey>
<connor> - They pulled us over some bridge, </connor>
<connor> So there wasn't like much there, </connor>
<connor> so it was just like some water, </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then like a bunch of
like a power plant nearby, </connor>
<connor> so it was like nothing, it was really odd. </connor>
<garnt> - So four police officers, </garnt>
<garnt> like fucking busted down
this decrepit taxi driver. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah just for this guy </garnt>
<garnt> and then there was two
other police officers </garnt>
<connor> just standing there doing nothing </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's what they do here. </connor>
<garnt> - Every police story I've heard in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> is all about how many
police officers you need </garnt>
<garnt> versus how many was actually
needed during the scene. </garnt>
<connor> - They literally send
like six police officers </connor>
<connor> to like someone falling over on a bike. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's like it's insane. </connor>
<connor> They're so bored here,
they've nothing to do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah they need spotters right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> He's like I got you bro, nice
policing you're doing there. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause normally in the UK,
it's always like two people. </joey>
<garnt> Like it's always a squad right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- Two people and you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Go one and your partner right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's normally
how it should be right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because also I don't know
if this is on purpose, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's very intimidating </garnt>
<connor> when four or five policemen
are crowding around you </connor>
<joey> and you haven't done anything </joey>
<joey> and they're asking you questions. </joey>
<joey> They all look pissed off
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> and I'm like well come on, </joey>
<joey> what's going on here then? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah right?
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - What's all this about? </connor>
<connor> - I felt so bad for the old dude, </connor>
<joey> 'cause he looked like he was
about to get fucking beaten up </joey>
<joey> by these four police officers,
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're literally were
just crowding around him, </joey>
<joey> just like looking down at the paperwork. </joey>
<connor> - I've never been in
this situation as well, </connor>
<connor> this is the first time
where I've been near police </connor>
<joey> where they haven't asked for like my ID </joey>
<joey> and like information and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Well yeah because I busted
out the Japanese quickly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, true.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's so annoying 'cause
you just go near them </joey>
<joey> and they're like hey can
we see ID and all this? </joey>
<joey> and I'm like why? </joey>
<joey> I'm not involved in this, </joey>
<joey> I'm literally just a
customer leave me alone. </joey>
<joey> - Well you think I had a
gun pointing to this taxi, </joey>
<joey> like do 80, do 80. </joey>
<joey> - Do it, do it, do 80, you sick cunt. </joey>
<connor> (laughing)
- No like what? </connor>
<garnt> - Start playing European in
the background, hey come on, </garnt>
<connor> Gas, gas, gas. </connor>
<garnt> - Yo drift this corner, drift this corner. </garnt>
<joey> Do it, do it.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I know what I'm doing,
I've done it one time. </joey>
<joey> This video is sponsored by Mack Weldon. </joey>
<joey> There are a lot of things
that you'd probably like </joey>
<connor> to leave behind in 2020, </connor>
<connor> one of the most important
being your old underwear boys. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> (Joey screaming) If you're
rolling into the new year </connor>
<connor> with the same bunching, chafing </connor>
<connor> and uncomfortable underwear </connor>
<connor> then you've gotta check out Mack Weldon. </connor>
<connor> Mack Weldon is an essential
piece of my daily routine, </connor>
<connor> thanks to this card holder boys. </connor>
<connor> It holds all my cards very
neatly thank you Mack Weldon. </connor>
<joey> - I have a face mask because
I'm scared of the outside, </joey>
<connor> as should you be. </connor>

<joey> - Thank you to Mack Weldon
for sponsoring this episode </joey>
<joey> back to the show. </joey>
<connor> - But in general I do find
taxis a little awkward, </connor>
<connor> I don't know as somebody again who thinks </connor>
<garnt> about things a lot socially, </garnt>
<garnt> I like to think of like the
perfect social situations. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's awkward about them? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You talk so highly of taxis right? </joey>
<connor> - In Japan it's good
because I know they'll, </connor>
<garnt> actually some of them do
actually try and talk to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like virtually none
of them ever talk to me, </garnt>
<connor> but some of them will. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like some of the older ones, </connor>
<garnt> they bust out a conversation.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of the people who also
like, maybe learned English </connor>
<garnt> in college or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially I've noticed taxi
drivers in the countryside. </garnt>
<connor> To me as I like </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah they love talking. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In the city it's just like, all right. </connor>
<garnt> You're a customer I'm a taxi driver, </garnt>
<garnt> I will not communicate in any way, </garnt>
<connor> shape or form.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's charming in Japan I think, </connor>
<connor> when the taxi driver is
trying to talk to you. </connor>
<connor> Especially in English, when
they're trying to talk to you. </connor>
<connor> It's like oh, damn. you're
putting on the work. </connor>
<connor> So please focus on driving
but you know go ahead. </connor>
<joey> - The best taxi driver I
ever had was in Okinawa </joey>
<joey> and we were going from. </joey>
<garnt> - What constitutes a good taxi driver? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that's a good question.
(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay it was a good taxi driver. </joey>
<joey> - Wait do you like it when
your taxi drivers talk to you? </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes, I gotta be
in the right mood I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah same here. </garnt>
<connor> - Like you know if it's like </connor>
<connor> fucking 3:00 am right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm like either
drunk or just tired or both </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm stepping in </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna have a fucking conversation </garnt>
<joey> with the taxi driver. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, some sometimes
you get in a taxi drive </garnt>
<joey> and they ask how your day's going, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like arg. </joey>
<connor> - Can you tell by the way I look? </connor>
<garnt> - Here we go, here we go.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it depends if
I'm alone or with friends, </garnt>
<joey> have you ever had a taxi driver who butt </joey>
<joey> into a conversation
between you and friends? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- No. </joey>
<connor> - That I hate that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm like Whoa, whoa, whoa. </connor>
<connor> Wait hold up, hold up.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> this isn't a social invitation, sir. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Now the best taxi ride
I had was in Okinawa, </joey>
<joey> because we were going from our hotel </joey>
<joey> to this like one castle in Naha </joey>
<joey> and it was like a 30-minute taxi ride. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - And the dude was like you know, </joey>
<garnt> obviously an older gentleman </garnt>
<garnt> but he clearly had been
there his entire life, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And he knew immediately </garnt>
<garnt> he's like oh foreigners, </garnt>
<garnt> you clearly don't know a whole
lot about this place huh? </garnt>
<garnt> And he started talking </garnt>
<garnt> and he took us on this really </garnt>
<garnt> fucking scenic route.
- That's pretty nice. </garnt>
<connor> - Like throughout all these places </connor>
<connor> but he said he's like I
took you on the scenic route </connor>
<connor> but i'll charge you for the regular route. </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- What a nice guy. </connor>
<connor> - So he was nice enough </connor>
<connor> so he would like actually
kind of stop the car </connor>
<connor> and kinda be like this is this, </connor>
<connor> and it's a kind of cool thing.
- Man's a tour guide, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> not a taxi man goddamn.
- No legit </garnt>
<joey> Like he was like a tour guide. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually had something
very similar happen to me </garnt>
<garnt> when I went to Koshi Valley. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we wanted to go to this one. </garnt>
<connor> - Are taxi drivers just
part-time like fucking tourists? </connor>
<garnt> - I think they're just happy
because they just have, </garnt>
<joey> One, they're happy to have tourists there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I'm pretty sure
business has not been banging </joey>
<joey> this year.
- Oh yeah true. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah me and Sydney
were on this taxi ride </joey>
<connor> to get to this winery and he's
like let me give you a tour </connor>
<connor> of the other wineries in the area as well, </connor>
<connor> just in case </connor>
<connor> you wanna go to one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah he only charged
us for the taxi ride </connor>
<garnt> to the one winery but yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> we got a tour of every winery down there. </garnt>
<connor> - Show me these taxi drivers,
I'm never getting any. </connor>
<joey> - Again I feel taxi
drivers like that though, </joey>
<joey> really only exist in the countryside. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah nobody gets
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That in Tokyo. </joey>
<connor> Dude in Tokyo they're fucking miserable. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah I would be too
to be honest. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's in Rappongi,
there's a big cemetery. </joey>
<joey> I'll find it
- Oh, yeah, yeah </joey>
<joey> I forgot the name of it. </joey>
<joey> - I'll send you a picture
of (inaudible speech) </joey>
<connor> but there's this whole area right next </connor>
<connor> to this giant cemetery right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's a big stretch of road </connor>
<garnt> and taxi drivers just sleep there. </garnt>
<connor> - Like really?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - There's hundreds of taxis parked right? </connor>
<connor> And they all park and they all just sleep </connor>
<connor> and change clothes in this area. </connor>
<joey> It's on a busy road in a really busy area. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which they all just sleep
there, it's so bizarre, </joey>
<joey> yeah you can do that here. </joey>
<joey> You can just park your car </joey>
<joey> on a busy road and just sleep
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like people do that it's so weird. </joey>
<connor> You can't do that in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - No I feel most countries
you can't do that. </joey>
<connor> - No even in the
countryside that'd be weird, </connor>
<connor> someone would come and
slap you and be like, </connor>
<connor> yow are you okay, what's up?
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Have you by the way seen, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't fucking believe this, </joey>
<joey> but have you seen those rare taxis </joey>
<garnt> that you can get in Tokyo? </garnt>
<garnt> - Rare taxis?
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't believe Japan
has actually done this, </garnt>
<joey> but they've literally
turned taxis into Gacha. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Of course they have,
of course they have. </garnt>
<garnt> - I forgot the exact name of it, </garnt>
<connor> but I think it's called like </connor>
<connor> Sakura taxis.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - So you know how like in most taxis </connor>
<connor> and this is only a Tokyo thing, </connor>
<connor> but like, you know how on taxis </connor>
<connor> they usually have like the
signs on top of the car </connor>
<connor> that like show whether the
taxi's open or whatnot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Apparently out of, I
think the 7,400 taxi cars </garnt>
<connor> in the greater Tokyo
area there are five taxis </connor>
<garnt> that have a Sakura thing on top of it </garnt>
<garnt> and supposedly that's
like the SSR of taxis. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What do you get? </connor>
<connor> What buffs do you get? </connor>
<connor> - No 'cause one of my friends
actually got it the other day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And when you enter into the taxi, </connor>
<connor> it's lot, lot nicer, </connor>
<connor> and actually like a first class of taxis. </connor>
<connor> - Goddamn. </connor>
<connor> - And inside there's a
little sheet of paper </connor>
<connor> that says congratulations </connor>
<joey> you've found one of
five fortune red taxis. </joey>
<connor> (laughing)
- Fuck I hate that, </connor>
<connor> I think that's so fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think that's so fucking cool, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> I really wanna kinda go around now, </joey>
<joey> trying to find this fucking
mythical taxi, this SSR taxi. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude my fucking Gacha pull. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
- Yeah right? </connor>
<connor> - It's the Gacha pool of taxis now. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's frothing already.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - He's like oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - It's like every time
you use Tokyo taxi app, </connor>
<connor> you're just like come on give me the SSR. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - What is this like a 0.01 pull </connor>
<connor> or something like that?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Fuck it, i'll give it a go why not? </connor>
<garnt> All right Connor let's get more taxis now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt's just calling taxi
after taxi to his house </garnt>
<garnt> and they're all just parked out. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like are you the rare taxi? </connor>
<garnt> No, don't worry I don't need a taxi. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like oh, fuck,
it's blue bag blue bag. </garnt>
<garnt> He's just like come on
give me the gold bag, </garnt>
<joey> give me the gold bag. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Well I just think that's so fucking cool, </joey>
<joey> that's just like one extra I guess, </joey>
<connor> like piece of enjoyment you
can have as a tourist right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </connor>
<connor> - Knowing that now when you come to Japan </connor>
<connor> and you go in a taxi, you
can look forward to that, </connor>
<joey> being like finna pull the SSR's off taxis. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one reason as a
tourist you should use a taxi </garnt>
<garnt> because Goddamn they're
expensive in Japan man. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh in Tokyo they're fucking expensive. </joey>
<connor> - They get pissed off if you
take a short journey as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've noticed that </joey>
<joey> sometimes I've had too much shit to carry, </joey>
<joey> so I've had to get like, </joey>
<joey> it's like a short walk from
the station to my house </joey>
<connor> but I remember like a few
times I've gotten the taxi </connor>
<connor> because I had like too
much stuff to carry, </connor>
<connor> they were like oh there? </connor>
<garnt> Okay.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh here this house. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I say like
thank you when I leave </garnt>
<connor> and then don't say it
back and I'm like wow. </connor>
<connor> Okay in Japan that's like
the biggest fuck you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like didn't say thank
you back, the audacity. </joey>
<joey> - That's like the equivalent
of flipping the book. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, literally. </joey>
<joey> Yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> I didn't realize that until
someone pointed it out </connor>
<connor> that it happened another time as well. </connor>
<connor> They were like wow that was
really rude, I'm like was he? </connor>
<connor> I thought he was just driving
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Well he didn't say thank you
back, what a fucking asshole. </garnt>
<connor> - The first time it happened
was a similar situation </connor>
<garnt> where it was a very short journey, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like an $8 journey not even right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And then I got out and
the other person with me </connor>
<connor> was like wow that was so
rude. I'm like what was rude? </connor>
<joey> He just drove us he didn't say anything, </joey>
<joey> he's like yeah I said thank
you, he didn't say it back, </joey>
<joey> I'm like oh okay. </joey>
<joey> - The audacity of this bitch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> Ima finna get back in that car
and give him a slap you know. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing, it's just Tokyo taxis </connor>
<connor> that are just so fucking expensive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Because like </connor>
<connor> if you think about it catching
a taxi in Tokyo is a luxury </connor>
<connor> because trains are just so
fucking convenient in Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> whereas the moment you were
out of the greater Tokyo area, </connor>
<connor> a lot of places without a taxi </connor>
<joey> you're fucked.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think it depends where you're going. </joey>
<connor> 'cause there's some, if you're
on the outskirts of Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> if you're going in like an arc, </connor>
<connor> like a quarter circle let's say, </connor>
<connor> they don't really have trains
that go, like London right? </connor>
<connor> It's the exact same.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Where trains go in and
out and they don't go round </connor>
<connor> normally.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So if you wanna go the to outskirts, </connor>
<joey> most of the time to get like, </joey>
<joey> just a 15-minute taxi drive away, </joey>
<joey> it might require you to go
in, all the way to central, </joey>
<joey> and then go out.
- Yeah yeah that's true. </joey>
<joey> - That's like 50 minutes </joey>
<joey> and it's like well you know, </joey>
<connor> how much is 45 minutes of
my time worth or 30 minutes? </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But I think like the majority of people </joey>
<connor> - Central Tokyo.
- Just don't really. </connor>
<connor> - leave no excuse.
- Care about that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel you're like
you know going to Shinju. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas in Okinawa, there's
literally one tram line </connor>
<connor> that goes for five stops
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> and that's the only
train line that they have </connor>
<connor> on the entire Island.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that's why the taxis
are like half the price </connor>
<joey> that you get in Tokyo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah if the people rely on it, </connor>
<connor> the local government will help insure. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah like a 30-minute
tax free ride in Okinawa </joey>
<garnt> I was talking about was like 2000 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit seriously. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it was really, really cheap. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause in Tokyo that would be </joey>
<garnt> about like 60, 70 bucks about.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm convinced right, </garnt>
<connor> that in Tokyo they don't
make people retire, </connor>
<connor> they make them become taxi drivers. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I swear most times taxi drivers, </garnt>
<garnt> when I see a young taxi driver, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like wow you've made a career choice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I'm like something's up. </joey>
<connor> - You made a bold career
choice here what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - Because I speak to
people and I swear to God, </connor>
<connor> they look at taxi drivers
like McDonald's workers here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do they? </connor>
<connor> - Because it's like, you
don't need any qualifications </connor>
<joey> except drive, which you
know they expect you to do. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's just like a throwaway job </joey>
<connor> they make old G sons do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah basically it's like, </joey>
<joey> I think the average age of a
taxi driver here is like 70 </joey>
<connor> - It's like you can retire in Japan. </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
- You become a taxi driver? </joey>
<joey> - You wanna see yourself retire </joey>
<connor> or become a taxi driver. </connor>
<connor> - It's either taxi driver </connor>
<connor> or a construction worker.
- Um. </connor>
<connor> - But not actually.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Doing construction.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just like holding the signs
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> and being like this way please. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's nuts how fast
they built houses here, </connor>
<connor> it's like crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah we had like a whole school be built </garnt>
<garnt> right next to the apartment I'm living in, </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the span of the
year I was living here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is fucking insane. </garnt>
<connor> - They built a full like
three-story house next to me </connor>
<connor> in like two months. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell.
- I was like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck this ain't right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No it is crazy especially
like say when you go </connor>
<connor> into the city or whatever
and you haven't been </connor>
<garnt> for maybe a couple of months. </garnt>
<garnt> (murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> it's surprising the amount
of things that have changed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- You'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh this building
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> was completely different two months ago, </garnt>
<garnt> now it's just magically here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Going back to taxi drivers though, </garnt>
<garnt> have you ever had any weird </garnt>
<garnt> or bad taxi experiences worldwide? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah definitely in Europe, </joey>
<connor> I've had some.
- In Europe. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty shitty taxis. </connor>
<joey> - Where in Europe? </joey>
<connor> - France. </connor>
<joey> - Oh.
- Oh okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Was a taxi and Uber, </garnt>
<joey> the worst Uber ride I
ever had was in France. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know why all the
weird taxi experiences I've had </garnt>
<connor> have been in LA. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like taxis or Ubers?
- Ubers. </joey>
<garnt> - Ubers right. </garnt>
<joey> - I like When they taught
you in LA, it's nice. </joey>
<joey> - Ubers in LA I've always
had a pleasant time. </joey>
<garnt> - It's weird because I've
not for like the most part, </garnt>
<connor> I've had very pleasant
experiences with Uber in LA </connor>
<connor> but sometimes I get a really
odd experience and it's. </connor>
<garnt> Okay so the oddest experience
I've ever had with Uber in LA, </garnt>
<garnt> it was during AX time, </garnt>
<garnt> (clearing throat) </garnt>
<garnt> It was me and two other friends </garnt>
<garnt> and all we were doing was
we wanted to take a taxi </garnt>
<garnt> to the convention hall, </garnt>
<garnt> and this was late at night by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it wasn't like the daytime, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like let's say 7:00, 8:00 pm, </garnt>
<connor> so it was kinda nighttime,
the sun was down. </connor>
<connor> So we call this Uber and
this car just rocks up </connor>
<connor> and it's like a fucking decrepit </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> broken car. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. I was just like.
- Shit. </connor>
<connor> - How the fuck has this passed </connor>
<connor> like Uber standards?
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure that
like a dead body had been </connor>
<connor> in there at one point.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So we were like oh this is the Uber? </connor>
<connor> Oh okay so we were like whatever. </connor>
<connor> It's like a five, 10
minute journey anyway, </connor>
<connor> doesn't really matter that much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </connor>
<connor> - So we get in this taxi driver, </connor>
<connor> and immediately he opens his mouth, </connor>
<connor> and you can kind of feel </connor>
<connor> that he's not all there in the head, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> he has a screw loose right? </connor>
<connor> - Right
- Why, What was he saying? </connor>
<connor> - So at the beginning
he was talking about, </connor>
<connor> guys I gotta ask you a favor, </connor>
<connor> can you please give me
five stars for my journey? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> All I'm asking for is one five-star, </connor>
<joey> I just want a five-star okay. </joey>
<joey> I just keep getting one
stars and I don't know why, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - He's like the one light kid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's like we did it guys. </joey>
<joey> - And then I'm like okay
that's an aggressive way </joey>
<joey> to ask for a positive review but sure. </joey>
<joey> - That is not how you get five stars. </joey>
<joey> - Sure we'll give you a five star, </joey>
<joey> so he starts driving to
this convention hall right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And he puts it in the GPS, </joey>
<joey> go to the LA Convention Center, </joey>
<joey> and then it says to go on a turning right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then it says please turn right, </joey>
<joey> doesn't listen he goes forward right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So it's fine the GPS
corrects itself and goes </joey>
<joey> please turn right at the next turning, </joey>
<joey> ignores that one keeps going forward </joey>
<joey> and in between him ignoring this GPS </joey>
<joey> and getting further and further away </joey>
<joey> from the Convention Center I might ask, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like on Google Maps, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like What the is fuck </joey>
<joey> is this taxi driver doing? </joey>
<joey> And he goes and he keeps talking </joey>
<garnt> about this fucking five-star
and one-star run right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he goes if I get another bad review, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna lose it a man, </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
I'm gonna lose it. </connor>
<garnt> - You're like hovering the one-star. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - He keeps saying that and
I'm just like making eyes, </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm sitting in the front </connor>
<connor> and my teammate's sitting in the back </connor>
<connor> and I'm just trying to
make eyes to be like. </connor>
<connor> - Oh you're in the passenger seat? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I'm just like,
- Oh, no. </connor>
<connor> - Yow if he pulls the gun </connor>
<connor> you've got my back, right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like if something happens,
you've got my back. </connor>
<connor> And so the third time the
GPS tells to turn right </connor>
<connor> and he misses it again and
I'm just like shit man. </connor>
<connor> Something's gone wrong, </connor>
<connor> we need to get out of this taxi right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather get another Uber. </connor>
<connor> than get further and
further away from safety, </connor>
<connor> which is the Convention Center. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Than stay one second
longer in this taxi, </connor>
<connor> so we're like don't worry man, </connor>
<connor> we're close enough to
the convention center. </connor>
<connor> We can just stop here
and he goes are you sure? </connor>
<connor> And so we're just like
yeah, yeah please stop. </connor>
<connor> Please just stop here.
- I beg of you. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And so we get out of the taxi </connor>
<connor> and as I'm getting out he
leans over and he goes, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna give me a five-star, right? </connor>
<connor> And we go Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, five-star. </connor>
<connor> Five-star, You promise? </connor>
<connor> Five-star yeah, five-star.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> And we're like yeah, yeah don't worry, </connor>
<connor> we'll give you a five-star. </connor>
<connor> All right looking forward
to that five-star, </connor>
<connor> drives off instant one-star. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say, I hope
you gave him one-star. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I hoped it was a one-star. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause people are just like, </connor>
<joey> I don't care how nice you are, </joey>
<connor> you shouldn't fucking be an Uber driver </connor>
<connor> if you're pulling shit like that. </connor>
<joey> - That's the equivalent of
getting a pizza delivered </joey>
<garnt> and the guy being like $20 tip right? </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta give me a least a $20 tip, </garnt>
<garnt> $10 no, no, no 20. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I could very much
see during that experience </garnt>
<garnt> why people gave him one stars </garnt>
<garnt> because I mean I kind
of feared for my safety </garnt>
<garnt> at one point during that taxi ride. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean it's not even a matter of him </joey>
<joey> just like ranting about like, </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna kill a bitch if
I get another one-star. </garnt>
<joey> It's the fact that he wasn't
even going the right way. </joey>
<garnt> - He wasn't going the right way </garnt>
<garnt> and like I was like okay. </garnt>
<garnt> At the beginning when he
asked for the five stars, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like whatever it's a fucking review. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I don't give a shit </joey>
<garnt> but when he was like
I'm gonna lose it man, </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna lose it.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I was just like oh shit man. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking terrifying especially LA, </joey>
<joey> you don't know what the
fuck's gonna happen. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's pretty scary, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've suddenly haven't had any </joey>
<connor> of the crazy taxi journeys really </connor>
<connor> most of them are pretty chill. </connor>
<connor> I don't know I feel like it's really hard </connor>
<connor> to have a bad taxi journey. </connor>
<connor> Although someone gave me a one-star once </connor>
<connor> as a customer on Uber </connor>
<connor> and I was confused.
- Really. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't think I've
ever done anything in a car, </connor>
<connor> but maybe I did something that
like ruined this man's day </connor>
<joey> and he gave me a one-star. </joey>
<connor> - Oh wow.
- Yeah I know. </connor>
<joey> - I had one really
memorable Uber ride in LA, </joey>
<connor> and it was again from
where we were staying </connor>
<connor> to the convention center, </connor>
<connor> it was like again another
like five, 10-minute ride. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And this massive Jeep rocks up. </garnt>
<connor> - Right.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - There's only two of us, </connor>
<connor> I'm like okay that's a
bit overkill but whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Jump in and just this like </connor>
<connor> the biggest black dude I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - He's got like not like fat, like built. </connor>
<connor> Like he's got fucking
brick shit house all right, </connor>
<connor> and he's just like are you Joey right? </connor>
<garnt> I'm like Yup and he's
like LA Convention Center? </garnt>
<garnt> All right I got you.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like super chill right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so the car drives off, </garnt>
<garnt> like two minutes later he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> aye yo you mind if I put on some music? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like yeah man </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you want right.
- Real nice circulation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like yeah man whatever you want, </garnt>
<garnt> it's all good and he's
like all right cool. </garnt>
<garnt> He turns on something right? </garnt>
<garnt> There's a million different artists, </garnt>
<garnt> you can envision a person like
that might listen to right? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just like oh yeah, just
like you know it could be any </connor>
<connor> fucking like hardcore
hip hop whatever right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Whatever the dude's into, </connor>
<connor> fucking Enya comes on. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Hell yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - He's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> ♪ Who can say where ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't just have a
fucking Terry Crews moment </garnt>
<joey> and like white chicks.
- Yeah, </joey>
<connor> and I'm just like, I
just started laughing, </connor>
<connor> I couldn't help I'm like, </connor>
<connor> if I laugh this man might kill me, </connor>
<joey> but this is just too funny </joey>
<joey> and I'm like you like Enya huh? </joey>
<joey> And he's like, yeah helps me to relax. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Dude that's fucking amazing man. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it was fucking great.
- Full on respect to the dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah it was so cool.
That's the thing though, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know if he was
like trying to make me laugh </garnt>
<garnt> or he was actually being serious
but either way I was like, </garnt>
<connor> you know what, I can get into this. </connor>
<joey> This is a really cool, you
know what props to you man. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) You may be brick

<joey> to some Enya whatever man. </joey>
<joey> - I'd love to be an Uber driver </joey>
<joey> and just troll people with music. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I would as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - You mind if I put my favorite music on? </garnt>
<garnt> it just plays like. </garnt>
<joey> - Lucky Star opening. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No if I become an Uber driver, </garnt>
<garnt> anime ops only man.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Anime ops only. </connor>
<connor> - As I was hearing your story I was like, </connor>
<connor> have I ever given an
Uber driver a one-star? </connor>
<garnt> I don't think so.
- That was my only one-star. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me it's like five-star is like </garnt>
<connor> encompasses everything from
the best experience to my life </connor>
<connor> to you got me there in one piece. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<joey> - Four-star is like you
literally broke down, </joey>
<garnt> you shit yourself
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> the car stinks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've killed someone,
you hit a dog as well. </garnt>
<joey> All right four stars.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I've just never used a one-star </joey>
<joey> I'm like didn't even
know it was an option, </joey>
<connor> you know I thought there were just two. </connor>
<connor> - There's zero-star as
well that you can give. </connor>
<garnt> - Is there?
- Yeah I think so. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbling) </garnt>
<connor> - What does someone have
to do to get zero-star? </connor>
<joey> - I mean like the worst Uber ride </joey>
<joey> that me and Aki went on
was in France, in Paris </joey>
<joey> and this dude like. </joey>
<joey> - You could Uber in France? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - And this man almost actually
got us into a car accident. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah french drivers are nuts dude. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I was I kid.
- He was fucking shouting </connor>
<joey> at everybody and like the shittiest kind </joey>
<joey> of like start-stop kind of driving </joey>
<connor> - (laughing) yeah.
- Where I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> bro I'm gonna be fucking
sick all over this car. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And he got us there and he was like </joey>
<joey> okay, okay we're here
for you know whatever, </joey>
<joey> and I was just like all
right man, zero stars. </joey>
<connor> - Didn't you get, you got
scammed in Italy right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah almost. </joey>
<connor> (laughing)
- 'Cause like In like </connor>
<connor> Italy and a lot of European countries, </connor>
<joey> except for like I don't know,
Germany is pretty good for it. </joey>
<connor> I think, like Prague is really bad for it </connor>
<connor> and places like that.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where the taxi drivers mad scam you </connor>
<garnt> and you gotta be like, it sucks, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's the most
un-Japanese thing ever. </garnt>
<joey> But you just gotta be like,
no I'm not paying that. </joey>
<joey> - Give me an actual fare. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like this is ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah so we landed in Rome Airport </connor>
<joey> and there was just a
dude outside of the gate </joey>
<joey> just being like taxi, taxi. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause they know you're tourists. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause they know
it's tourists right? </connor>
<connor> And we were with Aki's parents as well, </connor>
<connor> so Aki's dad was like,
yeah, yeah, yeah sure. </connor>
<connor> You know 'cause he's an Uber
driver right? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And he's like how much to this hotel? </connor>
<connor> And he looks and he goes uh 50 euros </connor>
<connor> and we're like all right whatever. </connor>
<connor> So then he takes us to like
the back of the airport </connor>
<connor> where it's like right
opposite where the hangar is. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And there's just this van, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> and we get into this van and he's like, </connor>
<connor> okay hold on, I call my
driver and the guy fucks off </connor>
<connor> and we're left in this van </connor>
<connor> and the longer we look around this van </connor>
<connor> we're like we gotta get the fuck out </connor>
<connor> of this van dude.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like this is not a taxi
because then I looked up like, </connor>
<connor> you know standard Italian taxi fares </connor>
<connor> to the airport from the hotel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we're like a normal
taxi ride is like 20 euros </connor>
<connor> and this dude's charging
50 and we're like, </connor>
<joey> we gotta get the fuck out. </joey>
<connor> - Don't fucking listen
to those in Europe man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like they'll try and get you away, </connor>
<joey> 'cause there's always gonna
be an official taxi stand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Which you should </joey>
<connor> always go to.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So we immediately like, we
didn't even wait for the dude. </connor>
<garnt> We just like grabbed our shit got out, </garnt>
<garnt> went to the regular taxi stand </garnt>
<garnt> and we're like all right thank God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean I'm pretty sure
for like any country, </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna go to the official taxi stand. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well some countries
have way stricter rules </connor>
<garnt> on taxis than others </garnt>
<connor> and like even if you get
one somewhere random, </connor>
<connor> yes a lot of countries
you'll still get like. </connor>
<connor> I mean Japan you get it anyway, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna get the standard fare. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Same in like Germany and UK as well, </connor>
<joey> I'm pretty sure it's all the same thing, </joey>
<joey> but yeah, it's.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah we learned our lesson
and we were about to get. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know where the fuck
this guy was gonna take us. </garnt>
<garnt> - Couple of you got in
someone's van. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally what they warn
against as you're a fucking kid. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, right?
- Don't get in any van ever, </connor>
<joey> unless you're the one who's booked it. </joey>
<joey> - Well I think like the
craziest in terms of </joey>
<joey> taxi drivers I've had
are probably in China. </joey>
<joey> I remember there was this one taxi journey </joey>
<joey> I had in China where it
was literally like I was </joey>
<joey> in a crazy taxi game. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like this guy was full-on fucking, </joey>
<connor> he might as well have just been like </connor>
<connor> drifting initial D style. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> And he was like in the
middle of fucking Shanghai, </connor>
<connor> and whenever there would
be pedestrians on the road, </connor>
<connor> he wouldn't slow down. </connor>
<connor> He was like tapping his horn </connor>
<connor> like it was a fucking quick time event. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - That's extra dumb shit. </connor>
<connor> - Like he literally had one
hand on the steering wheel </connor>
<garnt> and the other hand on the horn, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause that's how often he tapping it man. </garnt>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had never like feared for my life. </garnt>
<connor> - You go to Chinese driving
school and they're like, </connor>
<connor> right so roll the window down pre </connor>
<connor> so that you get ready to
shout at people (laughing) </connor>
<connor> and make sure your hand is
always on the middle, (laughing) </connor>
<connor> steering is optional. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God man. </connor>
<connor> - I mean you told us
about the story before </connor>
<joey> about the situation that </joey>
<garnt> was not (murmuring) right?
- Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I've just had weird taxi journeys </garnt>
<joey> what can I say.
- You have. </joey>
<joey> - It's just Asia seems to
have some weird fucking taxis. </joey>
<garnt> - That's just Asia and driving rules </garnt>
<joey> in general right?
- Oh yeah that's true. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Which is why like we were talking </joey>
<joey> about bad taxi experiences in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I don't think I've had an even like </connor>
<connor> a bad mediocre experience in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Everything has just.
- No it's good. </connor>
<garnt> - Got the job done. </garnt>
<garnt> - If anything the best taxi rides I've had </garnt>
<joey> have been in country like Japan. </joey>
<joey> - In Japan right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Everything's metered, </joey>
<garnt> you don't have to worry about
tipping or anything like that. </garnt>
<connor> I mean sometimes Japan
has been the only country </connor>
<connor> where I wish tipping culture was a thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I wish it was a tipper.
- Yeah right. </connor>
<connor> - Because I wanted to tip that taxi driver </connor>
<joey> who took me on a tour </joey>
<joey> of different wineries.
- Yeah same. </joey>
<joey> - Without asking and stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> I'm like please let me.
- Lemme give you money. </joey>
<joey> - Give you extra money. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah we were all fully
prepared to like pay the extra, </garnt>
<garnt> because he was taking us
around the scenic route </garnt>
<connor> and he's like no, no, no, no it's okay. </connor>
<connor> Stay the price, I'm
just like, bro come on. </connor>
<connor> - I want you to go home
tonight and treat yourself. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Get something nice. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Speaking of like giving five-stars </joey>
<joey> and one-stars and stuff like that, </joey>
<connor> have we ever talked about </connor>
<garnt> what the reviewing
mentality is here in Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just in terms of everything. </garnt>
<connor> - I noticed that right
away when I moved here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - How like nothing on
Amazon is above four stars. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not just on Amazon, </garnt>
<connor> like everything on Google Reviews. </connor>
<joey> - Google maps, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Hardly anything is above four stars. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if it is then it's
only like two reviews right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They do use Google Reviews </connor>
<joey> mainly for like restaurants and stuff, </joey>
<joey> but there's also a thing called Tabelog, </joey>
<joey> a lot of people who think
there food critics use. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the Yelp of Japan basically. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, it's insane, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like these people
review these food restaurants </joey>
<connor> and like three stars for
restaurant is considered good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's like it's done
it, it's impressive. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Because I remember when
I first moved to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and whenever you'd look
up restaurants on Google, </garnt>
<connor> you'd see like 3, 3.5 stars,
maybe the occasional 4, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And in England or in America </connor>
<connor> when I see a three-star restaurant, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like yo something's gone wrong. </garnt>
<joey> - If it's below a four then I'm
just like up with this place </joey>
<connor> - Someone found a rat in
their food or something man </connor>
<connor> like I don't know.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I don't understand it's like, </joey>
<joey> do the Japanese think that
the stars on Google Reviews </joey>
<joey> is like Michelin stars? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean I understand it
because they actually. </garnt>
<garnt> I respect that they have a mentality </garnt>
<garnt> where they literally actually use </garnt>
<garnt> every star in the review system. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like the MAL review right? </joey>
<joey> - Anything below seven is shit. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure MAL users don't realize </joey>
<joey> that under five stars actually exists. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's either
like seven if it's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Six is really bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Six is really bad </garnt>
<garnt> and like five is the most
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> awful anime you've ever watched. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause for like a restaurant </connor>
<connor> the way I imagine it is like, </connor>
<joey> what would I tell the owner </joey>
<joey> if he was right in front of me now? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - Like would I genuinely
sit there and be like, </connor>
<connor> this was a three-star experience, </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How are you gonna do
that to the poor guy, </connor>
<connor> he's just trina run a business right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's 'cause to me you know, </connor>
<connor> if I go somewhere I really like the food, </connor>
<connor> I have nothing bad about it, </connor>
<connor> how in good faith can I be like, </connor>
<connor> yeah you don't deserve five stars. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause there was nothing wrong with it. </connor>
<joey> Like this was exactly what I wanted, </joey>
<joey> I got what I needed. </joey>
<connor> Yeah it wasn't fine dining, </connor>
<connor> it wasn't crazy but
there was nothing wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry go on.
- Oh sorry </connor>
<joey> I was gonna say like that's
the thing I wanna ask </joey>
<joey> about these like super harsh
Japanese reviews right? </joey>
<connor> It's like what is a five-star? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like do you want
a blow job from the chef? </joey>
<connor> - Because this is also
another thing where like, </connor>
<connor> can you judge really a restaurant
the same way McDonald's? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because what I was gonna say is, </garnt>
<joey> even the fine dining restaurants
are the same star ratings, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's because they
expect a fine dining experience, </joey>
<connor> so if they get the fine dining experience. </connor>
<connor> - That's standard, </connor>
<connor> that's normal.
- That's standard, </connor>
<connor> you've done the job and
so that makes me wonder, </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck would a
fine dining restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> have to do to get a four or five-star man? </garnt>
<connor> - It blows my mind 'cause like I said, </connor>
<connor> like comparing McDonald's to
like a fine dining experience, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they really shouldn't
be on the same scale right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're totally different things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So when you go to McDonald's, </joey>
<joey> what are you judging about McDonald's? </joey>
<joey> Are you judging the place, the food? </joey>
<joey> What are you judging? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the food isn't gonna change really. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's probably not
gonna be any different. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- The only thing </joey>
<joey> that determines a good McDonald's
experience or a bad one </joey>
<joey> is like how fast the food comes out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that's what I
see on Google Reviews, </joey>
<connor> i'll see a two-star McDonald's
and i'll see a four-star, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like what is the difference? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like ultimately I cannot
tell the difference, </connor>
<joey> yes it might be dirty or whatever. </joey>
<connor> - I had three less fries
than I ordered last time. </connor>
<connor> - That's what confuses me
because then I'm also like, </connor>
<connor> okay so if I rate this
McDonald's a five-star, </connor>
<garnt> what am I rating it a five-star on? </garnt>
<garnt> Am I rating it on a
five-star because I have. </garnt>
<garnt> - Compared to other McDonald's? </garnt>
<connor> - Compared to you know. </connor>
<garnt> - A bigger question is, </garnt>
<connor> who the fuck is rating
McDonald's on Google? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Who are you people? </garnt>
<connor> - Who is that boy?
- I don't do that. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It must be okay not to
be rude but you know, </connor>
<garnt> people who are like </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's my only fine dining experience. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I will review every McDonald's I go to. </connor>
<joey> - People who call them
McDonald's a restaurant </joey>
<joey> are the same people will
call motels, hotels you know. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
You know? </joey>
<connor> - I've noticed that every single </connor>
<connor> like really, really
high-rated place in Japan </connor>
<connor> like 4.5 or higher. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is normally like a disgusting
wait time to get the food. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because when you get
to that star in Japan, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like you get almost like a fandom, </garnt>
<garnt> like a hype around you.
- A cult following. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and then everyone
starts telling everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like yo, yo this
has got a 4.5-star. </garnt>
<garnt> - You gotta go there
early, you gotta line up, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like well fuck now
I can't enjoy the place. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> There gotta make it a three-day
in-advance reservation. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I noticed that as well,
Japan's restaurant culture </garnt>
<garnt> especially if something
is highly acclaimed, </garnt>
<garnt> it all spreads via word of mouth. </garnt>
<joey> - The Japanese love lining up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I don't know, </garnt>
<connor> I don't get that. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> They love lining up.
- As a British person, </joey>
<connor> I can appreciate a good queue. </connor>
<garnt> - As a British person I can
appreciate a good queue as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but not to a restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - I can't fucking stand queues dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah if I wanna go to a good
restaurant that's exclusive, </garnt>
<connor> please let me book it. </connor>
<connor> Please, Please.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want another Gacha
system, I don't wanna line up. </connor>
<connor> I want just to have a booking
and a specific time I turn up </connor>
<garnt> or you could be like us and
try to book a table at Denny's, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> and completely fail. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause we always eat Denny's
before we record a podcast </joey>
<joey> and we had one of the guests over </joey>
<joey> and we're like oh shit
that's a lot of people, </joey>
<joey> we might have to book a table at Danny's . </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So we were like hey, Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - Which to give context, </joey>
<joey> it's like trying to book
a table at McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So Meilyne.
- You guys know Denny's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Called up Denny's </garnt>
<connor> and was like uh can we
book a table for six? </connor>
<connor> and the guy came back and was like. </connor>
<connor> - This is a Denny's man.
- What is booking? </connor>
<connor> This is a Denny's.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Why are you trying to book
a fucking table? (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Just come to the restaurant, please. </joey>
<connor> - Man this is Denny's.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wasn't it like he called
like the manager or something. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Then he said like
wait I'm going to get someone, </connor>
<connor> he comes back and he was like </connor>
<connor> uhh this is Denny's we
don't do reservations. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - We don't do reservations.
- We don't do reservations </connor>
<connor> Yeah.
- This is a fucking Denny's. </connor>
<connor> - It's so exclusive, you
have to turn up on the day. </connor>
<garnt> - It's the most polite
way you can just say, </garnt>
<connor> it's a fucking Denny's why
are you calling for bookings? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah what the fuck's wrong with you? </garnt>
<connor> - But also even like going
back to normal reviews </connor>
<connor> with products like all the
products are like that as well, </connor>
<garnt> - and like.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - If you see something
with fully five stars </joey>
<joey> on Amazon with over like 20 reviews, </joey>
<joey> you're like damn this must be the shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or they're paying for those reviews. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember when I was buying a, </joey>
<joey> going back last week, buying a bed. </joey>
<joey> I could not find a bed
over three stars on Amazon. </joey>
<joey> - No I couldn't either, I remember that. </joey>
<joey> - Like there was no bed </joey>
<joey> that was above three stars and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> how many problems are
people having with beds? </joey>
<joey> and I would go to the reviews </joey>
<joey> to read what they were saying </joey>
<joey> and they were all saying
that the build was too long </joey>
<joey> and that was the problem. </joey>
<garnt> - That just sounds like your problem bro. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had some of the
most pedantic reviews </connor>
<joey> on Japanese Amazon.
- They get so iffy wit it. </joey>
<connor> - I've had like someone one-star a product </connor>
<joey> because the packaging was bad. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's a really common problem. </joey>
<joey> - The product's completely fine
the packaging was a bit off. </joey>
<garnt> So they were like, one-stars. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah that's what drives me insane, </connor>
<connor> is that they almost
always review this shit </connor>
<connor> around what you're actually reviewing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like oh the delivery
man had a bad attitude, </joey>
<connor> One-star.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's bullshit, if the
package is a little beat up, </connor>
<connor> but the thing's totally fine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Fantastic. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah you're gonna throw
out the packaging anyway. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Who the fuck cares. </joey>
<joey> - I don't give a fuck, </joey>
<connor> as long as I can use the
thing I need so what? </connor>
<connor> This shouldn't be a blight on
the company that sent me it. </connor>
<connor> Like this is fucking absurd, </connor>
<connor> I guess I remember as I
brought it up to Chris as well, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was confused </connor>
<connor> and Chris was telling
me that Riotro told him </connor>
<connor> it's something like,
three is what you expect, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- and it is good </connor>
<connor> and then five is like above and beyond. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To get five stars, it has
to be beyond exceptional, </connor>
<connor> like beyond what you wanted. </connor>
<joey> Whereas I think for me
five-star should be like, </joey>
<connor> all right this is what I paid for, </connor>
<connor> you gave me exactly what I asked for </connor>
<connor> no problems, five stars I
don't know weird, weird. </connor>
<connor> I guess it's different cultures. </connor>
<garnt> - How do you guys feel
about seasonal products </garnt>
<connor> here in Japan? </connor>
<joey> Because, you know every
country in the world has, </joey>
<joey> like seasonal products.
- Do we? </joey>
<joey> - And stuff but I feel.
- I guess so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just not as heavily
advertised as us here. </joey>
<joey> - But like Japan take
it to the next level. </joey>
<garnt> Whereas half the shelf sometimes I feel, </garnt>
<garnt> is like seasonal products. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah everything is seasonal, </garnt>
<garnt> everything is premium as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I get it now, </joey>
<connor> I remember they would talk
about it in the anime. </connor>
<connor> They were like.
- (laughing) In the anime. </connor>
<connor> - They're like you don't know the pain </connor>
<connor> until your favorite item has
been removed from the Konbini. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel that as well
- Because so many items </garnt>
<garnt> that I just liked and for some reason, </garnt>
<connor> the items that I specifically like </connor>
<connor> would just randomly get removed. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - From the Konbini,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I'd be like oh
it'll be back next week. </joey>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, every
time I walk into a Konbini </joey>
<garnt> and I see something is like new. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like oh I might
grab one of those you know. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna try it, I
don't wanna get attached. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's exactly
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> how I feel now.
- To be betrayed. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like so many
times living in Japan, </connor>
<connor> I go to a Konbini, I
try out this new product </connor>
<connor> that's only available for spring, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like the spring special. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or the winter special
products try, absolutely love it </connor>
<connor> and then a few months later, </connor>
<connor> it just disappears.
- It's gone. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like fuck man I want it now, </connor>
<connor> you've given me a craving
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> and you've removed the craving </connor>
<garnt> and now I'm gonna have to wait all year. </garnt>
<garnt> - For it to maybe come back. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah for it to maybe come back, </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it might not even come back. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate that when they like bring out </joey>
<joey> like a new Strong Zero flavor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like man this is way better </joey>
<joey> than the standard flavors
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> too bad it's only around for two weeks </joey>
<joey> and i'll never see it
again once it's gone. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause it's not just like items, </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes there's like menu items </garnt>
<joey> in like restaurants as well.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That are only available
during certain seasons. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I feel the
biggest problem with that </joey>
<joey> is that the one thing in Japanese </joey>
<joey> like especially supermarkets
and restaurants, </joey>
<connor> they love to do that whole like, </connor>
<connor> seasonal premium shit with fruits. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> - We've gone out, we've ranted </connor>
<connor> about fruits so many times.
- We've ranted about fruits, </connor>
<connor> but like I remember like I went to uh. </connor>
<connor> I don't remember, no it was a Royal Host. </connor>
<connor> I went to Royal host </connor>
<connor> and they were doing this like
seasonal thing with grapes. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Like the green grapes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I remember this.
- Like the muskets </connor>
<connor> and I tried a few of them
'cause I liked green grapes </connor>
<connor> and I was like oh this is really nice. </connor>
<connor> Went back the next week and it was gone </connor>
<garnt> I'm like fucking hell, this
is really premium isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
It's like I swear it was </garnt>
<garnt> only on the menu for like three days </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
and it's just gone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I swear they take
like limited time sales </garnt>
<garnt> to like another level here.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it feels like a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> are just very limited. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a limited edition something, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a limited edition product. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean you know one can argue </joey>
<joey> that that's like very good marketing. </joey>
<garnt> - It is very good marketing I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like people will look
at something premium, </garnt>
<joey> being like well I guess
if I can only get it now, </joey>
<connor> I should get it now. </connor>
<connor> - It is kinda cool going into a place </connor>
<connor> and just having stuff being new constantly </connor>
<connor> but then there is also the fact of like </connor>
<connor> yeah I did really like this one thing </connor>
<connor> and you took it away from me. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing)
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So I'm very attached.
- 'Cause it's like </connor>
<garnt> the same thing whenever you
travel to a new prefecture </garnt>
<garnt> or something and there's every prefecture. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we talked about it before, </garnt>
<garnt> every prefecture has a specialty </garnt>
<garnt> and an item you can only
get in that prefecture. </garnt>
<joey> - Every prefecture will tell you that, </joey>
<garnt> this is the best rice in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Every prefecture will tell you, </garnt>
<joey> it's all the fucking same. </joey>
<garnt> - So like definitely living in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I've tried more, </garnt>
<garnt> like I've gone out of my comfort zone </garnt>
<garnt> with trying new products </garnt>
<garnt> and new sweets and new
foods and everything </garnt>
<garnt> but at the same time I've
just found more cravings </garnt>
<garnt> that I can't get on a
normal basis anymore, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
Because it's only available </garnt>
<garnt> from a certain prefecture. </garnt>
<joey> - What was the fucking maple
cakes that we bought from. </joey>
<garnt> - Manju. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah the Manju that we
bought from Hiroshima. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah.
- Those were so fucking good </connor>
<connor> but the problem is you can only buy them </connor>
<connor> in fucking Hiroshima. </connor>
<joey> So it's just like cool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I'm not really a sweet person </joey>
<connor> but then like we bought those, </connor>
<garnt> and I ate one and I was like
fuck I wanna eat all of them. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
- I was really pissed off </garnt>
<garnt> that I bought a tiny box.
- And I only bought </garnt>
<connor> a tiny box fuck.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Could have gotten the pack of 24 </garnt>
<garnt> but instead I got the pack of eight. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause you never know, </joey>
<garnt> Sometimes you go you
try out this new thing, </garnt>
<joey> you're like it's all right, </joey>
<joey> it's mid it's whatever right? </joey>
<garnt> But sometimes you find
that really amazing product </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like fuck.
- Fuck I need it. </garnt>
<joey> - But then on the contrary
isn't it amazing when you find </joey>
<garnt> that one regional thing </garnt>
<garnt> that you think you're
never gonna see in Tokyo, </garnt>
<garnt> and then just one random shop sells it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah true.
- Fuck yeah man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck yeah, </garnt>
<connor> like I remember in Tochigi for example, </connor>
<garnt> they had this thing called Lemon Milk. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - which I fucking love, it
was a regional specific thing </garnt>
<garnt> for the longest time and
I was like well fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> I gotta make a trip up to
Tochigi every time I want this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I would always buy it in bulk </garnt>
<connor> when I would come back home,
- Naturally. </connor>
<connor> - but of course it doesn't last, right? </connor>
<connor> And then the craving comes back </connor>
<connor> and I get fucking regressions. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> But then I remember I walked </connor>
<connor> into like a random Konbini once </connor>
<connor> and they were just selling it. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like fucking
El Dorado you know, </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
it was just like ah </joey>
<joey> the secret was here all along. </joey>
<connor> Fucking bought all that
shit then brought it back </connor>
<joey> and like all right note
put it on Google maps, </joey>
<joey> this is the Konbini that
sells the Lemon Milk. </joey>
<connor> - The Sapporo special thingy beer, </connor>
<connor> what is it?
What's it called again? </connor>
<connor> - Sapporo beer? </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> What's the prefecture called? </connor>
<connor> Hokkaido. </connor>
<connor> - Hokkaido.
- Hokkaido yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty forgot for a second there, </connor>
<connor> yeah Hokkaidom the Sapporo
beer tastes way better </connor>
<joey> when they have like the
actual Sapporo beer. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It tastes so good, </joey>
<joey> I wanted to bring so
much back but it's heavy. </joey>
<joey> - Does it actually make
a difference, though? </joey>
<garnt> - I genuinely think it tastes much better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think Sapporo in Japan tastes worse </garnt>
<garnt> than I remember it tasting abroad. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's 'cause I have
it way more often now </garnt>
<garnt> but when I had Sapporo like.
- Hmm. </garnt>
<garnt> - On tap somewhere else I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh this is so much better than
the other beer that we have. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but I think it's because
you're comparing it </garnt>
<garnt> to other beers right? </garnt>
<joey> Like I remember Asahi tasting </joey>
<garnt> infinitely better in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah now it tastes shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now it tastes like shit.
- I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah Asahi does taste bad.
- But now I'm more scared </garnt>
<connor> to go back to Australia and
have the shit beer in Australia, </connor>
<connor> I'm like
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> if I think Asahi is mid now, </garnt>
<garnt> which used to be like God-tier before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna drink a VB right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I feel like I'm gonna
throw up drinking that shit. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't imagine going
back and going like, </garnt>
<garnt> drinking a Carling again. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh God.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Carling is like piss water in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like one of the worst beers </garnt>
<garnt> and there'll be sports bars in Japan </garnt>
<connor> that are like we're
partnered with Carling. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know.
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - We sell Carling and Carlsberg here. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen that before 'cause. </connor>
<connor> - Or Budweiser. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah Budweiser. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause I've seen
like special restaurants. </connor>
<connor> They sell like this Thai
beer called Singha beer </connor>
<connor> and it's like in Thailand, </connor>
<joey> it's like the dirtiest, </joey>
<joey> cheapest beer you can get.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like they don't even put it on tap, </joey>
<joey> they put it in like a can, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean?
- Oh the tinnies, </joey>
<joey> the tinnies are the fucking worst. </joey>
<joey> - And in Japan they're on a menu, </joey>
<garnt> like 500 yen for a little
can of Singha beer, </garnt>
<garnt> fresh from Thailand. </garnt>
<joey> - Who is gonna go to Japan and be like, </joey>
<joey> oh we have exclusive Heineken
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> in bottle, 700 yen
please, it's like What no. </joey>
<garnt> - Yo Heineken in Amsterdam </garnt>
<connor> is fucking great.
- Yeah it's very good. </connor>
<garnt> - Heineken in Amsterdam is good. </garnt>
<connor> - Beer wherever it's brewed is the best. </connor>
<joey> - Well yeah.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like you know, I had a fucking uh, </joey>
<connor> oh my God I'm blanking
here the Irish one uh. </connor>
<connor> - Guinness. </connor>
<connor> - Guinness. </connor>
<connor> - Guinness in Ireland is
like infinitely better. </connor>
<garnt> - Guinness in Ireland does hits different. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's fucking amazing </garnt>
<garnt> but then I had a Guinness here on tap. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you do that? </garnt>
<joey> - Because they were having it on tap, </joey>
<joey> so I'm like I was curious. </joey>
<joey> I was like all right well,
Guinness in Ireland is so good. </joey>
<garnt> - I do that every time as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I was like oh
they have Guinness on tap </joey>
<garnt> here in Japan, let me see. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why'd you do it just to
get hurt all over again? </garnt>
<connor> - Because you hold out the hope right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You hold out the hope
of maybe this is the one, </connor>
<joey> maybe this is the place that recreate. </joey>
<joey> - It's like this pub
might be the SSR pool. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like this might be the one. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe this is the one and
every time I get disappointed. </garnt>
<connor> - It's never gonna be the one. </connor>
<connor> It's never gonna be the one. </connor>
<joey> - I was like every time I
see like Irish Pub in Tokyo, </joey>
<garnt> I was like,
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that the one? </garnt>
<joey> Is that the one place that I can go? </joey>
<garnt> - It's 'cause it's not even
Tokyo it's worldwide for me, </garnt>
<garnt> and like every time I
see a Guinness on tap. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- 'Cause it has to be on tap </joey>
<joey> never that canned shit. </joey>
<connor> - Oh no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - But like it has to be on tap, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm like it's on tap, </connor>
<connor> maybe this is the one. </connor>
<connor> Maybe they figured out the
secret and I'm still waiting. </connor>
<connor> If anyone in the world
has ever tasted a Guinness </connor>
<garnt> outside of Ireland that tastes as good </garnt>
<connor> as in Ireland.
- They're delusional </connor>
<garnt> if they think so.
- Please, please hit me up. </garnt>
<connor> - I need to know. </connor>
<connor> I need to know where that is.
- And I will literally travel </connor>
<garnt> to that fucking place to try it. </garnt>
<connor> - Why not just travel to Ireland Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Well yeah i'll just go
to Ireland at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> - No I'm curious, I'm curious
to see if there's any place </garnt>
<connor> outside of Ireland. </connor>
<garnt> - It doesn't travel well you know? </garnt>
<connor> That's the sad truth of it Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - It's like Kangaroo as well, </joey>
<joey> like that shit does not travel. </joey>
<connor> - I'm okay with that staying
in Australia actually. </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
- Dude I had a kangaroo steak </joey>
<connor> here in Japan at an outback steakhouse </connor>
<connor> of all fucking places.
- Why? </connor>
<connor> - Just 'cause I was curious </connor>
<connor> and I was like man this
shit does not travel, </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
I found that out on that day </joey>
<joey> that kangaroo does not travel. </joey>
<connor> - You know what's also bizarre? </connor>
<connor> When I was in Hokkaido,
I was at a train station, </connor>
<connor> and it was like 11:00 am. </connor>
<garnt> - Hmm.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There were so many people drinking beer, </garnt>
<joey> in the station.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just like everyone every kind of like, </connor>
<connor> you know group you can imagine, </connor>
<connor> like young girls, old men, young men </connor>
<connor> they were all just
chilling in the station, </connor>
<connor> just drinking a Sapporo beer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm like this is weird right? </connor>
<connor> Everyone's just drinking
beer at like 11:00 am. </connor>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> It's in the train station
like the public waiting area, </connor>
<connor> it's just so bizarre. </connor>
<joey> - It's like that in Okinawa as well </joey>
<connor> but instead of beer it's alimony, </connor>
<connor> which is essentially just
really fucking strong shit, </connor>
<joey> it's basically Okinawan vodka. </joey>
<joey> That's the only way to describe it. </joey>
<garnt> - I forget sometimes about
the public drinking laws here, </garnt>
<connor> which you can drink publicly here, </connor>
<connor> because I feel like I didn't expect </connor>
<connor> to see so many people drinking
in the daytime in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Like I get surprised when
I see an Izakaya open, </connor>
<connor> because I'm like, who the
fuck is going to an Izakaya, </connor>
<connor> like 12:00 am for lunch. </connor>
<connor> - You'll see 'em and
they'll be drinking a Bevy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I never thought that the concept </connor>
<garnt> of like lunchtime beer was a thing here </garnt>
<garnt> until I saw it for myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And I was like wow, </garnt>
<garnt> they're actually having lunch and beer. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's always like the
people you don't expect, </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's always like
the old people right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- The old retired people, </connor>
<connor> who are just like hey, let's
just have a lunchtime beer. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah let's crack open
a beer like at 12:00 pm. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair in the UK, it's
all the old people do as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah it's true. </joey>
<connor> - If you ever go to
Wetherspoons at midday, </connor>
<connor> you'll always see the same
old people downing pints </connor>
<connor> at like 12:00 and you're like it's okay </connor>
<garnt> they'll be asleep by 4:00 anyways. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah it's true. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't matter. </connor>
<garnt> - Like speaking of like little seasonal </garnt>
<garnt> and regional stuff that
you can only get in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> has there been anything you've, </connor>
<connor> like any little products </connor>
<connor> or anything you've missed from home </connor>
<connor> or from any other country at all </connor>
<connor> that you like actively get a craving for? </connor>
<connor> - You know I have Garnt.
- Oh man. </connor>
<connor> - I know you have Connor. </connor>
<joey> - My parents shipped
out Pot Noodles to me. </joey>
<joey> - Oh (laughing). </joey>
<connor> - Because I do like the ramen
cup noodles they have here. </connor>
<garnt> - I die a little inside
whenever I hear Connor say that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because right? </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying that the
pot noodles in the UK, </connor>
<connor> which will be on screen, </connor>
<connor> are better than the ones in Japan, </connor>
<connor> I don't think that.
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - I think the Japanese ones
are superior in every way. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But there's something
familiar and comforting </joey>
<joey> about the flavor. </joey>
<joey> - It's nostalgia right? </joey>
<joey> - And also it's very spicy </joey>
<joey> which unfortunately.
- Oh. </joey>
<joey> That's hard to come by here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's really spicy,
it's good shit, I love it </joey>
<joey> and so my parents for Christmas, </joey>
<connor> because you know ever since you
start making your own money, </connor>
<connor> it's like right I buy
everything I want for myself. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So they're like what can we get you? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like well you can get me something </connor>
<connor> I can't get myself. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right.
- And not love, none of that. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just send me Pot Noodles from the UK </connor>
<connor> and they're like Pot Noodles? </connor>
<joey> I'm like yes, please send
me Pot Noodles, so they did. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- It was amazing. </joey>
<connor> - I always asked my parents.
- I teared up. </connor>
<connor> - To send me like Australian sweets </connor>
<connor> and something like that.
- Tim Tams perhaps? </connor>
<garnt> - No we can get Tim Tams here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well they suck anyway. </garnt>
<joey> - What?
You don't like Tim Tams? </joey>
<garnt> - Hello they're overrated. </garnt>
<connor> Every Australian swears by them, </connor>
<joey> like it's national pride or something. </joey>
<joey> - It is national pride. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - It's just a biscuit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God get out of here. </connor>
<connor> - I think a biscuit is like,
the most underwhelming sweet. </connor>
<connor> Like it's hard it's never satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<connor> - Like soft cookies are way better </connor>
<connor> than hard cookies as well.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - What do you think Joey?
- Oh I get that, I get that. </joey>
<joey> But like we also have like. </joey>
<garnt> Wait so do you guys consider
Tim Tams to be hard cookies? </garnt>
<garnt> - No biscuits. </garnt>
<garnt> - Biscuits oh hard biscuits, rather? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah there hard biscuits.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> What's the difference? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause that's a soft biscuit to us, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we have these things called. </connor>
<connor> - What you eating rocks for hard biscuits? </connor>
<connor> - We have these things
called Anzac cookies, </connor>
<connor> which are literally rocks. </connor>
<connor> - Like I don't wanna have to worry. </connor>
<connor> - Kids break teeth trying to eat these. </connor>
<connor> - I don't wanna have to worry.
- That's not a cookie. </connor>
<joey> - If I have to worry about breaking my. </joey>
<joey> - It is a cookie. </joey>
<connor> - If I have to worry about
breaking my goddamn teeth, </connor>
<connor> it's not a fucking cookie.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Anzac biscuits are fucking. </joey>
<joey> Like Australians watching this would know, </joey>
<garnt> Anzac biscuits are fucking awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just sounds like a
health hazard with eggs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't want it.
- It is a health hazard. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like chewing. </garnt>
<joey> Dude you could work out your jawline </joey>
<joey> eating this fucking cookie. </joey>
<connor> Like it's so tough. </connor>
<connor> - We had these growing up. </connor>
<connor> I still have these in the UK obviously, </connor>
<garnt> but they're called Digestifs, </garnt>
<garnt> did you like those? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- Suggestives? </garnt>
<garnt> - Digestif biscuits.
- Digestif biscuits </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Digestifs they're called. </garnt>
<connor> - That is not appealing at all. </connor>
<garnt> - I realized that's not
a very fitting name. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - They were awful, I never liked them. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the fuck is a Digestif biscuit? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like the most
plain biscuit you can get </connor>
<garnt> and it's got like a soft layer
of chocolate covered on top. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the chocolate is shit chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> and the biscuit is like just dry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a milk biscuit or? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no it's
like a wheat biscuit, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's what it looks like. </garnt>
<connor> - A wheat biscuit?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God that doesn't look
good at all (laughing). </connor>
<connor> - Because you're supposed to like dip it </connor>
<connor> with tea and coffee and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - But then sometimes you dip it </connor>
<connor> in your hot tea and it falls apart </connor>
<connor> and your fucking tea's ruined. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But you can do that
with a Tim Tam as well. </joey>
<garnt> - But I can't do that.
- That's too much chocolates </garnt>
<joey> put in the tea basically. </joey>
<joey> There needs to be like a
perfect chocolate ratio, </joey>
<joey> chocolate-to-biscuit ratio, </joey>
<joey> 'cause Tim Tam's like
covered in chocolate right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's too much. </garnt>
<garnt> - If the chocolate starts melting </garnt>
<garnt> on your fingers as you dip it
in tea that's like too much. </garnt>
<joey> - You never done a Tim Tam straw before? </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck is that? </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is that?
- That's like a thing </connor>
<connor> like you do in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - So Joey is like you never
done a flip flop kangaroo? </connor>
<connor> - Here's some Australian
culture for you all right? </connor>
<connor> So you get a Tim Tam, it
says usually you do it </connor>
<connor> with a cup of tea.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or a cup of coffee
or whatever you prefer, </connor>
<connor> you get a Tim Tam you bite both ends off. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then you use it as a straw </connor>
<joey> to suck up your tea and coffee </joey>
<joey> and it's awesome. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Is this some down under joke? </garnt>
<joey> Us in the up and over don't care. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like what the fuck?
- The up and over (laughing). </connor>
<connor> - When is something a culture </connor>
<connor> and when is it just like stupid? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's what we do, that's
what some people do. </joey>
<joey> I did it once and I was
like yeah it's cool, </joey>
<joey> I don't do it every time </joey>
<joey> but it's just a little thing
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> you can do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - We gotta find our own
fun in Australia, right? </garnt>
<joey> There isn't a lot to do. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) Exactly.
- All right. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah I don't like biscuits at all. </garnt>
<connor> - No it's definitely like the worst. </connor>
<connor> I'm not really fond of cookies either, </connor>
<connor> I think cookies are overrated. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe it's just because
UK cookies are just shit. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - No it's not </connor>
<connor> I've had cookies everywhere.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Come on. </connor>
<connor> - The fucking store brand
cookies are always shit, </connor>
<connor> fresh cookies out the oven. </connor>
<connor> When they're like, </connor>
<connor> they need to be.
- Soft, soft, soft. </connor>
<connor> - Soft and chewy I do not. </connor>
<connor> Okay my favorite cookies I can get </connor>
<joey> are actually subway cookies. </joey>
<joey> - Oh okay yeah there bomb.

<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Easily off yeah I like that, </garnt>
<connor> that is the best, good. </connor>
<connor> - If it's not fresh out the oven, </connor>
<connor> What I hate is if I bite in
a cookie and it crunches. </connor>
<connor> - Shit goes everywhere,
crumbs annihilate the room. </connor>
<connor> - If I have crumbs then I'm
like this, I this is a cookie. </connor>
<connor> This is just a biscuit with extra steps, </connor>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just a biscuit with attitude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
like my cookies to be gui. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I like it to be soft. </garnt>
<joey> - Not gonna lie I've never thought </joey>
<connor> that deeply about biscuit in my life. </connor>
<connor> - I have.
- I have because you grow up </connor>
<connor> in the UK you're watching
American cartoons </connor>
<connor> and for some reason in American
cartoons cookies are like </connor>
<connor> like I don't know the thing
that fueled the world, </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
for kids generation. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Cookies were what like
the Mayans used to barter </connor>
<connor> and negotiate these kids
shows me cookies to be </connor>
<connor> like the godsend of like everything. </connor>
<connor> So when you grow up and you can
stop buying your own things, </connor>
<joey> you're like well.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean cookies are the best treat, </connor>
<joey> then you start having them. </joey>

<joey> so I assume everybody else has one. </joey>
<joey> - It was just like cookies were
like insanely like valuable, </joey>
<connor> you know kids were dying
fighting wars on the playground </connor>
<garnt> - Like currency (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah literally it's you know? </connor>
<connor> - Cause like for me whenever

<joey> - Yeah exactly cause you gotta be like. </joey>
<joey> - 100% cookie speed right? </joey>
<garnt> - I gotta like enjoy this

<garnt> and it's like as soon
as it starts hardening, </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of the few objects in the world </garnt>
<garnt> where moist is a positive adjective. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - No I get that, I get that. </connor>
<joey> - I feel bad when people like make cookies </joey>
<joey> like the day before and they bring them </joey>
<garnt> and there like you wanna try

<garnt> - Like those and brownies like </garnt>
<connor> if I have like a dry brownie </connor>
<connor> it's like the </connor>
<garnt> limp dicks of brownies.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - A brownie does need to be a little like. </connor>
<garnt> - Wet. </garnt>
<connor> - yeah, yeah.
- Moist. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it all just fucking
crumbles apart though </garnt>
<garnt> when I touch it I'm like well.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The structural integrity
of this brownie is appalling. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's flaky then it's too dry. </garnt>
<joey> - If it's not making like a nkt, nkt sound </joey>
<garnt> as it should you know.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> If it's not making that sound </connor>
<joey> then it's a bad brownie, you feel me. </joey>
<joey> I can't be the only one that thinks that. </joey>
<joey> (Mumbling) </joey>
<connor> It needs to be like ASMR levels of </connor>
<joey> like lips smacking in your ears. </joey>
<joey> - Did your supermarkets in Australia </joey>
<joey> like have bakery sections
where they would bake things? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah we did. </joey>
<joey> - In the UK to be fair, </joey>
<garnt> they used to make pretty fucking
good cookies and brownies. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you not think so? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sainsbury's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sainsbury's would have their own bakery. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay I know the best ones
he goes Sainsbury's then </garnt>
<garnt> Tesco's then Coop cause those. </garnt>
<connor> - Do these all sound
like just made up names? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah they do.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - These are the supermarket
chains in the UK </connor>
<connor> all of them have their own bakery. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And like you get like four
fat ass cookies for a pound. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they were always like
freshly baked on the day </garnt>
<connor> and soft and they were fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - They were good cookies. </connor>
<connor> - You could buy the like
packaged ones but like </connor>
<connor> why would you do that when you could go </connor>
<connor> and get like a full box of brownies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like 16 little chunks for like quid. </connor>
<connor> That's a no brainer.
- Right and there </connor>
<garnt> freshly baked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Freshly baked.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that sounds way better. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah i'll tell you what I do miss </connor>
<connor> that I didn't think I
would dairy milk chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I liked dairy milk chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - Because I thought whenever I came </connor>
<connor> to Japan on holiday and
stuff I was like man, </connor>
<connor> the chocolate here's bomb. </connor>
<connor> I fucking loved the
taste of chocolate here. </connor>
<garnt> And then after living
here a year I just feel </garnt>
<garnt> like I've really something
homely about dairy milk. </garnt>
<connor> - No they've taken the American
way of making chocolate. </connor>
<garnt> - It does taste like American chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because what they've done
is instead of having more milk </garnt>
<connor> and making it like a richer
taste they're like hmm </connor>
<connor> let's just substitute with more sugar. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you get this kind
of weird chemically taste </connor>
<connor> which I like, Hershey's. </connor>
<connor> Hershey's tastes like in my mind </connor>
<garnt> like question marks with sugar. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like I don't know
what this tastes like, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't taste like chocolate,
it tastes like a made up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I am not a fan of Hershey's at all. </garnt>
<joey> - American chocolate does
not taste like chocolate. </joey>
<garnt> - I used to like really like Hershey's. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - I still kind of do
whenever I'm like in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not as rich, so
you could eat more of it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah because what Hershey's tastes like, </garnt>
<garnt> it tastes like cooking chocolate right. </garnt>
<joey> - Hmm. </joey>
<joey> - Oh like the melting chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - And I don't know why as a kid </joey>
<garnt> I fucking loved cooking chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well is normally for poorer quality. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah exactly.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's poorer quality but as a kid, </connor>
<connor> I just like anytime we'd cook chocolate </connor>
<joey> I just like always have
to dip my finger in it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah of course.
- Give it a quick taste </joey>
<connor> and that's what Hershey's tastes like. </connor>
<connor> So as an adult eating
Hershey's like brings me back </connor>
<connor> to being a kid and then I have two bars </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like okay
this is actually just shit. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> nostalgia gone it's
just shit chocolate now </connor>
<garnt> - Like American fan,
you have it rough man, </garnt>
<garnt> I know we clown you guys
all the time (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> but like your chocolate is fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> Please like import </joey>
<joey> some like milker or dairy milk
- Cadbury. </joey>
<joey> or something yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Cadbury milk chocolates
are the fucking best. </joey>
<joey> Cadbury's is dairy milk right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's owned by
an American company now. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But it used to be I mean </garnt>
<joey> a lot of the British
chocolate's really good. </joey>
<joey> I think that's one </joey>
<joey> of the things we actually did pretty well. </joey>
<joey> (murmuring) </joey>
<connor> Yeah I think chocolate in the
UK is really fucking good. </connor>
<garnt> - I think chocolate all over Europe </garnt>
<connor> is pretty damn fucking good.
- You guys get it from Europe. </connor>
<joey> - But it gets hella bougie </joey>
<joey> and then like the rest of Europe and like </joey>
<garnt> - Swiss chocolates and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - Swiss chocolates is fucking great. </garnt>
<connor> - It's great but it's
like seven bucks sometimes </connor>
<joey> for like a small piece .
- It's great but every time </joey>
<joey> I have a bite of Swiss chocolate, </joey>
<connor> I can feel the chocolate
entering my veins. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's a very intense.
- It's so rich. </connor>
<garnt> - Depends 'cause I think my favorite like </garnt>
<garnt> big brand Swiss chocolate is like Lindt. </garnt>
<joey> - I do like Lindt.
- Lindt's really good. </joey>
<joey> - But you gotta like sit
down after you have a bite. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
You're like arg. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - It's like doing a pint of cocaine. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fucking is you go on a journey, </garnt>
<garnt> when you take that one bite man, </garnt>
<connor> when like the truffle inside </connor>
<connor> is just like the perfect consistency. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - When you bite off the hard shell </connor>
<connor> and it just the soft truffle </connor>
<connor> and it's just like ah, it's beautiful </connor>
<connor> and my mouth is watering
just describing it. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love a good Ferrero Rocher. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh Ferrero Rocher, oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes Goddamn. </connor>
<joey> - Ferrero Rocher is fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Ferrero Rocher milkshakes
are like the best thing ever. </connor>
<garnt> - Ferrero Rocher's ice cream
is fucking good as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can like grind it
into like a milkshake </garnt>
<joey> and it's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh like DIY. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some places do it. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I increased the clause, </connor>
<connor> Whenever I say Ferrero Rocher.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's someone's porscheous word, </connor>
<connor> I can think of off the top of
my head and it sounds so good. </connor>
<connor> - I can feel the molecule
forming on my eye. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I do need to top hut every
time I say Ferrero Rocher. </joey>
<garnt> - Ferrero Rocher.
- Ferrero Rocher. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like you
experience Swiss chocolate, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't eat Swiss chocolate.
- No. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what I mean?
You eat British chocolate, </connor>
<connor> like it's something you can just eat. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - The Swiss don't do
drugs they do chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh man sometimes I like
buy like a packet of Lindt </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like I'm
having a good day today. </garnt>
<connor> - Can you eat all of the
Lindt package in one go? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I can't like </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like I
need a pallet cleanser, </garnt>
<connor> every time I have like a rich chocolate </connor>
<connor> I'm like give me the wine to go with it, </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
to empty the flavor. </connor>
<garnt> I have like the problem where
I have one, it's enough. </garnt>
<connor> - You have a sweet
tooth though, don't you? </connor>
<connor> - I do not have a sweet tooth actually. </connor>
<connor> - Bull shit you do.
- I don't. </connor>
<connor> - You always snack on sweets. </connor>
<connor> - Only in Japan actually
'cause here's the thing </connor>
<connor> I hardly ever use the snack, </connor>
<connor> I either was that guy in England </connor>
<connor> who would eat a tub of ice
cream or go without sweets </connor>
<joey> for like two weeks. </joey>
<joey> There was no in between
for me like only in Japan, </joey>
<joey> have I ever like kind of
embraced snacking culture </joey>
<joey> and that's just because there are so many </joey>
<joey> different kinds of sweets and snacks here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - They're like kina wanna
try something every time. </garnt>
<joey> - I used to be a sweet's
guy back in Australia </joey>
<joey> but then when I moved here I realized </joey>
<joey> that Japan's snack or
like confectionary section </joey>
<connor> there's a lot more savory shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That just tastes way
better than the sweet shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I always just go
for the savory shit now. </joey>
<connor> - It's easier to make
something that's tastes good </connor>
<joey> that's sweet though. </joey>
<joey> You just fucking put a shit
ton of sugar and call it a day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but I also feel gross
after eating it too right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause if you ever come
to my house in England, </joey>
<garnt> if you ask for like anything
that's not savory snack, </garnt>
<joey> I'm probably not gonna have it </joey>
<connor> because if I do have a
lindt, like a chocolate </connor>
<connor> or like a lindt box that's gone </connor>
<connor> in like a few hours
(laughing) most of the time. </connor>
<connor> That's cause I rarely buy but when I do </connor>
<garnt> I'm like super craving it I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I haven't had a Ferrero Rocher </joey>
<joey> in like probably like a year
and a half maybe two years. </joey>
<connor> - Do they sell them in Japan? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've never see them. </connor>
<joey> - If you go to like international
shops they'll have it. </joey>
<connor> - Because like in the UK that
was like the not expensive, </connor>
<connor> it's like the if you wanna look expensive </connor>
<connor> but not actually spend too much money </connor>
<connor> Ferrero Rocher's with it. </connor>
<connor> - Everything about Ferrero Rocher </connor>
<connor> it just looks fucking porsche. </connor>
<garnt> - It looks fancy, </garnt>
<garnt> it sounds fancy. But the
only thing that isn't fancy </garnt>
<garnt> is like the price tag, I
mean they're expensive, </garnt>
<connor> but compared to like Lindt or Leno </connor>
<connor> something like that it's like no. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had some super super. </garnt>
<garnt> You're talking about
Lindt and Ferrero Rocher </garnt>
<connor> being like a really like deep taste. </connor>
<connor> - Ferrero Rocher aren't that intense. </connor>
<connor> - I've had some like the
super expensive chocolates </connor>
<connor> are the ones I feel like </connor>
<garnt> you're going on a fucking battle </garnt>
<garnt> with taking a bite out of this man. </garnt>
<joey> - Ferrero Rocher is like
the premium of economy. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just a little
bit better than normal. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever had
like truly like you gone </garnt>
<connor> to like a specialist
chocolate shop kinda shop. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And tried one </garnt>
<garnt> of those chocolates. </garnt>
<garnt> - They always give you
like the super intense </garnt>
<joey> like dark chocolate 'cause
that's like the purest form </joey>
<joey> and then I eat this and I'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah tastes like fucking ash. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But do you like dark choc flavor? </joey>
<joey> - I do but there's a limit like. </joey>
<joey> - Right it's like 90% cacao. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you'll go to places
like chocolate tier places </joey>
<joey> and they'll be like
it's amazing, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> And it's like 80% like a cacao. </joey>
<garnt> And then you're like (throwing up) </garnt>
<connor> it's great, it's great.
(Laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes I have like
one bite and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> oh I've gotta fucking battle this. </connor>
<connor> - I need like two here. </connor>
<connor> - I'm having a fucking
battle with my mouth, </connor>
<connor> like trying to get this done man. </connor>
<connor> - Like I get it if I was
having like an espresso </connor>
<joey> or something to go with it </joey>
<joey> like perfect they'll wash each other out </joey>
<joey> and you know i'll feel happy. </joey>
<joey> But when you have one bite
of super dark chocolate </joey>
<joey> it fucking stays with you
for the rest of the day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it does. </joey>
<garnt> - You cannot get the
taste out of your mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I don't wanna feel like
I've just bleached my mouth. </connor>
<garnt> - I've never thought
about having chocolates </garnt>
<garnt> with like anything else actually. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? It's with
coffee, it's like the best. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you can have it with a coffee. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't eat chocolate
less it's with a hot drink. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause for me coffee and
tea I just like by it's self, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never tried, 'cause
if you dip something </garnt>
<connor> into the tea that kinda
like changes it's taste. </connor>
<connor> - No I don't dip in it, I eat it. </connor>
<garnt> - You eat it with it.
- You eat it and then </garnt>
<garnt> you drink it. </garnt>
<connor> It's like a palate cleanser.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like if your mouth is too chocolaty </connor>
<connor> you can't keep eating more chocolate. </connor>
<garnt> - I might wanna give
that a go then because. </garnt>
<connor> - Did this man never
thought to combine the two. </connor>
<joey> - No because I never yeah
I never thought about it. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Chocolate and tea unspeakable. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause chocolate was
always been a snack for me </joey>
<garnt> that I help myself.
- Why do you think that </garnt>
<connor> at like a fancy restaurant </connor>
<connor> there'll be like coffee and dessert. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's like ah ah what?.
- Coffee and Chocolates. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause they go together. </connor>
<connor> Garnt's just like wow I didn't know that. </connor>
<joey> - I thought you're supposed
to eat all the chocolate </joey>
<garnt> and then down your tea.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you telling me chocolate's
meant to be just a snack. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
and not just a dessert. </connor>
<connor> 'cause I guess that's
where I see all chocolates. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like I said I never used to snack, </connor>
<garnt> It's like it was my dessert I guess </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a full on
I'm either committed. </garnt>
<connor> - Feels very sad to have a chocolate bar </connor>
<connor> and be like ah yes dessert.
- My dessert. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause like, </connor>
<garnt> I actually like didn't start enjoying wine </garnt>
<joey> 'cause as a kid or as like
a teenager I would say </joey>
<joey> wine was like the one alcohol
that I just couldn't get into. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah same. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't understand
why people liked wine </joey>
<joey> and then I remember the
first time I tried red wine </joey>
<garnt> or good red wine with good steak </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just like an instant </garnt>
<garnt> eye opening moment for me man. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean let's be honest,
you can't really enjoy wine </connor>
<connor> unless you have a bit of
disposable income really? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know about you growing up </garnt>
<garnt> but parents would like to
think that's a waste of money. </garnt>
<connor> Which is fair enough.
- I mean unless your here. </connor>
<connor> - Even before whenever you know </connor>
<connor> you'd go out with your family </connor>
<garnt> or you're one of your rich you
know relatives or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> And you try this good expensive wine </connor>
<connor> and the only thing you can think of </connor>
<connor> this isn't fucking worth 80 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Are you're kidding me. </connor>
<connor> And to be honest I still think that </connor>
<connor> I still think any like, </connor>
<connor> I'm probably making some similar cry here </connor>
<connor> but I've never tasted like a wine above </connor>
<garnt> then let's say 50 bucks that
has tasted a lot greater </garnt>
<garnt> than some of like the best wine </garnt>
<connor> you can get in any other price. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah like a $60 wine tastes </garnt>
<connor> the same to me as like a $200 wine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I mean I've heard like you can buy wine </joey>
<garnt> at convenience stores here for
like as cheap as four bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not good wine though.
- That's really bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can taste the difference between that </garnt>
<garnt> but like the more expensive
quote-unquote wines </garnt>
<garnt> that you can buy like
a 711 is like 1000 yen </garnt>
<joey> and those are actually perfectly fine. </joey>
<joey> Like I've had a few of
those where I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> you know what? </joey>
<joey> This is actually pretty
good for 1000 yen wine. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's good for colombini
wine that's what i'll say. </garnt>
<joey> - For colombini wine it's
the best you're gonna get. </joey>
<joey> - Shout out to Alpaca wine, </joey>
<connor> What's like the equivalent
of like the cheap one? </connor>
<connor> - Echo falls. </connor>
<connor> - Echo falls. </connor>
<garnt> Alpaca wine is like the
Echo falls of Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - And in the UK it's
the cheapest wine brand. </connor>
<joey> - Like a box wine? </joey>
<joey> - There is a box version.
- It's the uni brand. </joey>
<joey> - Oh uni wine.
- It's about four pound </joey>
<connor> for a bottle and it's like always flavored </connor>
<connor> like a kids drink
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> it's like lemon and grapefruit </joey>
<joey> and it just tastes like
anti-freeze with grape hint. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah we have that in Australia </joey>
<joey> just tastes like washing
detergent grape flavored. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's fucking awful. </connor>
<joey> - It's fucking gross. </joey>
<joey> - But you know what else I'm grateful for? </joey>
