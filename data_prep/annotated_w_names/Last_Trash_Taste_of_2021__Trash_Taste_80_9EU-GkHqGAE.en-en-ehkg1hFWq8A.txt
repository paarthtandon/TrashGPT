<connor> (cheerful music) - You have one week left </connor>
<connor> to get your Apari/Trash Taste merch. </connor>
<connor> (Joey yelling) - [Connor] That's right. </connor>
<connor> Only one week left to grab it. Grab it now! </connor>
<joey> - It has beautiful embroideries on it, </joey>
<joey> like the After Dark design </joey>
<joey> and the regular Trash Taste design, </joey>
<joey> as well as T-shirts and sweat pants. </joey>
<garnt> Show it off Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> - Look at this, look at this, Look at this. </joey>
<garnt> You know what, this is the first time </garnt>
<garnt> light mode is gonna look this good. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's embroidery we wanted it to last this time. </connor>
<connor> The merch is a little bit more pricey than before, </connor>
<connor> but it will last. </connor>
<connor> And it will be around for a long time. </connor>
<connor> And the quality is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - We've promoted Apari many times </garnt>
<garnt> and every time their merch sells out. </garnt>
<garnt> So we know you love their quality. </garnt>
<joey> - And of course for every person who does buy </joey>
<joey> any of the Trash Taste items, </joey>
<joey> you'll get a special </joey>
<joey> personalized postcard from the boys. Just for you. </joey>
<connor> - So you have one week left to get your merch. </connor>
<connor> And I gotta be honest. </connor>
<connor> If you ever approach us wearing this Trash Taste merch, </connor>
<joey> you'll get a firm crisp hug and a handshake from me. </joey>
<joey> - A chef's kiss as well. (Joey smacks lips) </joey>
<connor> - Maybe a kiss on the lips, who knows, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> ♪ It's the final countdown ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey mimicking final countdown) </garnt>
<connor> - We can't get out on (Connor mumbling). </connor>
<connor> No copyright claim, no copyright claim. </connor>
<joey> - So if you'd like to grab your hands </joey>
<joey> on the Trash Taste merch </joey>
<joey> because after next week it's gonna be gone forever. </joey>
<garnt> Go down, links in the description below. </garnt>
<garnt> Grab some for yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to The episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (sound of water splashing) - I need to hydrate man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's some water please? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh dear my throat is awfully parched. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt sipping) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) - Is it quenched now? </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle music) </garnt>
<connor> Do you know where I learned </connor>
<connor> the words "Parched" and "Quenched?" </connor>
<connor> (Connor burps) - [Garnt] Where? </connor>
<connor> - (chuckles) Nintendogs, really. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] What? they use that language? </connor>
<connor> - (chuckles) Because in Nintendogs, </connor>
<connor> when it says that you need to give your dog water, </connor>
<connor> it says "Parched." </connor>
<connor> And then when you give the dog water, </connor>
<joey> it says "Quenched." (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - I think I learned the word "Parched" </garnt>
<garnt> in from the film "Inside Man" or "Inside Job." </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember which one it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's "Inside Man." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's an interrogation. </garnt>
<garnt> There's an interrogation scene. </garnt>
<garnt> And the guy's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can you give me some water please? My throat is parched." </garnt>
<garnt> And then the guy was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Bro, no one says their throat is parched. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) "Shut the fuck up! </garnt>
<garnt> "Shut the fuck up and tell me what's going on?" </garnt>
<garnt> Hello and welcome to another episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) - Such a weird way </connor>
<garnt> to remember a word. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I don't know (chuckles). </garnt>
<connor> - How vivid of a memory is this? </connor>
<joey> - So, where'd you guys learn new words from? </joey>
<joey> Because Like sometimes... - I just told you Nintendogs. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you just hear a word </joey>
<joey> and that like that sticks with you. </joey>
<joey> - Video games I learned </joey>
<connor> all my language form. - Video games? Movies? </connor>
<connor> - Nowadays I pronounce something incorrectly on, </connor>
<garnt> on a fuckin video or livestream. </garnt>
<connor> I got 10,000 comments and emails </connor>
<connor> telling me I pronounced it wrong. </connor>
<connor> And then, but it's a pretty good way of learning. </connor>
<joey> - I thought English was your first language bro. (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - Yes hello this is Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> It is I, the biggest Miku fan apparently. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey giggling) </joey>
<joey> - I don't simp Garnt or I did. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> you look like you're about to on Idol concert </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah so we're recording two episodes today. </garnt>
<garnt> So we have to like change clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I just gave that away. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was nothing else in the office, </garnt>
<garnt> aside from Miku stuff. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Today I am the biggest Miku fan. </connor>
<connor> And with me is of course </connor>
<connor> the second biggest Miku fan right now. </connor>
<connor> - (mumbles) Don't call me out. </connor>
<connor> This was Saddle merch bro, TM saddle. (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - I didn't even know that was Miku merch. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah it's Miku merch. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> If I turned around, </connor>
<connor> people would be able to see, </connor>
<connor> very clearly this is Miku. </connor>
<connor> - There's a big fat Miku on the back. </connor>
<connor> - We don't need to see that. </connor>
<connor> It's business in the front. </connor>
<connor> Front and the back </connor>
<garnt> - And then there's just Joey. </garnt>
<joey> the usual, whatever. - Yay! </joey>
<joey> The actual Miku fan. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah and Merry Christmas everyone! </joey>
<joey> I guess... - [Joey] Yay! </joey>
<joey> - I guess this is coming out on Christmas. </joey>
<joey> - It's also the last episode of the year. </joey>
<garnt> Supposedly. - [Connor] Yeah. Damn! </garnt>
<connor> - Because the next episode is gonna be </connor>
<joey> coming out on 1st of January. </joey>
<joey> We didn't even plan that shit out. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I guess that's just how the stars aligned. </garnt>
<garnt> When did the last episode come out of like, </garnt>
<garnt> did it come out on New Year's Eve </garnt>
<garnt> or did it come out on New Year's Day? </garnt>
<joey> - I think It came out... </joey>
<joey> Yeah like New Year's Eve I think. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember I was just getting drunk with Chris </garnt>
<joey> and that was like the first episode of the year right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I think it must've been </joey>
<garnt> after New Year's Day then. </garnt>
<joey> - That doesn't feel like a year ago. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] (laughs) It doesn't. </garnt>
<joey> - It feels like 10 years ago. </joey>
<garnt> - My God, like where did this year go? </garnt>
<garnt> Because it feels like the past two years </garnt>
<garnt> have just like flown by. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean 2020 just disappeared in a flash obviously </joey>
<joey> because everyone was just inside and depressed. </joey>
<connor> But, like this year I feel we were able </connor>
<connor> to go out a little bit more, at least in Japan. </connor>
<connor> We're able to go out a little bit more than last year. </connor>
<connor> But I think in our case we just had so much shit going on </connor>
<connor> that it all just like, seems like a blur. </connor>
<connor> - I mean was, I thought I was busy in 2020. </connor>
<connor> And then 2021 was like, </connor>
<connor> "Allow me to introduce myself." </connor>
<joey> And then, yeah... </joey>
<connor> - Every, like on the iPhone calendar. </connor>
<connor> Like when you have something on the iPhone calendar, </connor>
<connor> like you have something on that day, </connor>
<connor> there's like a little dot to symbolize it. </connor>
<connor> So, it's very easy on iPhone to see </connor>
<connor> how busy your past couple of months were. </connor>
<connor> Because every month I came up to the next month </connor>
<connor> and I was like, I'll be a lot more free next month. </connor>
<connor> Like this month was super busy. </connor>
<connor> Next month though, no dots. </connor>
<connor> Enter that month, all dots. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey chuckling) - Yeah, no time. </joey>
<joey> - It's like oh cool I have three days off last month. </joey>
<joey> No wonder I'm fuckin tired. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was really surreal seeing </garnt>
<garnt> just your calendar fill up. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember when I first moved to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought, who needs a calendar? </garnt>
<garnt> We're YouTubers, we don't need calendars. </garnt>
<garnt> We make our own schedule. </garnt>
<garnt> You move to Japan and slowly, you're just like, </garnt>
<joey> maybe I need a calendar to just to like, </joey>
<joey> keep track of like one or two days. </joey>
<joey> And then more stuff keeps creeping in </joey>
<joey> and then you're just like, oh wait! </joey>
<joey> I need to put my personal life for my calendar as well. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Because like, now I don't know </joey>
<joey> when like my mates wanna hang out </joey>
<joey> if I have something going on that day. </joey>
<connor> It's so surreal just being this busy. </connor>
<garnt> And I never expected to be this busy in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean it's definitely a good thing right? </joey>
<joey> Like it's a very... </joey>
<joey> it's definitely a very privileged position I would say. </joey>
<joey> To be busy and doing all sorts of cool stuff. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, </joey>
<joey> it's only so much my body can handle (Joey chuckles). </joey>
<garnt> - You know that scene in like, every like business movie, </garnt>
<connor> where the CEO is like, "Put it in my calendar." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I thought that was just a cliche. </connor>
<joey> - "Deborah, pencil it in." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - "Oh, do I have time for this meeting? </joey>
<joey> "Put it in my calendar." - It's only a matter of time </joey>
<garnt> until we all have our own Deborah's </garnt>
<connor> that have to pencil shit in for us. </connor>
<connor> - I think, I'd ironically want an assistant. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) - Yeah right? </connor>
<connor> - I know that sounds terrible. </connor>
<connor> I felt like what the fuck I would never want one. </connor>
<connor> Then I'm like, oh actually, </connor>
<joey> then a lot of things could be helped. </joey>
<connor> But if I had someone to help schedule things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know a couple of like YouTuber friends </joey>
<connor> who live here that have like personal assistants. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like oh my god that seems like a fuckin lifesaver. </joey>
<joey> - Oh man the thought of having </joey>
<connor> to like speak to someone. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And be like, "Hey my life's a mess. </connor>
<joey> "Can you help me?" </joey>
<connor> Like, it's not about that like, I feel... </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to explain it. </connor>
<connor> I'm embarrassed about having to get my life in order. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? That's what it is. </connor>
<connor> So, it's like going to the doctor. </connor>
<connor> I don't want you to tell me that I'm shit at health. </connor>
<connor> Like I know that. But if I go to the doctor, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna have 100% confirmation that I'm unhealthy. </connor>
<joey> - I just don't wanna be that guy who's like, </joey>
<connor> "Talk to my PA." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - "Talk to my assistant." (Joey gags) </joey>
<joey> - Let me say like, if you wanna like, </joey>
<connor> get permission for stuff. </connor>
<connor> Or get like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> You're like okay I need to be able </connor>
<connor> to like arrange all the shit </connor>
<connor> can you help you do that I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But like, I mean some days like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know about three, four days of the week. </connor>
<connor> I pretty much fill my schedule up, </connor>
<connor> from literally like eight o'clock till like midnight. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah insightful. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Good stuff doing stuff. </connor>
<connor> But I like that, I liked doing it. </connor>
<connor> And livestreaming just added a bunch of time </connor>
<connor> that it needs to be squished in there. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean you've put more work on yourself this year </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I feel like this year is the year </connor>
<connor> that you've really upped </connor>
<connor> your livestreaming schedule as like, </connor>
<connor> you basically have almost like three channels now. </connor>
<connor> You got Trash Taste, you got... </connor>
<connor> - Your main channel. </connor>
<garnt> And then you got... - I do have three channels. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your livestream channel right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah well, 'cause now I'll do livestreams </garnt>
<garnt> in the morning or the evening. </garnt>
<garnt> So, if I'm not doing something in the morning. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's say if I have something at 12 o'clock. </garnt>
<connor> Like we record Trash Taste... </connor>
<connor> Today we did to at it at 11. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But if we did it at 12, </connor>
<connor> I would be like, all right sick. </connor>
<connor> I'll wake up at eight, </connor>
<connor> I'll livestream until 12, I'll come here. </connor>
<connor> And then I'll like work all day, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll go do something in the evening. </connor>
<connor> And then I'll sleep. </connor>
<joey> This is why I can't watch shows actually. </joey>
<joey> This is what I've realized. </joey>
<joey> I literally have no time. - Yeah same. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what Joey's excuse is. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like streaming until I sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> So I realized I have no time to watch TV. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally have to pencil in </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) the times I watch Anime now. </connor>
<garnt> Because 'cause here's like the... </garnt>
<garnt> He's like the ultimatum of every Anime YouTuber right? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause a lot of the times, </connor>
<garnt> it takes more work to make a video about an Anime </garnt>
<connor> than to watch an Anime. </connor>
<garnt> So, I actually have to pencil in okay, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the time I'm going to put in </garnt>
<garnt> into making a video about Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> And here's the time that I have to pencil in to watch Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> And like the time I pencil in </garnt>
<garnt> to watch Anime is like this. </garnt>
<garnt> The time I pencil in to make videos is like that. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey and Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is like the equivalent like doctors </connor>
<connor> having to like study new practices </connor>
<joey> to stay on top of their game. </joey>
<connor> And so I have to watch Anime, it's R&D </connor>
<connor> - I just love to think that like, if I was like, </connor>
<connor> if someone was like a mate of Garnt's so he was like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey Garnt, do you wanna like hang out on X day at X time." </connor>
<connor> And Garnt's just being like, </connor>
<garnt> "Sorry man that's Anime time." </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - literally there've been times where Sydney's like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh Garnt can we hang out on this night?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Sorry Sydney, it's my Anime watching hour. </connor>
<connor> "And it's part of my job. I need to keep up with like </connor>
<garnt> "What's airing right now." </garnt>
<connor> - My friends laugh at me </connor>
<connor> 'cause I have to like ask them. </connor>
<connor> I have to like, I send them emails, like invitations, </connor>
<connor> to like times, to like hang out. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "Let's hang out, I'll send you an email. </connor>
<joey> "To like put it in your calendar." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'll forget. </joey>
<joey> - You send them like a Google calendar notification. </joey>
<joey> - I think about like the last 10 times </joey>
<joey> I agreed to hang out with someone at least on like a call, </joey>
<connor> not like in-person, </connor>
<connor> I've never liked not turned up in person. </connor>
<connor> But my on-call to hang out with people, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like I don't get to see often </garnt>
<garnt> or people who live in other countries. </garnt>
<connor> - I think like the last five out of 10 </connor>
<garnt> that I didn't put in my calendar, </garnt>
<connor> I think I like turned up late or just forgot about. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, if I don't put in... </connor>
<connor> - I feel terrible about that, I'm a bad friend but yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - If I don't put it in my calendar, </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes you get like free time </garnt>
<connor> or you think you get free time. </connor>
<connor> You're like, </connor>
<connor> do I actually have free time? - You think you have free time </connor>
<connor> - So you say, you whip out the calendar and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh I do have free time." </connor>
<connor> Then an hour passes and you get message and you're like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, weren't you meant to be... </joey>
<joey> "We're meant to be having a call. </joey>
<joey> "We're meant to be hanging out." And you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh fuck! It's a lie! It's a lie!" </joey>
<garnt> - For me It's like, for me the problem is like, </garnt>
<garnt> going back to like the apple calendar thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like all right, finally. </garnt>
<connor> I wake up and I'm like finally. </connor>
<connor> A day where the dot is non-existent. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) I have a day off. </connor>
<connor> I can do whatever the fuck I want. </connor>
<connor> But then I go to my computer. </connor>
<connor> I look at my other schedule </connor>
<garnt> that's sitting at my desk and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, I have to edit three videos and do two sponsors. </garnt>
<garnt> All right, so it's not a day off. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a day to be inside. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm not necessarily doing anything outside. </garnt>
<joey> So, it's not a day off. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, that's been my life for the past two years. </joey>
<joey> - Do you guys have to-do lists? </joey>
<joey> - I've been starting to like do to-do lists now </joey>
<garnt> because I have to forget what I have to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - To-do list, the day I discovered to-do lists, </garnt>
<garnt> like to do it late. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt giggling) </connor>
<connor> - Like a Caveman turning over a rock. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah game-changer. </connor>
<connor> - "There was a list of things I had to do it. </connor>
<connor> "It changed my mind." </connor>
<connor> - I don't even think cavemen were </connor>
<connor> that impressed when they discovered fire like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like one of my friends... </connor>
<connor> - How do you get </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) these easy tips? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly dude like, </connor>
<connor> especially when it comes to like Al stuff, </connor>
<connor> because we have so many things that we have to do, </connor>
<connor> and so many things that we want to do right. </connor>
<connor> So, my dad actually taught me like </connor>
<connor> how to make the perfect to-do list, </connor>
<connor> which is you wake up in the morning </connor>
<connor> and you think to yourself all right, </connor>
<connor> you jot down everything that you can think of </connor>
<connor> that you can do, and that you have to do. </connor>
<connor> You jot it down and then from that list, </connor>
<connor> everything that is super important goes to the top. </connor>
<connor> Else that can wait a couple of days goes to the bottom. </connor>
<connor> And then you go on with your day, </connor>
<connor> you tick off everything that you do. </connor>
<connor> And at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> if you're left with a couple of things, that's all right. </connor>
<connor> That becomes the top of your to-do list the next day. </connor>
<connor> - And just, I've been doing that for the past year </connor>
<connor> and I've become infinitely productive. </connor>
<connor> Like I guarantee you that's what </connor>
<connor> Mudan does as well probably. </connor>
<garnt> With the amount of shit he has to do like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "How do I find more hours in the day Mudan? </garnt>
<garnt> "You seem to like pull from this infinite pool of hours </garnt>
<garnt> "That I don't know where you find." </garnt>
<connor> - I don't want it, mere mortals aren't meant to </connor>
<joey> have that level of productivity... </joey>
<garnt> - I (chuckles) threw away my humanity long ago. </garnt>
<connor> - We don't wanna wield that level of productivity. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wanna know what did Mudan sacrifice? </garnt>
<joey> You know what? (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - I think he like cooked... </joey>
<garnt> - What did it cost? Everything! </garnt>
<connor> - I think he hooked his like brain in car (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> Like brain and heart with car battery. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) It's just like </connor>
<joey> constantly just going. </joey>
<connor> - I can't wait for him to come on and explain himself. </connor>
<garnt> - "So just don't sleep." </garnt>
<connor> - He's awful at like explaining how he's productive. </connor>
<garnt> Like he doesn't make it sound realistic at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's just like, </garnt>
<connor> "I just wake up in the morning and just do it." </connor>
<connor> He's the epitome of just get good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like with Mudan, </connor>
<connor> I only see like the input and output. </connor>
<connor> Like input, editing work. Output, a video. </connor>
<connor> I don't see like what happens. </connor>
<joey> It's basically just like a black box right. </joey>
<joey> It's like the YouTube algorithm, because like, </joey>
<joey> you kinda know how it works, </joey>
<joey> but no one really knows </joey>
<joey> the inner workings of the YouTube algorithm. </joey>
<joey> That's just like Mudan and editing for me man. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever seen Mudan edit? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - The only time I've seen him edit, is on stream. </connor>
<connor> And that's where he's also </connor>
<garnt> doing something else while he's editing. </garnt>
<connor> - He's probably like holding back on streams as well </connor>
<garnt> as people don't get freaked out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Certainly using 2% Of the brain. </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Sorry. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, that's how impressive it is because it's like, </joey>
<joey> I think, people already know who watched the show </joey>
<connor> are aware of just how much he edits for Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> And also for me and Connor. </connor>
<connor> But I think people forget that, </connor>
<garnt> other people also ask him to edit. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's editing for Sydney now as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, I'm just glad. </garnt>
<garnt> - And not to mention he edits his own streams </garnt>
<garnt> and he streams. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he also streams as well! </garnt>
<garnt> - And he also streams like pretty regularly. </garnt>
<joey> So I'm Like, what? How? </joey>
<joey> - Man's a beast! Man's a beast! </joey>
<joey> - I would like to know what... </joey>
<connor> Mudan what is your secret? </connor>
<connor> - When he comes. - When you come on, </connor>
<connor> when he come on, - He can tell us. </connor>
<connor> - Please, please... </connor>
<connor> - The long awaited episode. </connor>
<connor> - We're also waiting for the country to open back up </connor>
<garnt> which hopefully will finally happen next year as well. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like in part what I'm saying ish. </connor>
<connor> - That's the biggest thing I'm hoping for. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it's gonna happen next year. </garnt>
<joey> It's just when, it's like, </joey>
<connor> is it gonna happen early or late, that's the big question. </connor>
<connor> - I think everyone is saying like, </connor>
<connor> as early as maybe Feb or March right I think. </connor>
<connor> - March would be nice. </connor>
<connor> - Visitors can come in, because right now I think, </connor>
<connor> if you're a non-visitor, </connor>
<connor> so if you're like a student, </connor>
<connor> or you're on work visa or stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> you can technically come in now. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not that I've seen any actual examples </connor>
<joey> of people coming in. </joey>
<garnt> - I assume they need to get... </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't looked into the process, </garnt>
<joey> but I assume they need to reapply for some kind of </joey>
<joey> application because not tourists, </joey>
<joey> but at least if you have a working visa, </joey>
<connor> or you've been waiting, </connor>
<connor> for like a job or to study here </connor>
<joey> then you can come here which is good. </joey>
<joey> Which is like, </joey>
<joey> it shouldn't have taken two years to get to this point. </joey>
<joey> - I feel bad for the students man. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I know right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just being like finally I get to live </garnt>
<joey> my dream of coming to Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - No it makes me feel so bad because like when we applied, </garnt>
<garnt> we had to wait like what, three months? </garnt>
<garnt> And that was just like the worst three months by. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's not the fact that it's three months. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the fact that it's three months where you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what's gonna happen to your life. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just like your life's kind of in limbo </garnt>
<garnt> until you get that confirmation </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, "Oh, okay, finally, I can start packing. </garnt>
<garnt> "I can start preparing to go." And then... </garnt>
<garnt> But while you're waiting, you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Uh should I start? Should I go? </garnt>
<garnt> "What's kind of going on with me in my life right now." </garnt>
<connor> - I was wondering with the students things, </connor>
<connor> I was thinking like okay, </connor>
<connor> we had no way of knowing that </connor>
<connor> it was gonna take two years for Japan to open. </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't know what, </connor>
<connor> I actually haven't really spoken to any students about it. </connor>
<garnt> But like, what was like, if you got to like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like day one right. </garnt>
<garnt> You find out Japan is closing. </garnt>
<connor> Like, do you just like, </connor>
<joey> wait and see, or do you just decide to do something else? </joey>
<joey> And then like hope, </joey>
<connor> and hope that you can just then go back? </connor>
<joey> I don't know? - I think for most students, </joey>
<joey> I don't think anyone was anticipating them </joey>
<joey> to fuckin stay in limbo for two years right? </joey>
<joey> So, I'm sure the majority of students were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I still got time, I can wait." </joey>
<connor> - Oh fuck imagine losing two years of like, </connor>
<connor> I guess, progress you could have made in your 20s. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then again, it's not really that important </connor>
<connor> because I guess a lot of people </connor>
<connor> in life didn't start doing </connor>
<connor> their main thing until they were like 40s. </connor>
<connor> So I guess it really doesn't fuckin matter. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, true, true. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean but, I think what sucks </garnt>
<garnt> is that you just have two years where </garnt>
<connor> you can't really commit to something. </connor>
<connor> That's what really sucks for me, </connor>
<connor> where I always want to have a goal </connor>
<joey> that I'm working towards </joey>
<joey> and know that I'm actively working towards that goal. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause one of my biggest pet peeves is like, </joey>
<joey> if I'm feeling like I'm not working towards something, </joey>
<joey> then I just feel lost. </joey>
<joey> And I just feel like a fuckin lost soul. </joey>
<joey> And I need something concrete to work towards. </joey>
<joey> That's why like I really empathize </joey>
<joey> with anyone waiting for a visa. </joey>
<garnt> And thank God you guys can finally come here. </garnt>
<connor> - Hopefully we get here soon, get to eat some tsukemen. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) - That's the number one thing. </joey>
<connor> Fuck the sushi. - Don't get tsukemen. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck the ramen. </connor>
<joey> go to your local tsukemen joint and discover true happiness. </joey>
<connor> - Then we've the Michelin Star ramen. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah we do. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was very... </garnt>
<connor> We didn't know it was Michelin Star right? </connor>
<connor> - It was a place Maylin recommended to us. </connor>
<garnt> - Was it ramen? Because I thought it was soba. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] No, it's ramen. </joey>
<joey> - It's like Chuka-soba, which is like Chinese soba, </joey>
<joey> which is like, technically ramen, some people call it ramen. </joey>
<garnt> - The noodles are more ramen noodle. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was very light for a ramen. </garnt>
<connor> - It was very light yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like when you said like ramen, I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's going to be a heavy ramen," </connor>
<joey> 'cause ramen is the kind of meal </joey>
<joey> that like takes you out. </joey>
<joey> It knocks you out for like an hour </joey>
<joey> because of how heavy it is. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the thin noodle ramen I guess... </garnt>
<joey> - It was very nice, it was good, </joey>
<joey> it was light. - It was good but... </joey>
<joey> When I was thinking about it, I'm like, </joey>
<connor> okay what do I... </connor>
<connor> I think I have the wrong expectations of Michelin Star. </connor>
<connor> Like I expect some kind of </connor>
<connor> stupid luxurious-like gourmet thing, </connor>
<joey> but I guess it's more about value, </joey>
<joey> the food you get. - It was like 1000 Yen. </joey>
<joey> At least the one I got was like 10 bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean like $8 right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's amazing, </connor>
<joey> I have a picture of it, I put up on... </joey>
<connor> - It was very good but the whole time I was thinking, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I think tsukemen is more tasty there" </connor>
<garnt> - I think so as too. - I think so as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - The bulk standard tsukemen </garnt>
<connor> which was better than the Michelin Star ramen. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree. Honestly, I didn't enjoy the ramen that much. </garnt>
<garnt> And I got okay, 'cause here's the thing right? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like Michelin Star, if you've been to enough of them, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in Japan, 'cause it's like, </garnt>
<connor> in Japan there's so many Michelin Star restaurants, </connor>
<connor> but I've realized that, </connor>
<connor> with Michelin Star, you come in with like </connor>
<connor> the wrong expectations right? </connor>
<connor> And this is gonna make me sound, </connor>
<connor> this is gonna make me sound so fuckin privileged and all, </connor>
<garnt> "Michelin Stars aren't all that great but..." </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Where's the Michelin Star Garnt? Tell them. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a Michelin Star, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing right. - The Tire Man? No! </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) - Like here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> When you go into a Michelin Star restaurant, </connor>
<connor> your expectations are like up here, you're like... </connor>
<connor> - Scott knows all well </connor>
<connor> because he often frequents the Michelin Star </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> No but like, you come in with these expectations </connor>
<connor> that you're gonna get like a meal </connor>
<connor> that's a cut above the rest right? </connor>
<connor> And so you start judging things harsher </connor>
<connor> than if you just go to this random restaurant </connor>
<connor> and just like find out </connor>
<connor> that there's like amazing food. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause in Japan, I feel like there is </connor>
<connor> just as many restaurants that have food </connor>
<connor> that are like Michelin Star quality, </connor>
<connor> that just haven't been discovered yet? </connor>
<garnt> And, and to me like, </garnt>
<garnt> Michelin Star isn't always the indicator of, </garnt>
<connor> this is the best meal that you can get in Japan. </connor>
<connor> But it only means is that. </connor>
<connor> It's become famous enough </connor>
<connor> that people have started to notice it. </connor>
<garnt> But there are so many hidden gems. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, for example, with the Michelin Star ramen, </garnt>
<connor> that is not like the best, </connor>
<connor> even the best ramen that I've had, </connor>
<connor> the best tsukemen that I've had. </connor>
<connor> - I've had like sketchy ass places </connor>
<joey> that were a little bit better. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I honestly think the insect ramen </joey>
<connor> I had from my video was actually better. </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<joey> - And that had 150 crickets in it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not shitting on this one. </joey>
<connor> We haven't named the ramen place. </connor>
<connor> 'cause I also don't wanna like fuckin make... </connor>
<joey> - I'm saying that because the insect ramen </joey>
<joey> was actually fuckin amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - No. And also like, because it's Michelin Star, </garnt>
<garnt> it actually made it a worse experience for me right? </garnt>
<joey> Because you wait in line... </joey>
<joey> - Because your expectations are too high right? </joey>
<joey> - One, yeah expectations is high. </joey>
<joey> And two, it's really, really fuckin busy right? </joey>
<connor> So, in this ramen shop, it's a tiny ass ramen shop. </connor>
<connor> It's like, when we say Michelin Star, it's a really... </connor>
<garnt> It's a normal ramen shop. </garnt>
<connor> - Ramen stores in general are like not... </connor>
<connor> I would say they're good dining experiences. </connor>
<connor> If you wanna come here and chill out with your friends, </connor>
<connor> don't go to a ramen place. </connor>
<joey> - It's a come in, </joey>
<connor> eat, and go. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that place only seats like what? </connor>
<joey> 10, 12 people maybe? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's busy, it's like narrow. </connor>
<connor> You're like, if you're even remotely large, </connor>
<connor> then larger than normal, </connor>
<garnt> you're gonna have a tough time squeezing past everyone. </garnt>
<connor> It's like not fine. - [Garnt] Unlike, </connor>
<connor> We went at about 2:00 pm. </connor>
<connor> So not even like, not even close to peak time </connor>
<connor> and we still had to wait like a good 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Like a good 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> And this is when the country is closed to tourists, </connor>
<connor> so when tourists come back in... </connor>
<connor> I was talking to some people who've waited for this ramen </connor>
<connor> for like an hour, an hour and a half, two hours right? </connor>
<connor> And you get shepherd in, </connor>
<connor> and then you're expected </connor>
<connor> to just eat the ramen and leave right? </connor>
<connor> There's no downtime. </connor>
<connor> You get given a bowl, </connor>
<connor> you eat it and then leave. </connor>
<garnt> You can't like, to me, part of like the food experience, </garnt>
<garnt> is just like, not feeling pressured to eat the food, </garnt>
<garnt> but just... - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But just like, feeling like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can take my time to enjoy this food. </garnt>
<joey> - I couldn't even like bask. </joey>
<joey> Like as good as the ramen was, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't bask in it because </joey>
<joey> there was the pressure of all. </joey>
<connor> I could take my time with this, </connor>
<connor> but I'd also be pissing off the 20 other people </connor>
<connor> still waiting in line right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Exactly right, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Standing outside. </joey>
<joey> - This is why I've realized </joey>
<joey> that ramen is best at like midnight. </joey>
<connor> - You can just like... </connor>
<connor> - They take their time with it. </connor>
<connor> - They always serve beers. </connor>
<joey> Everyone's having like a good time in there, </joey>
<joey> like it's a way more fun atmosphere. </joey>
<connor> Like some of the stores that are open 24 hours </connor>
<joey> normally have a few more seats as well. </joey>
<joey> - It is the ultimate midnight snack for sure. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly it's awful for your stomach. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> There's a good chance you might like bring it back up. </joey>
<joey> But some of the best ramen experiences I've had </joey>
<connor> are like midnight. </connor>
<connor> We're in like a sketchy area </connor>
<connor> of some place in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's drinking beers in the store, </connor>
<connor> it's cool atmosphere, everyone's talking. </connor>
<connor> It's so much more fun than ramen during the day </connor>
<connor> where everyone's just there to eat and get out. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the best ramen experience I had </joey>
<joey> was when I was absolutely shit faced, </joey>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> at like 2:00 am. </connor>
<connor> And then my friend Makoto was like, </connor>
<connor> (Joey speaking Japanese) </connor>
<connor> at like 2:00 am and I was like, uh okay. </connor>
<connor> So, we ran around the corner </connor>
<connor> to this like awful sketchy place. </connor>
<connor> Like the ramen wasn't even that good bu just like... </connor>
<connor> - It's just fun. </connor>
<connor> - It's just fun. </connor>
<connor> When the moment I went down, I was like damn! </connor>
<connor> Good to feel alive. </connor>
<joey> But then the moment you walk out it's like... </joey>
<joey> - Oh it's awful. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you've ruined your stomach </joey>
<connor> with all the alcohol. - Be right back in the diner. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause to me like the restaurant experience </joey>
<joey> goes beyond just the taste of the food right? </joey>
<joey> There's like a reason why your mom's cooking </joey>
<connor> always tastes fuckin good right? </connor>
<connor> It's 'cause like... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that cooking mean something to you (stutters). </connor>
<connor> - "Where's the heart man? Where's the heart in the ramen?" </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) - Honestly, honestly! </connor>
<connor> you can taste in some Japanese restaurants </connor>
<connor> where they put the heart to the cooking. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like it's so obvious with some like very small shops. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean I just think that I just, </connor>
<garnt> I realized that I don't like ramen </garnt>
<connor> as much as I want to like ramen. </connor>
<connor> Like I Uber Eats tsukemen on sometimes. </connor>
<connor> And that shit is fuckin good. </connor>
<connor> Because also ramen travels terribly. </connor>
<connor> That's why I never, ever order ramen. </connor>
<joey> I mean unless you have like one of those </joey>
<joey> really old style ones, </joey>
<connor> where they like, bring you actual bowl </connor>
<connor> with everything in it. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only one I get. </joey>
<connor> - Problem is nowadays with ramen, with Uber Eats. </connor>
<connor> They separate the noodles and the broth. </connor>
<connor> So they just give you a broth in like a plastic thing. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - A lot of the time yeah. </connor>
<connor> They don't actually put the noodles in. </connor>
<joey> You have to put the noodles in yourself. </joey>
<joey> Yeah it's not good. </joey>
<joey> And the noodles are supposed to be </joey>
<joey> like piping hot in the broth. </joey>
<joey> So, it doesn't really work. </joey>
<joey> But tsukemen, it travels pretty okay, 'cause you... </joey>
<joey> - It's because the broth is so thick, it's like magma. </joey>
<joey> It stays hot forever. - The Broth is so thick </joey>
<joey> It stays really hot, </joey>
<connor> and then the noodles are supposed to be separate anyway. </connor>
<connor> And then you just dunk the noodles in </connor>
<connor> and it's almost as good as you get it. </connor>
<connor> - Definitely better than shop at but yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like if you need that itch. </connor>
<joey> - So, I've been saying man. </joey>
<joey> I've been advocating for. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like ramen is that one Japanese dish </garnt>
<garnt> where before I moved to Japan, </garnt>
<connor> I was thinking oh, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna eat ramen every fuckin week, every day. </connor>
<connor> - I realize I've had ramen </connor>
<garnt> three times in the past week. (chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> But I didn't have ramen for like months before that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was saying like the last time </garnt>
<garnt> I had ramen before we went to this </garnt>
<garnt> Michelin Star ramen place, </garnt>
<garnt> was like I think... </garnt>
<connor> - A year before. </connor>
<connor> - A year before. </connor>
<connor> That's just because I have like </connor>
<connor> zero craving for ramen. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause why would I have ramen </connor>
<connor> when I can have tsukemen right? </connor>
<connor> Like but the one dish that </connor>
<connor> I haven't got bored off though is sushi. </connor>
<connor> Like I eat sushi at least once a week. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<garnt> - At least once a week. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - You eat it more than me, </garnt>
<garnt> And I love sushi. </garnt>
<joey> I'd probably go maybe like two or three times a month. </joey>
<connor> - I wish there was like a really </connor>
<connor> quick and easy one near my house. </connor>
<garnt> I would probably go. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna order it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah no, it doesn't order well. </connor>
<garnt> But like, I feel like there's a few </garnt>
<connor> conveyor belts sushis near my place, </connor>
<garnt> and it's just perfect for lunch man. </garnt>
<connor> It's quick, it's easy. - They're like 100 Yen, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause even like the 100 Yen sushi, </garnt>
<connor> which is like 80 cents </connor>
<connor> for like one piece of like salmon or something. </connor>
<garnt> It's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly like my experience </garnt>
<garnt> with sushi in Japan is that, I've also... </garnt>
<connor> Maylin has taken me </connor>
<connor> to some Michelin Star sushi places as well </connor>
<connor> - But of course she has. </connor>
<connor> - Maylin only eats if there's </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) Michelin man inside. </garnt>
<connor> She's like, "I don't see the Michelin man anywhere, </connor>
<connor> "I'm not going in." </connor>
<garnt> - Basically part of the big reason </garnt>
<garnt> why we've gone to more Michelin Star places </garnt>
<joey> is because Maylin suggested </joey>
<joey> these places to us. - Maylin swears by it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which is how we found the ramen place. </joey>
<joey> which is Maylin recommended the ramen place </joey>
<joey> and it happens to be Michelin Star. </joey>
<joey> But I have tried like, a few like, </joey>
<joey> a lot of different sushi places </joey>
<joey> of like different price points. </joey>
<joey> And my honest opinion is that like sushi, </joey>
<garnt> you reach about like, </garnt>
<garnt> you reached about like $30 a meal for a sushi, </garnt>
<garnt> which is about, mid range sushi in Japan right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's not cheap, it's not expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's about as good as it gets to me, </garnt>
<garnt> because you can get sushi </garnt>
<garnt> from like $30, like $100, like $200. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gourmet, super famous chefs out there like, </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor whispers) "How dare you cunt? </garnt>
<garnt> "How dare you?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Unlike, my honest opinion is that </garnt>
<garnt> I've had the expensive sushi, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, it's better, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not that much better than like the $30 sushi </garnt>
<garnt> that I can get. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how it's always is there. </garnt>
<connor> Like I find the meals there are a little more pricey </connor>
<connor> than the normal ones, </connor>
<connor> are generally like the nice ones. </connor>
<garnt> And then when you get to the stupid </garnt>
<garnt> extravagant levels of prices, </garnt>
<connor> it's like not that worth it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a 10-fold increase </garnt>
<garnt> for like a five to 10% better meal. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I would argue that like </joey>
<joey> if you're ever gonna go to like, </joey>
<joey> especially like the high, high-end sushi places, </joey>
<connor> which is all around Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> then like get something that you could only get </connor>
<connor> in that high-end restaurant. </connor>
<connor> So like, 'cause I remember I took my friend Luke </connor>
<connor> to like the really high-end sushi place </connor>
<connor> 'cause he's never been to like a high-end sushi place. </connor>
<connor> So, I took him to the one in Harajuku. </connor>
<connor> It was like 400 bucks between the two of us. </connor>
<connor> So it's like really high-end. - Just some rice </connor>
<connor> and a bit of fish, oh lord!" </connor>
<connor> - But that place has like, I think, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you guys have been to it. </connor>
<connor> But like it's the one where you can have </connor>
<connor> like the nine different types of sea urchin </connor>
<connor> - That's nine different types of sea urchin. </connor>
<connor> - So they do this like special thing. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even want one type, fuck! </connor>
<connor> - So there's a special thing </connor>
<connor> where they do like nine different types of sea urchin. </connor>
<garnt> - Why are talking about sushi </garnt>
<garnt> and we haven't had lunch yet. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) - And you get like... </garnt>
<garnt> - My stomach's just like </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt makes rumbling sounds) </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can like taste test. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the different types of sea urchin from like </garnt>
<garnt> different parts of Japan and around the world and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And like that is like cool because... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I'm literally salivating. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll give you $0. </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that is cool because </garnt>
<connor> I've only ever seen that in that store. </connor>
<connor> Like yeah it's expensive, </connor>
<connor> but that is an experience </connor>
<connor> that you can only get in that store, </connor>
<connor> you can't go to like a fuckin sushi chain for a sea urchin. </connor>
<connor> But like if you can just kind of </connor>
<connor> go to a high-end sushi place </connor>
<connor> and just order fuckin salmon on the ice, </connor>
<connor> so then like, there's no point, </connor>
<connor> there's no difference, like you're not... </connor>
<connor> The average person is not </connor>
<joey> that much of a sushi snob where they gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh this isn't the high-grade salmon </joey>
<joey> "that they're using uh boo!" </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like, even if it's high-grade salmon, </garnt>
<joey> it's like 5% increase on how better the taste is right? </joey>
<joey> And sushi is basically just, it's rice, it's the fish, </joey>
<connor> it's the wasabi, and it's just like the... </connor>
<connor> Soy sauce they put on top, </connor>
<connor> and like it's basically, you just have to like, </connor>
<connor> make sure the ratios is all right. </connor>
<connor> And then there's only like </connor>
<connor> so much the fish can be fresh right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - At which point do we just like say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, you just can't make this taste any better </garnt>
<joey> "with the ingredients you're given," right, because... </joey>
<joey> - Unless you have like </joey>
<garnt> 10 times the number of taste buds than the average human, </garnt>
<garnt> like it's not gonna change yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> Like my tongue doesn't... </joey>
<garnt> Like I'm not part of like Shokugeki or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't taste the exact percentage </garnt>
<garnt> of salinity in the fuckin bitch. </garnt>
<joey> - Although I must say when I did try </joey>
<joey> the nine different types of like sea urchins, </joey>
<joey> I was ready to take my shirt off </joey>
<joey> from how good it was. </joey>
<joey> Just like, Ah! (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I'm just an unagi fan man. </connor>
<connor> It's my favorite food in Japan, unagi. It's the best man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but see like even like unagi right? </connor>
<joey> Like after a certain price range it's like... </joey>
<joey> You can't taste the difference. </joey>
<joey> - But like that's why like, </joey>
<joey> if you could just go to an unagi place, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of expensive unagi in general, </joey>
<connor> but I mean even like the lower-lower price point ones, </connor>
<connor> I'm always like satisfied, </connor>
<connor> I'm always very happy. - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And I think it's somewhat good for you, so that's good. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not terrible for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's got a lot of like, </garnt>
<connor> a lot of good omegas, those fishy oils. </connor>
<joey> - But they are also going extinct as well. </joey>
<joey> That's the reason why </joey>
<connor> their prices are getting </connor>
<connor> higher and higher. - Well, is it like Japan </connor>
<joey> it's like 80% of the world eels or something. </joey>
<connor> - Something like that yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then there's tons of eels from other countries. </connor>
<connor> It's like most of Japan's eels </connor>
<joey> that is like nearly eaten to extinction. </joey>
<connor> - They're like almost all gone. </connor>
<connor> That's why they're just getting more and more expensive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I saw like a whole Business Insider video on that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause Japan has a thing about, </connor>
<connor> "We don't wanna import foreign things. </connor>
<garnt> "It's lower quality." </garnt>
<joey> - Well they're starting like eel farms now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they import the eels as babies from other countries </joey>
<joey> then grow them in Japan like, </joey>
<joey> they're Like, "The Japanese eels." </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "It's just like Japanese eels." </joey>
<garnt> - Half of eels </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why... </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why I realized, </garnt>
<garnt> when you go to a restaurant and they serve you, </garnt>
<garnt> this like really expensive dish </garnt>
<garnt> or really expensive meats right? </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't necessarily mean it tastes any better, </garnt>
<connor> because a lot of it's like, a lot of more expensive meats, </connor>
<connor> weren't that expensive in history right? </connor>
<connor> So, the taste hasn't changed. </connor>
<connor> Like for example lobsters. </connor>
<connor> They used to be like... </connor>
<connor> - Peasant food. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah they used to be like peasant food or... </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Caviar? Peasant food, peasant food. </joey>
<connor> - You can't say peasant food without </connor>
<joey> someone laughing in the office. </joey>
<connor> - Tide pods used to be peasant food, now gourmet. </connor>
<connor> - [Crew] Salmon used to be peasant food as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and how the hell would I know. </connor>
<connor> - Is salmon like peasant food? </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) - At sushi restaurants it is. </connor>
<connor> - Most of the time right. </connor>
<connor> These fuckin restaurants, </connor>
<connor> the ones that are like the super high-end, </connor>
<joey> you feel so fuckin out of place </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're not like an oligarch from Russia. </joey>
<connor> I don't feel like I belong there. </connor>
<connor> I wanna go to the place that has a cool vibe. </connor>
<connor> Yeah the food's a little more pricey </connor>
<connor> than going into like Yoshinoya or something. </connor>
<connor> It's like a little bit more. </connor>
<connor> You get a vibe, you have a chill time, </connor>
<connor> there's no expectations. </connor>
<connor> You don't have to worry about how you've been dressed. </connor>
<connor> That's the vibe I like, - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a nice time. </connor>
<connor> I just wanna have my $12 burger. </connor>
<connor> That's like, "It's better than McDonald's," </connor>
<connor> but it's got a little gourmet, </connor>
<connor> but it's not gourmet, </connor>
<connor> but they put avocado on it or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Just that middle price point </connor>
<garnt> is my comfort zone and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> " This is nice." </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanna feel like </garnt>
<garnt> the cooks and the chef care about their food. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's a big thing for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, when I order a drink and they ask me </garnt>
<garnt> if it tastes okay before they serve it to me, </garnt>
<joey> that's when I feel like I'm out of my depth. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I've never done this before, I ordered the thing, </joey>
<joey> "you give me the thing." </joey>
<joey> - "Is that Michelin Star water fitted for your needs?" </joey>
<joey> - If I order a wine, just give me the wine. </joey>
<connor> Even if I told you it doesn't taste good, </connor>
<garnt> you should just be, you should just laugh at me </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, "Well, that's you did bad so laugh." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the small things. If I get served food and like, </garnt>
<connor> they come to an ask like, "Oh, how was it? </connor>
<garnt> "Was it good?" I'm just like, "You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> "You care enough to like care about my opinion." </garnt>
<garnt> - I meant as in like, </garnt>
<joey> they're gonna take it back if I say no. </joey>
<joey> - Not like, "Am I enjoying it?" </joey>
<connor> - But that's the kind of restaurants that, </connor>
<connor> when they bring out the dish or whatever, </connor>
<connor> and you'll look at it and you're like, "What is this?" </connor>
<connor> And then a light novel title </connor>
<connor> of explanation starts right? </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Can I just eat it?" </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like two bites. </connor>
<connor> I would be done by the time you finished explaining this </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) and I wouldn't care otherwise. </connor>
<joey> Those are the ones where I'm like, if I said, </joey>
<joey> if they came up to me and they were like, "Was it any good?" </joey>
<joey> And if I hypothetically said no, </joey>
<garnt> then they would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What can we do to help you sir?" </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause like what the experience I remember </joey>
<joey> was during the cycling special </joey>
<garnt> where we went to that restaurant with that grandma </garnt>
<garnt> who was basically just like eyeballing us </garnt>
<connor> as we were eating the food. - She pretty much </connor>
<garnt> pulled up a chair and sat with us. </garnt>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It was like aunt feeding, you know what I'm saying? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah (laughs), yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - I was so fed. </garnt>
<joey> - I loved that place though. </joey>
<joey> - It's just 'cause like when someone, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I get it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like when you cook a meal for someone </joey>
<joey> and they enjoy the food, </joey>
<joey> and they think it tastes good. </joey>
<garnt> Like there's such, like such a rush to that right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like I've seen enough chefs </garnt>
<joey> who, obviously it is a job. </joey>
<joey> I understand, some people just do it for a job, </joey>
<garnt> but there's just a magic to a chef or a cook </garnt>
<joey> who cooks the food, </joey>
<garnt> and just get such an enjoyment </garnt>
<garnt> from seeing people enjoy their food right? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, it doesn't just... </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't just chefs but you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if I just see someone enjoying their job, </garnt>
<garnt> that just makes my day better. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if you just go to a fuckin McDonald's </garnt>
<garnt> and you see like that one person with a genuine smile </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what, good for you man. </garnt>
<garnt> "You're having a good time working in McDonald's, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm fuckin happy." </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know man, if it wasn't McDonald's, I'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, someone's getting blackmailed." </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you ordered a Mac smile Garnt. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) - Can I get </joey>
<connor> a smile for that one? </connor>
<connor> - Which for some reason on Uber Eats in Japan </connor>
<connor> at the bottom of the page </connor>
<connor> where you just order all the stuff, </connor>
<connor> there was a Mac smile option for zero Yen. </connor>
<connor> And I don't understand </connor>
<connor> how you would purchase sad Mac smile? </connor>
<connor> Because I'm not there to see the smile. </connor>
<connor> - Is that natural? </connor>
<connor> - Genuinely go to Uber Eats. </connor>
<connor> - Because in Japan if you... </connor>
<connor> - My day's ruined, it is a lie. </connor>
<garnt> - In Japan if you go into a McDonald's restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> and you say, "Can I get a smile, please?" </garnt>
<joey> Then they'll give it to you. They have to. </joey>
<joey> - And I was fine with that right? </joey>
<joey> I don't agree with that. </joey>
<joey> I don't think someone </joey>
<garnt> should have to smile upon being requested. </garnt>
<connor> But, why the fuck on Uber Eats is it listed when... </connor>
<joey> - Is the Uber delivery guy gonna smile for you? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. 'Cause I don't even see him </joey>
<connor> 'cause they have, they fuckin drop it off my door. </connor>
<garnt> - It's fuckin like take like an InstaMax. </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<garnt> And just slide it under the door. </garnt>
<garnt> - The fuckin Uber driver </garnt>
<garnt> just takes a picture </garnt>
<connor> of the McDonald's employee just smiling. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why Uber added this to the menu? </connor>
<connor> I'm like for what? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand how this is gonna work. </connor>
<connor> I added it one time and nothing happened. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's legally part of the McDonald's menu. </joey>
<connor> - Because obviously nothing is gonna happen </connor>
<connor> when I ordered the Mac Smile via Uber Eats. </connor>
<connor> Because what would happen? </connor>
<connor> I was just curious. </connor>
<garnt> - Is this a Japan exclusive thing? </garnt>
<connor> - Japan exclusive. - Of course it is. </connor>
<garnt> - It would never work in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> Employees would quit on the spot. </connor>
<connor> They'd be like, "I'd rather die than smile." </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] I mean it's the same with McDonald's here. </connor>
<joey> It's like, yeah you wanna smile, "Please order it." </joey>
<connor> - There you go. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And it's like an actual menu item in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - These poor workers are being forced to smile upon request. </connor>
<joey> - At least give them like a tip or something. </joey>
<garnt> - You can't tip. - You can't tip though. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't tip here. </joey>
<joey> So what's the reason for smiling? </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, it's because the customer ordered me to smile." </garnt>
<garnt> "Smile, enjoy your job." </garnt>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I want someone to encourage me </joey>
<joey> as I ordered these 30 nuggets, </joey>
<garnt> that will inevitably destroy my body. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I enjoy seeing someone smile </garnt>
<garnt> without me having to order them to smile. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) You know? </garnt>
<connor> - But in Japan you're like, </connor>
<connor> you don't know if they're doing it, </connor>
<joey> 'cause they have to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Japan is the master of business smiles </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I've been to enough places... </connor>
<connor> in Japan - Some places I know </connor>
<connor> - Where I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> okay, this is like the corporate smile I'm watching now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because there's no way. </connor>
<connor> If you turn up like half drunk to a McDonald's </connor>
<connor> that they are happy to see you there, </connor>
<connor> that stumbly ordering of a cheeseburger. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like there's no way anyone is happy about that. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey mimics a drunk person) - "Excuse me, Can I get </garnt>
<connor> "a smile with that please?" </connor>
<connor> (Connor mimics a drunk person) - Ah! Big Mac, </connor>
<connor> (Connor speaking Japanese) </connor>
<connor> - I see maids in Akihabara and guys, </connor>
<connor> I don't think they're really happy </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) to talk to the customers. </connor>
<connor> I don't know man. </connor>
<joey> Maybe they're just not excited </joey>
<garnt> to talk to the people that they seem like </garnt>
<garnt> they want to talk to. </garnt>
<joey> - When you watch someone smile, </joey>
<garnt> but their eyes aren't smiling? </garnt>
<garnt> That's all the maids in Akihabara. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) They sound so cheaper. </garnt>
<garnt> And they have a big smile on their face </garnt>
<connor> as they're waving to you like this. </connor>
<connor> But deep in their eyes is just, "I wanna die." </connor>
<connor> - Oh, the industry's also dying. </connor>
<connor> So, you can't be too happy about that. </connor>
<connor> I mean there's like significant amount </connor>
<connor> less of maid stores or cafes but then. </connor>
<joey> - But now they all have masks on. </joey>
<connor> So they're probably not even smiling under the mask either. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughs) - A God sign. </garnt>
<garnt> - How can you tell if they're smiling now? </garnt>
<joey> - They've perfected the, </joey>
<joey> "I sound happy without smiling voice." </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughs) (Connor sings in Japanese) </connor>
<joey> Just like that behind the uniform. </joey>
<joey> (Joey sings in Japanese) </joey>
<joey> (crew sings in japanese) </joey>
<joey> - Good they shouldn't have to smile. </joey>
<connor> I'm all for people not needing to smile. </connor>
<connor> - That's all right, I wasn't gonna go </connor>
<connor> into those maid cafes anyways. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) So don't worry about it. </connor>
<joey> - Really Joey, really? </joey>
<joey> - I've been to one, it fuckin sucked. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<garnt> - I've been to one as well. </garnt>
<connor> - We've established many times on this podcast, </connor>
<garnt> that they are the worst thing on earth. </garnt>
<connor> - They are the worst. Have you been on one? </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't need to go to one to know </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) I don't want to get to one. </joey>
<joey> I'm violently uncomfortable by it. </joey>
<joey> - It's an experience, you should try it at least once. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] It's so uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the most un-British thing on earth </connor>
<connor> and I can't do it. </connor>
<connor> And I've seen like, </connor>
<connor> so like Offline TV went to one </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I can just only imagine </connor>
<connor> how awkward this was when they went there, </connor>
<connor> like this is terrible. </connor>
<joey> - I would go back solely for the reason </joey>
<garnt> to take Chris with me. </garnt>
<joey> - That would be an amazing video, </joey>
<connor> "Taking Chris to a maid cafe." </connor>
<garnt> - There's a lot of things I would do </garnt>
<garnt> just to make Chris suffer. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) And to make myself </connor>
<connor> suffer as well. </connor>
<joey> - Can I take you and Chris to a maid cafe? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) - Sure, you should. </connor>
<garnt> - We'll see how you guys react to that. </garnt>
<joey> - Sure, why not. </joey>
<garnt> - "Trash Taste maid cafe special," That's... </garnt>
<garnt> - But promise Chris's reaction's often off camera </garnt>
<connor> are almost funnier than his </connor>
<connor> on camera reactions. - Yeah they are. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause, he'll just be like, </connor>
<connor> "Shit! That was shit! Connor why do you made me do that?" </connor>
<garnt> - Seem Chris and you're like the love-love beam or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember </joey>
<joey> what they say... - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - Are they Mohicun cun? </joey>
<garnt> Oh the Mohicun cun. - Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> - That's it. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I wanna see Chris do that dude. </joey>
<connor> - Chris has gone to the point where </connor>
<joey> he's just the most entertaining, miserable British man. </joey>
<joey> Like he's so funny to watch be miserable. </joey>
<connor> ause he's perfected the art of like, </connor>
<garnt> you don't feel bad for making him angry </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs). - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> Like some people when they get upset or uncomfortable, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like you feel sorry for them. </garnt>
<garnt> But Chris has perfected the way of like, </garnt>
<connor> you just don't feel bad for laughing at Chris when he's... </connor>
<joey> - He's the only man that can somehow laugh </joey>
<connor> while having a frown </connor>
<connor> on his face. - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But what's so good about being British. </connor>
<connor> The people don't feel bad for laughing at you </connor>
<connor> when you're uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause people they're just like, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh! he's having a horrible time. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) "It's funny, it's great." </connor>
<connor> - Like to me with maid cafes, </connor>
<connor> like to me it's the perfect determiner to see if </connor>
<connor> someone's like a lost soul when it comes to differentiating </connor>
<connor> between like Anime and real life. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if you go to like, </connor>
<connor> if he goes to like a maid cafe </connor>
<connor> and you don't feel uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> then to me that makes me feel like... </connor>
<connor> - Ripperoni. </connor>
<connor> - Ripperoni, he's a lost soul right now. </connor>
<connor> Because maids are meant to act like Anime characters right? </connor>
<garnt> And there's nothing more uncomfortable to me </garnt>
<garnt> than seeing like a real life Anime character, </garnt>
<garnt> like right in front of my eyes. </garnt>
<connor> - Well because in real life </connor>
<connor> it's like extremely uncomfortable </connor>
<garnt> to see somebody talk that way. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Please just act normal..." </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause people do not that way. </garnt>
<connor> - "Please just act normal," </connor>
<connor> "What did you say, I'm begging you. </connor>
<connor> "Please I don't know, slap me or something. </connor>
<connor> "I don't know anything but this." </connor>
<connor> - Just talk to me like a human being, </connor>
<joey> please, please. - [Joey] Yeah exactly. </joey>

<connor> - Back to the show. </connor>
<connor> - Considering this is </connor>
<connor> (soft upbeat music) our year episode. </connor>
<connor> What have you guys been up to this year then? </connor>
<connor> What's been the biggest growth? </connor>
<joey> The biggest disappointments? </joey>
<joey> The biggest achievements? </joey>
<joey> Have you achieved anything this year? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not dead. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> Still alive I guess. - Still alive I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> What have you achieved Connor? </garnt>
<joey> - Not much really. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - We all say that, but I think to our audience, </joey>
<garnt> it's like, "I can name off about 50 things." </garnt>
<joey> - We have moved studios. </joey>
<joey> We've got a merch with... </joey>
<connor> - This is probably the biggest achievement. </connor>
<garnt> - This is probably the biggest thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's difficult 'cause you don't... </garnt>
<connor> Often you don't wanna spend too much time </connor>
<connor> patting yourself on the back, </connor>
<connor> because if you do, </connor>
<connor> you often get lost in that. </connor>
<connor> - You become, be considered yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You wanna keep pushing forward </connor>
<connor> and never be complacent with what you've done. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I guess I'm happy I moved house. </connor>
<connor> It didn't really feel like something that I've achieved, </connor>
<connor> but I felt like it was a big dub. </connor>
<connor> Get moving to a better place. </connor>
<joey> - You know that's all right man, </joey>
<joey> sometimes, you have to stroke your own dick sometimes </joey>
<connor> to feel good. - I know I know. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only way... </joey>
<joey> - Definitely a minus is </joey>
<joey> the gym has been less apparent in my life. </joey>
<garnt> I need to get back soon. - It has been </garnt>
<connor> non existent in my life </connor>
<connor> - I'm just happy, </connor>
<garnt> Connor can I say where we used to live? </garnt>
<connor> We can say the area - We can say Saitama. </connor>
<connor> - So, I'm glad we've moved out of Saitama. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckles) - Yeah we did. </connor>
<connor> - So, all that time when we said </connor>
<connor> that we lived in Tokyo, </connor>
<garnt> that was a fuckin lie. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, we lived in Saitama at the time. </garnt>
<joey> - Not exactly, it's the greater Tokyo Metropolitan area. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't like... </joey>
<connor> - Is zone six really London? </connor>
<joey> - Saitama is massive. </joey>
<garnt> Saitama is a fuckin massive location. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like three times the size of Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - We lived in like the area that was like </joey>
<garnt> connected to Tokyo. - Close to Tokyo. </garnt>
<connor> - So it wasn't difficult. </connor>
<connor> - Going into Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> there was like different trains </connor>
<connor> that we could get to go into Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> So, we could like either take like the rapid train, </connor>
<connor> which takes like 20 minutes or something </connor>
<connor> to get into central Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> But like the rapid train is like, </connor>
<connor> only comes once an hour. - It was a Unicorn. </connor>
<garnt> Now there's a commuter rapid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, the commuter rapid. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's two, there's the local rapid, commuter rapid. </garnt>
<garnt> The local stops every spot obviously. </garnt>
<joey> The rapid stops like, I'd say half. </joey>
<joey> - People in Japan are definitely </joey>
<joey> gonna figure that out, where we are. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, Oh really think so? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because the commuter rapid is like one train line. </joey>
<connor> - Oh really, there is a few stops </connor>
<connor> that it goes to that we could live at. </connor>
<joey> - I think people in Japan now figured out, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, it's definitely that line," </connor>
<connor> that they were wining about. </connor>
<garnt> - Good thing we don't live there anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah good thing we don't </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) live there anymore. </connor>
<joey> So there you go. </joey>
<connor> (crew murmuring) </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) There's only one train line. </joey>
<joey> There's only Saikyō Line that's still </joey>
<garnt> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </garnt>
<joey> I'm just gonna say it because there's only one line. </joey>
<connor> - Joey, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Well, they wouldn't know the exact stop. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. That's fine, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> - Okay there's two lines in Saitama though, </joey>
<joey> that you can get, the Keiō Tokyo and the Saikyo. </joey>
<joey> Keiō Tokyo sucks, stops every stop. </joey>
<joey> It takes like 10 hours to get anywhere. </joey>
<joey> There's like two lines. </joey>
<joey> One of them actually gets you places. </joey>
<connor> The other one, it literally takes like two hours </connor>
<joey> to go from like the... </joey>
<connor> - It's because Keiō Tokyo like from start to finish, </connor>
<joey> goes through full prefectures. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah it's crazy. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it's nuts. </joey>
<garnt> - And then like where we used to live, </garnt>
<garnt> like if we could plan going into Tokyo right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can plan to go this time, </garnt>
<garnt> to get the commuter rapid. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a fast train. </garnt>
<garnt> But my God! Going back it was such a pain right? </garnt>
<connor> - Seibu-Shinjuku at like 11 was like nightmare. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you'll never get the commuter rapid. </garnt>
<garnt> You will never get like the rapid. It's always the local. </garnt>
<connor> And then suddenly a 20 minute commute turns into an hour, </connor>
<connor> on the local train. </connor>
<connor> It was like the first few times I was like, </connor>
<connor> okay, I okay, I can do this. </connor>
<garnt> And then afterwards, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when we started coming to the office, </garnt>
<garnt> where we moved office. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to move a lot closer. </garnt>
<connor> - The first year didn't bother me much. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't really care much that it got to. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah I'm glad we moved. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I liked where we lived actually. </connor>
<connor> It was a nice area. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, it was a really nice area. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just too far. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> And I won't lie, the Uber Eats selection was shocking. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) You pretty much, </connor>
<connor> you had one option for every cuisine. </connor>
<joey> So it was like, if the Thai place was bad, </joey>
<joey> which luckily it wasn't. </joey>
<joey> - The Thai place there was like the banger. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, the Thai place was like the best place, </garnt>
<garnt> but like the... </garnt>
<joey> All right Chris current Thai right. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He's like, "If it's not Michelin, I ain't having it." </joey>
<joey> - There was like no </joey>
<garnt> good Italian food that delivered, which was like... </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like there was. </joey>
<joey> - This is the most privileged fuckin thing. </joey>
<connor> I don't care, I love Italian food and I love </connor>
<joey> getting that pasta. - "I don't know if you </joey>
<joey> "heard of Domino's?" </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty Italian, if you know what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> - They do pizza? </connor>
<joey> - They do pizza, and pasta. </joey>
<connor> - There was one place, but it was ridiculously expensive. </connor>
<garnt> - For me the biggest thing that was missing, </garnt>
<garnt> Uber Eats selection was healthy options. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah there was like, no like salad or anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Like if you wanted healthy foods, </garnt>
<connor> you needed to cook it yourself. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the times I wanted to eat healthy and then like, </connor>
<garnt> I would get back from work, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the day would be over. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the most first world problems we have. </connor>
<joey> - "God forbid I chop bubble lettuce in my own home?" </joey>
<connor> - We be like the Uber Eats selection was rather poor. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is like pre-oligarch, like levels of water. </connor>
<joey> - I used to just go out a lot to eat. </joey>
<joey> Just because when I did move into my previous place, </joey>
<connor> I saw the Uber Eats options. </connor>
<joey> It was like, are you? Fuck that! I'm just gonna go out. </joey>
<joey> - But you're busy enough. </joey>
<joey> But also you were a lot closer </joey>
<joey> to the places than I was so. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I guess so. </joey>
<connor> - But It was like nothing </connor>
<connor> near me news. - It was nice though. </connor>
<connor> Like that area was super nice to walk around in. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, I do miss the area. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like, I feel like I only started </joey>
<connor> to really walk around and explore </connor>
<connor> when I was deciding whether I should move or not. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> oh, there's a lot of cool places, </connor>
<connor> a lot cool cafes and restaurants </connor>
<connor> that I just didn't notice before, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'd never bothered exploring the area </connor>
<connor> and they didn't show up in Uber Eats. </connor>
<connor> So how could I discover them? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, like I feel like there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> small local places that I miss now. </joey>
<joey> But I'm also happy </joey>
<joey> to be in a more convenient area </joey>
<joey> and being outside that time. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just happy, we've all moved into </joey>
<connor> much, much bigger and nicer places now. </connor>
<connor> And like as good as our previous places were, </connor>
<connor> I think, especially after we got this office, </connor>
<joey> I think it was definitely time for an upgrade </joey>
<joey> in our personal lives as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean I've said this before, </garnt>
<connor> but I was happy with my place </connor>
<connor> and I was very lucky to find the place </connor>
<connor> that I have moved into. </connor>
<connor> But I was still pretty happy with my place. </connor>
<connor> So, to me it's definitely an upgrade, but it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's like a natural progression to me. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like there are some things </connor>
<connor> that I've definitely progressed in, in like 2021. </connor>
<connor> And then there's some things that I feel like </connor>
<connor> I've probably regressed in, or stayed the same. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. It's been a sort of weird year. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause after 2020, everyone was just like all right, </connor>
<connor> ready to like hit the ground running in 2021. </connor>
<connor> And then the environment just didn't allow us </connor>
<connor> to like hit the ground running. </connor>
<connor> - [Group] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was like, I remember like, </connor>
<connor> I think for a lot of 2021, </connor>
<connor> like I can say this now </connor>
<connor> because I think before going back to England, </connor>
<connor> I was definitely burnt out. - I was the same. </connor>
<connor> - I'm say the same, like I was definitely burnt out </connor>
<connor> and everyone's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, why didn't you take a holiday? </connor>
<connor> "Why didn't you take some time off </connor>
<connor> "to just look after your mental health and all that stuff." </connor>
<connor> And what I will say was, </connor>
<connor> there was nothing that I could do. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<connor> There was nothing that I wanted to do. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause what I wanted to do was, </connor>
<connor> see family, see friends, back home, see people... </connor>
<connor> - Two years is a long time man. </connor>
<connor> - Two years is a very long time. </connor>
<connor> And that was like my reset right? </connor>
<connor> So, before that, like I was definitely burnt out. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of just dealt with it </connor>
<connor> by just trying to fill up my schedule. </connor>
<connor> And kinda kind of just like ignoring it. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't fully realize that </connor>
<connor> until I went back to England, </connor>
<connor> and I just had nothing on my schedule. </connor>
<connor> And I just realized, </connor>
<connor> holy shit! This is really refreshing. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting a lot of ideas. </connor>
<connor> And I wanna go back to work now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not doing a single thing. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<garnt> - Is this what it's like to have a break. </garnt>
<garnt> Have a proper break? </garnt>
<joey> - This is what it's like to have a life. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> To just not do anything. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. So, I mean, that's kind of like </joey>
<joey> what has been hardest in 2021. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause 2020 was like, was a year where </joey>
<joey> the entire world was flagged. </joey>
<joey> 2021 was like, me waiting for the world </joey>
<connor> to get back to normal. </connor>
<garnt> And it's finally looking like </garnt>
<connor> it is going to get back to normal now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Fingers crossed, touch wood. </garnt>
<connor> - Are you boys happy with your YouTube channel this year? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Group chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Which one Joey, which one? </connor>
<connor> - Both, both. </connor>
<connor> - I love it 'cause 2021 is the year that </connor>
<connor> Joey finally became an AniTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Not on the Anime Man channel. </connor>
<garnt> - Just (laughs) not on the Anime Man channel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I have, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I told Garnt about it </garnt>
<garnt> but 'cause I've been uploading </garnt>
<garnt> a lot more on my second channel now, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'll be making a lot more Anime content </garnt>
<garnt> on my second channel </garnt>
<garnt> now that I have a playlist on my second channel </garnt>
<garnt> called Actual Anime Content. </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Just to poke fun, but like yeah I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I'm very harsh on myself when it comes </joey>
<joey> to my YouTube channel and my content and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> So like, I'm obviously proud </joey>
<joey> of all the videos I upload, on both channels. </joey>
<joey> - Otherwise I wouldn't upload it at all. </joey>
<connor> But I'm definitely... </connor>
<connor> - I'm fuckin not proud of all of them. </connor>
<joey> (Connor laughs) - All right. </joey>
<connor> But like, I'm definitely one of those people </connor>
<garnt> that's like, after a week, </garnt>
<garnt> of that like honeymoon period, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like yeah, </garnt>
<connor> could have done better on that video. </connor>
<connor> I'll do better on the next one. </connor>
<connor> And then I try and do it, </connor>
<connor> and I keep thinking I'm going in the right direction. </connor>
<joey> Then I'm just like... </joey>
<joey> At the end of it I look back at all of it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah like, 5% of it was okay. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The 95% could have used a bit of work </connor>
<connor> But I think, like I have like plans for next year, </connor>
<connor> for what I wanna do with my shit. </connor>
<connor> But like, I dunno, </connor>
<connor> it's gonna be scary because it's gonna be a lot different, </connor>
<connor> to like pretty much everything </connor>
<connor> I've established up until this point so... </connor>
<connor> See how it goes, </connor>
<connor> but I guess that's why we have Trash Taste for right? </connor>
<connor> Like as a fail safe almost or a... </connor>
<connor> Not so much a fail safe, but like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I guess like... </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] A safety net. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like a safety net I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> because when we started again, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like when we started Trash Taste, we were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, this will be like a nice side project </garnt>
<connor> "for us to do." </connor>
<connor> And like we could do all sorts of cool things </connor>
<connor> on the sideline while we focus on our main content. </connor>
<connor> But now it's like well, </connor>
<connor> we're like 1.1 million </connor>
<connor> subs or something. - That's crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Insane on the main channel. - Fuckin insane </connor>
<connor> Thank you again by the way guys. </connor>
<connor> Now it's like pretty much become like the main basket now. </connor>
<joey> And our main channels, and our side channels, </joey>
<joey> and whatever else that we do outside of Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> has become the safety net almost. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know Trash Taste has become </garnt>
<joey> like almost the number one priority. </joey>
<joey> It is the number one priority. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] It is the number one priority. </connor>
<connor> - When we need to schedule a recording, </connor>
<joey> that's getting done before any of my fuckin videos. </joey>
<joey> Or any of my scripts in man. - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly. So it's like, definitely, </joey>
<connor> 'cause like we do have like lots of </connor>
<connor> exciting plans for Trash Taste obviously next year, </connor>
<connor> which obviously can't tell you </connor>
<joey> but look forward to it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I definitely plan </garnt>
<garnt> my working week around Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> Not the other way round. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey & Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think just like that right? </garnt>
<joey> Like that mentality is already just telling off. </joey>
<joey> Like, this is our main stick now. </joey>
<joey> - But also when I think because </joey>
<connor> all three of us are involved, </connor>
<joey> I guess we probably pay more respect </joey>
<joey> to the scheduling of Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> It's all right well. - Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - If I fuck over my own channel, </joey>
<joey> that's my own problem. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> But if I fuck over the scheduling with Trash Taste, </joey>
<connor> it's like a burden to everyone. </connor>
<connor> And we have people who turn up </connor>
<garnt> to help us with Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> When I fuck around doing </garnt>
<garnt> a Monkey Tier List on my own channel, </garnt>
<joey> if I don't do that, </joey>
<connor> it's on me and that's it right? No else is still looking. </connor>
<connor> - I think that that's like, </connor>
<connor> I guess like going back to the whole, </connor>
<connor> like getting a personal assistant, </connor>
<connor> or like getting a team, </connor>
<connor> to help behind the scenes of like </connor>
<connor> my main channel and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> I think that's the one thing I'm scared of, </connor>
<connor> which is like, I'm gonna feel more pressure now </connor>
<connor> to deliver on my main channel, </connor>
<connor> because now it's not just me that I'm taking care of. </connor>
<connor> It's I'm taking care of a personal assistant, </connor>
<connor> or like an editor, or a manager, or whoever right. </connor>
<connor> There's like multiple people's livelihoods at stake right. </connor>
<connor> That's really the only thing </connor>
<connor> I guess that's stopped me </connor>
<joey> from personally getting a personal assistant. </joey>
<joey> - #No one's taught them. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they'll realize that I'm fuckin stupid. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> They be like why am I helping you? </connor>
<garnt> It is a lost 'cause. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No, like for me, </joey>
<joey> I think the biggest change for me this year is, </joey>
<garnt> I guess I've been really trying to figure out, </garnt>
<garnt> not what I want to do </garnt>
<garnt> but how I want to do it. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like you said this last year and the year before. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Is that okay if we just say... </connor>
<connor> - Did I say this last year? </connor>
<joey> - You definitely said this last year. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because I think this year has been the year </connor>
<joey> where I've really like knuckled down </joey>
<connor> to try to really start thinking of my main channel, </connor>
<garnt> as like content, as a job that I have to like break down, </garnt>
<garnt> and like actually be strict </garnt>
<garnt> on how long it takes to like make a video because... </garnt>
<connor> - You're right, you can't taking months to make one video. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I mean like, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think one big thing that has changed </garnt>
<garnt> since joining Trash Taste right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that for better or worse. </garnt>
<garnt> My content upload schedule </garnt>
<garnt> as compared to you're guys right? </garnt>
<garnt> And especially like seeing how you're guys' content is made. </garnt>
<garnt> Like not saying like, </garnt>
<connor> obviously I'm not saying like, </connor>
<connor> anyone's content is better or worse. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, </connor>
<connor> I've kind of realized that, </connor>
<connor> I want to upload as much as you guys, </connor>
<connor> but with the workflow of my solid content, </connor>
<connor> I've tried to like cut as many, many corners as I can. </connor>
<connor> And there is like... </connor>
<connor> There is just too many bottlenecks </connor>
<joey> that I can't do to like... </joey>
<joey> Like I've reached max productivity </joey>
<joey> that I can reach with my channel. </joey>
<joey> And before last year I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I can improve, I can do better. </joey>
<joey> "I can do like three videos a month, and Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> And now I've come to realize that, </joey>
<joey> not only is that setting the wrong expectations for me, </joey>
<joey> to feel like I can do it. </joey>
<joey> And I feel bad if I don't do it, </joey>
<joey> but it also like sets the wrong expectations </joey>
<joey> for the viewer as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if the viewer is expecting me to upload </joey>
<garnt> that many videos a month </garnt>
<garnt> and I kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of keep doing that, </garnt>
<garnt> then that's just gonna be unsustainable. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just gonna burn out, </garnt>
<garnt> which I did do this year, but that's like... </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't burn out because I was putting myself </garnt>
<connor> through too much work, </connor>
<garnt> I burnt out because of the world situation. </garnt>
<garnt> But I've just realized that, I need to like, </garnt>
<garnt> I need to make a schedule, which is sustainable. </garnt>
<garnt> And unfortunately, it's for better or worse. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, my upload schedule does get compared to your guys. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's like, I've come to realize </garnt>
<garnt> to not feel guilty about that anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - No, when I make jokes about it. I don't give a shit. </connor>
<joey> I don't think it is... </joey>
<joey> - Just a little bit of fun, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I also don't like, I've never considered, </joey>
<joey> I don't think me or Joey have ever thought that </joey>
<garnt> your channel, or your content and channel </garnt>
<garnt> is comparable to ours in any way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't think one upload is equal to one upload on... </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no and not. </garnt>
<connor> - No, definitely not. </connor>
<connor> - I guess it's like forced me to like really break down </connor>
<connor> a workflow to like the video right? </connor>
<joey> Because like, how long would it take... </joey>
<joey> How long does it take you guys like make one video, </joey>
<joey> like hour wise, would you say? </joey>
<joey> - That varies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that varies correct. </joey>
<garnt> - It can be literally like two hours </garnt>
<connor> or like a hundred. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's some videos that like, even one now that's really, </connor>
<garnt> it's like a really big video I've been working on </garnt>
<garnt> that I've been wanting to do for a very long time. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of moving pieces, and a lot of, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of, a lot of, a lot of edits, </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of footage to go through. </garnt>
<garnt> But that, no matter, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I put like a month's worth of like, </garnt>
<garnt> let's say if you just took the hours I put into it, </garnt>
<connor> let's say it's like just a full working month </connor>
<connor> of hours into one video. </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't fuckin matter </connor>
<connor> 'cause I gotta upload the week after anyway. </connor>
<connor> So it so unlike it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But then maybe the week after </joey>
<connor> will be something that took me two hours. </connor>
<connor> So, it's kind of, </connor>
<connor> you kind of have to juggle it </connor>
<garnt> but also not make it look like all these videos </garnt>
<connor> are like completely different quality. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why I kind of just realized. </connor>
<connor> Okay, the only way I can make my videos </connor>
<connor> not seem drastically like different </connor>
<connor> in feeling, theme, quality, production, </connor>
<connor> is to just have, </connor>
<connor> I guess, me being an idiot, and my personality </connor>
<garnt> being like the focal point. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Or at least a main aspect of the video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So like I had to break down for like, </connor>
<connor> let's say like the fastest video... </connor>
<connor> - So I had to breakdown for this? </connor>
<connor> - So, I had to break down </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughing) my video making process. </connor>
<connor> Like the fastest video you can make </connor>
<connor> is like say in like two, three hours right? </connor>
<connor> Let's say you like, </connor>
<garnt> you needed to get a video out. </garnt>
<garnt> So I felt like a few times </garnt>
<garnt> where I just need to get a video out right? </garnt>
<connor> - That's the time on my end, not including editing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So like for me, </connor>
<garnt> like I need to like pencil in and let's say, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm doing a video about an Anime right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I have to pencil in hours, </garnt>
<connor> like a round about a day, </connor>
<connor> to watch the Anime. </connor>
<connor> Which is like, </connor>
<connor> assuming it's like a season of Anime right? </connor>
<connor> And then let's say, </connor>
<garnt> two days for scripting, </garnt>
<connor> which is like one day for the actual script. </connor>
<connor> One day it's like finish the script </connor>
<garnt> and actually make it like a good script. </garnt>
<garnt> And, and so that's already three days right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I have to have like, </garnt>
<connor> two hours or so, </connor>
<garnt> two hours for like the recording of the script. </garnt>
<joey> And then I send that off. </joey>
<joey> So that's like, on my end, three and a half days already, </joey>
<joey> to be sent off to the editor. </joey>
<joey> Now the editor edits it and he has to send it back to me. </joey>
<joey> And I have to do like the finishing touches, </joey>
<joey> uploads, and finishing touches, </joey>
<joey> upload, thumbnail, and title, </joey>
<joey> which if I'm really lucky would take half a day. </joey>
<joey> So that's like four days basically, </joey>
<joey> of workflow from beginning to end. </joey>
<joey> And that's if I'm fully productive </joey>
<joey> and nothing goes wrong right? </joey>
<joey> That's the fastest I can make a video. </joey>
<joey> - All of you assume that I don't procrastinate. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) - Now so that's </joey>
<connor> four days in a week. </connor>
<connor> Trash Taste is one day in a week right? </connor>
<connor> I also want weekends as well. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh now you're just wishful thinking. </connor>
<connor> You are at that point </connor>
<connor> - You are weak Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Beggars can't be choosers. </connor>
<joey> - I've realized like in my previous years, </joey>
<joey> when I've been able to do three videos a month, </joey>
<joey> I've been able to do three videos a month and Trash Taste, </joey>
<connor> because I've just worked on weekends. </connor>
<connor> And I've just realized </connor>
<connor> I kind of want weekends. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of also wanna do other things like stream, </connor>
<connor> and like maybe focus on some side projects as well. </connor>
<connor> And I've just realized, </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to put too much on myself. </connor>
<connor> And there's like, </connor>
<connor> with the type of video I'm making, </connor>
<connor> if there's no way I can make this video faster </connor>
<connor> than the way I'm making it, </connor>
<connor> and people will say well, </connor>
<connor> "Why don't you become like a personality based channel?" </connor>
<connor> Like you guys where you can do different kinds of content </connor>
<connor> that is more focused on any personality. </connor>
<connor> And I've played around with that. </connor>
<connor> And then I've just realized, </connor>
<connor> no I kind of like enjoy what I do. </connor>
<connor> I like scripting I've... </connor>
<connor> I've already got Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I have a channel </connor>
<connor> that is based around my personality so called. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) And so, I've just like, </connor>
<connor> I've just realized that, </connor>
<connor> my main channel is always going to be a max cap, </connor>
<connor> two uploads a month. </connor>
<connor> If I'm lucky three uploads a month. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not going to feel guilty if I don't make that. </connor>
<connor> If it's one upload a month </connor>
<connor> because I'm traveling or because I'm on holiday, </connor>
<connor> that's what you're getting. </connor>
<connor> And like, I guess this is a message to you guys as well, </connor>
<garnt> which is I know the imagery is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, Garnt is a lazy bum </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey & Connor laughing) who doesn't upload that much. </garnt>
<garnt> But trust me, I am working at full capacity </garnt>
<garnt> and you guys are getting two uploads a month, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe one upload a month, if I'm busy that month. </garnt>
<garnt> But, that is me at max capacity. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm not going to try to pretend </garnt>
<garnt> that anything else is that. </garnt>
<joey> - I honestly never saw a problem. </joey>
<joey> Like, as much as I like, </joey>
<joey> poking fun of it or whatever, </joey>
<connor> in episodes and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> I honestly never saw a problem with your upload schedule. </connor>
<connor> Because again like, </connor>
<connor> I know how much work goes into the content </connor>
<connor> that you make specifically. </connor>
<connor> Like you say you take two days to make a script. </connor>
<connor> I sometimes take like a week to make a script </connor>
<joey> 'cause I'm nowhere near </joey>
<joey> as good as making a script as you are. </joey>
<garnt> - The two-day script happened this year. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah right. </joey>
<joey> - Before it would take like, </joey>
<joey> maybe like three days or four days before. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't script. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel the more scripting you do, </garnt>
<garnt> the better you get at it </garnt>
<garnt> because you understand, </garnt>
<garnt> the basics of how to get a script down right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I remember the first script </garnt>
<garnt> I wrote took me fuckin forever </garnt>
<garnt> because I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you write jokes? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never written a joke down in my life </garnt>
<garnt> and performed it off of a script right? </garnt>
<garnt> So, it's like yeah. </garnt>
<joey> So, I would see like your upload schedule </joey>
<garnt> and then I would see your videos. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would think to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> all right if I were to make this video, </garnt>
<garnt> how long would it take for me? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I think to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, it'd probably take even longer </garnt>
<garnt> than it probably took Garnt right? </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I've never really seen </garnt>
<garnt> a problem with your upload schedule. </garnt>
<garnt> If anything I think like... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm honestly even thinking like for next year, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm thinking to maybe go to like </garnt>
<garnt> something similar to your upload schedule as well </garnt>
<garnt> because I wanna put, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think this year, </garnt>
<garnt> the thing that's changed with my channel is that like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've definitely upped my quality of content or like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've upped the bar of the minimum standard that </garnt>
<garnt> a video should be. </garnt>
<connor> And that has resulted in videos, </connor>
<connor> not only taking longer to make and to edit for Mudan </connor>
<connor> but also it's taken longer to prepare just in general. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like right now, </connor>
<connor> especially these last couple of months </connor>
<joey> that I've been in like a little bit of a burnout. </joey>
<joey> I've noticed that like, </joey>
<joey> one week or a week is starting to get tough. </joey>
<connor> - I actually forgot I had to upload the other day. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah right. </joey>
<joey> - I was so busy. </joey>
<joey> - I mean especially with us two. </joey>
<connor> - Legitimately I just forgot to upload the video. </connor>
<connor> And then the day... </connor>
<connor> It was like midnight and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I could upload it right now </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was supposed to go up in three hours. </connor>
<joey> But I had to wake up at 4:00 am to do a call. </joey>
<connor> So I was like fuck this. </connor>
<connor> I need like these three hours of sleep I'm getting. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right so, but it's like, especially with us two </joey>
<connor> now that we've like put more effort </connor>
<connor> into our second channels as well right? </connor>
<connor> - And on top of Trash Taste every week, </connor>
<connor> and then Trash Taste After Dark every week right? </connor>
<connor> Like, that's already so much shit on my plate, </connor>
<connor> that I realize like, </connor>
<connor> oh, if I continue this, </connor>
<connor> once a week schedule </connor>
<connor> or if I kind of lock myself into this once a week schedule. </connor>
<connor> I'm either gonna completely burn out. </connor>
<connor> I'm either just gonna be so fuckin exhausted </connor>
<connor> that I can't do anything. </connor>
<connor> Or, worst case scenario both. </connor>
<connor> And the quality of my videos </connor>
<joey> is just naturally gonna go down. </joey>
<connor> - I've been toying with the idea of </connor>
<joey> just not uploading all January. </joey>
<joey> Doing the classic YouTuber move. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, I kind of wanna like </joey>
<joey> just do streaming all month. </joey>
<connor> So, and I thought January is the best month </connor>
<connor> because that's when you get like... </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] zero Ad revenue. </connor>
<connor> - You get zero Ad revenue. </connor>
<connor> And that's the YouTuber month that everyone takes off </connor>
<garnt> 'cause they aren't getting much money. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughs) - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But I was like, </garnt>
<connor> I do actually wanna try doing like streams full month, </connor>
<joey> see how it goes and then, </joey>
<joey> have more of a consistent schedule with that. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like I've invested a lot in the streaming, </joey>
<garnt> but I'm still like in compared </garnt>
<garnt> to other people who have full-time streamers, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm nowhere near as consistent. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that's one thing that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> is a detriment to that, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause people always complain like Connor, </connor>
<connor> "I never know when the fuck you're gonna stream." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Yeah, I know." </connor>
<connor> But that's what I like about it. </connor>
<connor> (Group chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I like that I just turn up and I'm like, all right, </connor>
<connor> "I'm just gonna stream for 12 hours now casually, </connor>
<connor> "let's do it." </connor>
<joey> - But I think like Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> has definitely done a good job </joey>
<joey> with like, to varying levels, or varying results, </joey>
<joey> like Trash kind of like gotten us </joey>
<joey> to kind of look at our main channel stuff </joey>
<joey> and being like, "I could probably change." </joey>
<garnt> - Is it actually a main channel? </garnt>
<joey> Is it like... (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - I just say main channel for the purpose of main channel. </connor>
<joey> - I really didn't think about like the only... </joey>
<garnt> It's weird now. </garnt>
<garnt> Old channel. - It's weird now </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't even think of any channel as the main channel. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I just make shit. </garnt>
<joey> Some of it has priority over the other ones. </joey>
<joey> But it depends week by week, which one I might prioritize </joey>
<garnt> - Because like, part of the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why I've been putting down the... </garnt>
<garnt> I've been putting the same amount of videos </garnt>
<garnt> on the main channel now, </garnt>
<garnt> which is two videos a month </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not gonna try to do more because I want to... </garnt>
<garnt> - You do two videos a month? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought you did one a month. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I only do one a month when it's a holiday. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Connor mumbling) </connor>
<joey> So yeah yes, so right now I'm doing two videos a month. </joey>
<joey> And I'm putting all my extra time into, </joey>
<joey> I do also wanna like make a second channel, </joey>
<joey> 'cause that seems fun. </joey>
<joey> - It's super fun. </joey>
<joey> - I see you guys doing it and I'm just like, you know what, </joey>
<connor> maybe my main channel doesn't need to be my top priority. </connor>
<connor> I've got like the formula down for my main channel. </connor>
<connor> And now I just wanna... </connor>
<joey> I just want this extra time to do other shit now, </joey>
<joey> because I was thinking, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I have like a lot of ideas for like big projects </joey>
<joey> that can go to my main channel right, </joey>
<joey> which I am sitting on. </joey>
<joey> But my God, they're going to take so much fuckin time. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like doing these big projects </joey>
<joey> really takes a lot out of you, </joey>
<joey> especially when you're also trying </joey>
<joey> to maintain your consequences </joey>
<garnt> and upload a schedule on your main channel anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, I've kind of come to realize that, </garnt>
<garnt> when I really, really feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm down on YouTube and I need to work on a video </garnt>
<connor> that I'm really passionate in, </connor>
<connor> then I'm gonna start doing those. </connor>
<garnt> But for now, like I wanna do more small, small stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna do more small, small stuffs with you guys. </garnt>
<connor> - I think the thing for me was I was, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm not sitting here saying </connor>
<connor> that my main channel is quality by any means. </connor>
<connor> I think there is some level of effort that goes into it. </connor>
<connor> And I mean I'm to harsh on myself. </connor>
<joey> - Would that not be quality? </joey>
<connor> I think it's quality. - There's a certain bar. </connor>
<joey> - It is quality. </joey>
<joey> - There's a certain bar that I try to do </joey>
<connor> on the channel for most videos. </connor>
<connor> There are some times like, I did like a fuckin, </connor>
<connor> which Chris loves to joke about. </connor>
<connor> My monkey TLS video, </connor>
<connor> which I just wanted to do, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I thought it was fun. </connor>
<connor> But it's obviously, it's not, </connor>
<connor> it's nothing like exceptional, but in general, </connor>
<connor> the videos that I have were quite difficult, </connor>
<connor> but, sometimes I see someone doing </connor>
<connor> like a you laugh, you lose challenge. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "That's seems fun." </connor>
<connor> I'd like to do that. </connor>
<connor> - I'll do it live instead. </connor>
<connor> I'll do it on the other channel 'cause it works. </connor>
<connor> And so, it kinda came to a point where </connor>
<connor> a lot of fun ideas, </connor>
<garnt> that just weren't big enough, </garnt>
<garnt> or weren't exciting enough </garnt>
<garnt> to like warrant putting a lot of time and effort into them. </garnt>
<garnt> Just kinda work really well on the other channel </garnt>
<connor> and it's something I wanted. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I've noticed. </connor>
<garnt> One. That's why I want a second channel, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like I have set </garnt>
<garnt> a bar of quality on my main channel. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've liked tested uploading videos that </garnt>
<connor> maybe have not had as much time put into them. </connor>
<connor> And you do see it in the view numbers, eventually. </connor>
<connor> So, that's why I'm just like okay, </connor>
<connor> let's just keep my main channel </connor>
<connor> for like the contents. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Big boy videos. </connor>
<connor> - It's for the big boy videos. </connor>
<connor> For the videos that my audience expect of me. </connor>
<garnt> But that doesn't mean you can't do </garnt>
<garnt> other things on the second channel. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. It's like, there's like so many like, </joey>
<joey> especially timely things or, </joey>
<joey> like so many things that perhaps </joey>
<joey> have nothing to do with the shit I'm known for right. </joey>
<connor> That I wanna talk about in the video. </connor>
<connor> Like, when YouTube brought out their news </connor>
<connor> that they were gonna get rid of the dislike button right. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I wanna talk about this in a video, </connor>
<garnt> but I can't just put up a 15 minute Rant of me </garnt>
<garnt> on the main channel talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, so it's like perfect. (claps) </garnt>
<joey> I have a perfect outlet for random shit like that. </joey>
<connor> - Do you get the comments of, </connor>
<joey> I don't watch Trash Taste anymore, I watch Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah a lot. </joey>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> I mean that's fine and everything </connor>
<connor> because it's like, </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day it's still me right. </connor>
<connor> So, it's whatever, it's weird right. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause especially this past like two or three weeks, </connor>
<connor> I've been uploading a lot more on the second channel. </connor>
<connor> And I've just like, </connor>
<connor> I found myself waking up and thinking to myself, </connor>
<connor> all right what should the next video </connor>
<connor> on the second channel be? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah not the channel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, I haven't mentioned, fuck! </garnt>
<joey> I should probably think about that one as well right. </joey>
<garnt> - I think because another big thing as well is, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, right now with my main channel, </garnt>
<garnt> I've definitely seen the plateau </garnt>
<garnt> of just that kind of Anime content. </garnt>
<joey> Like that kind of </joey>
<garnt> Anime content. - [Joey] Same, same. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, I do have like ideas about, </garnt>
<connor> how, I could keep that channel growing, </connor>
<connor> and grow past the plateau. </connor>
<connor> But the amount of time and effort that would take, </connor>
<connor> to me that would take too much time and effort </connor>
<connor> that I just don't have right now. </connor>
<joey> They'll take giving up Trash Taste basically, </joey>
<joey> to make content and rebrand my channel </joey>
<joey> to a point where </joey>
<garnt> it can grow plus past the plateau </garnt>
<garnt> of that kind of energy content right. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you feel about the growth </connor>
<connor> on your channel, your main ain channel? </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, I mean I'm fine with it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I know like right now AniTube as it is </garnt>
<connor> has just plateaus, like that's, </connor>
<connor> we've seen a platton. </connor>
<connor> If there are any other AniTubers </connor>
<garnt> who would like to prove me wrong, please, because... </garnt>
<joey> - I'm waiting for that one person to prove me wrong. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm waiting as well because </garnt>
<garnt> I need a kick up my ass and be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, you can go higher okay?" </joey>
<joey> That's like my motivation 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure you guys are the same way. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter how many subscribers you have right. </joey>
<connor> What I find happiness in is growing something. </connor>
<connor> Or like making it feel like </connor>
<connor> I have made progress on something. </connor>
<connor> So, like I felt way more fulfilled </connor>
<connor> seeing the progress and growth on Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> than I did on my own channel, for like last year. </connor>
<connor> And like that's why the thought of a second channel </connor>
<connor> excites me way more </connor>
<connor> than even making big videos on my own channel. </connor>
<garnt> Because even if I make a big video, </garnt>
<garnt> my own channel, which I'm really passionate in, </garnt>
<garnt> I know that there's a certain cap </garnt>
<garnt> for like the number of views that's gonna get. </garnt>
<joey> - And I mean it's already like, </joey>
<joey> especially with like all of our main channels, </joey>
<joey> like it's already at a size </joey>
<garnt> where we're pretty happy with right. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, it's massive to a lot of people right. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, it just makes more sense that like, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you're gonna have more excitement, </garnt>
<garnt> watering this tiny plant than watering a giant tree right. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously watching this tiny thing grow </garnt>
<garnt> into something bigger is going to be more fulfilling. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially if you're trying to do something </garnt>
<garnt> that you're otherwise not really known for. </garnt>
<garnt> Perhaps it's like content that you've never tried before, </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that's why I've been having </garnt>
<garnt> so much fun with the second channel, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, yeah I dunno like, </garnt>
<garnt> my main channel grew as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I hit 3 million subs this year, as to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - So did I. </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) - Yeah you do as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Go ways and where that. </joey>
<garnt> - It doesn't feel like a probably a lot. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah right, but like to me it's like I dunno. </joey>
<joey> Like I know definitely past me would look at </joey>
<connor> some months of my channel's growth and being like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> I didn't really grow that much at all. </connor>
<connor> I think I've just rewired my brain this year to be like, </connor>
<garnt> if it ain't a negative, then it's all good dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if every day I'm gaining at least one sub, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm completely okay with that now because it's like... </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't been counseled yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, if people are still like </garnt>
<garnt> looking at my shit and wanting to come in, cool dude. </garnt>
<garnt> My doors are open, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I'm not at this point now where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh fuck, I only made 20,000 subs this month. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm slowly dying. It's like... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, the channel? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I'm like don't trynna say oh no, </connor>
<connor> I'm just past that point now. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm much rather put in the time to like, be like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I have this tiny second channel. </connor>
<connor> That I'll wanna grow into something big. </connor>
<connor> So, let's focus on that kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> Oh, with like Trash Taste for instance. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like that's way more exciting for me. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's why, </connor>
<connor> at least you and I have had </connor>
<connor> a lot of fun doing the second stuff right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah man, it's just like streaming man. </connor>
<joey> - It's just something new right. </joey>
<joey> - It's fun. </joey>
<garnt> - Did they just start like properly streaming this year. </garnt>
<connor> Or did they start last year? I can't remember. </connor>
<joey> - It almost feels like you've been streaming forever. </joey>
<joey> - Like properly, properly like consistently, </joey>
<joey> I think it was this year right. </joey>
<connor> - It's been more this year than it was last year. </connor>
<joey> Well last year, since 2009, no. </joey>
<joey> When was the chess tournament? The first one? </joey>
<joey> - Early 2020. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah 2020. </joey>
<connor> - Okay well, 2020 was around when I started streaming. </connor>
<garnt> And then I think, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this year is probably when it's growing the most. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been a lot more consistent, </garnt>
<connor> been doing a bunch of stuff with that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's interesting. </connor>
<connor> I still, occasionally I have people </connor>
<connor> coming into the Twitch being like, </connor>
<connor> I had no idea you had a Twitch channel. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah. I have that every time I started. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I guess it's a different platform right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it is a different platform. </connor>
<garnt> Is there any changes you guys want to make </garnt>
<garnt> going into the next year? </garnt>
<connor> Or just continuing what you're doing now? </connor>
<joey> - I guess just like, I dunno, for me... </joey>
<garnt> - New Year's resolutions. </garnt>
<connor> YouTuber New Year's resolutions. </connor>
<garnt> - (Joey mimics a lame voice) I'm gonna hit a million subs </garnt>
<joey> on the second channel. </joey>
<connor> - That's probably gonna be a point. </connor>
<connor> 'cause when the world is opened up, </connor>
<connor> I do wanna travel a lot more. </connor>
<connor> And I actually like have a bit more of time to relax. </connor>
<joey> So they'll probably be appointment uploading </joey>
<joey> a little bit less. </joey>
<connor> I'm not really too bothered about it at all. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just gonna say it now. </joey>
<joey> Just expect less uploads on the main channel I think, </joey>
<joey> just because for one, </joey>
<joey> I want to put more effort into each video now. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna like be confined to this </joey>
<joey> once a week schedule and like... </joey>
<connor> - You're gonna talk about </connor>
<joey> what Anime you're not gonna watch. </joey>
<joey> - No, probably not. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> If I do it, that'll be on the second channel </connor>
<connor> where actual Anime content exists. Subscribe! </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I don't know like </connor>
<connor> at least with the main channel, </connor>
<connor> like I think, I know what kind of content </connor>
<connor> I wanna like focus more on, </connor>
<garnt> on the main channel from next year. </garnt>
<garnt> But that is definitely gonna force me </garnt>
<garnt> to not upload every week. </garnt>
<joey> Just because it's going to be impossible. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think last year my New Year's resolution </garnt>
<garnt> was to be more productive and to upload more. </garnt>
<garnt> And then as I've just said this year, </garnt>
<garnt> I've kind of realized yeah that I tried. </garnt>
<joey> I really did 'cause I went like a good like, </joey>
<joey> four months where I had like </joey>
<joey> three videos a month, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like yeah. - Did you really. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I'm just like... </garnt>
<garnt> - That was before he went to the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like pretty consistent. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was so really, fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't watch Gigguk? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) - I do but I couldn't be sure. </joey>
<connor> - It was literally just before the office move. </connor>
<connor> And then it took like... - Oh really. </connor>
<connor> - Fuckin three weeks </connor>
<connor> for the office move. - Oh Joey. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it was around the same time. </connor>
<connor> So it was like the first half of the year. </connor>
<connor> And then I realized, </connor>
<connor> okay, my resolution was just unsustainable. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I've accepted that. </connor>
<connor> - So, my New Year's resolution is, </connor>
<connor> I wanna do more collabs. </connor>
<connor> And, it's not gonna be on the main channel, </connor>
<garnt> which is why I wanna focus more on another channel. </garnt>
<connor> Because I've kinda realized </connor>
<connor> collabs just don't work for the dynamic </connor>
<connor> on my main channel. </connor>
<connor> That's there's... - Why What'd you mean, </connor>
<garnt> come to my all collab. </garnt>
<garnt> All collab, remember that one? </garnt>
<garnt> - That one? </garnt>
<connor> - The one collab. </connor>
<connor> - That legendary club? </connor>
<connor> - That one that was skit? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. That was a long time. </connor>
<connor> - That was like three, four years. </connor>
<connor> - Come on you used me out of the bustle a lot. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I mean 'cause like I wanna do less, </connor>
<connor> something that's like not scripted, </connor>
<connor> and I'd feel like, </connor>
<garnt> anything I scripted in collabs. </garnt>
<garnt> Anything I do on my main channel has to be scripted. </garnt>
<garnt> So that, that video was obviously scripted. </garnt>
<joey> - I also just want like more time </joey>
<joey> to work on like side projects. </joey>
<connor> - I wanna do a week long livestream at least at some point. </connor>
<joey> I'll do it at some point. </joey>
<joey> - Good luck with alvra. </joey>
<connor> - I'll do it at some point. I did three days. </connor>
<connor> Just double them. </connor>
<garnt> - That's just (chuckles) double yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was double. </garnt>
<connor> - Did that not like break you? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Three days will like easily break me off like... </connor>
<connor> - It is three hours for me. </connor>
<connor> - I think I made a mistake of shouting during one game. </connor>
<garnt> Too much getting angry. </garnt>
<garnt> And it fucked my throat for like the next day. </garnt>
<garnt> And then obviously it wasn't having any time to heal </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was talking all day. </garnt>
<garnt> And so that was a rocky mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> If I do it again, I'm not gonna shout as much. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) Not as angrily. </connor>
<connor> But, actually the sleeping in that shit bed </connor>
<connor> was kind of uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> I didn't really get good sleep. That was one thing. </joey>
<joey> - No yeah, I wouldn't either. </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't with a fuckin rave. </connor>
<connor> - If I had thousands of people... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah with a fuckin rave </garnt>
<garnt> going on in the background as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - The bed sucked. </garnt>
<joey> I'd probably just do one night </joey>
<joey> where I'd just go and sleep in my nice bed, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "I'm rested boys, let's get it. Let's go. </joey>
<joey> "Come on. Marscube streaming." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I dunno. I wanna do that at some point. </connor>
<connor> It's not a wonder. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah and I mean like, </joey>
<joey> I guess like in the case with like </joey>
<joey> Trash Taste as well, </joey>
<joey> like because you know, </joey>
<garnt> we're that the world is hopefully </garnt>
<garnt> gonna open up a little more next year. </garnt>
<garnt> We're just gonna be really busy </garnt>
<joey> with that shit as well. - I mean like </joey>
<garnt> the workload for Trash Taste has been up as well right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we don't, </garnt>
<joey> now we stream every week if you didn't know, </joey>
<joey> until at least until Christmas comes along which... </joey>
<joey> - Trish.tv/trashtastepodcast. </joey>
<joey> - Which would be around now. </joey>
<joey> But once the New Year rolls along, </joey>
<joey> I wanna continue the weekly streams. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I defer, I detour. </joey>
<joey> - But like, what that means is that </joey>
<garnt> we're basically just recording another podcast every week. </garnt>
<connor> - We put each have two Trash Taste's at this point. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) You have the Trash Taste, </garnt>
<connor> and the Trash Taste After Dark. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah you guys are getting like </joey>
<joey> five hours of content of which isn't most. </joey>
<garnt> - Which if there wasn't enough of my schedule already. </garnt>
<connor> There's, there's another thing to tick off the main channel. </connor>
<garnt> It's another Trash Taste recording. </garnt>
<connor> - I think somebody added up </connor>
<connor> all the runtime of Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> and it was longer than like all of DBC or something. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I believe that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You still rather watch that of DBC. </garnt>
<garnt> - The people are like, I've re-watched episodes there. </garnt>
<connor> And all of them. Oh my God! </connor>
<garnt> - Regarding Trash Taste though. </garnt>
<garnt> We figured out earlier </garnt>
<garnt> that we've only uploaded one special this year. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Which is the Cycling Special back in Favorite, </joey>
<joey> which we filmed the year prior. </joey>
<garnt> - When will "The Figure" episode count as a special? </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of year. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It's like half a special. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like half a mini special yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] I guess it's </connor>
<garnt> a mini special. - It's a special in nature. </garnt>
<garnt> And not a name. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) 'Cause we're still </garnt>
<garnt> in the office. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean we had "The Cycling Special" </garnt>
<garnt> and then we've had like some mini specials, </garnt>
<connor> like "The Figure special," </connor>
<garnt> "The PC build special." </garnt>
<connor> But I guess it truly is like top gear now. </connor>
<connor> - Where we get like... </connor>
<connor> [Garnt and Joey] once a year. </connor>
<connor> - One big special a year, </connor>
<connor> and very other week is just like </connor>
<connor> the normal episode. - We should name </connor>
<garnt> big two specials a year. </garnt>
<joey> That's probably a healthy amount. </joey>
<garnt> - Two yeah, I think two is special amount. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah well a big portion of this year was... </garnt>
<garnt> - Remember when we first started doing specials, </garnt>
<garnt> we were like, for a year, let's do it. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) All right. </garnt>
<joey> That ain't happening. </joey>
<joey> - Well, because we had like, </joey>
<joey> we had just like, </joey>
<connor> back then we had our main channel with Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> and that was it. - Yeah that was it. </connor>
<connor> - Now we have our main channel. </connor>
<connor> You guys are doing your second channel, streaming, </connor>
<connor> Trash Taste After Dark. </connor>
<connor> And then we gotta do to our specials on top of it. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Easy, easy. </connor>
<connor> - Mudan, Mudan, teach us how this is done Mudan? </connor>
<garnt> And people wonder why we want assistance. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) - Yeah right. </joey>
<connor> I really, I might genuinely considering it for next year. </connor>
<connor> I think it's gotten to the point where I actually will. </connor>
<joey> It's not a matter of if, I need one, </joey>
<joey> or if I want one, I actually need one. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise I think I'm gonna go insane. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I've been trying to look for one as well. </garnt>
<connor> But I want an assistant who is in Japan, </connor>
<connor> which is very hard. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise I'd just like </connor>
<connor> fuckin fly Eleanor over or something. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I am also definitely looking for an assistant. </garnt>

<connor> the other day. - It would be like that </connor>
<connor> But no I actually regret </connor>
<connor> not putting more time into Japanese, </connor>
<connor> because my Japanese studying </connor>
<connor> has been like very spotty this year. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like super into it, </connor>
<connor> and then like, something would happen </connor>
<connor> and then like I would take a day off, </connor>
<connor> and then that would just like stack onto like </connor>
<connor> two days and three days. </connor>
<connor> And then suddenly I'd find like </connor>
<connor> a month had been taken off of learning Japanese. </connor>
<connor> And then like the first few weeks </connor>
<connor> of me getting back into Japanese </connor>
<connor> is just like me relearning the shit </connor>
<connor> that I already knew before. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like the gym in that day right, </connor>
<connor> where in that way, </connor>
<connor> where you make your gains, </connor>
<connor> and then you stop going, </connor>
<connor> and then when you go back to the gym, </connor>
<garnt> you gotta like, </garnt>
<garnt> regain the gains you already had. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just feels like really demotivating. </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle upbeat music) It's like trying </garnt>
<garnt> to push through. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor whispers) - It sucks. </garnt>
<connor> - I really wanna get to the gym more. </connor>
<connor> But I'm just lazy. </connor>
<garnt> - Are you just lazy, or is it just because </garnt>
<garnt> you have got so much going on in your life now </garnt>
<garnt> that you just don't have the time? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean if I really, really, really wanna go to the gym, </connor>
<connor> I could make time. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> But it's not something that I enjoy as much as other stuff. </connor>
<connor> But I really do wanna go more. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Or some days after I've like, </connor>
<connor> after I've been, you hurt for the next day. </connor>
<connor> And then the day after that, </connor>
<connor> I'm like not great feeling 100%, </connor>
<connor> but it's the only time that we can have time, </connor>
<connor> but I'm like oh shit. </connor>
<connor> Fuck maybe I'll go, maybe I won't. </connor>
<connor> It's tough. It's tough. </connor>
<connor> It's really annoying. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> My schedule was a lot more unflexible now. </connor>
<connor> So, I think I have times to go. </connor>
<connor> It's just a lot difficult. </connor>
<connor> A lot more difficult to get it in, </connor>
<connor> in the way I wanted it to. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because I think. </joey>
<connor> Because you just have so much more shit going on right. </connor>
<connor> So like even if you are at the gym, it's like, oh fuck! </connor>
<connor> You're just thinking of all the stuff </connor>
<connor> that you could be doing otherwise. </connor>
<joey> And it just feels better. </joey>
<joey> - I travel a lot more videos as well now. </joey>
<joey> So, that takes stuff away. </joey>
<garnt> - It feels weird there was a point where </garnt>
<connor> "The Seadog channel" was just you inside filming videos. </connor>
<connor> And now that Fifty video that is not outside. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, I'm kinda slacking back, kinda slacking. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) - "Is that honey." </connor>
<garnt> - This is what I'm worried about. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like fuck all right. </garnt>
<connor> So let's say, I wanna get back to the UK at some point. </connor>
<connor> Where the fuck I'm I gonna do on my channel? </connor>
<connor> Everyone's gonna be like, "Why isn't he outside?" </connor>
<connor> Like so what is it I fuckin do </connor>
<connor> in the UK outside? - Just go to Weather Sprints. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - fuckin off. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd just try every pint in Weather Sprints. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not a bad idea actually. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<connor> I'd watch that. - I was afraid you'd </connor>
<joey> try every meal deal at Tesco. </joey>
<joey> - Right, I'd do that too. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I've already tried them all, </connor>
<connor> but I'll prevent like I haven't. </connor>
<connor> - Do it on video. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know what I would do. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'd basically be like shitty Tom Scott at that point, </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> "This is a house, where they get water through a well. </connor>
<connor> "It's really old and stuff." </connor>
<connor> That's like the UK. </connor>
<connor> We don't have anything interesting. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> We only have like really old quirky stuff in the UK. </connor>
<connor> We don't have anything modern that's like fuckin insane. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I guess that's why </garnt>
<connor> I want to travel south side the UK. </connor>
<garnt> It's got some interesting stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - I generally really don't know what I would do </garnt>
<garnt> with my main channel content </garnt>
<garnt> if I ever moved back to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't worry I don't have plans to... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt and Joey] It's not happening any time soon. </garnt>
<joey> - These boys keep me hostage, I'm joking. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I don't know what I would do, I mean I... </connor>
<connor> - This cheque titled "Trash Taste" keeps me hostage. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's very enticing. </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing that's weird. </connor>
<connor> Having, like having a specific spot </connor>
<connor> I need to be in every week, like a job. </connor>
<connor> And when we have to take holidays now, </connor>
<connor> we have to tell the boys, and put in our holiday time. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) To be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, I'm going to be away for this week." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean we could just like... </connor>
<joey> - Put in the hours ahead of time. </joey>
<joey> - Right, yeah yeah. </joey>
<connor> - We could just like, not have Trash Tastes some weeks, </connor>
<joey> but then also it's like, why? Why not? </joey>
<joey> We can easily just make it every week. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not a fan of like the whole, </connor>
<connor> not uploading on holidays. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I only like some of my audience celebrates set holidays, </joey>
<joey> so I don't feel like </joey>
<joey> it's fair to just be like, "Oh fuck you guys." </joey>
<connor> People who don't celebrate the same holidays as me. </connor>
<connor> I'm not giving you content, I'm busy. </connor>
<connor> It's a valid excuse. </connor>
<connor> I think in some ways, when you let your busy part, </connor>
<joey> I also like uploading. </joey>
<joey> And I like the Trash Taste uploads </joey>
<joey> every, every, every week no matter what. </joey>
<joey> It's like no matter how </joey>
<joey> normal people are doing, it's like you can expect </joey>
<joey> that you're gonna get a Trash Taste every week. </joey>
<joey> - It's called like comfort food. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I liked that about channels I watch that. </joey>
<joey> That like no matter where I am, </joey>
<joey> even if 'cause sometimes, </joey>
<garnt> maybe Christmas I got some downtime, </garnt>
<garnt> for an hour or two, I might watch a video </garnt>
<garnt> that's coming out, </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm really excited for. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - I like it, I like it. </connor>
<connor> - Well, the thing about Christmas right? </connor>
<garnt> It's that okay, so you have, you have the beginning right. </garnt>
<garnt> You wake up early with the family. </garnt>
<garnt> You open presents, and everyone opens their presents. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's all merry and happy. </garnt>
<garnt> So what happens between like 11 o'clock to four o'clock. </garnt>
<garnt> - Food and alcohol. </garnt>
<joey> - Food, alcohol and check this out. </joey>
<garnt> You saw this on TV. </garnt>
<connor> - Food comes on at four right? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - Food comes out about four. </joey>
<joey> - You don't have like all Christmas lunch. </joey>
<connor> - I mean like okay. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait, what? </connor>
<garnt> - What's for Christmas lunch? </garnt>
<joey> - Wherever you want. </joey>
<joey> - Whatever you envisioned a dinner to be, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm about to have like an all </garnt>
<garnt> you can eat buffet for dinner. </garnt>
<joey> You better know that </joey>
<garnt> I'm saving space for that Christmas dinner. </garnt>
<joey> - Well no I have that buffet at lunch </joey>
<connor> and then don't have dinner. </connor>
<connor> - I have both. </connor>
<joey> - Because during dinner time I'm busy getting drunk. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, dinner time, Christmas dinner! </garnt>
<joey> It's like one of the best meals of the year. </joey>
<joey> - We don't do that in Australia. </joey>
<garnt> - What do you do in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> - In Australia, we wake up we have, </garnt>
<connor> we open up all the presents or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - And then by that time it's around lunchtime. </connor>
<connor> And then all the family comes over. </connor>
<connor> You have like kind of a late lunch, </connor>
<connor> maybe like two, three o'clock type of </connor>
<connor> like big, big lunch. </connor>
<joey> Finish at like 5:00 pm. </joey>
<joey> And then that's when you get shit-faced with your family. </joey>
<joey> And by the time dinner time rolls around. </joey>
<joey> You're not hungry </joey>
<joey> because your still full from the massive lunch. </joey>
<connor> - I think I have lunch and dinner, Christmas time pig... </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a lunch and dinner. </garnt>
<joey> - For me It's like... </joey>
<joey> - It's one big meal. </joey>
<joey> - No it is one big meal. </joey>
<joey> - I have two big meals. </joey>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - How can your stomach handle that? </connor>
<connor> - It's Christmas baby. </connor>
<connor> The Christmas spirit man. </connor>
<connor> This is the largest my stomach by four times. </connor>
<connor> - The reason we don't have a Christmas lunch </connor>
<connor> or I've never heard of anyone having a Christmas lunch, </connor>
<garnt> is because I'm pretty sure during Christmas dinner, </garnt>
<garnt> you eat enough to like fill yourself up for a fuckin week. </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes like you have </connor>
<garnt> friends who can't come to the dinner or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So, we can meet them for lunch or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're going out on Christmas Day! What! </garnt>
<connor> - Blasphemy! </connor>
<connor> - I go to their house. </connor>
<joey> - What, you don't spend it with your family? </joey>
<connor> - No, no. I'll spend the dinner with my family. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause maybe there's someone who I must... </connor>
<garnt> - You don't spend all day with your family? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, not all the time. Sometimes I do. </connor>
<connor> It depends on like who I can see, when and when I can't. </connor>
<connor> Some people they have like, </connor>
<connor> they're having a Christmas thing </connor>
<connor> and I'll go and say hi, I'll turn up, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll go back and spend the evening with family. </connor>
<joey> - So like last time I went back to Australia, I did that. </joey>
<connor> Like I spent like a Christmas dinner </connor>
<connor> with my friend at my friend's place, like my uni mate. </connor>
<connor> But I did that the day after the actual Christmas event. </connor>
<connor> As like a late Christmas </connor>
<connor> kind of thing. - [Garnt] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - But like on Christmas day, </connor>
<garnt> if I'm not at home with my family, </garnt>
<joey> then something's wrong in the family. </joey>
<garnt> - If I'm not at home (laughs) with the family </garnt>
<connor> or we're not going </connor>
<joey> to another one of our family's relatives' places. </joey>
<connor> Then some beef </connor>
<connor> is going on. - Something is weird. </connor>
<joey> - Some of them are friends, some of them are family. </joey>
<connor> It's kind of a mix, depends who it is. </connor>
<joey> - Okay but like my justification </joey>
<joey> for the Christmas lunch in Australia </joey>
<joey> is that you have to understand that, </joey>
<connor> Christmas day is a very nice summer day. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> Right so, going outside, eating a massive thing </connor>
<joey> by a pool side is </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) very normal in Australia. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, pass me the Turkey, I'm in the pool right now. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - So you don't have a roast? </garnt>
<connor> - No, we do. But outside. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It gets cooked with the sun 'cause it's so hot. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We pop up a whole... </joey>
<connor> - So you just have a fuckin barbecue basically. </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - Not even, we just go out onto the road </connor>
<connor> and just pop a whole chicken on the tarmac. </connor>
<connor> And then it just cooks by itself and it's like </connor>
<connor> ( Joey mimics happy voices) - It's done five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - No but like, it's like reazly, like 34°C, 35°C, </connor>
<connor> like nice summer day right. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, </connor>
<connor> you're out on the balcony with your family. </connor>
<connor> And you're having a nice roast, or pork, </connor>
<connor> or whatever it is that you eat during Christmas. </connor>
<joey> And we have that during the day </joey>
<joey> because the sun's out and it feels good. </joey>
<joey> That's, that's my justification of </joey>
<joey> why we have one meal at like two o'clock. </joey>
<joey> I obviously, if it was like... </joey>
<garnt> - That's so alien to me right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Obviously it feels like winter time right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna go out. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, so okay PM right. </garnt>
<joey> - So, as someone who obviously </joey>
<garnt> grew up in Australia celebrating Christmas that way, </garnt>
<garnt> do you have like this Christmas-y feeling, </garnt>
<joey> like what, do you have a Christmas-y feeling? </joey>
<joey> Or do you have anything </joey>
<garnt> that gives you a Christmas-y feeling? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah Christmas-y feeling is when </garnt>
<joey> I'm having a beer at like 2:00 pm in a pool. </joey>
<garnt> - That could be that's like any day for Australians Joey. </garnt>
<connor> It is (chuckles) every day Christmas. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Hell yeah it is Dawg! </joey>
<joey> - Is it like weird watching Christmas movies. </joey>
<joey> - We don't watch Christmas movies. </joey>
<garnt> - At all? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't, at least our family doesn't. </garnt>
<joey> - Australians do. </joey>
<joey> - Did you have like a Christmas spirit? Like... </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Is it like a dating site. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - Why are you sharp Joey, tell us where you was at? </connor>
<garnt> - I remember 'cause, when I live in Thailand, me and Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> celebrated Christmas there for like two or so years. </garnt>
<garnt> Every year she'd tell me, </garnt>
<connor> "You know what, the trees are up, </connor>
<connor> "we've got the Christmas songs on, </connor>
<connor> "the roasters out." </connor>
<connor> But it doesn't feel like Christmas. </connor>
<connor> She says as, as it is like 35°C </connor>
<connor> and like hot outside. </connor>
<connor> Just doesn't feel (laughs) - Turn on the AC. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't feel like Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - I know, it just doesn't feel like Christmas. </connor>
<joey> - I mean yeah I know, we put up a tree and everything, </joey>
<connor> and we decorated it </connor>
<connor> and we'll put the lights on it and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But it's also, </connor>
<joey> I'm in my board shorts and T-shirt at the same time. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - That just doesn't sound festive to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like board shorts, </garnt>
<connor> board shorts, T-shirts, Christmas hot. </connor>
<connor> There's a great photo of me. </connor>
<connor> Like just with exactly that getup, </connor>
<connor> standing in front of the Christmas tree, </connor>
<connor> sweating my nuts off </connor>
<joey> because it was like 38°C like that. </joey>
<garnt> - So like, is there like a certain period of time </garnt>
<garnt> where you see something, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, Christmas is coming up. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause for me, like in England, </garnt>
<garnt> it was whenever, the weather would start </garnt>
<garnt> getting like really cold. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you'd start seeing </garnt>
<garnt> Christmas decorations pop up here and there. </garnt>
<garnt> What is it like in Australia? </garnt>
<joey> - It's the same thing. </joey>
<garnt> You see... - Is it the same? </garnt>
<garnt> - Christmas decorations pop up. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, it's like oh, </garnt>
<connor> I gotta start taking this jacket off. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - My God! That's so bizarre. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how we do it. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you get any houses which like go absolutely mental </joey>
<joey> with the Christmas decorations? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - It is so odd. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the problem is because it's the summertime right? </garnt>
<joey> You can't turn the lights on until it's like 9:00 pm. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it's still bright outside. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel so sorry for fuckin Santa Claus. </joey>
<garnt> And like with like a hot red jacket. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh he ain't in a hot red jacket. </joey>
<joey> He has no shirt on dude. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He's in red board shorts. </joey>
<joey> Usually no shirt, on a surfboard. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you have like snowmen decoration and shit like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no we know actually... </garnt>
<connor> - Does it snow in Australia? </connor>
<joey> - In some parts it does yes. </joey>
<joey> So in Canberra it does. </joey>
<joey> But not where I'm from no. </joey>
<joey> Not at all. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't get cold enough. </joey>
<joey> It's like the coldest it'll get maybe it's like 10°C. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, but again like </joey>
<joey> that happens in July for us, not Christmas. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) - That's strange. </joey>
<garnt> - What's Christmas for you Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - What'd you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - What's your Christmas spirit? </connor>
<garnt> - What's your Christmas spirit? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm I being interrogated for my Christmas? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, yeah come on. </garnt>
<garnt> What is your Christmas? </garnt>
<garnt> - His Christmas is </garnt>
<joey> not spending the whole day with his family. </joey>
<garnt> - I like spending the day with my family. </garnt>
<connor> - Is Christmas like a special day for you? </connor>
<connor> Not, not like, does it mean something to you, </connor>
<garnt> but like, you know what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just like, it's Christmas just like... </garnt>
<connor> - The day, I'm indifferent towards. </connor>
<connor> I don't feel anything particular on the day. </connor>
<connor> I like spending, It's a good, </connor>
<connor> I like the idea of spending time with the family. </connor>
<connor> I shut up, fuck yourself Mark Zuckerberg right now, don't I? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "I like human activity. </connor>
<connor> "I like seeing people, </connor>
<connor> "on the day of the 25th." </connor>
<connor> - "I'm cooking a skillet." </connor>
<connor> - "With sweet barbecue rice." </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, but Mark Zuckerberg meme's are... </connor>
<joey> - I love that meme. </joey>
<joey> - To me it's like... </joey>
<garnt> I dunno I like watching the Christmas movies. They're fun. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the jingle all the way. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my favorite one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jingle all the way. What's that one? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's where Arnold Schwarzenegger </garnt>
<garnt> tries to buy that figure for his kid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I didn't know the name of that movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love that movie. </garnt>
<garnt> That movie is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like my favorite Christmas movie. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I like Christmas Eve a lot </connor>
<connor> as well actually with my family. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause everyone's kinda like, </connor>
<connor> everyone's trynna warm up. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's kind of like getting the... </connor>
<connor> Yeah getting that family vibe yeah. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause Christmas Eve for us is a normal day. </joey>
<connor> - We don't do anything special. </connor>
<joey> - Cause you see because were nine. </joey>
<connor> - We kinda like all, kinda like talk. </connor>
<connor> Watch TV or drink. Have a nice meal. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause we don't talk otherwise. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> Not as like a collective family unit. </joey>
<garnt> - All right, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll talk to my mom and dad or then I'll go somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> And then my brother will tell, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's never like the whole units together. </garnt>
<garnt> Even now because, me and my family, </garnt>
<connor> all of us live in... </connor>
<connor> Me and my brothers all live in different areas. </connor>
<connor> My brother's gonna go to Canada now as well. </connor>
<connor> - Sure. </connor>
<connor> - So, it's gonna be even harder </connor>
<connor> to get everyone in the same place. </connor>
<connor> - I was the difficult one </connor>
<connor> because I was on the other side of the world, </connor>
<connor> but now Evans is gonna be the difficult one. </connor>
<connor> So, hopefully I'll get to see. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I didn't get to see my older brother </garnt>
<garnt> when I went back to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause he was busy doing </garnt>
<garnt> stuff in Scotland I think, or something. </garnt>
<connor> - You going back this year? </connor>
<connor> - Well the Christmas this year? No. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna deal with travel again. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I lost enough in my lifetime worth, </garnt>
<garnt> but 'cause you didn't go to America </garnt>
<garnt> to see Sidney's family right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I guess that's fair enough. </connor>
<connor> I don't have anything like that. </connor>
<connor> So, I saw my family. </connor>
<joey> They got to see me. </joey>
<joey> I'm like I'll see you next year. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'll probably go back </joey>
<connor> at some point in April or something and see them again. </connor>
<joey> - Was it your parents that said that </joey>
<connor> they would probably never come to Japan? </connor>
<connor> (soft upbeat music) - No. </connor>
<joey> - Why is that? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no. They never said that. </connor>
<connor> - They wanna go to Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Why not next time </connor>
<connor> when the country opens up they come here. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah maybe that too. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't think, they haven't come to Japan before </connor>
<connor> have they? - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - My parents really wanna come to Japan as well. </joey>
<joey> - I bought them, my Christmas present was flights for them. </joey>
<joey> - Oh hell yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Last year. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) - Oh, well you go there. </joey>
<garnt> - Do Christmas presents rollover? </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm like what? </connor>
<garnt> - You haven't redeemed it yet so? </garnt>
<garnt> - I got my own man fine. </garnt>
<joey> - It's sitting there, waiting. </joey>
<connor> - So, I know they want to, </connor>
<joey> they really, really want to. </joey>
<connor> I know that they've, I've really sold them on the idea. </connor>
<connor> When I first moved here, </connor>
<connor> they weren't too hyped on it but after they've watched, </connor>
<connor> after I moved here, </connor>
<connor> they kind of watched a lot more stuff about it </connor>
<connor> and they're really excited to come. </connor>
<connor> Which is great because I can't wait </connor>
<connor> to see how utterly confused they are. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah now I'm really excited for them to come over. </garnt>
<connor> And yeah that'll be fun. </connor>
<garnt> - When was the last time you did spend Christmas </garnt>
<garnt> with your family then. </garnt>
<garnt> it must been in a while right? </garnt>
<connor> - The one before Japan. </connor>
<connor> So, 2019 I was in Japan right? </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - 2019 Christmas then. </connor>
<garnt> - Damn! </garnt>
<garnt> - That's must been a long time man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay so yeah, </garnt>
<joey> fuck, fuck man. - It's three years bro. </joey>
<connor> - Shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, three years ago. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the first Christmas, </connor>
<connor> I'd just moved to Japan in October </connor>
<connor> and I was kinda settling in. </connor>
<connor> So I was like I won't come back, </connor>
<garnt> I'll come back next year, Next Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> That didn't happen. </garnt>
<connor> And then they didn't come by this Christmas either. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you guys ever cook for Christmas? </garnt>
<connor> Or who does the cooking for Christmas? </connor>
<connor> - My dad. </connor>
<garnt> - My dad yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like. </joey>
<connor> - Spends like 12 hours the day before. </connor>
<joey> - My dad spends like two days. </joey>
<joey> - So like what I've always wondered is, </joey>
<garnt> when does the torch get passed over right? </garnt>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - When you got your own kids Garnt, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) 'cause you have no choice. </connor>
<connor> - Hopefully not for a while. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I need a lot of catching up to do. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause yeah I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I've started cooking my own roast as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> I kinda like how my roast cooked </connor>
<connor> but I don't think it's as good as my mom's yet. </connor>
<connor> But I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gunning for it eventually. </connor>
<connor> But I also... </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Gunning for the title. </connor>
<connor> - Also I don't know when in my life </connor>
<connor> I want to like spend my entire day cooking </connor>
<connor> because when you cook </connor>
<connor> a Christmas day... - Never. </connor>
<connor> - You're just like, as a kid, </connor>
<connor> you have comfort in knowing, </connor>
<connor> that's like the parent's job </connor>
<connor> to like deal with. </connor>
<connor> You're out here having fun with your family. </connor>
<connor> They're out there just cooking and all that shit </connor>
<connor> for an entire day. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> when is that gonna be my job. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kind of dreading that. </garnt>
<joey> - When a little baby man is appeasing your life, </joey>
<garnt> I guess that's, </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) that's when you can start. </joey>
<joey> - Joey don't lie, you're just gonna make Aki do it. </joey>
<garnt> - You gonna be like, honey, honey. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, every Thanksgiving, </joey>
<connor> she spends like an entire day cooking food. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> oh fuck that. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) I'm not dong that, </connor>
<connor> are you kidding me. </connor>
<connor> - Here to enjoy the fruits of her labor. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly I get to just enjoy the food right. </connor>
<connor> So, yeah I dunno. </connor>
<connor> Like I've been thinking that too. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like every time, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I guarantee when I go back for Christmas, </joey>
<connor> which I will be by the time this comes out. </connor>
<connor> My dad is gonna force me. </connor>
<joey> It'd be like, "Son, it's time you learnt the way." </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. He's gonna be in the other room. </joey>
<garnt> He's gonna email you, "Dear son..." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, "Dear son." </connor>
<garnt> - He's gonna leave a YouTube comment. </garnt>
<joey> "Dear son come </joey>
<garnt> in the next room." - Yeah in my last video, </garnt>
<joey> "Hey son help me with the roast." </joey>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<joey> Yeah but like, </joey>
<joey> every time I do go back home, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause he cooks every night. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've gotta learn the family recipe right. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah right and like I've learned </joey>
<connor> some of recipes. - Wait what's your </connor>
<connor> dad's like specialty? </connor>
<joey> - My dad's specialty? </joey>
<connor> My dad's specialty is Moroccan chicken. </connor>
<connor> - Wow! That seems Nice. </connor>
<connor> - So, he bought like this, like proper, like Moroccan, </connor>
<connor> like a pot type of thing </connor>
<connor> that has like the kind of funnel lead on it, </connor>
<connor> which is like apparently what they use in Morocco. </connor>
<connor> Please correct me if I'm wrong about that. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it's like spiced Moroccan chicken, </connor>
<connor> dates and lemons. - Do they sound bomb. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - I'm definitely gonna get them </connor>
<connor> to make that when I go back home. </connor>
<connor> But it also takes like six hours to make. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> I mean I love to have that. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah every week in my house, </garnt>
<garnt> but I also don't wanna invest in a fuckin pot, </garnt>
<joey> let alone spend six hours cooking this thing. </joey>
<garnt> - That just means you haven't reached </garnt>
<joey> that point in life yet. </joey>
<connor> When you settle down in a house </connor>
<connor> you're were just like... </connor>
<connor> Maybe I have some spare time to start a hobby. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I should... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause there are some like kitchen ware, </connor>
<connor> which you never use, </connor>
<connor> apart for like that one event in the year. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> When you're like a teenager, you're just like, </connor>
<connor> why would I need this thing? </connor>
<connor> This is just taking up space right. </connor>
<connor> I hardly have any space in my kitchen as it is. </connor>
<connor> But now especially moving into my new house, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I remember going to Connor's house and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> oh Connor this cutlery. </connor>
<garnt> It feels good. It feels good Connor God! </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't Daiso cutlery. </garnt>
<connor> - I bought IKEA's finest. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I did actually feel a little bit </joey>
<joey> like when I helped Aki last year for Thanksgiving. </joey>
<joey> And she made like a Turkey, </joey>
<joey> like a whole Turkey thing. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause we bought an oven finally. </connor>
<connor> And the gratifying feeling of me going, </connor>
<joey> "Honey, bring out the oven tray." </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<garnt> was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Aw! This is special day. </garnt>
<joey> We never bring this thing out oh my God! </joey>
<garnt> Aw! This is a special event. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I am gonna be like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm already like that with like tools. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've slowly... </garnt>
<garnt> - Like which kind of tools? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like DIY like... </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Like hammers and like all that kind of shit right. </joey>
<garnt> - I still don't own a hammer. Not in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, what? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I don't own an hammer. </garnt>
<joey> - Hammers are quite useful. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah they are quite useful. </joey>
<connor> - A mallet maybe, like a rubber mallet is like pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I have a rubber mallet so I use it. </joey>
<joey> - When do you need it? </joey>
<joey> - I never know </joey>
<joey> when you need a hammer - You never know. </joey>
<joey> - But when you need it, </joey>
<connor> you're like thank God for fuckin saying that loud. </connor>
<garnt> - When have you needed one in Japan? </garnt>
<connor> - Like having to like </connor>
<connor> knock some screws out of place or something. </connor>
<connor> - Or nail some things down to like prop, </connor>
<joey> maybe an artwork up or something, or you whatever. </joey>
<connor> - One time my IKEA table was being annoying with the screw. </connor>
<connor> I needed a hammer to like push it. </connor>
<joey> - making like tables and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And you just kinda knock it in. </joey>
<connor> - It's coming a lot more, I can't tell you </connor>
<connor> every use I've had for it. </connor>
<connor> But I remember I've had multiple times I've been like, </connor>
<connor> thank God I finally bought a hammer. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah now that 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> our current place that we're in, </joey>
<connor> 'cause we have two balconies right. </connor>
<connor> And like building those balconies, </connor>
<connor> I was like oh, </connor>
<connor> I am missing like 90% of essential tools. </connor>
<garnt> So I just went out a day </garnt>
<garnt> to like Tokyu Hands or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like binged, like buying, binge-bought. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I just like spooshed </garnt>
<garnt> on all these tools. - All that's yours. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey, doesn't binge AnimE anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Binge is tools. </garnt>
<garnt> - Binges is hardware. </garnt>
<garnt> - Binge is his wallet. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like not gonna lie. </garnt>
<garnt> That was probably </garnt>
<connor> one of the most fun shopping experiences </connor>
<connor> I've had in a long time. - Dou you ever power drill? </connor>
<joey> - I sure do buddy. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God! Do you ever power? </connor>
<garnt> Where can you use a power drill in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Many places. 'Cause after while 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> especially when you're buying furniture, </joey>
<joey> like when you first move. </joey>
<joey> So when I was first building my room, </joey>
<connor> I was like okay, </connor>
<connor> I have a much bigger room now. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna replace all of like </connor>
<connor> the desks, and like shelves and everything, </connor>
<connor> it was like much bigger, nicer place </connor>
<connor> that fit the atmosphere right. </connor>
<connor> So, obviously when you buy stuff from like IKEA, </connor>
<connor> or Amazon or whatever, </connor>
<joey> that don't come in one piece, </joey>
<joey> you gotta fuckin DIY that shit all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've definitely been feeling that, </garnt>
<joey> for like the past few weeks. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't you hate it? </garnt>
<connor> Twisting the fuckin screwdriver for 17 hours in the week. </connor>
<connor> And to the point where your wrist and your thumb </connor>
<connor> starts to get sore. </connor>
<connor> - I do not regret not buying one. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I guess so. </connor>
<connor> - I do, I bought my furniture at the Mall, </connor>
<connor> I regret not buying it. </connor>
<connor> - So, when I bought like my new bookshelf, </connor>
<connor> I was still had the screw right. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, oh good. </connor>
<connor> This bookshelf has 50 screws that I have to screw in. </connor>
<connor> And they're hard as shit as well. </connor>
<joey> By the time I finished like three hours later </joey>
<joey> my hands were so sore. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, fuck it I'm buying a power drill. </joey>
<joey> Because though I had another shelf coming in, </joey>
<joey> built that shit in like 30 minutes cool. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause all I had to do with screw. </joey>
<joey> (Joey mimics screw sound) </joey>
<joey> And I was like </joey>
<garnt> (Joey mimics breathes heavily) </garnt>
<joey> technology, is amazing, is incredible. </joey>
<joey> - Remember when IKEA selling point was like, </joey>
<connor> that you get to build your own furniture, </connor>
<connor> and it's like all convenient and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And now I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I've ordered some furniture off Amazon, </connor>
<connor> which doesn't need to be built. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, this is a fuckin godsend. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> They're ahead of the game man. </garnt>
<joey> - Some IKEA products, </joey>
<joey> I think you can pay them to assemble in your house. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah you can, you can. </joey>
<joey> - Because sometimes IKEA furniture </joey>
<joey> are actually are really good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like they have somethings that are </connor>
<connor> really, really good. - No IKEA has great furniture. </connor>
<connor> It's just like... </connor>
<connor> - Pay me yens to make. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, especially moving into a new place. </garnt>
<garnt> Making one or two things that ain't too bad. </garnt>
<garnt> That's, that's a fun afternoon. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're making like 10 fuckin things in a day, </garnt>
<joey> you're just like, </joey>
<garnt> Can't these things just come pre-built. </garnt>
<garnt> - And there are some like, </garnt>
<joey> there some IKEA things where like, </joey>
<joey> even the way that you have to build, </joey>
<joey> it is like some kind of autistic feat, </joey>
<joey> where it's like fuckin algebra one </joey>
<joey> to get like a fuckin piece in </joey>
<joey> because it just looks so weird </joey>
<joey> on the construction thing and so urgh! </joey>
<connor> - My table kind of broke a little bit, </connor>
<joey> and one of the screws is missing, </joey>
<connor> but I should be fine. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly it happens. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of the biggest things, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest things that annoys me is that, </garnt>
<garnt> now that I've built so much furniture </garnt>
<joey> in the past few weeks, </joey>
<garnt> I know what kinda packaging </garnt>
<garnt> is just like good and optimized. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) And what is awful right? </joey>
<garnt> So, like I was building a shelf yesterday. </garnt>
<connor> And like every single screw, </connor>
<connor> every single compartment, </connor>
<connor> every single plank, </connor>
<connor> had like a number sticker on it. </connor>
<connor> All like came in, came in a bag </connor>
<connor> that was labeled as a certain number. </connor>
<connor> And that's great. </connor>
<connor> Because you look at the instruction manuals and you see ah! </connor>
<connor> These number of screw </connor>
<connor> goes into this number plank. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I fuckin hate the furniture </connor>
<connor> that gives you a bag of screws. </connor>
<connor> And then you get the instruction manuals. </connor>
<connor> And it gives you like 10 different tonne of screws. </connor>
<connor> And doesn't tell you... </connor>
<garnt> - And they all look the same. - And they all look the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - IKEA does that. </garnt>
<garnt> And it fuckin like blows my mind feeling, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to like, it's so fuckin hard </garnt>
<connor> trying to differentiate, </connor>
<garnt> like a screw that's this length, </garnt>
<garnt> and a screw that this length on the instruction module. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> that could be one of 10 screws. </garnt>
<joey> Which screw I'm I supposed to you use. </joey>
<joey> - The one I hate more than that, </joey>
<joey> is like when it tells you like, </joey>
<joey> okay, you have this many screws right? </joey>
<connor> Like you should have 10 screws. </connor>
<connor> And so I go to count and I'm like, why is there 11 screws? </connor>
<connor> That's not the screw. </connor>
<connor> And then I realize one is just there for a spare right. </connor>
<connor> But they don't tell you it's a spare. </connor>
<connor> So you just have to assume that one of them is a spare. </connor>
<connor> So it's like okay, </connor>
<joey> because when you finish building it, </joey>
<joey> and then you realize </joey>
<joey> and you look down and there's like </joey>
<joey> three screws left over, you're like... </joey>
<connor> Well I clearly fucked up somewhere. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes in Japan they give you </connor>
<joey> a pair of gloves with your furniture. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause for some reason you need, </joey>
<joey> it's to not hurt your hands I guess when you build it. </joey>
<joey> They give you like a pair of white gloves. </joey>
<joey> It's really, I don't know it's cute. </joey>
<joey> It's really cute, I never wear them </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, why the fuck would I wear gloves? </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> I don't like, they give you these shitty screwdrivers </joey>
<joey> and like Allen keys and stuff. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like It's such a waste. </garnt>
<garnt> When I buy like eight things </garnt>
<connor> and I have eight shit screwdrivers </connor>
<connor> that I have to get rid of. </connor>
<garnt> - I have a cupboard of just </garnt>
<connor> unused Allen keys. - The shit screwdrivers. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Like the shitty screwdrivers </connor>
<garnt> are less common than the Allen keys. </garnt>
<connor> - I put my own set of Allen keys. </connor>
<garnt> They are all like perfectly measured, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're great, really good quality. </garnt>
<connor> And it's so much better than using these tiny ones </connor>
<connor> where you like destroy your Palm, </connor>
<connor> trynna do that last turn. </connor>
<connor> - They clearly don't understand </connor>
<joey> the concept of torque </joey>
<joey> with some of these. - They're not long enough. </joey>
<garnt> Dongs ones are really long, they're really good.. </garnt>
<connor> It's so easy to just like turn. </connor>
<garnt> - Unlike the quality of, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reasons, </garnt>
<garnt> There are some furniture </garnt>
<garnt> that the quality of the screws, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like </connor>
<connor> all over the place. - Holy shit! </connor>
<connor> - There's some that are just like perfectly ingrained. </connor>
<connor> You can get your stuff in. - Damascus Steel. </connor>
<connor> Enhanced Nails. </connor>
<connor> - And then there are some which I swear </connor>
<connor> are like pre-sheared. </connor>
<garnt> So like you turn it and it's like a fuckin ice skate right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just slipping in and out. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, how am I supposed </garnt>
<connor> to get this screw in. </connor>
<connor> - The worst feeling is when you like, </connor>
<connor> go for that, you take this much of the screw is still out, </connor>
<joey> and you turn it and you feel it shear. </joey>
<connor> And you look at it, and it's like already sheared. </connor>
<joey> You're like fuck! </joey>
<joey> - It's makes like that horrible. </joey>
<joey> (Joey mimics screw drivers turning) </joey>
<joey> - You have to like fully like, </joey>
<garnt> put your full pressure on it, and not stop. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if you let go or It'll like shear it more. </garnt>
<connor> You'll be like fuck I've gotta get this in </connor>
<connor> before I fuck this up. </connor>
<joey> - Is everyone keeping on? </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<connor> You know what we're talking about right? </connor>
<connor> - Just furniture things. </connor>
<joey> - Just middle-aged guy things. </joey>
<joey> But yeah I've just noticed that like, </joey>
<joey> since, having the balcony </joey>
<joey> and having so many like new things to build. </joey>
<joey> I've really enjoyed building furniture. </joey>
<connor> Like on ironically. </connor>
<connor> - Joey I'm just buying furniture I don't need. </connor>
<garnt> - Come into my house and build my furniture. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I've been doing. </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly dude, I'll happily do it. </joey>
<connor> It's actually so fun. </connor>
<connor> I don't know it's like... - I bet he won't. </connor>
<garnt> If you actually like, </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) "Joey, come around this time." </garnt>
<connor> - He says this on camera, camera toes off yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (Connor mimics Joey) - "I'm busy that day." </garnt>
<connor> - No, honestly like, </connor>
<connor> if you like buy me launch or something. </connor>
<garnt> I'll do it. </garnt>
<connor> - All right, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I'll like dead ass help you out. </joey>
<connor> - Do you ever like consider making your own furniture? </connor>
<garnt> Like going proper DIY. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Like buying the wood and everything. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah buying the wood. - I have actually </garnt>
<connor> thought about it. </connor>
<connor> But at the same to. - Same to buy what </connor>
<connor> to make what? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno, just something, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> But like, maybe like a table of fuckin out on the whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Merge on table. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - I have thought </garnt>
<garnt> about it actually. </garnt>
<connor> I have actually thought about it, </connor>
<connor> but like yeah because I dunno. </connor>
<connor> Like I took woodworking like classes </connor>
<connor> a little bit in like uni, because it was like </connor>
<connor> a thing that we had to do. </connor>
<connor> But like, it's weird because I'd specifically remember, </connor>
<joey> I fuckin hated that course. </joey>
<joey> Like I really did not like doing like DIY shit. </joey>
<joey> And it's not until , suddenly I have like moved, </joey>
<joey> and I've got all this like, </joey>
<joey> I think you know what it is. </joey>
<joey> It's not that I enjoy DIY, </joey>
<joey> it's that I like the feeling of getting new furniture. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> So, that just changed drastically as opposed. </connor>
<joey> - But it's like, I think it's well, </joey>
<joey> it's like it's nice because </joey>
<connor> I mean you guys have seen me </connor>
<connor> in this like trance-like state </connor>
<connor> when I'm building shit around. </connor>
<garnt> Where like I literally just turn on music. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just, I'm in my own world </garnt>
<connor> as I'm like making furniture, or like whatever it is. </connor>
<connor> When I'm making something. </connor>
<joey> I think I like that feeling </joey>
<joey> because it's almost meditative to me. </joey>
<garnt> - I like the feeling of buying furniture. </garnt>
<connor> That's, that's a good feeling. </connor>
<garnt> You're like I knew I was. </garnt>
<garnt> I like eating on my furniture </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) when it's done though. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I knew I was odd </connor>
<connor> where you go through the IKEA catalog </connor>
<connor> and you just like, </connor>
<garnt> oh, that's a good looking desk right there. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Catalog, now you're gonna go there in person Garnt. </connor>
<connor> But to go to the IKEA mega store. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta sit down. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta feel the chat. </joey>
<joey> I don't really like. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta consider the furniture way. </joey>
<connor> All that shit. </connor>
<joey> - Everything needs to be considered. </joey>
<connor> - Consider the color of it, the feel of it. </connor>
<joey> When did buying furniture become fun. </joey>
<connor> - Dude fuck! Welcome to adulthood baby. </connor>
<connor> - You know what was the most annoying part of, </connor>
<garnt> I bought that IKEA grass shit right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shit like generic grass </garnt>
<garnt> that goes on your floor. - Patio. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whatever the fuck you want. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I wanted to have some grass </garnt>
<garnt> I could like, it feels nice. </garnt>
<connor> It feels good, It feels good. </connor>
<connor> So, I bought it. </connor>
<connor> Turns out though, those IKEA grasses, </connor>
<connor> like the one thing that sucks about them is that like, </connor>
<connor> you can't measure them. </connor>
<connor> (soft somber music) </connor>
<connor> You can't like fit them in precisely. </connor>
<connor> Like they either fit or they don't. </connor>
<connor> Like you can nearly have some of your </connor>
<connor> belt patio covered or you won't right. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're like squares. </connor>
<connor> I think they're like five by five. </connor>
<joey> - Oh you got the squared tiles. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I got the ones. </joey>
<joey> I just got the roll 'cause my balcony is massive. </joey>
<joey> - Well 'cause IKEA does like square tiles of fake grass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so I didn't really consider how it would fit, </joey>
<connor> but I've roughly measured it. </connor>
<garnt> I thought I was too far, fuckin like it, fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> I realized that I can't block the drain, </garnt>
<garnt> the water drain. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise, no water again. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Obviously. </connor>
<connor> - So, then I was like okay. </connor>
<connor> Well, now I either have </connor>
<connor> like a big chunk of my patio not covered, </connor>
<connor> and it looks weird. </connor>
<connor> Or I have my drain cover drawn, </connor>
<connor> I can't do, so I was like... </connor>
<garnt> - Why not cover it with like there's... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know the tiles, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a wood tile which has holes in it. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you just put that there? </garnt>
<connor> - I have some wood tile on the other side. </connor>
<joey> - What about if you get the square </joey>
<connor> and you cut a hole </connor>
<connor> that partly fix the drain. - So here we go. </connor>
<joey> - And then you can just plop it on top. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's what I did at my place. </joey>
<connor> - Oh okay, so what I did, it's not, it's not, </connor>
<connor> it's not like one big drain. </connor>
<garnt> The drains in the corner somewhere else. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's like the thing that leads into the drain. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Something to be going in it. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, okay fuck it up. </connor>
<connor> Cut the shit in half. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like rock solid plastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] No I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is impossible to cut the shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like what tools did you use to cut it? </garnt>
<connor> - My willpower. I literally like, got this piece of plastic. </connor>
<connor> - A ball saw. </connor>
<connor> - It's like this big right? </connor>
<connor> Not even a saw, I literally just like </connor>
<connor> bent it together with my hands </connor>
<connor> like this right. (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> And then I just kept bending it like that, </connor>
<connor> and it weakened, and then I did it the other way. </connor>
<connor> But the other way it's all plastics </connor>
<connor> so it hurts your hands to bend it but wasn't fuckin bending. </connor>
<connor> So bend it the other way. </connor>
<connor> And I just kept doing this. </connor>
<connor> And it got loose enough where I got some pliers, </connor>
<connor> and I was like cutting the plastic along. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ! </connor>
<connor> - And its so goddamn long. </connor>
<connor> And then I had the problem of okay, </connor>
<connor> because of how these tiles work, </connor>
<joey> there's only like, </joey>
<joey> there's two sides, </joey>
<joey> like the one 90 corner, 90°C. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> This side and this side </joey>
<connor> are like the holes that you connect it to. </connor>
<connor> And these sides have like </connor>
<connor> the clips that it clips into. </connor>
<connor> So I had this problem now, </connor>
<connor> where some of the clips in well, some of it doesn't. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, don't step on that one, </connor>
<connor> when people go to the balcony. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, </connor>
<connor> yeah it's just all gonna like </connor>
<connor> fuckin break and fall apart when you step on it. </connor>
<connor> But it looks nice. </connor>
<garnt> We got it perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it looks nice. </garnt>
<connor> - I hurt my hands and it took so goddamn long. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I like the roll variety </joey>
<joey> because it's designed to be cut. </joey>
<connor> - But like I didn't have </connor>
<connor> a big enough area to warrant a whole roll. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it was a small area. </connor>
<connor> I just wanted grass. I wanted to see more green. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause in my previous place, </garnt>
<connor> I just had like the wood things. </connor>
<connor> The wood tiles. - Those are nice. </connor>
<connor> - Which look nice, </connor>
<garnt> but also, I think I just prefer the feel of fake, </garnt>
<joey> even if it's fake grass. </joey>
<joey> - Fake grass is nice to feel </joey>
<connor> That's why I got some parts wood, </connor>
<joey> just for, to have that over the house. (mumbles) </joey>
<joey> But I have a grasp of where my feet go. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs). </joey>
<garnt> - There's something about with touching grass </garnt>
<garnt> with your feet feels good. </garnt>
<garnt> - What can I say, </garnt>
<garnt> we touch grass. - Yeah, we touch grass. </garnt>
<connor> - I touch grass every morning. </connor>
<connor> Next time you consider insulting me. </connor>
<joey> Remember I have grass, and that I touch. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Even if it's fake grass. </joey>
<connor> - Whenever I see you calling this is touch grass. </connor>
<connor> I'm like don't mind if I do. </connor>
<connor> I go out to my balcony. </connor>
<connor> - Ah! So much grass.. </connor>
<joey> - Do you have a garden in Australia </joey>
<joey> when you were growing up? </joey>
<joey> Did you ever do the gardens? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my dad had a massive garden. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, now that my dad's retired, </connor>
<connor> It's like all he does. Gardening. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you ever consider a garden? </garnt>
<connor> - I know I want a garden. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna look after said garden. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the point right? </garnt>
<connor> The idea of a garden's nice because, </connor>
<connor> we have a garden in our English home. </connor>
<connor> As you know, you've been there. </connor>
<connor> And there was a point in time </connor>
<connor> where my parents would just go to Thailand. </connor>
<connor> And there was a point in time </connor>
<connor> where I would work from home, at that house. </connor>
<connor> And then, in the months that were away, </connor>
<connor> I noticed that the garden </connor>
<connor> just progressively looked like shit. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) And the grass would grow. </joey>
<joey> And then it was at that point where I realized, </joey>
<joey> oh, someone's gonna take care of this garden </joey>
<joey> for it to look good. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna do that. </joey>
<joey> That's so much effort. </joey>
<joey> It's a big garden. - Garnt these garden </joey>
<joey> plants are alive. </joey>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - That's true Garnt. </connor>
<connor> That's true - Plants are living things. </connor>
<connor> - And ever since then, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> the idea of a garden is nice but just... </connor>
<garnt> I've seen a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> like Sidney's house is like a massive garden. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can lose like half a day or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like taking care of it. </garnt>
<connor> - My dad regularly spends multiple days taking care of it. </connor>
<garnt> - Multiple days? And I'm just like... </garnt>
<garnt> - He loves it there. It's like his new child. </garnt>
<connor> But it looks amazing to be fair. </connor>
<connor> He does a really good job. </connor>
<connor> But to me it's just like </connor>
<joey> I don't know how to do is. - I think I would </joey>
<joey> absolutely love it if I had the time to take care of it. </joey>
<connor> - We haven't got to that age yet. </connor>
<joey> We can appreciate, just being able to like, </joey>
<joey> pull out the lawn mower. </joey>
<connor> Have your coffee, or your beer, and just go at it. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. Just grab a hose and just hose down. </joey>
<joey> - Is that a good thing? I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Like when you get older, </garnt>
<garnt> you probably enjoy those pleasures more. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care to enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I remember when I was a kid, </garnt>
<connor> my mom would be like, </connor>
<garnt> Garnt, go cut the grass now. </garnt>
<connor> It's your turn. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like for fucks sake! </connor>
<connor> - They never made me do that. </connor>
<garnt> I did a lot of the other chores. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh they made me do that, I just fuckin hated it. </connor>
<connor> - Because to me it was, my dad was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not letting him do it, it's my garden. </connor>
<connor> It's mine, he's gonna fuck it up. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - My dad was like, </joey>
<connor> if you don't do it, then no dinner tonight. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Okay yes father." </connor>
<connor> And I do it, and I hated it. </connor>
<connor> - I had to do everything else. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I like the fake grass. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "You're not grow." </joey>
<connor> - I hated putting up the laundry. </connor>
<garnt> That's what I hated. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still hate putting out the laundry. </garnt>
<connor> Which is what Sydney does actually. </connor>
<garnt> Sydney loves that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the way it was in my house is that </garnt>
<connor> we had lodged a line and a big stick </connor>
<connor> that props up the line in the middle. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, it was always fuckin annoying </connor>
<connor> when it was windy doing this </connor>
<connor> when I was like smaller as well. </connor>
<connor> And this pole is massive. </connor>
<connor> So, I hated doing it. </connor>
<connor> Mom, these were pressed memories by the way. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) I don't like </connor>
<connor> doing the laundry now, </connor>
<connor> that's because of you, Joey? </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Childhood trauma. </connor>
<connor> - I fuckin hate that pole, piece of shit. </connor>
<connor> They still use this pole as well. </connor>
<garnt> Get a new pole. </garnt>
<garnt> Get a better pole. - Upgrade your pole. </garnt>
<connor> - Get a new pole. </connor>
<connor> - Like I remember, </connor>
<garnt> I remember when I moved to my new place and, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause one of the big thing </connor>
<connor> about my new place that we've added, </connor>
<joey> is a dishwasher. </joey>
<joey> Which as you guys now, </joey>
<joey> you guys have dishwashers now right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I sure do. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, completely changed my life. </joey>
<joey> At the beginning, my mum was like, </joey>
<joey> my mum my entire life, right. </joey>
<joey> Has been like, </joey>
<garnt> we don't need dishwasher. </garnt>
<garnt> My family doesn't need dishwasher. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just, that's just wasteful water. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just like your water bill, and your electricity bill </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna go up, go up. </garnt>
<connor> - The moment I found out </connor>
<connor> the dishwashers use significantly less water. </connor>
<connor> I was like, well that's my excuse </connor>
<connor> for the rest of the timeline. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, I'm never, ever, ever, </garnt>
<connor> washing the hands-like dish again. </connor>
<connor> I'm like you guys you're killing the environment. </connor>
<connor> I can't possibly watch whatever it is. </connor>
<garnt> - And ever since like I've moved into my new place, </garnt>
<garnt> and like I've shown my mum the dishwasher. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like how much less effort it takes to, </garnt>
<garnt> wash dishes after you cook. </garnt>
<connor> - Will you have like a zoom call with her and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Mom look, I press the go button." </connor>
<garnt> - She's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> "I could be looking for a dishwasher for Christmas." </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Just... </joey>
<joey> - Got em. </joey>
<joey> (Joey mimicking Anime tone) - Conversion complete. </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was like where was this my entire life mom? </joey>
<joey> Was I just your dishwasher your entire life, </joey>
<joey> and now that I'm gone, </joey>
<joey> you need an actual dishwasher? </joey>
<joey> Is that it? - Pretty much yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I see how it is mom. </joey>
<garnt> I see how it is. </garnt>
<joey> - Children are just cheap appliance-like conversions right. </joey>
<connor> It's just like, I could spend </connor>
<connor> a lot of money on a lawnmower. </connor>
<joey> Or I could get my son to do it, with the shitty lawnmower. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, when I have children, </garnt>
<connor> you bet your ass </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) they get much old </connor>
<garnt> to do the chores. - You're really describing </garnt>
<joey> why people had kids like hundreds of years ago. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) That's why they had so many. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they'll like well, I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> - So you that get married into a household was like, </joey>
<connor> all right how many things </connor>
<connor> do we need to do every day? Seven. </connor>
<connor> All right, prepare to have seven kids. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not paying for an assistant. I'm getting a kid. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - My PA is gonna be my kid. </connor>
<connor> - Sell my stock son. What will you be selling? </connor>
<connor> - Hiring and clean out. </connor>
<connor> That's like privileged rich people shit. </connor>
<connor> Getting a kid, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) now that's the real shit. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a lie fuck right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing, sorry to go on a tangent. </garnt>
<garnt> I just realized fuck kids for real. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please don't, please don't. </garnt>
<garnt> (Group laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Not that kind. Don't play Samsung music. </garnt>
<garnt> One thing that I hope I get less of next year. </garnt>
<connor> The only regret is that </connor>
<connor> I haven't told these fuckin NFT companies </connor>
<connor> that email me every day to fuck off! </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Fuck off! Stop emailing me about making NFT. </connor>
<joey> Fuck off! </joey>
<garnt> - We all get them and I just... </garnt>
<connor> - So it's not just emails, it's tweets as well. </connor>
<connor> - Did you know notice on some of the tweets </connor>
<connor> where it's just like a bot that gets like retweeted, </connor>
<connor> to be like, you can buy like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how me tweeting about </garnt>
<garnt> like Anime TDS or something </garnt>
<garnt> has anything to do with fuckin NFTs. </garnt>
<joey> - It's either this bot saying, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, you can do something with this NFT." </joey>
<joey> Or it's this one guy who every tweet is consistently like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, you should read this one model." </joey>
<connor> - I never got a visibly angry email before, </connor>
<connor> but this one made me like, I shouted. </connor>
<connor> It was this one, where it says, </connor>
<garnt> "Business invitation from the most anticipated NFT game." </garnt>
<garnt> I've never wanted to hear that string of woods ever. </garnt>
<garnt> And the fact that I got that email </garnt>
<garnt> made me actually... - What the fuck </garnt>
<garnt> is an NFT game? </garnt>
<garnt> (crew murmurs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know! I don't want it! Stop emailing me! </garnt>
<connor> I hate this bro. </connor>
<joey> If you're into it, that's fine. </joey>
<connor> I don't mind, but why do they </connor>
<connor> shove it down our throat? </connor>
<connor> Fuck off! </connor>
<garnt> - Because it's NextGen dude, it's NextGen. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone needs to be up to date on that NextGen shit. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause what it feels like is that </garnt>
<garnt> this thing is this thing that I have </garnt>
<joey> like very little knowledge about it. </joey>
<joey> It's just getting shoved down my throat right. </joey>
<connor> - I understand it and I don't like it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even understand and I still hate it. </joey>
<connor> - Because of the shit that they like, </connor>
<connor> the fuckin stuff they say on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> It's like mind numbing. </connor>
<connor> I hate it's like... </connor>
<connor> Twitter since NFTs has become somewhat worse. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand how Twitter got worse. </connor>
<connor> But like NFTs made Twitter so much more wrong. </connor>
<connor> And then every goddamn YouTuber </connor>
<connor> is like somehow using NFTs </connor>
<connor> for like scams as well, </connor>
<connor> it's awful. - Are they? </connor>
<connor> - So many YouTubers using NFT </connor>
<joey> for like scamming stuff. - Can you explain to me </joey>
<joey> and perhaps the audience that doesn't know. </joey>
<joey> Explain it like I'm five. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck even is an NFT? </joey>
<connor> - So, there's like a... </connor>
<connor> You're basically buying the proof </connor>
<connor> that you own a piece of artwork right. </connor>
<connor> - But it's digital right? </connor>
<joey> - But it's a digital piece of artwork. </joey>
<joey> It's not a physical piece, </joey>
<connor> but in the blockchain which is kind of... </connor>
<joey> I'm not getting into that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) - Yeah don't go into that. </joey>
<connor> - Explain it like I'm five. </connor>
<joey> Explain it like I'm five. </joey>
<connor> - In like proof to the world that you're... </connor>
<connor> Essentially you are paying </connor>
<connor> for the proof that you own something right. </connor>
<connor> That's the most basic way I can explain it. </connor>
<garnt> - So you get a token that can't be replicated </garnt>
<garnt> to say you own this thing. </garnt>
<joey> - So it's like a certificate of authenticity kinda. </joey>
<garnt> - That's exactly what it means. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - That's why people are buying artwork, digital artwork, </joey>
<joey> for like ridiculous amounts of money because, </joey>
<connor> in a sense, even though you can (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> right click and save as that one. </connor>
<connor> (Group laughs) - Got em. </connor>
<connor> - Like there's a token, </connor>
<connor> or like a certificate that says </connor>
<connor> you own the "Original" piece of the artwork. </connor>
<connor> - It's so fuckin. </connor>
<connor> - Even though it's like digital. </connor>
<garnt> - That's dumb as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have friends, good friends, </garnt>
<joey> who like have made a lot of money from it, </joey>
<joey> and that's what they do. </joey>
<connor> And they produce them themselves and they, </connor>
<connor> it's all for them. I don't mind them doing it. </connor>
<connor> I'm not like you can't do it. </connor>
<joey> It's like just this whole aspect </joey>
<joey> of shoving it down everyone's throat. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a craze. </joey>
<joey> - Because people are trynna make money from it. </joey>
<joey> So the only way to get money and make money </joey>
<connor> from a a lot of them, not all of them are scams. </connor>
<connor> There are a lot of scams as well. </connor>
<connor> There are so many scams. </connor>
<connor> And there's like so many scandals and stuff </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there's no regulation or anything. </connor>
<joey> - So do people like by certain NFTs </joey>
<garnt> and then resell them at a higher </garnt>
<garnt> price or something. - Yeah, a lot of it yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So it's just like an investment. </joey>
<connor> (group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's how they frame it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's how they phrase it yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But the stuff like, </joey>
<joey> there's been stuff like insider trading </joey>
<joey> where like websites that sell NFTs and showcase them. </joey>
<joey> They have like things. </joey>
<connor> There was like one case where </connor>
<connor> this thing where they basically </connor>
<connor> promote an NFT every week, </connor>
<connor> and they guy, one of the like COOs or something </connor>
<connor> new which NFT was coming up. </connor>
<connor> So he would buy a bunch of that, </connor>
<connor> that type of artwork. </connor>
<connor> And then when it went up, </connor>
<joey> he would sell it and make a ton of money. </joey>
<joey> But there's no laws against it </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's not considered insider trading </joey>
<joey> because it's cryptocurrency. </joey>
<joey> - The siren police isn't gonna come. </joey>
<garnt> - So there's like this, it's just the wild west right now. </garnt>
<garnt> And for some people it's great. They love that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a place where, </garnt>
<connor> because there's no rules, there's no regulation. </connor>
<joey> A lot of people can get scammed. </joey>
<joey> A lot of people can make... - A lot of scams. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of money very, very fast. </joey>
<garnt> And it's just kind of like a toxic environment right now. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and it sounds like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get so many scams. </garnt>
<garnt> And I hate the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers have started promoting them and doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course they have. </garnt>
<garnt> - It' fuckin awful. </garnt>
<joey> "Oh you have really is my NFT yeah yeah..." </joey>
<garnt> - Which is like a shame 'cause I like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the idea and the technology </garnt>
<garnt> has like so much potential, </garnt>
<garnt> and now it's just being used for like </garnt>
<garnt> really shitty things basically. </garnt>
<connor> - And there's also the criticism </connor>
<joey> that it's terrible for the environment </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> - Wait how's it terrible for the environment? </joey>
<joey> - Oh 'cause the (mumbles). Oh God! </joey>
<joey> - Do I have to go do my own research? </joey>
<joey> - The way that like... </joey>
<joey> how the system works, </joey>
<joey> it uses a shit ton of computing power </joey>
<joey> to have the blockchain. </joey>
<joey> It's quite inefficient in general, </joey>
<garnt> it wastes a lot of energy to run these fuckin nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically like, some of these cryptocurrencies </garnt>
<garnt> at the moment, have as much energy usage </garnt>
<connor> as some countries to run right? </connor>
<connor> - Genuinely (chuckles) It's insane. </connor>
<connor> - Like the network that NFTs run on, </connor>
<garnt> which is called Ethereum. </garnt>
<garnt> I think uses as much energy as like Sweden </garnt>
<connor> or one of those countries. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not like this boomer </connor>
<connor> who's like anti-progress and anti technology. </connor>
<connor> I'm all for like good technology. </connor>
<connor> But it just feels like the way it's been going </connor>
<connor> is such a fuckin mess and it's like, it's just awful. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, because it's actually been shoved down my throat. </garnt>
<garnt> I did actually do like my research and reading </garnt>
<garnt> into this thing because like, </garnt>
<garnt> if there's this thing, </garnt>
<connor> like I like to understand things. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like, </connor>
<connor> the problem now is that, it's just so fuckin you, </connor>
<connor> that nobody knows what the fuck to do with them. </connor>
<connor> It's the wild west. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like as like, </connor>
<connor> as the years progress and it becomes more stable </connor>
<connor> then this could, there is potential for this technology </connor>
<connor> to be used for something actually good. </connor>
<connor> And it will, I feel like it, </connor>
<garnt> this technology will be more sustainable </garnt>
<garnt> in the future as well as </garnt>
<garnt> cryptocurrency is kinda figure out, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, let's build a system that doesn't, </garnt>
<garnt> "like burn the entire Amazon rainforest </garnt>
<garnt> "to get running right." </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel just right now, </garnt>
<garnt> it is like, I'm staying the fuck away from this. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah I'm not touching it like they need... </connor>
<connor> Although that's the last thing they want. </connor>
<connor> It does need some kind of regulation in some sense, </connor>
<connor> to stop all these fuckin scams. </connor>
<connor> And the reason why I know how many scams there are, </connor>
<connor> is because they always reach out to us, </connor>
<connor> to ask us to promote them. </connor>
<connor> There's so many that ask us to promote them. </connor>
<connor> And this is like this fuckin nonsense and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, we're like a Badger Poop NFT, wanna... " </connor>
<connor> And it's like fuck off! </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) Just fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> Like it's so crazy. - Are you looking forward to </garnt>
<garnt> NFTs being added to </garnt>
<garnt> your favorite video games? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> I think if it gets to a point where it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's not like fuckin burning the planet and it's chill. </connor>
<connor> And it's not so scummy. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like real, like I see this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like the CSGO skin community </garnt>
<garnt> is like salivating right now. Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) Yeah NFT skins and memes </connor>
<joey> surprise came over. </joey>
<joey> It'll probably get there at some point. </joey>
<joey> I can see it happening. </joey>
<joey> I can easily see it happening, </joey>
<joey> if you having one of a kind skin. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like so out of the loop </joey>
<connor> with like that kind of </connor>
<joey> like NFT, crypto and shit... - Honestly good. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like this is what my grandma must have felt </joey>
<joey> when VR was introduced. </joey>
<connor> It's like where it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I just can't wrap my head around. </connor>
<connor> Like I did ask, </connor>
<connor> like when you said Ethereum, </connor>
<connor> I was like oh okay yeah. </connor>
<connor> I've heard of that. </connor>
<connor> Because the first time I heard Ethereum. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I'm pretty sure you can collect that </joey>
<joey> in StarCraft right. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like that's what it sounded like to me. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, oh wait no, </connor>
<connor> it's like a crypto thing, okay nevermind I don't wanna... </connor>
<joey> I feel very old right now my bad. </joey>
<joey> - That's the only trend I hope changes or dies down. </joey>
<garnt> That's all I want. I don't care about anything else. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just stop it now. </connor>
<connor> - I just want some actual cool applications </connor>
<joey> that are not just selling overly priced artwork, </joey>
<joey> which is just the exact same fuckin artwork. </joey>
<joey> The amount of times </joey>
<joey> I've seen that monkey NFT. - Oh my fuckin God! </joey>
<garnt> - Like with just different skins. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know what that monkey NFT is. </garnt>
<connor> - "I've got the skin moist wearing the pirate hat," </connor>
<joey> and it's like fuck off! </joey>
<joey> Do you realize how stupid this sounds. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Oh God! </joey>
<joey> - At least if some guy spends talking $200 on a Monet, </joey>
<connor> he's got a fuckin Monet, </connor>
<connor> I don't think that's good either, </connor>
<connor> but at least he's got the fuckin painting. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Didn't burn down the rainforest to get a fuckin token. </joey>
<joey> I understand it's such a boom right now. </joey>
<garnt> I hate all this stuff man it sucks. The scam suck too. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah again, I hope that it gets some kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> I hope that </garnt>
<garnt> it claims up its act. - Regulation. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it stops being so shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah because like I was reading up about </garnt>
<garnt> like the possible applications NFTs could have. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, you have a Non Fungible... </garnt>
<garnt> NFT stands for No Fungible Tokens. </garnt>
<connor> So of course, right now it's been used </connor>
<connor> as a certificate to say, </connor>
<connor> you own this stuff, </connor>
<garnt> but it has like a lot more applications above that. </garnt>
<garnt> You can think about hey, </garnt>
<connor> sending over certification to say hey, this person, </connor>
<connor> let's say has a driver's license, </connor>
<connor> or is certified, </connor>
<connor> has a master's degree or something </connor>
<connor> along those lines. - Along those lines yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like one centralized unit </connor>
<connor> that anyone can check. </connor>
<connor> So we don't rely on like some companies, </connor>
<connor> like forging driver's license or documentation. </connor>
<joey> - Or like have to got all the way to like... </joey>
<joey> - Or even thinking about house ownership </joey>
<connor> or any kind of ownership. </connor>
<joey> - The amount of fuckin paperwork. </joey>
<joey> Think of how much it can revolutionize Japan. </joey>
<joey> If there was one system that said, </joey>
<garnt> this person owns this, and this person owns that. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, that's got so much potential to like, </garnt>
<garnt> like reduce the paperwork by tenfold. </garnt>
<joey> You gotta give Japan time. </joey>
<garnt> They've just discovered databases so like... </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Japan still uses the fuckin desk card. </connor>
<connor> - They've just discover what Excel is. </connor>
<joey> Maybe like 30, 40 years time for them. </joey>
<joey> - I think there's a lot of exciting things </joey>
<joey> that it could be useful, </joey>
<garnt> but right now it is... </garnt>
<joey> - That sounds cool right. </joey>
<garnt> - Like yeah, that sounds like a real life use. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like, the only piece of news I saw about NFT </garnt>
<garnt> is when it was first popping up </garnt>
<joey> was like the original Nyan cat GIF </joey>
<joey> got like sold as an NFT for like </joey>
<joey> some stupid amount of money. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, who? </garnt>
<garnt> - What I wanna know is, who sold it? </garnt>
<garnt> And how did they prove that they had ownership of it? </garnt>
<joey> - I think it might've been the original creator. </joey>
<joey> - [Crew Member] I think, even like the original creator </joey>
<joey> was like, there's actually a loophole for this. </joey>
<joey> We can't actually like... </joey>
<joey> This concept is actually not applicable to what... </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's, that's the biggest loophole </garnt>
<joey> I don't understand. - So what we're saying is, </joey>
<joey> we can't authenticate whether it's authentic or not. </joey>
<garnt> (Group and crew laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - [Crew Member] Yeah, that's what they've said. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck! </joey>
<joey> (Group laughs) </joey>
<joey> Does that not seem ass backwards to you. </joey>
<joey> - [Crew Member] Yeah, and then someone took their image </joey>
<joey> and like "Ah, yeah, whatever." </joey>
<joey> - My God! (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's still a lot about this place </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand. </garnt>
<connor> So I'm not gonna, </connor>
<garnt> I'm only gonna comment on things that I do know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I just want less scums. </garnt>
<garnt> Just to put it less scums. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] So like for example like </garnt>
<garnt> a single Ethereum transaction </garnt>
<garnt> consumes as much electricity </garnt>
<connor> as an average US household uses in a work week, </connor>
<connor> and has a covered footprint equivalent to 140,893 Visa, </connor>
<joey> like for example Visa credit card transactions, </joey>
<garnt> or 10,595 hours of watching YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck! </connor>
<connor> (soft upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - So that's like every NFT transaction </connor>
<connor> that's being made right now. - That's fuckin insane. </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] So 10,000 hours of watching YouTube </connor>
<connor> is more than that fuckin (mumbles) </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck! Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah right now it is... </garnt>
<joey> - We truly live in a society. </joey>
<joey> (Group and crew laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Bro, that's actually depressing. </connor>
<joey> That's so depressing to hear. Fuck! </joey>
<joey> - What a way to end the year. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Well, happy new year gamers! </joey>
<garnt> Hope you get a good one. - Happy new year. </garnt>
<connor> - Hopefully next year you won't be </connor>
<connor> as depressed hearing that. </connor>
<joey> - Merry Christmas if you celebrate it, </joey>
<joey> if not happy holidays, </joey>
<joey> if not, have a good day. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna buy </garnt>
<joey> an NFT of my favorite... - Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> Fortnite narrative skin. </joey>
<garnt> That's what I'm gonna buy. - Oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fuckin getting out. </garnt>
<garnt> Get me outta here. Get me outta here! </garnt>
<garnt> - Did they sell the GIF of Genjutsu? </garnt>
<connor> (Group laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I want my resin gun, thank you very much. </garnt>
<connor> (Group and Crew laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] He maybe out of chakra </connor>
<connor> but he ain't out of bullets. </connor>
<joey> - He ain't out of bullets. </joey>
<connor> - Well hope you enjoyed this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
