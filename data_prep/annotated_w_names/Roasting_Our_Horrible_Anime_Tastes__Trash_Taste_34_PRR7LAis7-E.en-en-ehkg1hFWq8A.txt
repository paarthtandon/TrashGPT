<garnt> - Get your nostalgia talk out of here, </garnt>
<garnt> Pokemon wasn't that great. </garnt>
<joey> - But I'm pretty sure you'd give Digimon an eight. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Digimon is better than Pokemon. </garnt>
<connor> I will fight you on this. </connor>
<joey> - The Digimon kid is like the OG neighbor's kid. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? - What? </connor>
<connor> (bright upbeat music) </connor>
<joey> - What's up crack heads? </joey>
<joey> Welcome to another episode of "The Trash Taste Podcast." </joey>
<joey> I'm your host, Joey. </joey>
<joey> And I'm with the other two crack heads. </joey>
<garnt> - I like how you like started with alliteration </garnt>
<connor> at the start of this podcast. </connor>
<connor> So now it's just like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, what happened to that? </connor>
<garnt> You gave up with the alliteration. </garnt>
<connor> - What's up you crack heads? </connor>
<connor> There you go. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - Stop saying crack heads, we need to monetize. </connor>
<connor> - No, we won't. </connor>
<connor> It'd be fine, YouTube knows it's a joke. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - YouTube has a sense of humor. </joey>
<connor> YouTube's notorious for having wild sense of humor. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - YouTube gets the jokes, YouTube gets the memes. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they understand satire. </connor>
<garnt> - They never de-monetize for no reason at all. </garnt>
<connor> Never happened in the history of YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - No, of course not. </joey>
<connor> - Ask any YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not like It happened </garnt>
<garnt> on the last Chris episode or anything. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's fine. </joey>
<garnt> - To be fair, I think that was just </garnt>
<garnt> the copious amount of alcohol we consumed in that episode. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that was the demonetization. </garnt>
<connor> - Chris forced us into just being a mess. </connor>
<connor> Which I'm fine with, but it's just a mess. </connor>
<connor> But, welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<joey> - Welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> Hopefully, this one's not gonna get demonetize, </joey>
<joey> because we're gonna be talking about, Anime. </joey>
<joey> - Whoa, wait. </joey>
<garnt> We're gonna be talking about what? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you remember when? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> Trash Taste talking about Anime? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you remember when this podcast was Anime podcast? </joey>
<joey> We're gonna bring that back. </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad that I stopped this </joey>
<connor> from becoming an Anime podcast my influence. </connor>
<connor> I did everything in my power. </connor>
<joey> - And then me and Garnt were like no, </joey>
<joey> we must bring it back. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I'm feeling nostalgic now </garnt>
<garnt> because I get to talk about </garnt>
<garnt> Anime again on this podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> My fucking God. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, we barely talk about Anime on our own channels. </joey>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I like it that way. </connor>
<connor> I like being an Anime fan that's what I like. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> We're all Anime fans but today we're gonna talk about it. </connor>
<connor> We're gonna talk about some Anime. </connor>
<connor> Most specifically, </connor>
<connor> we are gonna be doing what we do best, </connor>
<joey> which is roasting our Trash Tastes in Anime. </joey>
<garnt> - As like Anime YouTubers, and Connor. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You gotta do me like that? </connor>
<garnt> All right, fair enough, fair enough though. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of the most annoying questions we get </garnt>
<garnt> I'll asked them sure is, </garnt>
<garnt> what is your favorite Anime? </garnt>
<garnt> Like you get asked this at every panel, </garnt>
<garnt> at every fan meetup you've ever gone to. </garnt>
<garnt> And I swear to God, I don't know about you, </garnt>
<garnt> but I have a different answer every time </garnt>
<connor> - No, I've loaded a default answer </connor>
<joey> so that I don't have to think, </joey>
<joey> and that will like satisfy them. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, same, I just say sold online, </connor>
<joey> so that they can laugh and shut up. </joey>
<garnt> But as Anime YouTubers we are normally </garnt>
<garnt> the ones judging other people's tastes </garnt>
<garnt> but now we are putting our own taste on the line </garnt>
<garnt> and we are judging each other's tastes, </garnt>
<garnt> and letting you all judge our tastes along with us </garnt>
<garnt> because like normally we don't promote my Anime list or, </garnt>
<garnt> we'll get into what we're doing. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's basically, </garnt>
<garnt> we are going to be showing each other's my Anime list. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yup. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then afterwards we are going to be... </garnt>
<garnt> If you guys remember, </garnt>
<garnt> there was this trend in the Anime community before </garnt>
<garnt> called three by threes. </garnt>
<garnt> Where you basically pick nine Anime, </garnt>
<garnt> in a three by three grid </garnt>
<garnt> that you show to your fellow brethren. </garnt>
<garnt> And that basically encapsulates kind of your taste of Anime. </garnt>
<joey> - It's basically just like </joey>
<garnt> a Pinterest collage of Anime. </garnt>
<connor> - We're a bunch of fucking Tumbler girls in this community. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - This is my collage guys, </connor>
<connor> I just got my collage. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it definitely started by </connor>
<joey> like Tumblr or Pinterest or something like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was started by 4Chain actually. </garnt>
<joey> - Was it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of all things 4Chain creates, </joey>
<joey> they made this. </joey>
<joey> So in Trash Taste spirit, </joey>
<garnt> we're gonna bring back trash box can right here. </garnt>
<garnt> If you guys remember from our Akiba episodes </garnt>
<joey> - That was over half a year ago. </joey>
<joey> - That was like six seven months ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - But we are gonna bring him back. </garnt>
<garnt> And to make it fair, </garnt>
<connor> we're gonna pull out... </connor>
<connor> Oh wait, what's this doing in here? </connor>
<joey> - That was me, I did put that. </joey>
<joey> I've made it very clear how I feel about Funkopops. </joey>
<connor> - Where it belongs, where it belongs. </connor>
<joey> - She's been living there for awhile. </joey>
<connor> - You can chill with Mike this episode. </connor>
<connor> We'll give you some slides. </connor>
<joey> - I do wanna mentioned while Joey is </joey>
<connor> pulling out the first name that... </connor>
<connor> This is my hidden Anime list. </connor>
<connor> So I actually have one from when I was a teenager </connor>
<connor> - Right. - that I never made public, </connor>
<connor> and people would always ask me for my Anime List. </connor>
<connor> So I actually made a my Anime list under SeadogVA </connor>
<connor> and just put like Boku No Pico as Like a 10. </connor>
<connor> And then every now and then </connor>
<connor> I get a comment on it being like, </connor>
<connor> I hate you, Connor. </connor>
<joey> So, hi. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my username as well, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I've done a video on it already, </joey>
<connor> so people know. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, </connor>
<connor> my username is not even the Anime Man. </connor>
<connor> - It was blasphemy. </connor>
<connor> - It was the username I used </connor>
<connor> before I was the Anime Man to DeZinga. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - What are you, a Big Bang Theory fan? </joey>
<connor> - Wait, DeZinga? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Where did that come, oh. </connor>
<garnt> - Because my surname is Basinger. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And is it like Big Bang Theory? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Bazinga, right? </connor>
<connor> - He's never heard that one before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've never heard of that one before. </connor>
<connor> - Well, fucking pull a name out already. </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - You've just been like fingering that </joey>
<joey> for a fucking a mellinum there. </joey>
<joey> - The first one is, oh, it's me. </joey>
<connor> All right, I'll go first. </connor>
<connor> - Fantastic. </connor>
<garnt> - Fan fucking fantastic. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's check out Dezinga's Anime list. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> So first thing I got to ask is </garnt>
<joey> when was the last time you remember updating this? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause like I'm gonna say this now, </garnt>
<garnt> we're all picking up our mals, </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't updated my mal in years. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I'll give you an idea, all right. </joey>
<joey> I'm looking at my watching lists right now </joey>
<joey> and Boku No Hiro Academia second season is on you. </joey>
<connor> - You've got 91 Days here, </connor>
<joey> and that was like what, 34 years ago? </joey>
<joey> Tell us some. </joey>
<joey> - No, I've already finished that one though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's like... </joey>
<joey> How long ago was that, 91 Days? </joey>
<joey> Two years ago? </joey>
<connor> - God, no. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - When did season two of My Hero come out? </connor>
<connor> Like two years ago? </connor>
<connor> - I think two years ago. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> It was two years ago? </garnt>
<connor> No, it wasn't two years ago. </connor>
<connor> It was like fucking three. </connor>
<connor> - Three guys realize they're boomers. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Three, four years ago. </joey>
<joey> - Three, four years ago. </joey>
<joey> So it's been that long since I've updated it. </joey>
<joey> - All right, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So wait, wait. </joey>
<joey> You're telling me, you've watched </joey>
<garnt> My Hero Scademia season one? </garnt>
<joey> - I finished season one, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - How come you've like never talked about this before? </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause it was like the most six out of 10 </joey>
<connor> show I've ever watched. </connor>
<connor> - But you'd normally milk that for all it's worth </connor>
<connor> being like, yo it's mid bro, </connor>
<connor> I'm triggering all the little weeds out there. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, like I could but also it's like, I dunno. </joey>
<garnt> To me like calling My Hero Academia mid, </garnt>
<garnt> is just as much of a popular opinion </garnt>
<garnt> as saying that it's a 10 out of 10, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - The first thing that pops out to me on this... </garnt>
<connor> - It's mid but you gave it a seven out of 10. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's all right. </joey>
<joey> - How is seven mid? </joey>
<joey> - It was good. </joey>
<garnt> But it wasn't like </garnt>
<joey> the second coming of Jesus that people thought. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, all right, go on. </joey>
<joey> - The first thing that pops out to me here, right? </joey>
<joey> The first thing that pops out to me here, </joey>
<joey> this is how I know Joey's my fucking brethren here, right? </joey>
<joey> Because as we all know, </joey>
<joey> I started as the Anime Zone. </joey>
<garnt> And my very first Anime Zone review was bleach. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I gave a seven. </garnt>
<garnt> And I can see that Mr. Joey the Anime Man, </garnt>
<garnt> also gave Bleach a seven out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Despite the fact how much we've shitted on Bleach </garnt>
<garnt> in our like professional career. </garnt>
<joey> - Look, look, look, </joey>
<joey> when I shit on Bleach, right? </joey>
<joey> I mean, granted, I've never really like </joey>
<joey> publicly shit on Bleach all that much. </joey>
<connor> I didn't make like a fucking Anime Zone review </connor>
<connor> on Bleach or anything, </connor>
<connor> But, look the only thing, it's three points off, </connor>
<connor> for the Eisenach. </connor>
<connor> And then everything else was perfect. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean I would argue everything </garnt>
<garnt> off the so Sole Society. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean you can like the.... </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - or whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - The way Kamindo work was fine as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I mean it was fine. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never watched but we never watched .... </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't need to, you are not missing much. </garnt>
<joey> - And if you do just read or watch up to Saul society, </joey>
<joey> which is the first talk. </joey>
<connor> - Which is what I've heard, you can't just stop. </connor>
<joey> If you're like, really into it. </joey>
<joey> - You kinda have to. </joey>
<joey> - You can't just though you want to see it go down. </joey>
<connor> - No you can. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it depends like, </connor>
<connor> because Bleach didn't go out with a bang. </connor>
<connor> - No I know, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It just like kinda fizzled out. </connor>
<connor> - Well I have watched all like reviews </connor>
<connor> of Bleach for some reason. </connor>
<connor> I've watched like every eye patch Wolf video on it </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, yeah cool, this sounds good. </connor>
<joey> - Look don't get me wrong, it was back in the day </joey>
<joey> when it was serializing it was a super solid show in Manga. </joey>
<joey> And like as much as I like to think that I'm like oh, </joey>
<joey> I like all the underground like weird, non-mainstream show. </joey>
<joey> I love my show in and Bleach was one, </joey>
<joey> like so I said it was just fucking awesome. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly to this day, I think Bleach is one of just </garnt>
<garnt> the coolest Anime to come out. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it definitely I like, out of the big three </garnt>
<garnt> which is like One Piece, Naruto and Bleach. </garnt>
<garnt> Bleach was just like that fucking cool kid, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - It always seemed like the edgiest one. </connor>
<joey> - It was definitely the edgiest one. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean have you seen what .... looks like? </joey>
<connor> It looks like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I mean I used to always see the mute AMVs </connor>
<garnt> and was like Lincoln park with Bleach. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean that was pretty much Bleach. </garnt>
<connor> - No that was Bleach, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it wasn't like, it went better with like Bleach </connor>
<connor> 'cause they had like half skills and share </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's going on with this man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just fucking sick dude. </connor>
<connor> - Like the powers were sick. </connor>
<garnt> It was just, the sword powers were sick then like Kubo. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna see some more bad guys god damn it. </joey>
<garnt> - Say what you want about Kubo </garnt>
<joey> but like he has a good fashion sense. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The way he dressed the characters, </joey>
<joey> they just always looked cool. </joey>
<garnt> Really. - The drip was clean. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the perfect way to decide to each characters. </joey>
<joey> - The drip was clean. </joey>
<garnt> - Like say what you want about Bleach, </garnt>
<joey> those characters had drip man. </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't go as far as to say that </joey>
<joey> Bleach might be maybe not the first, </joey>
<joey> but definitely one of the biggest shows </joey>
<joey> that kind of gave like I don't know, </joey>
<joey> maybe it's street wear and Animes like collaborations. </joey>
<joey> I would argue maybe came from Bleach </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Because </joey>
<joey> a lot of the characters, </joey>
<connor> especially in like the title channels </connor>
<connor> that he wrote during the Manga. </connor>
<connor> Like he gave them such cool fucking looking street wear </connor>
<connor> that honestly you can see people wearing </connor>
<connor> like people being me. </connor>
<connor> - This is why Drip Goku exists. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, Bleach is the reason why Drip Goku exists. </joey>
<connor> - Wait this a meme? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What is Drip Goku? </connor>
<garnt> (all laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's this fucking, I don't know who made it. </connor>
<connor> - I'll show you. </connor>
<connor> - But like it's this fucking meme of like Goku, </connor>
<joey> like in the fucking, like b-boys stands </joey>
<joey> wearing this fucking drip. </joey>
<connor> - It's like a big meme right now. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why this is a meme. </connor>
<connor> I tried to explain it to some people </connor>
<connor> and they're like but why is it to meme? </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, I don't know, but it's a meme. </joey>
<joey> - But the drip is clean. </joey>
<garnt> - What is going back to Dragon Ball fans, </garnt>
<garnt> what is Dragon Ball memes man? </garnt>
<garnt> Did this start on Twitter? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know all I remember seeing is Drip Goku. </connor>
<connor> It's a meme. </connor>
<joey> - And then Vegeta wearing like the Supreme black sweater </joey>
<joey> as always just being like, that's clean man. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no my God. </joey>
<connor> - Goku got drip apparently that's all I know. </connor>
<connor> - Goku got drip, bro. </connor>
<connor> - And there would be no Drip Goku without Drip Bleach. </connor>
<connor> - And if it wasn't for Bleach, there will be no Drip Goku. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I feel liked every kind of Dragon Ball meme </joey>
<joey> under the sun has just been like every cancerous meme </joey>
<garnt> and like literally cancerous memes. </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of the Dragon Ball Community. </garnt>
<connor> - I get lost for words you're like </connor>
<connor> what the fuck did I just says. </connor>
<joey> - I'm surprised you've never seen it's all over Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - So you rated Bleach the same as My Hero Season One. </connor>
<connor> Would you still stand by that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I would, because like look again </joey>
<joey> as much as I don't think My Hero </joey>
<joey> is like the second coming of Christ. </joey>
<joey> Season one was solid as fuck, like I enjoyed it. </joey>
<garnt> - I would say for me, My hero it goes season two, </garnt>
<joey> then season one, then season three, right? </joey>
<joey> We haven't had season four yet, haven't we? </joey>
<connor> - I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, no, no, no, no, no we haven't. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't know, we have no. </connor>
<joey> - No, we haven't. </joey>
<garnt> It's coming up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Marilyn, have we had My Hero Academia Season Four? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's coming. - It's coming. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, season four is coming so we don't even know. </connor>
<garnt> - We're such fake amateurs we don't even know if we have </garnt>
<garnt> My Hero Academia Season Four. </garnt>
<connor> The most mainstream I make. </connor>
<connor> - The biggest three attitude is don't know </connor>
<joey> if there's a next season of My Hero Academia or not. </joey>
<joey> - So the next one for now. </joey>
<connor> I saw on Twitter everyone was like the next doc is boring. </connor>
<connor> And I was like great, just another year </connor>
<connor> of just mediocre fucking showing. </connor>
<joey> - Even the show in right now, </joey>
<joey> it's just like, yeah whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean like the thing is with My Hero </garnt>
<garnt> is that I started of really, really liking it. </garnt>
<garnt> And to me like out of all the modern show </garnt>
<connor> and it had the potential to be the greatest, right? </connor>
<connor> Like they had the potential to reach like a higher ceiling </connor>
<connor> than say something like say Black Clover </connor>
<connor> or Demon Slayer or something like that. </connor>
<connor> But it seems like the setup is there </connor>
<connor> and the potential is there </connor>
<connor> but there just hasn't been that moment for me </connor>
<garnt> to really make me love this. </garnt>
<garnt> And it seems like the more I watch </garnt>
<garnt> just the less and less interest I get in there. </garnt>
<joey> - Well that's how I kind of felt watching season one </joey>
<joey> like the first half of season one to me was like, okay </joey>
<joey> I like this premier, like superheroes, quirks, okay cool. </joey>
<joey> I can see why people are into this and it's good shit </joey>
<garnt> like action scenes were pretty fucking solid, </garnt>
<garnt> characters pretty fucking soul. </garnt>
<garnt> But then the further along I got, I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah all right. </garnt>
<garnt> All right, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's just a show in like. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just good. - It's good. </joey>
<joey> - It's acceptable. </joey>
<connor> - It's like I struggle to find words just to describe </connor>
<connor> how I feel towards it 'cause I'm just at the beginning, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like yeah, I really liked this. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty hyped for this and the more I've watched, </connor>
<connor> the more I'm just like, yes good. </connor>
<connor> Yes, no, not really much to say about it. </connor>
<joey> It's just good. - Is good. </joey>
<joey> - It's good. </joey>
<joey> - It's adequate. </joey>
<connor> - It's like going to a cousin's birthday party. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, yeah I'll go, I'll go </connor>
<joey> but like, I'm not that thrilled about but I'll turn up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'll be supportive. </joey>
<joey> - How's your cousin's birthday? </joey>
<joey> It was good. </joey>
<joey> - It was fun. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's how I feel. </joey>
<connor> That's how the show is in my mind. </connor>
<joey> - That's it exactly. </joey>
<joey> But that's the thing like people make it out to be </joey>
<connor> because I'm not praising the shit out of a publicly </connor>
<connor> people immediately think, "Oh Joey hates My Hero Academia." </connor>
<joey> I don't hate My Hero Academia, I just think it's fine. </joey>
<connor> - I just cry every time Deco talks man. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm not a fan of Deco, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I'm not a fan of Deco either. </connor>
<connor> - I don't understand why people love Bucky girl so much. </connor>
<connor> I feel like, is there something like going wrong </connor>
<connor> in the childhood of Bucky girl </connor>
<connor> they're like really into him? </connor>
<joey> - I don't get it. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause To me it's like, he's just kind of an asshole. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I understand why people love Todoroki. </connor>
<connor> Like that is like set up to be like, yeah fan favorite. </connor>
<joey> Why Bucky goes people's favorites, I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the worst kid in school </joey>
<joey> and everyone's like, I love this kid. </joey>
<joey> - It's like people like talking about Bleach, </joey>
<connor> it's like back in Bleach days when people said </connor>
<connor> that Rangi was their favorite, I'm like yeah, </connor>
<joey> he's just an angry kid. </joey>
<connor> - He's a nice guy secretly </connor>
<connor> and I'm like have you ever met someone </connor>
<connor> who's an asshole in real life who is secretly nice. </connor>
<garnt> What the fucking was. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's weird to me right, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> the same kind of Twitter accounts </garnt>
<connor> and the same kind of fan base. </connor>
<connor> I see like defending Barker and having him </connor>
<connor> as their favorite character. </connor>
<connor> Is like the same kind of accounts that I see fucking </connor>
<connor> trying to counsel people for like ten-year-old tweets </connor>
<garnt> or something like that </garnt>
<garnt> and like trying to counsel people for that. </garnt>
<garnt> And here they are being like, oh I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> Barco go like was a bully </garnt>
<garnt> back in like middle school, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> But he's like turned around now, </garnt>
<garnt> he's good guy now. </garnt>
<connor> - His got friends to support him now. </connor>
<connor> - It's a lot easy to get behind fictional characters </connor>
<joey> turn around story. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Like those people were defending Vegeta </garnt>
<garnt> and he's talking, he fucking tried to blow up the planet </garnt>
<garnt> two walks go man, Jesus fucking Christ. </garnt>
<connor> - It's all right, he's a good guy now. </connor>
<connor> - But speaking of Vegeta, you gave Dragon Ball </connor>
<joey> and Dragon Ball Z both a nine out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<connor> - I thought Dragon Ball was shit. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's good. </connor>
<connor> - Oh a nine? </connor>
<connor> - You gonna look me in the eye and say it's, </connor>
<connor> the original Dragon Ball is a nine. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Okay that's good. </joey>
<joey> - Again this puts into perspective how long ago was that </joey>
<joey> I probably put that in. </joey>
<connor> - How many fucking Doraemon movies, </connor>
<connor> you gave a Doraemon movie a masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> You gave that a 10 and you're going to give. </connor>
<joey> - Wait which one, which story I want a movie. </joey>
<connor> - There's so goddamnit many, 16 you gave a 10. </connor>
<joey> What is special about 16? </joey>
<joey> - Okay that. </joey>
<connor> - Wasn't my Schindler's list of Doraemon movies </connor>
<connor> like what was it. </connor>
<joey> - That was the third Doraemon movie. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's 16. </joey>
<joey> - No, that the remake is 16. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the original is the third one, which I couldn't find </joey>
<connor> which doesn't exist on my Anime list for summer. </connor>
<connor> - All right, okay? </connor>
<connor> - But I gave that a 10 purely because I watched that movie. </connor>
<joey> That was one of the first Doraemon movies I ever watched </joey>
<joey> and I mean, if you guys don't agree with that. </joey>
<connor> - Don't give me that I'm the bad guy now, I get it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's good. </connor>
<connor> Like honestly, like sweat, like even now </connor>
<connor> I could probably rewatch that movie </connor>
<joey> and still find it enjoying, yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Doraemon holds a special place in my heart </joey>
<joey> as you can tell from the amount of Doraemon movies I put in. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I'm just like I didn't even know </garnt>
<joey> there were this many Doraemon movies. </joey>
<joey> - Dude they still making Doraemon movies. </joey>
<joey> - I'm surprised someone else has been watching Doraemon </joey>
<joey> like further along than when they were a kid watching on TV </joey>
<connor> 'cause that's the only exposure I've ever had to Doraemon. </connor>
<connor> I probably would never go out my way </connor>
<joey> to watch a fucking Doraemon movie. </joey>
<joey> - I completely understand, </joey>
<joey> if you did not grow up with Doraemon </joey>
<connor> I do not blame you for not watching a single Doraemon movie </connor>
<connor> or episode because that shit's hard to get into as an adult. </connor>
<joey> But if you grew up with it like I did, </joey>
<joey> then you can easily go back and watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't man to me it's kinda like, yeah as a grown up, </garnt>
<connor> grown ass adult I would just like </connor>
<connor> watch the fucking Teletubbies movie. </connor>
<joey> - Like Dora the Explorer while watching, </joey>
<connor> you know what I mean like yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - I guess it's like to like a niece or something </connor>
<connor> and then they'd be like, oh sure you watching you watching </connor>
<joey> and you're like, what the fuck is happening in these days? </joey>
<joey> This shit is wild bro, what is this? </joey>
<connor> - That's probably all my parents thought </connor>
<connor> when I was watching Doraemon, </connor>
<joey> it was like what the fuck is this boothing? </joey>
<joey> - I noticed you gave Fullmetal Alchemist </joey>
<connor> and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood both a seven. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> - Because it's like My Hero, </connor>
<connor> - No, come on, - it was good. </connor>
<joey> - just bring it, Brotherhood is not, </joey>
<joey> it's like at least an eight or a nine, come on. </joey>
<connor> - It was acceptable. </connor>
<garnt> - Acceptable? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it was acceptable. </joey>
<joey> - Hold on, hold on, hold on. </joey>
<garnt> Let me act angry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait you gave Fullmetal Alchemist a seven, </garnt>
<garnt> how dare you Joey, how dare you? </garnt>
<garnt> I am so fucking offended right now, </garnt>
<garnt> the audacity of this bitch man, the audacity. </garnt>
<garnt> - To the new viewers </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt has never watched Fullmetal Alchemist. </garnt>
<garnt> - That scene with Nina and the dog, </garnt>
<garnt> Mike did you know I do get the feels from that. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how that's the first thing you would think of. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not trying to say like, you need to give it like a 10. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm just saying, </joey>
<connor> I think it's like minimum eight, right? </connor>
<joey> - Okay here's the thing, with that one </joey>
<joey> I still stand by that to this day, </joey>
<garnt> because like a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> it was not the first Anime I watched. </garnt>
<connor> I watched that way after a kid. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah me too. </connor>
<connor> - Right? - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but it was probably one of the first </connor>
<connor> ones you watched right? </connor>
<connor> - For that first 20. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. - But does that count? </connor>
<joey> - This might've been in like the first 200 for me. </joey>
<connor> - But I don't know, I feel like out of all the Anime </connor>
<connor> I've watched except the ones with bad stories. </connor>
<joey> - Here's the thing, my experience with Fullmetal Alchemist </joey>
<joey> is basically guns next step, </joey>
<joey> which is because I hear about it so much. </joey>
<joey> I watched it out of obligation. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Garnt, hasn't got to the stage yet. </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't got to that stage yet. </joey>
<connor> Every time someone asks me a day gets added on. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. - I'm pretty sure I like. </joey>
<garnt> - And I was like that was like that as well </garnt>
<connor> and I'm just like, you know what, I've got time, </connor>
<joey> I'll fucking watch it, just because I hear about it. </joey>
<connor> - Some in the same like sitting </connor>
<joey> or like how did you? </joey>
<joey> - So I watched, so people are like, </joey>
<joey> okay you don't have to watch the first Fullmetal Alchemist, </joey>
<joey> just watch Brotherhood all right? </joey>
<connor> You hear that all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> But am like no, no I wanna see why </connor>
<connor> people saying that, all right? </connor>
<connor> So I watched the original and I was like, </connor>
<connor> okay this was adequate. </connor>
<joey> So, Brotherhood must be a lot better, </joey>
<joey> like a lot, lot, lot better, that's what I heard. </joey>
<joey> - I think it is. - Yeah, I think it is. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, yeah, it's better </joey>
<connor> but it's essentially the same thing. </connor>
<connor> - It deserves a point higher better. </connor>
<connor> - It's essentially the- </connor>
<joey> - No, it's not. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, the first Fullmetal Alchemist is like a low seven </joey>
<connor> and Brotherhood is like a high seven. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - It is, that's all it is to me. </connor>
<connor> - Also am critiquing your scores here, </connor>
<connor> knowing that some of these Anime I've also scored myself </connor>
<connor> but I have no idea what I said because I, </connor>
<connor> this is my list was done in 2014. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit seven years ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I see you've given Naruto a six compared to Bleach. </connor>
<joey> So would you say that you preferred Bleach over Naruto? </joey>
<joey> - That a fucking absolutely I prefer Bleach over Naruto. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I have never dropped a show more times </garnt>
<garnt> than I have Naruto. </garnt>
<connor> Like Naruto's been one of those shows where it's like, </connor>
<connor> I've watched it, I've read it and watched it </connor>
<connor> like close to the end. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But along that way, there were so many points </connor>
<connor> throughout "Naruto" where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> ah maybe it's not worth it. </connor>
<joey> - You didn't get that with "Bleach" at all? </joey>
<joey> - No I did get that bit with "Bleach" once, </joey>
<joey> during the "...." </joey>
<garnt> - That's it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, "Bleach" for me was just like a constant downhill, </garnt>
<garnt> "Naruto" just kinda went up and down. </garnt>
<garnt> I think back sometimes I think, </garnt>
<garnt> was "Naruto" a good show, would hold up to this day </garnt>
<garnt> and I still think best parts of "Naruto" </garnt>
<garnt> are still like a fucking amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - No, again and that's why I probably gave it a six, right? </joey>
<joey> It's because like, I completely understand why </joey>
<joey> it is one of the most beloved Anime out there today. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so like I saw parts of that, but again this was, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't grow up with "Naruto" like a lot of people did, </garnt>
<garnt> like this was again another show that I kind of just. </garnt>
<garnt> - This was just another show in for you, right? </garnt>
<joey> - This is just another show in for me. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so again I'm not saying that "Naruto" is bad. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'd just like to point that out. </joey>
<joey> It's not bad, but it's not a 10 out of 10 for me. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay I'm trying to see what else. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like I'm getting interrogated. </joey>
<garnt> - This is an interrogation. </garnt>
<joey> - It's an interrogation, </joey>
<joey> it's like we've been in interrogation. </joey>
<joey> - This is like True-Crime Weaver edition. </joey>
<joey> So yes. </joey>
<joey> - Notice his hand move, his hands are off the table </joey>
<joey> saying that he is quite nervous. </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry we're not like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So what is the lowest one that you've rated on here? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to see. </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably only one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm trying to see. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, it's I think it's "Pupa." </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, "Pupa." </joey>
<joey> I gave "Pupa" I think I get "Boku na" and "Pupa" one. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, one of the biggest that surprised me </garnt>
<garnt> going through your list is okay, be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you completed every Anime you've scored on here? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<connor> - No way. </connor>
<connor> - No fucking way. </connor>
<connor> - This is so fucking many. </connor>
<joey> - Except for maybe "Sazae-san." </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - You completed "Sazae-san," completed it. </connor>
<connor> - I did complete "Sazae-san" </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's still going after 50 years. </connor>
<connor> But other than "Sazae-san" </connor>
<joey> I honestly think I have finished everything. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like I remember one of, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause when are we gonna get to my list. </garnt>
<garnt> One of the reasons why my list seems like a lot emptier </garnt>
<garnt> is because if I don't complete a show, </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't bother putting it in my list. </garnt>
<joey> - Right? - And. </joey>
<joey> - Well that's why I have like the on-hold section as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh he got the fucking. </joey>
<garnt> When did you stop updating this man? </garnt>
<connor> You really were the anime man before this. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck, you watch so much anime. </connor>
<connor> - You've also rated "Tokyo Ghoul" season one, </connor>
<connor> the same as season two. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - Come on, they're no way near the same. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair I would rate, </connor>
<connor> what did I give season one and two? </connor>
<connor> - What do you think you gave season one or two? </connor>
<connor> - I think I gave season one and two like a seven, maybe? </connor>
<connor> - You did. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I would give season two maybe like a four. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I was gonna say it's like </connor>
<connor> not even from the mostly the same. </connor>
<connor> - I would give it like a four, I don't know </connor>
<connor> what I was on about. </connor>
<connor> I'll give it like a four. </connor>
<connor> - "Trigun" a seven, you stand by that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, there were a lot of parts about "Trigun" </connor>
<connor> I really enjoyed, but I think the problem with "Trigun" </connor>
<joey> is that I was a little too over hyped, when I came into it. </joey>
<joey> - Right? - Because </joey>
<joey> I heard so many people being like, </joey>
<joey> yoo "Trigun" is like same levels as like "Boku no" </joey>
<connor> or "Cowboy Bebop" or something. </connor>
<connor> It's like up there with the big, like classic leagues. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, all right I'll get into it. </connor>
<connor> And I watched it and again it was good </connor>
<connor> but not to give spoilers, but the last quarter of "Trigun," </connor>
<joey> I was like what the fuck is going on. </joey>
<joey> - Really, really? - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought the last quarter of "Trigun" was fucking great. </garnt>
<connor> - It was great. </connor>
<connor> - I enjoyed it, but I was like, what the fuck is going on? </connor>
<garnt> I mean its been a long time since I watched it. </garnt>
<joey> - I would say this </joey>
<joey> I haven't watched it in literally decades now I think. </joey>
<joey> - It's been a long time since I watched "Trigun." </joey>
<joey> - "Zetsuen no Tempest" as well, you gave that a seven. </joey>
<joey> That is that like, if there was a benchmark </joey>
<connor> for seven out of 10 shows, it would be "Zetsuen no Tempest." </connor>
<garnt> - I actually, I can't remember what I rate on that one. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, isn't it based on the Shakespeare. </connor>
<connor> - It's based on Shakespeare. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, was it basically, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I think it was on his diary originally. </joey>
<joey> - Very very loosely inspired off a Shakespeare store. </joey>
<connor> I don't remember which one it was, </connor>
<connor> but I gave a points because at the time </connor>
<joey> it was quite creative and new. </joey>
<garnt> - I've really liked it, like it's one of, </garnt>
<garnt> I put "Zetsuen no Tempest" in the same category </garnt>
<connor> as I do "Darker than Black," right? </connor>
<connor> - I love "Darker than Black". </connor>
<connor> - When I watched it was kinda like, when I think back, </connor>
<connor> I was like it seems average in my memory, </connor>
<garnt> but for some reason it sticks with me </garnt>
<garnt> and I always think back to this show. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, what did you see? </connor>
<garnt> - What did you see? </garnt>
<garnt> No, I did finish my point. </garnt>
<connor> - "Yuri on Ice" a three. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Were you just trying like piss off Twitter that day. </connor>
<connor> - No I just genuinely I just thought it was boring. </connor>
<connor> - No it's not a three. </connor>
<joey> - I just thought it was fucking boring, I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, come on. </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna get into this again man, </joey>
<joey> like at the time I got so much shit for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I remember did you make an apology video? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> No, because I said that I didn't like "Yuri on Ice." </joey>
<joey> - He made an apology video. </joey>
<joey> - It's because at the time like "Yuri on Ice" </joey>
<joey> was like the hottest thing right back </joey>
<joey> like I don't remember when it was like 2016, </joey>
<joey> 2017 something like that. </joey>
<connor> And all I said in the video was, </connor>
<connor> I don't think "Yuri on Ice" was. </connor>
<connor> Oh no, I said something along the lines of a 99% of people </connor>
<connor> watch "Yuri on Ice for the "Yaoi Elements." </connor>
<connor> 1% watched it for the actual sport element. </connor>
<connor> And so many "Yuri on Ice" stands </connor>
<connor> called me homosexual because of oh sorry, </connor>
<connor> not homosexual they called me a homophobic, yeah. </connor>
<joey> They call me, </joey>
<connor> - Homophobic - homophobic because of it. </connor>
<connor> First of all, hey I'm not homophobic. </connor>
<connor> But you also gave "Free!" a five Joey, </connor>
<connor> so man this is looking so bad for it. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, wow. </connor>
<connor> - Are you harmed? </connor>
<joey> - Because "Free!" I gave a higher score than "Yuri on Ice," </joey>
<joey> again because Koto Animation, </joey>
<joey> animated that way better than they did "Yuri on Ice," so? </joey>
<connor> - I don't really think there's any world </connor>
<connor> like any review that you could warrant </connor>
<connor> that "Yuri on Ice" just below a five. </connor>
<connor> Like it was a really good story, </connor>
<connor> it was a minimum five, I think. </connor>
<joey> What would you give it? - What would you give it? </joey>
<garnt> - I would give it a six, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - But it like you, could you reasonably put it below a five, </connor>
<connor> Like at a four? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, if it's not your thing, </garnt>
<connor> because the thing about it- </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't my thing. </connor>
<connor> - The thing about "Yuri on Ice" is that </connor>
<connor> they introduce way too many characters </connor>
<garnt> and they just like kind of didn't focus on any of them. </garnt>
<joey> - Also I'm sorry, I couldn't stand </joey>
<joey> the main fucking character, I hated him. </joey>
<joey> - I loved the guy who just came while he's dancing, </joey>
<joey> that guy was funny as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, again there was some funny parts of it. </joey>
<connor> There's a reason why I didn't give it a one, right? </connor>
<connor> Like there was some parts about it that I enjoy. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, there's a reason I didn't give it a one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the reason I didn't give it a one, </connor>
<connor> there was some parts about it </connor>
<connor> but like was it a fucking like slug </connor>
<connor> to watch all of it, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, it was good. </connor>
<connor> - I was like every episode pass I was like </connor>
<joey> I could be watching something else right now. </joey>
<connor> - First I can actually beat you up </connor>
<connor> for saying something like that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah for sure, I thought you really liked it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah she likes it and she's like, </joey>
<joey> well that's your opinion. </joey>
<garnt> - All right, here's here's something I noticed, "Kissxsis." </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Masterpiece. </joey>
<joey> - Seven out of ten. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So do you wanna explain why it's not </garnt>
<garnt> either like a one or ten. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm guessing it's not a one, 'cause he got, </connor>
<joey> he came to realization with his friend. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> No if I put that in my list like after the first time </joey>
<garnt> I watched it with my friend </garnt>
<garnt> I would have given it a ten, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - But then </garnt>
<garnt> I rewatched it, 'cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was drunk to shit when I watched it for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me rewatch it just to double check. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, it's good, not a ten though. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Somebody's anime like </connor>

<garnt> - So What I love about AFK arena, </garnt>
<garnt> as someone who plays a lot of gadget games </garnt>
<garnt> is that there are some games </garnt>
<garnt> where you probably have to focus when you're grinding </garnt>
<garnt> but thankfully AFK Arena allows you to skip all that. </garnt>
<connor> - AFK Arena has collaborated with multiple properties before </connor>

<garnt> JL pages all the time. </garnt>

<garnt> for sponsoring this episode, back to the video. </garnt>
<garnt> What I will say about this going through this </garnt>
<garnt> is that you've finished a lot of shows </garnt>
<garnt> that I've watched like a few episodes off </garnt>
<garnt> and they're not gonna be on my list. </garnt>
<garnt> But you've like just straight up </garnt>
<garnt> finished them and scored them. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't trust someone who would get through </connor>
<garnt> some of these shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's something wrong, </connor>
<joey> someone's gone wrong in the head, </joey>
<joey> just to make you keep watching. </joey>
<joey> - You have to understand like back in like 2016, 2015 </joey>
<joey> this is all I fucking did. </joey>
<garnt> - Like no fucking wonder you burnt out an anime </garnt>
<garnt> when you're like, when you've actually finishing </garnt>
<garnt> most of these shows. </garnt>
<connor> - You know in the movie "Old Boy," </connor>
<connor> when that guy's trapped in that room for like 10 years? </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm pretty sure he watched less anime in this. </connor>
<connor> Like how do you get through this guy. </connor>
<connor> - Okay yes, I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<joey> Like I'm looking through my list right now </joey>
<connor> and like I comment to my past self for the fact that </connor>
<joey> I finished "Infinite Straddle" season two. </joey>
<garnt> - It wasn't the that you've finished season one, </garnt>
<garnt> you went through season two, like my fucking God. </garnt>
<connor> - You swear that you didn't lie on any of these. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, legit, other than "Sosaye san" </joey>
<connor> 100% have finished all of these. </connor>
<connor> - All right, we'll find out. </connor>
<connor> - And that is like, I swear on my own grave. </connor>
<joey> - I did like a little fucking reaction that said bullshit </joey>
<joey> but I'll say fine. </joey>
<joey> - No I swear I finished all. </joey>
<joey> - All right, I mean overall your list </joey>
<connor> is like exactly what I'd expected. </connor>
<connor> You give the shows that are universally accepted to be good, </connor>
<connor> good ratings and the universally to be bad, bad ratings. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean I have good taste, what can I say? </connor>
<connor> - You got the public tastes I say. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think I have the public taste. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty in line. </connor>
<connor> - I gave "Yuri on Ice" a three, </connor>
<connor> that's far from public taste. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you can't just do one and be like one will take. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I won't notice, you gave "Charlotte" a seven </garnt>
<joey> and that's a pretty high score for what I think is. </joey>
<joey> Change my eight is like worst piece of work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would give that realistically like a five or four. </joey>
<connor> - Would you say if the director is esteemed </connor>
<connor> or like the show makers are esteemed, </connor>
<connor> you're more likely to pick up a fairer review. </connor>
<joey> - I think if I'm a fan of like the creator </joey>
<joey> or like the studio or like someone in the production team </joey>
<joey> then I'm more willing to give it </joey>
<joey> like, say like "Charlotte," right? </joey>
<joey> Like that's a Mitojune production </joey>
<joey> and like I love everything Mitojune makes, </joey>
<joey> but so I gave it a seven. </joey>
<joey> But realistically thinking back on "Charlotte" now, </joey>
<joey> realistically I give it like a four or five. </joey>
<connor> - See this is why I'm the perfect critic </connor>
<connor> because I just don't know anything. </connor>
<joey> - So I go into the show and I'm like </joey>
<joey> I don't even know what the fuck the studio made this, </joey>
<connor> like let's just watch. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - So it's like Bones, who's Bones? </connor>
<garnt> - What is Bones. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gave it "Another" nine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> What, what? </joey>
<connor> - No you're on stand by that, right? </connor>
<connor> No come on. </connor>
<connor> - I'd still give it like a night, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I really enjoyed it, I don't care what anyone says, </connor>
<garnt> I really enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> But then again, I'm a fucking horror anime simp so.. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes it's like an anagram fry of shit taste, </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. - that's what I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because there is no good horror anime. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Have you watched Mononoke? </connor>
<connor> - That's not horror. </connor>
<garnt> - I rest my case. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a horror the same way </garnt>
<garnt> that like fucking "Monster" is a horror, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes "Monster" is a horror. </garnt>
<connor> - That's horror the same way </connor>
<connor> that fucking "Grave of Fireflies" is a horror, </connor>
<connor> like it's different kind of vibe bro. </connor>
<connor> - What are you talking about? </connor>
<joey> - You know what I mean it's not like it's scary, scary. </joey>
<connor> It's kind of like the thing... </connor>
<joey> - I don't know man I was pretty fucking on edge </joey>
<joey> when I watched "Mononoke." </joey>
<garnt> - Yes it's unnerving, but it's not like it's definitely </garnt>
<joey> not in the same kind of genre as "Another" </joey>
<joey> which is just final destination, the anime adaptation </joey>
<garnt> but even camp here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I liked the campiness of it, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I really enjoyed it. </garnt>
<garnt> I love my fucking like- </garnt>
<connor> - Your honor I rest my case. </connor>
<joey> - To me "Another" was like a really good beat great horror. </joey>
<garnt> - Are you trying to defend the fucking umbrella scene? </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you know a burst out laughing </garnt>
<garnt> when that happens man? </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe because I watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> - The entire last episode. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just a Mr. Bean episode at a time </connor>
<garnt> let's cut the shit off. </garnt>
<garnt> - The entire last two episodes was just a slapstick comedy. </garnt>
<garnt> I won't put some Benny Hill music on that. </garnt>
<joey> - Again I really love the campiness of it, I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - All right, fuck that shit. </connor>
<connor> - I completely get why people hate "Another." </connor>
<connor> I just thought it was really like tongue in cheek, </connor>
<connor> like camping. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - Give me the box, let me pull up the next one. </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry it will be funny if I pull out myself. </joey>
<joey> All right. </joey>
<connor> - The next list we're gonna be discussing. </connor>
<connor> - Is. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh mine, wow I guess we're just going in the order now. </joey>
<garnt> - Who fucking needed this anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember when I've last updated this, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I stopped updating my mail- </connor>
<connor> - I think we just go with the most recent. </connor>
<connor> And I moved over to "Kitsu. </connor>
<connor> So it depends if "Kitsu" is also updating this. </connor>
<connor> But this is going to be my teenage tastes I'm guessing. </connor>
<garnt> - Teenage taste. </garnt>
<joey> I can tell this is your teenage taste </joey>
<joey> because like I don't know, in the past episode </joey>
<joey> you talked so much shit about "Akira" </joey>
<joey> and yet you've given it an eight out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - What would you give it now? </connor>
<connor> - I would give it like a six. </connor>
<connor> - A six okay, well you are still updating. </connor>
<connor> - What do you think you gave "Akame ga Kill?" </connor>
<connor> Just curious. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it really low? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no I'm just curious. </joey>
<joey> - What di you give it? - A three or something? </joey>
<connor> - What would you rate it today, </connor>
<connor> if I asked you to rate "Akame ga Kill." </connor>
<connor> - Like two, three. </connor>
<garnt> - Really it's not that bad. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I would also give it the same. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty shit. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, you gave it a four. </joey>
<joey> - Okay good, teenage me a taste. </joey>
<garnt> I'd say "Akame ga Kill" was one of those shows </garnt>
<garnt> where I thought it was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> And then all the comments were the Manga's better, </garnt>
<garnt> the Manga's better, trust me guys, the Manga's better. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was one of those few times </garnt>
<garnt> why called them on their bluff, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I call it the Manga readers on their bluff </garnt>
<garnt> and I read the Manga up to the end, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, this is just the same shit </garnt>
<garnt> just elongates, you know what I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was complaining about the anime </garnt>
<garnt> only ending of "Akame ga Kill." </garnt>
<garnt> But "the Manga" is like equally as edgy </garnt>
<garnt> but it just elongates. </garnt>
<garnt> It just has a different ending </garnt>
<garnt> and it's equally as bad in my opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> - You also rated "Aldnoah Zero." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you gave it a six. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you gave that season one a six and season two a six </joey>
<garnt> but season two come on is infinitely worse than season one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know what I was thinking. </garnt>
<connor> - "Aldnoah Zero season one" is actually like pretty decent, </connor>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah you still good of stuff about "Aldnoah Zero." </joey>
<garnt> - "Aldnoah Zero season one" </garnt>
<connor> I don't remember why I gave it. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you maybe finished both of them at the same time. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you finished season two, </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe. </garnt>
<connor> - and was like am pissed off with this shit. </connor>
<connor> - Because I remember "Aldnoah season one" </connor>
<garnt> being pretty interesting and then it was like, </garnt>
<connor> it was great </connor>
<garnt> and then the cliffhanger season ending happened </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just like, holy shit this is super interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> And then season two, just kinda pissed on everything </garnt>
<connor> that season one set up. </connor>
<garnt> - And then the left of the how became like- </garnt>
<connor> - I know this is like teenage gauntlets </connor>
<joey> because you gave "Baka to Test to" an eight. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I still stand by that, it is- </garnt>
<joey> - But you also gave season two an eight as well. </joey>
<joey> Season two was not as good as season one. </joey>
<connor> - I've never watched Baka, what is "Baka to Test to" about? </connor>
<joey> - "Baka to Test to" it's just like, it's like a comedy </joey>
<joey> like kind of trashy, like romance, itchy- </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - To be honest I like it so, I thought it's really nice. </connor>
<connor> - It was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - The human ambassador for domestic girlfriend </connor>
<garnt> that's right up his phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like one of the first comedy anime </garnt>
<connor> that actually made me laugh and I didn't think was generic. </connor>
<garnt> And now that I look back, I think yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> it was probably pretty generic, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> Like I look at the art style and I'm just like </connor>
<connor> this is premium, mid 2000s anime. </connor>
<connor> It is nothing interesting to say about this at all. </connor>
<connor> - You gave "Baccano!" a 10 as well, I like that. </connor>
<joey> - Yep. </joey>
<connor> - I think we all gave "Baccano!" a 10 on my list. </connor>
<joey> - If I didn't give it a 10 on my list </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what that's. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I'm curious to see </garnt>
<garnt> what your three by threes are </garnt>
<garnt> because that's where like </garnt>
<garnt> the real personality test comes in. </garnt>
<connor> - Hold on, I got to ask that. </connor>
<connor> Marilyn, do we have beers? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no Nebo, gave me some beers. </garnt>
<connor> - We have beers, okay I'm just checking to make sure. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it will be fine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, no we also have. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, we've got the Pikara juice. </connor>
<connor> - We also have Pikara umesu. </connor>
<joey> - You like that right Connor, you like that? </joey>
<joey> - Pikara juice. </joey>
<connor> We're gonna be smashing some of this, right Connor? </connor>
<joey> - Like fuck the beers. </joey>
<garnt> - No don't ever get, he doesn't even deserve </garnt>
<connor> Pikara juice give it to me. </connor>
<connor> - I'll rather have a beer than this. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't want some of Pikara's goodness. </garnt>
<connor> - You don't want Pikara juice too? </connor>
<connor> - So I noticed as well you also gave "Btoom" an eight. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But Joey gave "Btoom" a six. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I actually would side more with Garnt on this one, </joey>
<connor> even though it did end kinda shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah wasn't the ending absolute shit? </joey>
<connor> - But the show was really fun </connor>
<garnt> and the opening was a banger bro. </garnt>
<joey> - Opening fucking 10 out of 10. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude fucking 10 out of 10 opening, but soon the show, </garnt>
<garnt> that was just pure fun. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know like it is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah dude it was good. </garnt>
<joey> - It was fucking great. </joey>
<joey> It was one of the few death games </joey>
<joey> that didn't feel like it was one, a "Battle Royale" rip-off. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - 'Cause the problem </joey>
<joey> with every death game anime </joey>
<joey> is that it feels like a "Virgin Battle Royale," </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> "Battle Royale" did it </joey>
<joey> and like why would I want to watch anything else? </joey>
<joey> "Btoom" it was just like it didn't try to pretend </joey>
<joey> it wasn't a "Battle Royale" rip-off, </joey>
<joey> but it just like- </joey>
<joey> - I really like "Btoom". </joey>
<garnt> - It went off that and it just was a hell a lot of fun. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know I think I gave it a lower score. </joey>
<joey> I think when I first finished it, </joey>
<joey> I also gave it maybe like a seven or an eight, </joey>
<joey> but then I read the Manga and I was like, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> that wasn't that great. </joey>
<connor> - I guess for some reason, </connor>
<connor> like "Btoom" has always been one of those shows, </connor>
<connor> like stuck with me, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Like I've always just wanted the season two. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I still like that. </connor>
<connor> - I still think about it, I still think about why </connor>
<garnt> it didn't have a season two. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I know Sydney read the Manga. </garnt>
<joey> She said the Manga is also pretty good as it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah the Manga is way better. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, really good. </connor>
<connor> - Okay you gave "Eromanga-sensei" 10 so it did to me. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> But you are my brother because you gave "Gankutsuou" a 10, </connor>
<connor> which I also agree. - Yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - You gave "Code Geass" season one a 10 </connor>
<garnt> and "Code Geass" season two an eight. </garnt>
<garnt> What are your thoughts on that? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - What are your thoughts on that, I'm interested. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, So I remember giving it a 10. </connor>
<connor> Okay, So thinking about "Code Geass" right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I gave it a 10, the first time I watched it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I thought it was like a fucking masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> It was perfect, it was everything. </connor>
<connor> I recently, not recently, </connor>
<connor> like I rewatched "Code Geass" with Sydney </connor>
<garnt> and there was a lot of flaws in season one </garnt>
<garnt> that I guess I just kind of ignored as a kid or just like, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of forgot about. </garnt>
<garnt> Like okay, like I remember rewatching it and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> why is there an episode dedicated to chasing a cat, </garnt>
<garnt> and how did I just blank this from my memory? </garnt>
<connor> - That episode was very good. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I remember first watching "Code Geass", </garnt>
<garnt> it was like easy 10 out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like the greatest anime can become. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I just remembered </garnt>
<garnt> the good points of "Code Geass", </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there was a lot of like plot holes and everything, </garnt>
<garnt> like it's how, can we spoil "Code Geass"? </garnt>
<connor> - Everything I think it's we've got spoil "Code Geass", </connor>
<garnt> I know it's universally it's like. </garnt>
<connor> - Skip to this timestamp below 'cause "Code Geass" </connor>
<connor> if you haven't watched "Code Geass" and you want to watch it </connor>
<connor> it's one of my most spoilerble shows out there. </connor>
<connor> But I remember rewatching it and I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> man they've really had to like twist the ploy </garnt>
<garnt> in order to make Nina or what was not Nina, Euphemia, </garnt>
<garnt> just fucking massacre everyone, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember watching it and I'm just thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> man the plots kind of over now everything's sorted </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just the most. </garnt>
<connor> - Racism is over. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone go home. </connor>
<garnt> - It was just the most roundabout way </garnt>
<garnt> of like okay guys we gonna make the plot continue. </garnt>
<garnt> How can we make the plot continue? </garnt>
<garnt> And it was literally a scene where the the Lelus, </garnt>
<joey> goes "Hahaha wouldn't it be funny </joey>
<joey> "if I told you to kill the Japanese haha psychs" </joey>
<joey> and then it wasn't psycs. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, that did happen, right? </joey>
<joey> - And like I just remembered thinking, </joey>
<connor> well, I remember thinking as a kid </connor>
<connor> that was a huge plot twist </connor>
<connor> and now watching it as an adult, I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> - This is stupid. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just, Oh this kind of doesn't make sense. </joey>
<connor> This is kind of pretty cheap right there. </connor>
<connor> This is pretty cheap writing. </connor>
<connor> So yeah like I would give </connor>
<garnt> "Code Geass" season one maybe an eight. </garnt>
<connor> - I think because of the high of "Code Geass" was so good. </connor>
<joey> They like you almost forgive it. </joey>
<connor> - The highs are very high. </connor>
<connor> - So like you forgive it for a lot of the shit it does. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then season two was like, that was, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what it is about season two, </connor>
<connor> that was like a car crash that somehow. </connor>
<garnt> - Roller was the season. </garnt>
<connor> - Season two was a car crash </connor>
<garnt> that somehow perfectly parallel parked. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it was absolute disaster </garnt>
<garnt> and somehow it like just landed its ending perfectly. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember rewatching "Code Geass" two, </garnt>
<joey> after season one. </joey>
<joey> And going on the problems I had with season one, </joey>
<joey> season two just took all the like </joey>
<joey> small problems of season one </joey>
<joey> and just extrapolate it to them. </joey>
<joey> It's like, let's take every stupid plot twist in season one </joey>
<joey> and just make it 10 times bigger. </joey>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think the exact moment that lost me in season two </garnt>
<garnt> was like, it was I am Iam spoker scene, but just with Lelus. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I know I just thought this is not clever anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, true. - It's just stupid. </joey>
<joey> And everything up to that, </joey>
<connor> to like the final few episodes was fucking dumb but the. </connor>
<connor> - They stick the landing man. </connor>
<connor> - But like the ending is still I think </connor>
<connor> the best ending ever in anime. </connor>
<connor> - Its obviously yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would think. </connor>
<connor> - I'd agree with that. </connor>
<connor> - I would think it's probably the best of the top of my head </connor>
<garnt> the best ending anime is produced so far so God knows. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that an unpopular opinion? </joey>
<garnt> - God knows. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay hold on a second, I'd like to point out, </joey>
<joey> for someone who says he doesn't like Ghibli Films, </joey>
<joey> you gave "Mononoke Hime" a 10. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Will you stick by that, because if you do, </joey>
<joey> then I can high-five you but if not, the backhand is coming. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, what did they give "Spirited Away?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me see. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I think thinking back "Mononoke" is one of mine. </garnt>
<joey> - You gave "Spirited Away" a nine. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay then. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Con, I really had to think about that, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't like Ghibli Films </joey>
<joey> but I think "Manonoke" and "Sirits Away" </joey>
<garnt> are some of the few where I stick by them. </garnt>
<joey> - It's good. </joey>
<garnt> - I stick by them. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also love how you gave "Gyo" a six, </garnt>
<joey> that's pretty fucking high if you ask me. </joey>
<joey> - I thought it was good. </joey>
<garnt> - I just, have you read the Manga? </garnt>
<connor> - I have read the Manga. </connor>
<connor> - How did you give it a six? </connor>
<connor> - I watched it. </connor>
<connor> - I think I would give it a three. </connor>
<connor> - Wait what is "Gyo?" - "Gyo, is a Jinjinto. </connor>
<joey> - "Gyo" is a Jinjinto Manga that's. </joey>
<garnt> - And they made a movie about it like five years ago </garnt>
<joey> and it is horrendous. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was a fun movie, </garnt>
<joey> I had a fun time watching quickly. </joey>
<joey> - I was so sad watching it. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the thing about "Gyo" is that I watched the anime </joey>
<joey> not knowing any background about it, </joey>
<joey> not knowing it was Jin Jinto. </joey>
<garnt> I thought it was just like a campy B movie horror movie, </garnt>
<garnt> which it is. - Which it is. </garnt>
<joey> - But I remember because I went into that </joey>
<joey> thinking it was gonna be absolute trash. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I watched it and despite it actually being trashy </joey>
<joey> and it was trash, it gave me the same kind of enjoyment </joey>
<joey> as you do watching a shitty B movie horror. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it wasn't like it was shitty animation, </joey>
<joey> 'cause "Gyo" the movie was animated by Ufotable </joey>
<garnt> and man they, you could see some effort </garnt>
<garnt> being put into this man. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but you also got to admit that like the 3D, </joey>
<joey> some of the 3D elements, I was just like, God this is ugly </joey>
<joey> but is that a good thing, because it's a horror </joey>
<connor> like I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair in 2012 it wasn't, they weren't very good. </connor>
<garnt> - It was compared to some of the 3D that came out in 2012, </garnt>
<connor> compared to like "Studio Gonzo Gantz 3D," </connor>
<connor> which just makes me wanna vomit when I think about it. </connor>
<connor> - Don't remind me of that. </connor>
<connor> - Like it was good looking 3D. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah true, true. </connor>
<garnt> - Like Ufotable put some effort into that </garnt>
<garnt> and I respect them for doing that. </garnt>
<connor> - You watched "Halo Legends", </connor>
<connor> but think you're the only person on my anime to watch that. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't even know that was an anime by Halo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - RIP to the other 19,000 people who have rated this show, </connor>
<connor> for some reason. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I've watched, that was my stint </garnt>
<garnt> when I watched that and the "Mass Effect" anime as well. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you think you gave "Halo Legends"? </connor>
<garnt> Did I say that, did I say what you gave it? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think so, no I didn't. </connor>
<connor> - You gave it a four, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Okay I stick by that 'cause I'm on- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, hold on a second, </garnt>
<joey> you gave "Re:Zero" season one, a six. </joey>
<joey> - Did I actually. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<connor> - What's that about? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Why the six? </connor>
<joey> - What would you say? </joey>
<joey> - What would you give it? </joey>
<joey> - I think I gave it a seven or an eight. </joey>
<joey> - I gave it an eight probably. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I don't know why I gave it a six. </joey>
<joey> I think it was because everyone was hyping it up </joey>
<joey> and I was- </joey>
<joey> - I wanna be different. </joey>
<joey> - I was kind of underwhelmed by it. </joey>
<joey> Now 'cause I have rewatched "Re:Zero" </joey>
<joey> in preparation of season two. </joey>
<joey> I would give it a seven, </joey>
<joey> but I remember coming out of "Re:Zero" </joey>
<connor> just feeling empty, right? </connor>
<connor> And it just no 'cause it kind of like </connor>
<connor> I had a good time watching it </connor>
<connor> and it was just a girl reaction of it was a good time </connor>
<connor> and I'm probably gonna forget this show in a few years </connor>
<connor> and I didn't end up getting it, so I. </connor>
<joey> - You also gave "Space Dandy" a six as well. </joey>
<joey> - I really liked "Space Dandy" </joey>
<joey> - I really liked it too. </joey>
<joey> - If you look at it like a Saturday morning cartoon, </joey>
<connor> it's pretty fun. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - "Space Dandy" it was very hit for miss for me. </garnt>
<joey> - You gave "Sololine and Sololine two" also with six. </joey>
<joey> So in Garnt opinion, "Space Dandy" </joey>
<joey> and SAO are on the same level. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly? </joey>
<connor> - On top of that, he also gave "Guilty Crown" a five. </connor>
<joey> So would you say that SAO is better than- </joey>
<joey> - SAO is better than "Guilty Crown". </joey>
<joey> - Would you say that SAO is better than "Guilty Crown?" </joey>
<connor> - No, I wouldn't. </connor>
<connor> - You were a little harsh on "Guilty Crown". </connor>
<connor> - I was a little harsh on "Guilty Crown". </connor>
<connor> "Guilty Crown" I would give a higher score, </connor>
<connor> but going to "SAO" versus "Space Dandy" </connor>
<connor> I mean I've rate this based on my pure enjoyment </connor>
<connor> and "Space Dandy" was either like nine on enjoyment </connor>
<connor> or a two depending on the episode, </connor>
<connor> which is probably why I rated it as six. </connor>
<connor> There were some killer episodes </connor>
<connor> and then there was some episodes </connor>
<connor> that were just a fucking drag </connor>
<connor> where 'Sword Art Online" was just like a constant. </connor>
<joey> - It was a plateau. </joey>
<joey> - It was just a constant six I watched this I'm trash, </joey>
<connor> I enjoy this whatever move on, you know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> - Would you care to explain this for me, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - "JoJo" seven, what's up with that, come on. </connor>
<joey> - Was that power one? </joey>
<joey> - Is it the original one? </joey>
<joey> - The original one he gave a six, which you also watched. </joey>
<joey> - The OVA. - The OVA,yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You haven't rated any other "JoJo's" ever won. </connor>
<connor> So I'm gonna say is the "JoJo's" series as a whole Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - I rated part one, well it is a seven. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a seven. </garnt>
<connor> - I just wanted to get angry for something. </connor>
<connor> I just wanted to get riled up a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - You also gave a "Totoro" an eight. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay that's wrong. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck was I thinking, </connor>
<garnt> was I trying to look like I had good taste, oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> no it's a fucking four in my opinion. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you think you gave "Kuroko's Basket"? </connor>
<connor> - Eight? </connor>
<connor> - You did yeah, I'm surprised. </connor>
<connor> I honestly thought you would bash "Kuroko" more. </connor>
<connor> - I loved "Kuroko" yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think for some reason I think you hated. </garnt>
<connor> I love "Kuroko". </connor>
<garnt> - NO, I love "Kuroko" and "Kuroko" was a sports anime </garnt>
<garnt> that got me back into sports anime. </garnt>
<garnt> So no I. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You watched all of "Mekaku City Actors?" </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I noticed that, he gave it a four, </joey>
<joey> which I would also agree with that. </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck how did you sit through all that. </connor>
<garnt> - It was just, I don't know I liked the aesthetic </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know why it was just, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I was just high that day and I just- </garnt>
<joey> - I was so disappointed with that 'cause I loved the novels. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because. - And I just completely </garnt>
<joey> fucking destroyed it. </joey>
<connor> - It was me after watching "Boku no a Gantry" </connor>
<connor> and go through the shaft type. </connor>
<connor> - Right, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, this is gonna get better. </connor>
<garnt> This is by studio shaft. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I legitimately thought that Mekaku City Actors </garnt>
<connor> was like a gay porn novel because of the internet, </connor>
<connor> because all you ever see about Mekaku City Actors online </connor>
<connor> is gay stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is, yeah </connor>
<joey> There's a large Fujoshi fan base for Mekaku city. </joey>
<garnt> - I brought the op of Mekaku City Actors </garnt>
<connor> is a fucking banger, I still listen to that shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's awesome. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's great. </connor>
<connor> - All the time. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you think you gave "Monster?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Did I give it a 10? </garnt>
<connor> - You did. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, good. </connor>
<connor> - I honestly. </connor>
<connor> - I would agree. </connor>
<connor> - I'll stand by that. </connor>
<connor> - I love monster. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's one of the animes that like, I dropped </connor>
<connor> and then came back to. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that I was so glad that I picked back up </connor>
<connor> because, obviously it's really fucking slow in the start. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is really slow, but I feel like "Monster" is a rarity </garnt>
<garnt> of an anime, where it's an Anime that has an amazing Manga </garnt>
<garnt> that could have easily be sliced up </garnt>
<garnt> and have a shirty adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But "Monster" is one of the few epic </garnt>
<garnt> like masterpiece Manga, that go to masterpiece adaptation. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, like, thank God </joey>
<joey> it got 70 something episodes that they did. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Could you imagine if "Monster" was a 24 episodes. </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly, that's why I'm scared if 20th Century </joey>
<garnt> gets adapted man 'cause that's like Monster but even longer </garnt>
<garnt> and even more. </garnt>
<joey> - Also, I find it hilarious, Ikkitousen Aturo. </joey>
<joey> (both laughs) </joey>
<joey> - What's Ikkitousen? </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna explain what Ikkitousen is? </joey>
<garnt> - Ikkitousen is like, imagine like the show </garnt>
<connor> the above the shows, like high school for the dead. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - It is a battle fun service show </connor>
<garnt> and back in the day, this was the most degenerates kind </garnt>
<garnt> of fan service ETD action show you could, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like so many, it's like we are boomers, </joey>
<garnt> fucking love Ikkitousen. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And it goes just like, nope. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Fuck your memories, it's shit. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I look back now, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I'd rate a higher, I don't know, it's a- </garnt>
<joey> - I would rate it like maybe a four purely </joey>
<joey> because it's just so attractive. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like back in the day, this was all we had. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nowadays there's so much trash anime </garnt>
<garnt> and trash kind of found surface-y shows </garnt>
<garnt> but back in the day, it was kinda like Ikkitousen </garnt>
<connor> and then nothing else. </connor>
<garnt> - Nothing really else, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Nothing really else </connor>
<connor> - There was nothing like Ikkitousen. </connor>
<connor> - You gave that "Zetsuen no Tempest" a seven as well. </connor>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Actually. </connor>
<connor> I'm thinking back, </connor>
<connor> I'd probably give it an eight now, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You gave- </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I need to watch it again. </connor>
<connor> - You gave "Yuri on Ice" a seven as well, </connor>
<connor> a "Trigun" a nine, that's fair, </connor>
<connor> "Tokyo Ghoul season one" and six, </connor>
<connor> and "Tokyo Ghoul season two", a five. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, would I rate it lower now? </connor>
<connor> - I would honestly pretty rate it lower. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, I would rate it lower now. </connor>
<connor> It's literally like a lot, it's one of the shows </connor>
<connor> where I don't know if the Manga readers are right </connor>
<joey> because everyone talks about "the Tokyo Ghoul Manga." </joey>
<joey> Has anyone, have you guys read "the Tokyo Ghoul Manga?" </joey>
<joey> - No. - No. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so nobody knows if the Manga readers were right </garnt>
<joey> for "Tokyo Ghoul" </joey>
<joey> but apparently it's one of the most popular Mango out there </joey>
<garnt> and one of the highest rating. </garnt>
<joey> - I find it interesting how you gave "DanMachi" a five. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll stick by that. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was "Sword Art Online," but beat us all out in lines. </garnt>
<garnt> So "Sword Art Online" was like a six. </garnt>
<connor> - Why was that "Sword Art Online" show </connor>
<connor> so popular when it came out? </connor>
<joey> - I thought it was acceptable. </joey>
<joey> (all laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I gave him maybe like a six or seven. </connor>
<joey> - I just saw some passionate around there. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was good. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know it was acceptable. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought it was bigger than five. </connor>
<connor> - You gave "Prison School" an eight. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You stand by that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I stand by that. - I stand by that. </connor>
<garnt> - "Prison School" is one of the most, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, this regarding the ending of the Manga, </garnt>
<connor> it is one of the most hilarious Mangas I've read. </connor>
<connor> The Anime adaptation did a pretty good fucking job. </connor>
<connor> - He gave Warren.... a serve a five. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I wasn't sure if I should comment on that, </connor>
<connor> I was a bit offended by that and I'm pretty mad at him. </connor>
<joey> - I've never watched this, I have no idea. </joey>
<connor> - I'm Curious "Psycho-Pass," a seven? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Season one, really? </connor>
<connor> - Really, no, no, - I thought it's better. </connor>
<connor> - no, it's a nine now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay, thank God </connor>
<connor> - Like like "Psycho-Pass," I remember "Psycho-Pass" is one </connor>
<connor> of the few shows that has stuck with me </connor>
<connor> and it's one of the shows where I rewatched it </connor>
<connor> and I loved it way more rewatching it </connor>
<connor> than I watched the first time. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think, watch- </connor>
<connor> - The film is so damn good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think I didn't appreciate "Psycho-Pass," </connor>
<connor> through the first time I watched it </connor>
<connor> But the more I watch "Psycho-Pass," the more I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> now, like, I gave it a seven when I first watched it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When I was thinking back to like my top 10 favorite </joey>
<joey> anime of the decade of the 2010s. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "Psycho-Pass" was up there. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it still has some like the Villain </joey>
<joey> was one of the best Villains in the Anime. </joey>
<joey> It still has some of the most unique ideas </joey>
<joey> that I've seen an anime that has like stuck with me. </joey>
<joey> And I don't think has aged at all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like the scene halfway through </garnt>
<garnt> where the main character has to make a choice, </garnt>
<garnt> that has stuck with me for a long time </garnt>
<garnt> and the one scene that has also stuck on me </garnt>
<garnt> is I can't remember what exactly what episode it is </garnt>
<garnt> but it's the episode where they start beating the shit </garnt>
<garnt> out of this character, in like the middle </garnt>
<garnt> of the street, right? </garnt>
<connor> And because of the system that's been set up, </connor>
<connor> no one reacts just because they've never seen </connor>
<connor> something like this before. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - And I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I thought that was like such a unique idea </connor>
<connor> that was completely natural </connor>
<connor> in this world that Gen Urobuchi has built. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's unfortunate- </connor>
<connor> - The whole building is like amazing. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's unfortunate, </connor>
<connor> I think the biggest unfortunate thing is that season two </connor>
<garnt> and I haven't watched season three yet, </garnt>
<garnt> but they just didn't have as interesting ideas </garnt>
<garnt> as was in season one, but yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Who told you? </connor>

<joey> - [Garnt] If honey finds a working coupon, </joey>
<joey> you'll watch the prices drop. </joey>
<joey> - Damn that is epic. </joey>
<connor> Some of the cosplays are cheap, </connor>
<connor> but I want them to be cheaper and thanks to Honey, </connor>
<joey> I've saved up to sometimes $20 on some of those cosplays. </joey>
<joey> - Which goes a long way, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - When you're buying a lot and you're spending half a grand </joey>
<connor> on cosplay, it's a pretty good saving, I'll welcome it. </connor>
<joey> - Honey has found it's over 17 million members </joey>
<connor> over 2 billion dollars in savings. </connor>
<connor> - Half of that is on Michael's place. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - If you don't already have Honey installed, </garnt>
<garnt> you could be straight up missing out on free savings. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally free to install and takes seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid </garnt>
<garnt> and supporting this podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> So, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> Get Honey free at joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </garnt>
<garnt> That's joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking nailed that, back to the episode. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Okay, to end it off though, </joey>
<joey> I gotta point out this blast for me right here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You gave the first "Pokemon movie," </garnt>
<garnt> - Yep. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Mewtwo no Gyakushuu," a four out of 10. </garnt>
<connor> - Yep. - Get out of here. </connor>
<connor> - Get your fucking nostalgia. </connor>
<joey> - Are you seriously telling me the third movie, </joey>
<joey> "Teiou Entei no" is better? </joey>
<joey> You've given that a six. </joey>
<joey> - You gave a "Teiou Entei" movie more </joey>
<garnt> than the first "Pokemon movie." </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I watched them as a kid </garnt>
<joey> and I think I remember the "Entei" movie more. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking give a shit about "Pokemon" guys. </joey>
<joey> - I give a shit about "Pokemon." </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, this is all nostalgia talking here. </connor>
<garnt> I rated this as an adult or a teenager, like yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, clearly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, fucking off the "Pokemon" man </garnt>
<connor> like get your nostalgia talk out of here, </connor>
<connor> "Pokemon" wasn't that great, okay? </connor>
<connor> - Like, I need a fucking beer Garnt, I'm tired of this shit. </connor>
<joey> - But I'm pretty sure you gave Digimon the net. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> "Digimon," is better than "Pokemon," </garnt>
<garnt> I'll fight you on this. </garnt>
<garnt> I was the "Digimon" kids. </garnt>
<connor> "Digimon," the first movie was fucking brilliant </connor>
<connor> have an amazing sound track. </connor>
<joey> - The "Digimon" kid is like the OG neighbor's kid, </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> That meme of like, oh, go and look after the neighbor's kid, </connor>
<connor> obviously weird and it was like... </connor>
<connor> It's a Digimon fun. - It's a Digimon fun. </connor>
<connor> - I bet you were the kind of kid who was like, </connor>
<joey> I don't play "Yu-Gi-Oh," I play "Duel Monsters." </joey>
<joey> (all laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Refuses the jewel without the brakes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, did you did either of you watch, "Digimon?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I did. </joey>
<joey> - So you- </joey>
<connor> - I only watched the movies. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, but are you still sticking by "the Pokemon-" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I watched them both the same age </connor>
<connor> and I preferred "Pokemon." </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because "Digimon" had an actual plot, okay? </garnt>
<joey> - I think at that age, that wasn't my concern. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, (laughs) I think at that age, </joey>
<joey> the concern is which monsters look cool. </joey>
<connor> - I think the thing was right, </connor>
<connor> is that I would watch "Pokemon" </connor>
<joey> and then go play "Pokemon" and be like, yo, this is sick. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I'll play "Digimon," go and play </joey>
<joey> one of the disgusting RPG games they have, </joey>
<connor> that was impossible to fit. </connor>
<connor> Have you ever played that? </connor>
<connor> - I've played some of them. </connor>
<connor> - It's so hard. </connor>
<garnt> - It's hard as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't even complete that shit now. </garnt>
<garnt> Unlike 12 year old, like 10 year old me </garnt>
<connor> was stuck on the fucking thing, like a first level, </connor>
<connor> I couldn't do anything. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what's sick, fuck me, this for children's TV show. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because the thing about "Digimon and Pokemon" </garnt>
<connor> is that I never gave a shit about the games, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't really care about the Pokemon game. </connor>
<connor> - I got to have you on this spot. </connor>
<connor> - I actually watched the "Pokemon anime" years </connor>
<connor> before like I played the actual games for the first time. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - And the thing that stuck out to me for "Digimon" </connor>
<connor> was that, even as a kid, I could recognize that </connor>
<connor> this had story arcs. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Like, even as a kid, I'm just like what- </garnt>
<garnt> - You are the most pretentious kid I have ever met. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, I was just. </garnt>
<garnt> - This kid in his fucking diapers, written in his phone, </garnt>
<joey> like writing on his mouth lips, like. </joey>
<joey> - Mother, turn this "Pokemon" show off, </joey>
<joey> I want story in my children's shows. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was always thinking to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> why is Ash not getting anywhere in his life? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was angry by that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Everyone was angry about that, but "the Mewtwo movie." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was scared that true. </connor>
<joey> - That had fucking fanta. </joey>
<joey> Mewtwo was a fantastic fucking character. </joey>
<joey> But you can relate to that guy, so fucking harda </joey>
<joey> and then with the whole like, </joey>
<joey> you can't tell me that you didn't cry. </joey>
<joey> I don't know when you watched the first "Pokemon Movie." </joey>
<joey> - I cried. </joey>
<joey> - You can't tell, me you didn't cry </joey>
<joey> with the Pikachu crying scene. </joey>
<garnt> - I never gave a shit about Pikachu man. </garnt>
<joey> - You're dead to me. </joey>
<joey> - I never give a shit about Ash. </joey>
<joey> - Bye-bye. </joey>
<garnt> - Fucking it's a loud fucking yellow rat guys, </garnt>
<garnt> get over yourself, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - I glue him on is a fucking diabetic, dinosaur </joey>
<joey> so be it. </joey>
<joey> - I would insult you "Digimon" </joey>
<garnt> but it's so fucking forgettable, </garnt>
<joey> I can't even remember anything to insult. </joey>
<garnt> - I can only remember what a name Agumon. </garnt>
<connor> - What a shit name, Agumon, what is that shit? </connor>
<garnt> - All I'm saying is "Digimon" was the original easy guys. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I'm glad that someone. </connor>
<connor> - Of course I'm gonna rep "Digimon". </connor>
<connor> - Go fucking tweet it Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - I was born out of my mom's womb </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, mother, is this a new world, yes it is. </connor>
<garnt> I'm fucking, I love my "Digimon" </garnt>
<garnt> and as a kid "Digimon" is a better story than "Pokemon" </garnt>
<garnt> and I would define. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey guys make sure to follow us on the Trash Taste Twitter </joey>
<joey> to just absolutely shit all over this man's opinions. </joey>
<joey> But I'm moving on, let's go over to Connor's list, </joey>
<joey> - Well. </joey>
<connor> - Which is rather. </connor>
<joey> - Can I have beer first please. </joey>
<joey> - Do you want to be a beer first? </joey>
<connor> - I think I need to. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - Can I have a beer. </connor>
<connor> - I gonna have to take bullying from you guys. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Every week we should. </connor>
<connor> - I need alcohol to toll me from the bullying. </connor>
<connor> - We should rename the show </connor>
<connor> to Connor fucking fans of two boys a wave. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean, we've both gotten so much shit from you. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause every weekend Connor has to defend his shitty take. </connor>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Well I mean, it's kind of hard </joey>
<joey> because I'm looking at this list right now </joey>
<connor> and so far there's a lot of shows </connor>
<connor> that you haven't even given a score. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think there's a lot of them, I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> this is so shit I don't even wanna give it a like, </connor>
<garnt> hold up Garnt, don't fucking tell me anything </garnt>
<connor> until I've had my beer. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, we're starting now Connor, we're starting now. </connor>
<connor> You better prepare your fucking anus here. </connor>
<garnt> - All right well. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, - Well what's up? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Boku no" an eight, </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay well, listen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just an eight, the fucking "Boku no" </garnt>
<garnt> stan gave "Boku no" an eight. </garnt>
<joey> - Listen. </joey>
<garnt> - Joey, your taste is shit, </garnt>
<connor> the job is so much better, eight out of 10. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why I did that, I mean clearly I was a fool </connor>
<connor> I don't know who that person is, </connor>
<connor> who signed into my account and changed my score. </connor>
<garnt> - I love the fact that you gave "Bakemonogataria" </garnt>
<connor> a higher score than "Pokemon". </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - You give us shit for "Pokemon". </joey>
<connor> - Wait hold on you gave "Clannad: After Story" a 10. </connor>
<joey> - Were you shitting on me for fucking liking "Clannard?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah the first season is shit. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - What did I give that? </joey>
<joey> - You didn't even give it a score. </joey>
<joey> - It's so forgettable, I didn't even wanna </joey>
<joey> fucking rate that piece of shit. </joey>
<joey> "Chobits" if I could rate that, </joey>
<joey> I give that like a seven or an eight. </joey>
<joey> That was a fun show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that was great. </joey>
<joey> - That's a fun show. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Why the fuck did I give </joey>
<connor> "C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control" an eight? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Dude, I never even finished that. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, "Code Geass" season one and two the same score. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, did I really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you did. </joey>
<garnt> Second thing I immediately notice, </garnt>
<garnt> after our discussion we just had, "Pokemon" four. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were my boy. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay I can probably explain why that is the case, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this was made in 2014, </connor>
<connor> it was probably the age of like, I'm a big boy now. </connor>
<connor> "Pokemon" that's old Connor that's child Connor, </connor>
<connor> me adult Connor I don't like "Pokemon", I'm a man. </connor>
<joey> - I thought you were my boy. </joey>
<connor> - No, I am, I would actively change that to a 10 if I could. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, big sad. </connor>
<garnt> - Really, a 10 Connor? </garnt>
<joey> - What else am I gonna fucking- </joey>
<garnt> - Okay one thing I've found hilarious, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Come on. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - This is why I didn't wanna go last. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I can't be, I have to talk shit about your scores </connor>
<connor> and not know my own. </connor>
<garnt> - Connor, has given "Stein's Gate" and "Sword Art Online" </garnt>
<garnt> the same score of eight. </garnt>
<connor> - I gave "Sword Art Online" an eight, fuck! </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You gave "Sword Art Online" season one an eight. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that I'm actually having a stroke. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Joey's just having an aneurysm right now. </connor>
<connor> - Listen, I can explain. </connor>
<connor> - You gave the same score. - You gave it the same score. </connor>
<connor> - I can explain all right. </connor>
<connor> - Please explain it. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'm not even gonna question you, </connor>
<joey> giving "Steins Gate" an eight, okay that's fine. </joey>
<connor> - I meant to put 10. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And "Sword Art Online" I meant to put a 10. </connor>
<connor> - Connor for which one. </connor>
<connor> - 10 for "Sword Art Online". </connor>
<connor> I always ignore what if I had, </connor>
<connor> genuinely I enjoyed "Sword Art Online", </connor>
<connor> but if I went back and watched it, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure I would be like, what the fuck is this shit? </connor>
<connor> I enjoyed it for like what it was. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I liked the idea cause was my first ever </joey>
<connor> like video game anime. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So it was fun. </connor>
<connor> And then you think about it more </connor>
<connor> and you think about Kerio and Tony and you're like, </connor>
<connor> wow this show is really garbage. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> But at the time, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, at the time everyone's, </garnt>
<garnt> I think we've all gone through the stage where we thought </garnt>
<garnt> "Sword Art Online" was a cool concept, </garnt>
<joey> back when it was a cool concept. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean look admittedly, as much as I'm known as </joey>
<joey> the guy who publicly hates "Sword Art Online" </joey>
<garnt> like I've said that like first couple of episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> really great buildup with the premise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then it kind of just fell apart after a while </garnt>
<garnt> when they were like let's make Kurito </garnt>
<garnt> the edgiest protagonist alive. </garnt>
<joey> And then that's when I was like, okay. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you had a great premise yeah </joey>
<joey> and you just kind of ruined it </joey>
<joey> with the worst, main character. </joey>
<connor> - I have no idea why I gave "Pokemon" </connor>
<connor> and it go a three at nine, </connor>
<connor> I would never, ever do that. </connor>
<connor> - Why, what would you give it? </connor>
<connor> - Like a five? </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Show is shit man. - What? </connor>
<connor> - Boring show. - What? </connor>
<connor> - It's boring man. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - It's so boring. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but you have to understand </joey>
<garnt> this is a man who skipped stories. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no yeah, what I wanna know is, </garnt>
<joey> how the fuck do you watch "Pokemon?" </joey>
<joey> - Why did you even watch it? </joey>
<garnt> - You watched an animated light novel, what the fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched "Pokemon" and I got through </garnt>
<joey> and then I watched like the next three seasons or so. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right? </joey>
<joey> - And how did you, </joey>
<joey> - How did you manage that? </joey>
<joey> - How did you manage that? </joey>
<joey> - I was confused a lot of the time </joey>
<joey> but I also just like thought a lot of it was weird. </joey>
<joey> Like, 'cause this is the, you have to bear in mind </joey>
<connor> this is the first time I'd ever seen any anime </connor>
<connor> where like there was a protagonist or whatever. </connor>
<connor> Who was just like touching a kid, like the ghost skill. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, wait what the fuck. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, well, why is he making this child porn bro? </connor>
<connor> - It's all right man, it's a deconstruction of heroin. </connor>
<garnt> That's what they call it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I want to know is how you got the patients to do it </garnt>
<connor> because even me. </connor>
<connor> - Well, you again, back in the age of like </connor>
<connor> when you're an anime fan, you can kind of like </connor>
<connor> put up with anything 'cause you've just gotten into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that was when I watched it </connor>
<connor> 'cause it always high up on the list </connor>
<connor> and that might've been the thing that made me be like </connor>
<joey> you know what, no, I'm not watching anime, fuck anime. </joey>
<joey> - But here's what confuses me right. </joey>
<joey> Is that like you gave "Pokemon and Gotei" an eight </joey>
<connor> and I would assume the majority of the Montari series </connor>
<connor> is like a mid school. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you love "Katana Nagatari" </connor>
<joey> - "Katana Nagatari" is like fucking awesome. </joey>
<joey> - But it's the same style. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Okay it's the same style. </joey>
<joey> - It's written by the same dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but it's done like a million times better. </joey>
<connor> It's so much more entertaining than "Baka Nagatari" </connor>
<connor> ever was. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not saying "Katana Nagatari" is bad or anything. </joey>
<connor> - I'm saying it was fucking great. </connor>
<joey> - I just find it weird. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're both great </joey>
<joey> because like I guess in my mind, </joey>
<connor> when I think of "Katana Nagatari" </connor>
<connor> it just feels like a Quentin Tarantino film, </connor>
<connor> like when I love war shit. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right, like the dialogue is really important, </connor>
<connor> it's like the one that like, </connor>
<connor> I don't really like it when seeing, </connor>
<joey> - Wait how did you not find that </joey>
<connor> with the "Mogna Nagatari" series? </connor>
<connor> - Because I didn't find the dialogue interesting. </connor>
<connor> In like "Katana Nagatari." </connor>
<joey> - That's like the one selling point </joey>
<connor> of "the Mononatari series." </connor>
<connor> - I didn't find it interesting. </connor>
<connor> I was sold and rice circulation came on </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, yo this is a fucking bomb. </connor>
<connor> And then I went to see her. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, man give give us the fucking wine here. </connor>
<joey> - I needed off the enumeration. </joey>
<connor> - "Katana Nagatari" was like legit, oh shit, </connor>
<connor> okay I'm in my three by three, </connor>
<connor> I honestly I didn't put "Katana Nagatari" </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just didn't forgot it existed. </connor>
<connor> That would go with my three by three. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So "Katana Nagatari" is like </connor>
<connor> it gave me everything that like </connor>
<connor> I love about like "Kill Bill" </connor>
<connor> and "Pulp Fiction" in anime form </connor>
<connor> and with kind of store with a setting that I love, </connor>
<joey> which is like Samurai. </joey>
<joey> I really love Samurai stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean again, I'm not disagreeing with you on that </garnt>
<joey> 100% agree with all of them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just saying like, it's both a lot of words. </garnt>
<joey> It's both like. </joey>
<garnt> - It's both weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's both characters that are very- </garnt>
<garnt> Is it by "Shidi or Sharift?" </garnt>
<joey> - No "Katana Nagatari" is not Shidi and Sharift. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know something about "Katana Nagatari." </joey>
<connor> I just really fucking enjoyed so much more </connor>
<connor> than I ever did the Monogatari series. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's the closest you've come to enjoying </garnt>
<connor> just reading words then. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I think because there was a lot of, </connor>
<joey> the action was really fucking good in "Katana Nagatari." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it made sense on the story. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you didn't like any action in the Monogatari's? </joey>
<joey> - The Monogatari series action was fucking great. </joey>
<garnt> - It was fucking insane. </garnt>
<connor> - Come on man. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know why but yet the action was far better </garnt>
<garnt> than I had any right to be. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, Sharif was like, </joey>
<joey> all right em gonna flex for a quick. </joey>
<garnt> - Like that fight where it was like Arora Rogi </garnt>
<garnt> versus like I think it was Karen in the second season? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - It was like the big brother </connor>
<joey> versus- - They fight with Karen. </joey>
<connor> I can't even remember. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no the fight was Combo. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah that one with Combo. </connor>
<joey> - You remember the monkey. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking, Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - That shit was fucking insane. </joey>
<connor> - That was brutal, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even find if remember this. </connor>
<joey> - Okay I'll show you afterwards </joey>
<connor> and you'll learn to appreciate. </connor>
<joey> - I would say though, the toothbrushing scene </joey>
<joey> it's probably the thing that made me </joey>
<connor> like curious about Hamtai. </connor>
<joey> I was like, oh this is actually kind of hot. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly like the toothbrush scene. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna say it's hot. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like it birthed so many degenerates. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Because that's culture was born. </joey>
<joey> - And that's culture was born </joey>
<joey> thanks to the toothbrushing scene, </joey>
<joey> that is a classic scene. </joey>
<joey> I would defend that scene as being like the classic scene. </joey>
<garnt> I noticed you gave me "Noragami" a 10. </garnt>
<connor> - Did I really? </connor>
<garnt> - Masterpiece. </garnt>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - Did I really? </garnt>
<connor> - Who are you and how much time did you spend on Tumblr? </connor>
<connor> - Are you a 12 year old? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I don't know what mindset I was in, </connor>
<connor> to ever give, I don't think there's any point in my life </connor>
<connor> where I genuinely liked "Noragami" that much. </connor>
<joey> - In my opinion, the only 10 out of 10 aspect </joey>
<connor> about "Noragami" is the opening. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that was a good show. </connor>
<joey> - The opening was fucking bad </joey>
<joey> but then again, I find it absolutely hilarious </joey>
<joey> that you gave "Black Butler" a five. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Honestly? </joey>
<joey> - And he gave "Black Butler" season two specials a three. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, I still would. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Everyone, I made it no, I would not try and hide it </joey>
<connor> that I did not like the show. </connor>
<garnt> - Your life is a lie seed OVA fans, </garnt>
<connor> he was never a "Black Butler" fan. </connor>
<connor> - He was never a "Black Butler" fan. </connor>
<garnt> - You gave "Monogarati second season" a 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I definitely suffered as a teen getting into anime </connor>
<connor> like I was heavily influenced </connor>
<connor> by what everyone else was saying. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean I agree with, I agree. </garnt>
<joey> - I agree. </joey>
<joey> - I was fucking, I'm a liar. </joey>
<joey> - Second season is definitely a 10 for me. </joey>
<garnt> - You gave "Monogatari" 10 as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is definitely the case of teenage Connor </connor>
<connor> saw that everyone was saying the show was good </connor>
<joey> that I didn't understand. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just gonna put it a high score. </joey>
<connor> - I can tell because you gave "Mirai Niki" a nine. </connor>
<connor> - Did you actually? </connor>
<connor> - I think I really enjoyed that show when I watched it. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh man. </garnt>
<connor> - I legitimately did. </connor>
<connor> - You must've watched as a teenager. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah you must have. </joey>
<joey> - Yes I did. </joey>
<garnt> - That was like "the Elfen Lied" of human race. </garnt>
<garnt> - Again, this is when I was. </garnt>
<joey> - He gave "Elfen Lied" a nine as well. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah actually. </joey>
<garnt> - He was such an aging kid man. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, listen. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like that too when I finished mine. </garnt>
<joey> - That was when I was 14, that was seven years ago. </joey>
<garnt> So I was. </garnt>
<joey> - I probably just said how old was I when I was 14? </joey>
<garnt> - I was 17? </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, 17 when I made this list, so. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - This just sounds about right for 17 year old Connor, </joey>
<connor> like "Deadman Wonderland" an eight, yeah that checks out. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> You gave "Monster" a seven. </garnt>
<garnt> - What, what? </garnt>
<connor> - I may have to down before. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, that might've been, </connor>
<connor> from me having to recover from the fact </connor>
<connor> that I dropped it and had to pick it back up. </connor>
<connor> - You dropped it? </connor>
<connor> - About yeah, about 10 episodes in </connor>
<connor> 'cause the shit didn't fucking move </connor>
<connor> but then actually, but then you when you watch it, </connor>
<connor> you're like, holly shit it's good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, holy shit, nevermind. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit, oh hold up homies. </connor>
<connor> - I was blind but now I can see. </connor>
<connor> - I gave "Cowboy Bebop" a seven as well, </connor>
<connor> which honestly, maybe it's an eight but it's honestly, </connor>
<connor> it's not a 10 or a nine. </connor>
<joey> - There are some shows on here </joey>
<joey> that I'm surprised you watched at all, like "Zombie Loan". </joey>
<connor> - "Zombie Loan" I have no idea why I watched that show </connor>
<joey> but I remember being angry that I watched that show. </joey>
<joey> I remember being like mad </joey>
<connor> that I wasted my time watching that show. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I think the only reason why I watched "Zombie Loan" </joey>
<connor> was because I heard it was a pitch pit show and I was like, </connor>
<connor> I like peach pit and I was like. </connor>
<connor> - I gave " School Days" a one though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I see that. </garnt>
<joey> - I see that. </joey>
<joey> - Hell, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You finished "Sunday Without God". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah I noticed that. </joey>
<garnt> - I haven't finished that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I finished it, but I definitely did not give it a seven </garnt>
<garnt> that's for sure </garnt>
<garnt> - And you gave it a seven. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait which one is "Sunday Without God"? </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly, that's the point I'm trying to make. </joey>
<connor> (both mumbling) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "the Girl With The Shovel." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I watched that because. </connor>
<connor> - I'm surprised you watched that. </connor>
<connor> - That was when, I can actually tell you </connor>
<connor> the exact time I watched that. </connor>
<connor> I remember very well when I watched that. </connor>
<connor> So, when I first got into anime, </connor>
<connor> I was watching it on like the shitty like parrot sides </connor>
<connor> to figure out what the fuck was going on. </connor>
<connor> I accidentally watched "Fullmetal Alchemist" twice, </connor>
<connor> not realizing like what the fuck I was doing. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I finally got a free trial for crunchy roll </connor>
<joey> and so I watched ass much anime as I could </joey>
<joey> for the 48 hours. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And that was one of them. </joey>
<joey> - We're not sponsored by Crunch Roll </joey>
<joey> we're just let you know. </joey>
<joey> - I actually, that was one of the ones that I watched </joey>
<joey> and that was- </joey>
<joey> - Was "Zombie Loan" one of them as well? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, that was before. </joey>
<connor> So I remember that was pretty the first ever 12 episode show </connor>
<connor> I watched on Crunchy Roll I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of this shit just doesn't make sense. </garnt>
<joey> - You watched "Outbreak Company." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I did. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's no. </joey>
<connor> - I would never expected you to watch that. </connor>
<garnt> - I would not have paid Connor to watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think you're the only other person I know </garnt>
<garnt> that has watched "Outbreak Company." </garnt>
<garnt> - You finished "The World God Only Knows" </garnt>
<garnt> and gave it a nine. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah all three seasons, I actually really liked that. </connor>
<garnt> - I really like what is going on. </garnt>
<joey> - I liked it as well that just doesn't seem. </joey>
<joey> - It's surprising to me. </joey>
<joey> - That I'm just like my jaws on the floor </joey>
<garnt> 'cause if you were to tell me </garnt>
<garnt> that Connor finish this show in lights, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, what is this? </garnt>
<joey> - Wait you also gave "Higurashi" an eight. </joey>
<joey> - Season one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think I would take that back. </connor>
<joey> - What would you give it now? </joey>
<connor> - I watched the doubts maybe a four. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I'm looking at some of this </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, is this me? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like he gave "Devil is a part-timer" a fucking 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love that, I love look, dude. </garnt>
<connor> - That's really good. </connor>
<connor> - That is really good. </connor>
<connor> - If you actually look up my account </connor>
<connor> my profile picture is "Devil is a Part Timer." </connor>
<joey> I loved "Devil is a Part Timer." </joey>
<joey> - I'm surprised you watched </joey>
<connor> "Eden of the East" - Yeah, I did. </connor>
<joey> - And the two movie and gave them a nine. </joey>
<connor> - I really enjoyed "Eden of the East." </connor>
<joey> - Really? - I thought you could try it. </joey>
<connor> - How we never talked about "Eden of the East" together. </connor>
<connor> - I don't how have we never talked? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I fucking love. </connor>
<connor> It brings up "Eden of the East" never comes up. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a fucking great show. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but no one ever brings that shit up. </connor>
<garnt> - It's got a great first season but like the movies </garnt>
<joey> just didn't conclude it in the way I wanted to. </joey>
<joey> - He gave both of them are nine though. </joey>
<joey> - I thought "Eden of the East" </joey>
<connor> had one of the most interesting </connor>
<connor> premises you could find. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yes. </connor>
<connor> - I watched. </connor>
<connor> - Okay since no one talks about "Eden of the East" </connor>
<garnt> we're gonna sell "Eden of the East" right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's give some love to "Eden of the East" right now. </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna be honest I remember my feelings for the show. </connor>
<connor> I cannot fucking remember what happened. </connor>
<connor> I have one memory of this show and it was like a ship </connor>
<connor> and a bunch of naked people coming up. </connor>
<garnt> That's all I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> No the ending of the first season of "Eden of the East" </garnt>
<connor> was fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Oh fucking brilliant. </connor>
<connor> - What is the premise again? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so the premise is they have a smartphone </connor>
<connor> and I can't remember exactly how much money they were given </connor>
<connor> but he had like 13 people who were given these smartphones </connor>
<connor> and on this smartphone, you have like this AI </connor>
<connor> that they could request anything to happen. </connor>
<connor> - That's right. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> And they were given a budget of I think $10 million. </connor>
<connor> - No it was more than that actually. </connor>
<connor> - Was it like a million or 10 million. </connor>
<joey> - 10 Billion yen. </joey>
<joey> - 10 billion yen. </joey>
<joey> - Which is $100 million. </joey>
<joey> - So they were given a budget of $100 million </joey>
<joey> and all they were told was to save the world. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> And that was their objective. </joey>
<joey> - It was good. </joey>
<connor> - And so the series is just the story </connor>
<connor> of these different people and their own take </connor>
<connor> on what $100 million means to save the world. </connor>
<connor> And honestly, like, I don't wanna spoil like what happens. </connor>
<joey> - It's so good watch it. </joey>
<joey> - But it's fucking great especially the first season. </joey>
<joey> - It's only 12 episodes, just go watch it. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna rewatch it. </joey>
<connor> - I wanna rewatch it. </connor>
<connor> - It's not just 12 episodes is 12 episodes </connor>
<connor> and a movie, I think. </connor>
<connor> - It's two movies. </connor>
<connor> - Two movies. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Are you sure it's two movies not just one recap movie. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because he gave both of them a nine out of 10. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, but I feel like the first season </garnt>
<garnt> was fucking fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the problem with the first season </garnt>
<garnt> is that I didn't conclude the story, </garnt>
<joey> but the first season was fucking fantastic. </joey>
<joey> The movies were not as good in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know they had movies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I don't remember much </joey>
<garnt> about what happened in the movies. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of these shows, I legitimately can't remember </connor>
<connor> like fully watching but I.. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just surprised you watched the "Hentai" </joey>
<joey> the one eye nickel. </joey>
<connor> - "The Stony Cat and the Hentai." </connor>
<connor> - I did watch that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think he done the audio as well. </connor>
<joey> That doesn't seem like a show you would watch. </joey>
<joey> Why have we never talked about this? </joey>
<garnt> You watch "Black Bullet?" </garnt>
<joey> You haven't rated it, but you watched that. </joey>
<joey> - You watched "Black Bullet?" </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I watched all of "Black Bullet." </garnt>
<connor> I remember, I actually do really enjoy </connor>
<joey> like romance slice of live shows, but I used to binge them </joey>
<joey> all the time, but now </joey>
<joey> - You watched "Black Cat" as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, "Black Cat" shit though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the moment was away though. </joey>
<joey> - I watched "Gatchaman Crowds." </joey>
<joey> And I remember I gave that a six, </joey>
<joey> but that was so reluctantly. </joey>
<joey> I did not enjoy watching that. </joey>
<joey> And I watched, there's a bunch of other shows that I watched </joey>
<joey> after this, I didn't include like, </joey>
<joey> what's that fucking card game like "Wixoss," </joey>
<joey> or whatever it's called. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That was fucking shit, I hated that. </connor>
<connor> I'm angry that I watched that. - You watched that? </connor>
<joey> - I hated that I watched that. </joey>
<joey> - Why did you even watch that? </joey>
<joey> - This is the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Is it to me? </joey>
<joey> I do not like looking up anime. </joey>
<garnt> Like I don't wanna know anything about the show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just give me the fucking show, let me watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> And if I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just brain dead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I wanna- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just brain dead monkey boats, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you, because here's the thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I guarantee, if you just give me a show, </garnt>
<connor> tell me to watch it, I'll watch it, I might enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> If you try and sell me on a show, </connor>
<connor> I immediately will stop being like, I don't know, no. </connor>
<connor> - I'm completely the opposite, I'm the opposite, </connor>
<connor> Because like, I've gotten to the point, </connor>
<connor> where I need to be sold on a show. </connor>
<connor> Because I need to have like a reason, </connor>
<connor> why I'm watching the show. </connor>
<connor> Like, is this show gonna get good? </connor>
<connor> Am I gonna have something that I get out of the show? </connor>
<connor> I need to know that before like truly gets into a show </connor>
<joey> because otherwise, nowadays I end up dropping shows </joey>
<joey> after one episode, if it doesn't hook me. </joey>
<joey> Even like critically highly claimed show, </joey>
<joey> if I don't know, that something good is coming up, </joey>
<joey> that's gonna be worth my time, </joey>
<joey> then I'm just not gonna give it a chance. </joey>
<joey> - No, I agree. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I just don't have that patience anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - I've sat through enough shirty shows </joey>
<garnt> to know that I don't wanna waste my time anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just sad, 'cause I do miss that feeling </connor>
<connor> of finding hidden gems, where I can just be like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I have zero expectations. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - I gave "Kyoukai no Kanata" wait this is it? </garnt>
<joey> No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - "Kyoukai no Kanata." </joey>
<garnt> - "Kyoukai no Kanata," seven, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - In fact, I haven't rated that, but I did watch it. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I did. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, one thing, that scares me, </connor>
<connor> you've watched "Fate/Zero," </connor>
<connor> but you rated the second season lower than the first season? </connor>
<connor> You mean the actual action packed second season, </connor>
<connor> where everything gets concluded, </connor>
<connor> is lower than the first season? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Which is the setup? </joey>
<garnt> - What happens in "Fate/Zero?" </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like completely going against everything, </garnt>
<connor> like all the character build up before is like </connor>
<connor> I hate story, I love action </connor>
<connor> but the season where there's more action, I'll rate low. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I really enjoyed, when they were introducing </connor>
<connor> like all of the characters in "Fate." </connor>
<joey> That's what my favorite part of "Fate." </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Like "Fate/stay night" as well, </joey>
<joey> my favorite part of "Fate/stay night," </joey>
<joey> is when they introducing the characters. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's so cool. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you're like, I know there's an assassin, </connor>
<connor> I know there's a writer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What are they gonna be? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then when you watch "Fate/stay night," </connor>
<connor> you're like, wow, writer is shirty in this one </connor>
<connor> compared to "Fate/Zero." </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like "Fate/Zero, you watched, </connor>
<connor> You're like your writer, he's the best. </connor>
<connor> Alexando, I'd fuck him. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, then you watch, then that's the reason </connor>
<connor> why I fucking hated "Fate/stay night," </connor>
<garnt> except for the animation, because I was like why- </garnt>
<connor> - Which, wait. </connor>
<connor> Which "Fate/stay night" are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - You're talking about the original "Fate/stay night?' </connor>
<garnt> - (inaudible) works. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - The series, not the movies, right? </connor>
<connor> - The series. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I don't wanna get into this with you. </connor>
<connor> (Laughs) </connor>
<garnt> The point is- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just need clarification because what you say can. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Fate" fans will like on their seat right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aren't you cool? </garnt>
<garnt> But I can't believe they had, like, </garnt>
<connor> there was no like good Alec, they should've just brought </connor>
<connor> Alexando back again and be like, hey, I'm back baby. </connor>
<connor> Or like, it's a free cool, I guess like, </connor>
<connor> hey, I'm back in the future. </connor>
<connor> - Back in the future. </connor>
<connor> - I'm back in the past, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was like the best part of "Fate/Zero. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> He was the best part of "Fate/zero. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 100% </connor>
<connor> - Like, he was... </connor>
<connor> - Had my castors relationship with the fucking Weevil, </connor>
<connor> whatever is called, lord vakins' </connor>
<connor> - Weevil, Waiver? </connor>
<connor> - Waiver, what I'm fucking doing. </connor>
<connor> - Weevil (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - Who the fuck gives a shit? </connor>
<connor> They don't even believe she's in. </connor>
<connor> Honestly, he's kind of won that's probably </connor>
<joey> why he's in my mind, that's what he is. </joey>
<joey> What's another thing that I gave? </joey>
<joey> What I don't, I disagree with that. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of ones that you haven't given a score like, </joey>
<joey> - "Darker than Black," I stand by being a nine, </joey>
<joey> 'cause if you watch the DOB dude, Troy Bakers in that, </joey>
<connor> this is before Troy Baker stopped doing Anime. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, fuck man, he kills it as November 11. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like for "Darker than Black, </garnt>
<connor> is a show that I've actually rewatched quite a few times. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know why if we watch it quite a few times. </connor>
<connor> - It's fun man. </connor>
<connor> - I just really liked the world of Dark than black. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, I don't remember anything. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Quirks, but instead of it, </garnt>
<connor> it's actually fucking cool and weird. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause, I remember watching it, it was like X-men. </garnt>
<garnt> But what I found interesting, was the fact that </garnt>
<connor> they had to like do this really weird activity every time </connor>
<connor> they enhance their power. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - With a smoking. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know why, I just thought that was really cool </garnt>
<garnt> and like it has an fucking amazing soundtrack as well </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was like by "Yoko Kanno." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like one of the biggest differences </garnt>
<garnt> between the first season, every other season </garnt>
<connor> was Yoko Kanno's music just set such an amazing tone </connor>
<connor> for this world and this environment </connor>
<connor> that it just made you it just felt good exploring this world </connor>
<connor> and just being in it and. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I gotta rewatch it. </connor>
<connor> - It's fun dude, I'm watching Dub dude </connor>
<connor> Like the Dubs really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - You're saying this is a Joey now? </connor>
<joey> - No, honestly, like "Troy Baker" is November 11th, </joey>
<joey> one of my favorite performances </joey>
<joey> - I love "Troy Baker," so you'll sole me on that, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because "Troy Baker" placed the guy </joey>
<connor> who has to smoke, even though he hates smoking. </connor>
<connor> - I've watched the Dub as well, it was fucking crazy </connor>
<connor> - And he's so good at it, man, God. </connor>
<connor> Okay, well I. </connor>
<joey> - Hold on, you watched "Saki?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you gave it a seven. </connor>
<connor> - "Saki," that's the one with things on here? </connor>
<joey> - That's the, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> No, no, the Mahjong one. </joey>
<connor> - That's the body pillow we have outside. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I watched that. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you've actually watched that- </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched all of Saki and I'll hope at the end, </garnt>
<connor> I was like, I'm gonna understand Mahjong </connor>
<connor> and at the end I was like, I don't understand Mahjong. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, with this golden wind and shit </connor>
<joey> going on and stuff like that, And I'm like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Again, it just doesn't seem like a show you would watch. </joey>
<joey> - I watched all of "Persona 4" the animation. </joey>
<joey> - I noticed that. - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I noticed that as well </joey>
<joey> - But you've never played "Persona 4?" </joey>
<joey> - Never played "Persona." </joey>
<joey> - Why would you do that? </joey>
<connor> - I'll be 100% honest with you at the time </connor>
<connor> I legitimately didn't know it was a game. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's like wait, did you watch "Danganronpa" as well? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I did. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah he did he gave it a four. </connor>
<joey> - I have played "Danganronpa" </joey>
<connor> I thought the anime was actually- </connor>
<connor> - Okay that's fine. </connor>
<connor> - For the shows that I haven't rated </connor>
<connor> you can ask me and ask me what I'd given- </connor>
<joey> - Okay what would you give "No Game No Life?" </joey>
<connor> - Well that if I was 14- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - A hard 10 bro. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course what of now? </connor>
<connor> - Now like a seven honestly. </connor>
<joey> - Seven okay. </joey>
<connor> - It's about that would say. </connor>
<connor> - What'd you give "Accel World?" </connor>
<garnt> - Like a four. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - What would you give "Another?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a one. </garnt>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - "Another" was shit. </joey>
<joey> - Well you watched "B-gata H-kei" as well. </joey>
<joey> - Actually I did I loved "B-gata H-kei." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that is funny. </joey>
<joey> - That is actually like a fucking great show. </joey>
<joey> - I have read the Manga. </joey>
<joey> - I can tell you exactly why I watched 'Another" as well </joey>
<joey> because I was talking to a girl at the time </joey>
<connor> and she was like of course my favorite show is "Another," </connor>
<garnt> it's the best show. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, fine I'll watch this show, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm trying to like Simp I'm try so I'll try. </connor>
<garnt> - "Another" was kinda like the true crimes documentary, </garnt>
<garnt> the anime, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause everyone knows white girls love true crime </connor>
<garnt> and before they get into true crime, </garnt>
<garnt> they're a little younger they're like </garnt>
<connor> "Another" yeah erased, yes, all these shows that I love. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like I too like "Final Destination" </connor>
<joey> and watching trashy horror movies, </joey>
<joey> I can do that all day long. </joey>
<joey> That's literally what Sydney gets me to do </joey>
<garnt> whenever I'm like- </garnt>
<joey> - Okay I'll give you props though </joey>
<joey> that you a watch "Claymore" and gave it a nine. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly I loved "Claymore." </connor>
<joey> - "Claymore" was fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - Man I, that is one of the animes that got done most dirty. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I'm surprised you gave it a nine </garnt>
<joey> because "Claymore" Manga- </joey>
<joey> - "Claymore" Manga nine or 10 honestly. </joey>
<joey> - "Claymore" Mangga masterpiece, anime- </joey>
<connor> - The Anime made me like feel things </connor>
<joey> that I hadn't felt before man. </joey>
<joey> I was like- </joey>
<joey> - What is that thing? </joey>
<joey> - Like a level of uncomfortableness </joey>
<joey> that I haven't experienced before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I don't know why there's something so unnerving </joey>
<connor> and uncomfortable about watching "Claymore." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I felt that when I watched "Basara" </joey>
<joey> so I know what you mean. </joey>
<joey> - It like fucks you up a little bit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I can tell like, I honestly I wish I... </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna try my best to try and read the Manga. </connor>
<connor> But I was set I was gonna read something else- </connor>
<joey> - I recently rebought all the Mangas </joey>
<joey> just 'cause I want to read it again 'cause- </joey>
<connor> - What was the other fucking show </connor>
<connor> I said I was gonna read the Manga by the way? </connor>
<joey> - I have no fucking clue. </joey>
<joey> - You finished "Eyeshield 21," right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I did, I wanna do- </joey>
<joey> Well, I actually, I downloaded- </joey>
<joey> - (inaudible) was it? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no I was gonna read that, </joey>
<joey> but I actually downloaded </joey>
<joey> the first 30 chapters of "One Piece" being like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, he is getting into "One Piece." </joey>
<garnt> (cheers and claps) </garnt>
<connor> - But I haven't had the stomach- </connor>
<joey> - Mark it in your calendar. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the seed of OVA start "One Piece." </garnt>
<joey> - Listen, I'll tell you when I start, like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah good. </joey>
<connor> - But I haven't- </connor>
<connor> - Mark it in your calendars </connor>
<joey> and come back to us in 10 years time </joey>
<joey> and we'll see where he is. </joey>
<garnt> - But honestly like "Claymore" is a fucking amazing Manga. </garnt>
<connor> One of the best Mangas out there. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly I really think so. </connor>
<garnt> - The anime did it there- </garnt>
<joey> - Is the Manga finished, like totally rapped up? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, years ago. </joey>
<connor> - Okay good, good, good. </connor>
<garnt> - So it's- </garnt>
<joey> - 22, 23 volumes something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And 'cause like the "Claymore" anime had </joey>
<connor> Anime original ending if I remember correctly. </connor>
<connor> - Yes it did. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it was complete shit, from what I remember. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember having a good time. </connor>
<connor> I remember, I watched the dub </connor>
<connor> and I remember the voice actor Greg Ayres, </connor>
<connor> was like playing the whiny characters he always does. </connor>
<connor> And I think he was a little too whining. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's just Greg Ayres. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, its true, he's too fucking good at his job. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no I remember that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I swear he was typecasting that role </garnt>
<garnt> for like the longest fucking time. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, 'cause there were so many of those characters </connor>
<garnt> and no one else could do a voice like him </garnt>
<garnt> if it's like sounding whiny. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was always him doing the whiny character. </connor>
<garnt> - I would say "Eureka Seven," seven out of 10. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, I when- </connor>
<garnt> - Original one? </garnt>
<garnt> - When I watched that everyone was talking about this show </garnt>
<connor> like Jesus had came down himself and brought a show </connor>
<connor> and I watched it and I thought, </connor>
<connor> honestly this is kind of shit. </connor>
<joey> Like it's good but like it's kinda fucking boring. </joey>
<joey> - Is that how you feel about- </joey>
<connor> - Obviously now now I will give it a six. </connor>
<joey> - Is that how you feel about "Ergo Proxy" as well, </joey>
<joey> you gave that a seven as well. </joey>
<connor> - "Ergo Proxy" I remember I was just like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is happening? </connor>
<joey> - Again this doesn't seem like an anime </joey>
<joey> that you would watch. </joey>
<joey> - No I- </joey>
<joey> - Like "Ergo Proxy" is the last anime </joey>
<joey> I would think Connor to watch. </joey>
<connor> - It was like watching like when you go </connor>
<connor> to a modern art museum and you look at this shit, </connor>
<joey> you're like, yeah I get it, that was what I - </joey>
<joey> - That's what I mean. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I felt like watching "Ergo Proxy." </connor>
<connor> - You saying that you've watched "Ergo Proxy" </connor>
<joey> is like the same amount of like what the fuck I would get </joey>
<joey> if you came up to me tomorrow and said </joey>
<joey> so I watched "Serial Experiments Lain." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that shit I've been wanting </connor>
<connor> to watch that for a while. </connor>
<joey> I just haven't had the opportunity to be like </joey>
<joey> yeah I wanna waste a day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And not really enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> - And have an avid brain that is hurting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel like you watch shows that to come out </joey>
<connor> with like just your brain being like what? </connor>
<connor> But like that's not fun half the time, so I never even- </connor>
<connor> - I mean it is fun depending on your mood </connor>
<connor> because I remember like, I took me ages </connor>
<connor> to watch "Serial Experiments Lain" </connor>
<connor> and then I was just in this weird mood where I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> yeah, I want my mind to be fucked up. </joey>
<joey> That sounds like a fun experience right now. </joey>
<joey> And then I did it- </joey>
<joey> - I wanna challenge. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like me with, you've asked me "Pun Pun." </joey>
<garnt> Like I'm waiting to wake up for the day where I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I want depression right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Why the fuck did I give this anime, what's it? </connor>
<connor> - "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I noticed that. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you, I was about to say </joey>
<joey> you gave that a nine and I'm like, was it the milf titties, </joey>
<garnt> is that what it is? </garnt>
<joey> - It must have been milf titties. </joey>
<garnt> - It must have been milf titties, </garnt>
<garnt> that's all I remember from that show. </garnt>
<garnt> - They get it a little two bonus points fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> but again, that was in the same weekend that I watched </garnt>
<connor> the other show on the country will 48 hours. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember "the Maoyuu Maou Yuusha show" </garnt>
<connor> was like Studio Arms and if you don't know Studio Arms. </connor>
<connor> - I do not know Studio Arms. </connor>
<connor> - They were like famous for being a Hunter studio, </connor>
<connor> like transitioned into anime. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's probably why it connected a little bit. </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, I mean, that was like one of the first show </garnt>
<garnt> they produced that was an anime </garnt>
<garnt> that was seen as just not complete trash </garnt>
<garnt> but I wouldn't call it a fucking nine out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember there's a little sexual things going on </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> Some vibes of little milf, some kind of thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean I'd say as an impressionable teenager </garnt>
<garnt> I can see why you are connected with that </garnt>
<joey> on a personal level you know. </joey>
<joey> - Connected with that? </joey>
<joey> - He connected with that? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, I think that's pretty much everything </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you haven't rated a lot of these. </garnt>
<connor> - I would bump Kill the kill at one </connor>
<connor> for getting me in the hand tie. </connor>
<connor> That's the only thing I would- </connor>
<connor> - Dude really? </connor>
<connor> - "Kill la Kill" is what made me be like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> - Anime girls are hot. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, you know what is there a hand tie of this </connor>
<connor> and there was. </connor>
<connor> And that's how I was like, oh this is good. </connor>
<connor> - That's why you need to get into the Jinchis man. </connor>
<joey> Connor, come on. </joey>
<garnt> - We're gonna get him into that event eventually. </garnt>
<connor> - You can run away- </connor>
<connor> - Eventually. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait okay then, if you liked </connor>
<connor> "the Maoyuu Maou Yuusha" did you like "Log Horizon?" </connor>
<connor> - I loved, "Log Horizon" is one of my favorite shows. </connor>
<connor> - Okay that makes sense </connor>
<joey> 'cause it's written by the same people. </joey>
<connor> - I'm actually hyped even though I think </connor>
<connor> I need to rewatch a little bit of Log season two. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember I fucking loved the world. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like in "Log Horizon" it's fun. </connor>
<connor> - Log, was fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - "Automata" is a fucking amazing, </connor>
<joey> like I don't know how they like fucking write stories. </joey>
<connor> - Look am glad as well- </connor>
<joey> - And all the stuff like that, it's so great. </joey>
<joey> - I'm also glad that the show </joey>
<joey> didn't like fucking blow its load like immediately- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And stop telling us everything about it. </connor>
<connor> Like I love it when the show is tease us with the words like </connor>
<connor> here's a little crumb- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Crumbling knowledge. </joey>
<joey> And then they just don't mention it for a few episodes </joey>
<garnt> and it's like, oh shit yeah, we all right now. </garnt>
<garnt> We're in a fucking video game and I forget- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we forget all that. - We're in a video game. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember "Log Horizon" </connor>
<connor> I remember watching the first two, three episodes of it, </connor>
<connor> dropped it immediately 'cause I'm just like- </connor>
<joey> - Really. </joey>
<connor> - What is this Beat a "Sword Art Online." </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like the worst I think muscle Locker Ryzen was that </connor>
<connor> one like the animation is like- </connor>
<connor> - It ain't great. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the most typical five out of 10 animation, </joey>
<connor> this is just a third way seasonal show. </connor>
<joey> And the first three or so episodes were like </joey>
<joey> the most generic kind of introduction </joey>
<connor> you could get to a world. </connor>
<connor> And it didn't start getting interesting until they properly </connor>
<connor> started explaining like the game mechanics- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And seeing the game mechanics being broken, </garnt>
<garnt> like within this world was just so fucking interesting. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that whole awkward like there was a guy </connor>
<garnt> who would killing the villages? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That was fucking cool. </connor>
<garnt> - And like we've all ready sold me immediately </garnt>
<garnt> was like when they first discovered </garnt>
<joey> that they could make things taste good. </joey>
<joey> And then they like invented the burger- </joey>
<joey> - Yes. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, yo this is really interesting. </connor>
<connor> This isn't even an easy cut </connor>
<garnt> this is just like an entrepreneur business fucking anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well that's what "Youmore show" was as well, </garnt>
<joey> was basically just like a business textbook for read. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - How the fuck do you guys remember what happens in these </connor>
<connor> like seven out of 10 shows bro? </connor>
<connor> The moment something isn't like exceptional, </connor>
<connor> I'm like that's going in the field. </connor>
<garnt> - "Log Horizon" is not a seven anime. </garnt>
<connor> - "Log Horizon" is not a seven out of 10 anime. </connor>
<connor> - "Log Horizon" is an a- </connor>
<connor> - Forget. </connor>
<connor> Like the "Maoyuu Maou" would have gone front of the fucking </connor>
<connor> cold that went straight into the let's forget everything. </connor>
<joey> - "Maoyuu Maou" show was cool because again, it was like </joey>
<joey> again it's against "Dub to Maoyuu Maou" </joey>
<joey> who's like somehow can like make you learn shit </joey>
<garnt> while reading these stories. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how he does it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I have really- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like spice able, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like spice able exactly, </garnt>
<garnt> like the reason why I love spice able </garnt>
<garnt> because like I actually learned like a proper </garnt>
<garnt> like useful business skills- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like wait a minute I'm just getting horny over this </garnt>
<garnt> what if this Wharf wife, but I'm learning- </garnt>
<garnt> - He is a marketing genius. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I'm learning things about economics, that's not legal, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not allowed, what are you doing? </garnt>
<joey> - I can't be horny and smart at the same time, </joey>
<joey> that's not how that works. </joey>
<connor> - I just feel like I have like amazing brain compression. </connor>
<connor> Like I, my brain zips- </connor>
<connor> - What does that mean? </connor>
<connor> - You know like how when you compress a file </connor>
<connor> to like lower the memory it takes up? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I do with anime immediately when I'm done. </connor>
<connor> I'm like zip that shit up, put it in storage, </connor>
<connor> forget about that thing. </connor>
<connor> And then when I rewatch shit, it's like unzipping the file, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, yeah this did happen, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Has this man like min-maxed his brain. </joey>
<connor> - I actually think I've sorted </connor>
<connor> the storage on my brain appropriately. </connor>
<garnt> - You've got a sorting algorithm literally just for anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - My fucking God. </connor>
<connor> But yes I think this is a good time to move on </connor>
<garnt> to our three by threes now. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes, there's a reason why I have my laptop up </joey>
<joey> is because we're gonna create, </joey>
<garnt> we're gonna share each other's three by three of anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<joey> - Have we explained, we have explained at the beginning, </joey>
<joey> - We've explained about three by three are. </joey>
<joey> But like to expand further on that, </joey>
<joey> I love seeing people's three by three right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I feel like a three by three is the closest thing </joey>
<connor> you get to a Rorschach test for like animate fans. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you get- </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - You got to see, 'cause like asking what </connor>
<joey> someone's favorite anime is, </joey>
<joey> is like a fucking stupid question, </joey>
<joey> because like if you've seen enough animes- </joey>
<joey> - It changes all the time. </joey>
<joey> - It changes all the fucking time, </joey>
<joey> but like we've like a kind of, </joey>
<joey> with nine animes to choose from, </joey>
<joey> that's a good sample size to really get a grasp </joey>
<connor> on what this person's taste is. </connor>
<connor> Like not all their tastes, because I don't know </connor>
<connor> how hard a time you guys had choosing nine anime. </connor>
<connor> - I just shoved through to get nine that I like. </connor>
<garnt> - But I had a pretty difficult time </garnt>
<garnt> just choosing my nine anime. </garnt>
<connor> - You have a fucking, you putting like a seizure </connor>
<connor> just thinking like what am I gonna do for like breakfast? </connor>
<connor> Like oh, my God, like Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> Like I swear, you like take so long </connor>
<connor> to contemplate decisions. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I can come up with mine pretty quickly </joey>
<joey> just because like I literally thought of the first nine, </joey>
<connor> we're gonna look at mine first. </connor>
<connor> But I literally just thought of the first nine </connor>
<connor> that I think is like, yeah I love this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I think that's the most important thing </connor>
<connor> is like, I feel if you think too hard about it, </connor>
<joey> then you will kind of reshaping your tastes. </joey>
<connor> - Thinking too much is generally a bad policy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I was like, all right what are the nine shows </joey>
<joey> that I fucking love? </joey>
<garnt> - Thinking is just a bad policy. </garnt>
<joey> - Don't think. </joey>
<connor> - I personally think is overrated, I just go with guts. </connor>
<joey> - Is that an unpopular opinion? </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna say it. </joey>
<joey> - Unpopular opinions and thinking's overrated. </joey>
<joey> - Thinking is overrated. </joey>
<joey> - All right so let's take a look at mine first. </joey>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's see what you got here Joey. </joey>
<connor> "Lucky Star" Connor yo what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> What? </joey>
<garnt> Do you wanna introduce to the audience who cannot see </garnt>
<garnt> or don't go to these shows? </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] So top row from left to right </joey>
<connor> is "Serial Experiments Lain, Palepoli." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Middle row is "Princess Mononoke," </connor>
<connor> "Lucky Star Mononoke" </connor>
<joey> And then bottom row is "Shitokayak, Automo," </joey>
<joey> "Monogatira series, Yuhacha." </joey>
<garnt> - Why, "Lucky Star?" </garnt>
<connor> I I've got to ask, man, why? </connor>
<connor> It's right bang there in the sense of- </connor>
<connor> - Starring at me. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry about placements too much. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry about placements too much. </joey>
<joey> This could be in any random order, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> Reason why, okay? </joey>
<joey> I completely get why someone would look at me </joey>
<connor> and say for bro "Lucky star" is not good. </connor>
<connor> Because truth be told </connor>
<connor> if you watch "Lucky Star" today, </connor>
<connor> it probably be sure, right? </connor>
<connor> "Lucky Star" to me is so time-sensitive </connor>
<connor> because all of its jokes are time-sensitive. </connor>
<joey> Like "Lucky Star" was one of those shows </joey>
<joey> that made fun of like "Otaku and Wieve Culture" </joey>
<joey> back in like the mid 2000s. </joey>
<joey> I'm turning this into a like video. </joey>
<garnt> - So I'll tell you a "Lucky Star" is my friend. </garnt>
<garnt> "Lucky Star" is a Reddit humor before Reddit got it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's it's like the it's like the late 2000s Reddit </garnt>
<connor> and the Reddit just didn't exist. </connor>
<connor> So I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I was just like, oh, "Lucky Star" was amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - I couldn't sit through it. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah, </joey>
<connor> I didn't finish it. </connor>
<joey> - See like, it's weird because randomly like a couple </joey>
<joey> of days ago I was just scrolling </joey>
<joey> through YouTube and all my recommended </joey>
<joey> there was just like a "Lucky Star," like funny compilation. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Fuck, I haven't </joey>
<joey> heard of "Lucky Stars." </joey>
<garnt> - I got time for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like six minutes long. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> Fuck it I've got time. </joey>
<garnt> - Like an Oxymoron to me "Lucky Star," funny compilation. </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys sucks. - Excuse me. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - But I don't know, I think it's because like especially </joey>
<joey> around the time when I watch "Lucky Star," </joey>
<joey> I was like really heavily into, </joey>
<garnt> obviously of course like animate obviously but, </garnt>
<garnt> I was really heavily like </garnt>
<garnt> the Otaku culture especially in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And "Lucky Star" kind of went over all of that shit. </garnt>
<joey> And putting it to perspective of like, </joey>
<joey> it's pretty fucking ridiculous looking </joey>
<joey> from an outsiders perspective. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just- - Meat calf is weird, huh? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, not even that. </joey>
<connor> It was just like the fucking comic cut scene. </connor>
<joey> It's still funny to this day. </joey>
<garnt> Just because it's so accurate. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean I just, I look back a lot just on, </garnt>
<garnt> I never liked it originally but I look back </garnt>
<garnt> at some of the scenes and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This doesn't age well to me at all." </garnt>
<joey> - Right, exactly and </joey>
<garnt> that's why I never recommend "Lucky Star" to people today. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it has no issue. </garnt>
<joey> The jokes are no issue. </joey>
<joey> - I have a question, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is this show in the bottom corner </joey>
<joey> have seen that sure - [Joey] Which one </joey>
<joey> the bottom left? </joey>
<joey> (speaking in a foreign language) </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] What's the English name? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Fucking, God, I don't even know. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] I think I've watched that show. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It's basically like a comedy show </joey>
<joey> that has in it a lot of itchy jokes. </joey>
<garnt> - I have watched the show. - I've watched the show </garnt>
<connor> and I don't remember anything about that. </connor>
<connor> - I 100% have watched the show. </connor>
<connor> There's this small girl, the small girl is angry </connor>
<connor> that she doesn't have big tits right? </connor>
<connor> I laughed. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's one of the jokes. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Funny. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, why is this I your three by three? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay this is in my three by three </joey>
<connor> because A, first of all, I think it's fucking hilarious. </connor>
<connor> B, it kind of encompasses my love for comedy, </connor>
<joey> and my love for Hiei. </joey>
<joey> - You're a broad term of a common years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - "Lucky Star" and the rest. </connor>
<garnt> - What encompasses your love for comedy arts? </garnt>
<garnt> What about the show it encompasses your love for comedy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's fucking hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> I mean, I don't know what else. </joey>
<joey> Wait, what the fuck answer </joey>
<joey> were you expecting? - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It's because it's very insecured and the jokes </joey>
<connor> that are constructed are very good like this, </connor>
<connor> okay the reason why I put this in is </connor>
<connor> because it encompasses my love for trashy shows. </connor>
<connor> This show is not good in any perspective. </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying it right now, all right? </connor>
<joey> This is how you know my three by three is legit, right? </joey>
<connor> - Give me some of those. </connor>
<connor> (speaking in a foreign language) </connor>
<connor> Is not a good show. </connor>
<connor> It's trashy, shitty comedy with HE jokes. </connor>
<connor> (both mumbling) </connor>
<connor> It's crap, all right? - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - And here is the reason why I put it in. </joey>
<garnt> - Important question then. </garnt>
<garnt> Every show in here, would you re-watch it today? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You would? - I would. </connor>
<connor> - You would rewatch "Lucky Star?" </connor>
<connor> - Did I not just say, </connor>
<connor> I was literally watching a compilation two days ago. </connor>
<connor> - I just know that is a lie honestly. </connor>
<connor> - I just didn't believe that. - No. </connor>
<joey> - I would a 100% rewatch all these shows here. </joey>
<garnt> - I go say, I was like I didn't put it on, </garnt>
<joey> but I was this close to putting you on the show. </joey>
<joey> (both mumbling) </joey>
<joey> - I am glad that you put it on. </joey>
<joey> - I'd put "Yu Yu Hakusho" in because it represents my love </joey>
<connor> for showing in. </connor>
<connor> - I got to be honest, right boys? </connor>
<joey> - I legitimately tried </joey>
<joey> to watch "Yu Yu Hakusho" no less than a week ago. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I put it on, first episode, </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "Fuck I can't watch this." </garnt>
<garnt> Like I thought it was the "Dab" </garnt>
<garnt> but then I was like the "Dab" was too awful. </garnt>
<garnt> I saw Japanese and fuck it's awful as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't stand this. - It talks great, </garnt>
<garnt> what are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> - The audio was driving me insane. </garnt>
<connor> Like I actually couldn't watch it. </connor>
<connor> It was such a bad faulty. </connor>
<connor> I know that it's old, but I actually couldn't sit to it. </connor>
<joey> - So basically your review of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </joey>
<joey> is where it's old. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, honestly like I feel bad </connor>
<connor> that I'm like that but I was like </connor>
<connor> "Fuck I actually can't watch this." </connor>
<connor> - Oh read the "Monger" then. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God you're really gonna hit me with that? </connor>
<garnt> - Audio problems? </garnt>
<connor> Read a book. </connor>
<connor> - What was your problem with the audios </connor>
<connor> 'cause like "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<garnt> from what I remember was one of my favorite dabs. </garnt>
<connor> - I never watched the dabs, I have no idea. </connor>
<connor> - I swear 10 seconds into the dab like fireless Japaneese </connor>
<connor> I gotta send the shit off like. </connor>
<connor> - Well seriously? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it was pretty bad. </garnt>
<connor> - Who the fuck paid Yoskay 'cause Yoskay fucking </connor>
<garnt> like killed- - I know this is probably </garnt>
<connor> just a case of watching it years later </connor>
<connor> and being spoiled for sex- </connor>
<joey> - I mean for me, I'd put "Yu Yu Hakusho" </joey>
<joey> because obviously I love my showing in. </joey>
<connor> But I feel like I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I've never felt the same level of excitement </connor>
<connor> that I felt watching and- - I wish. </connor>
<connor> - "Yu Yu Hakusho" that I have from any other- </connor>
<connor> - I'm envious, I want that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yu Yu Hakusho has some of my favorite arcs </garnt>
<joey> in all of shown in. </joey>
<joey> - The Dark Tournament arc Tuesday, </joey>
<joey> is one of the best arcs in shown in. </joey>
<garnt> - I know the Dark Tournament is the best tournament arc. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hands down. - Of all time. </garnt>
<joey> - Hands down. </joey>
<joey> - And this is a tournament arc </joey>
<joey> that came out fucking 20 years ago now. </joey>
<garnt> Like it buff the tournament genre, </garnt>
<garnt> and still is the best. </garnt>
<joey> - The reason why Tournament Hawks have become a meme, </joey>
<joey> and are so hyped is because of "Yu Yu Hakusho." </joey>
<garnt> - It's because of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </garnt>
<garnt> like "Dragon Ball" might have like popularized it, </garnt>
<connor> but then "Yu Yu Hakusho," </connor>
<connor> perfected it. - Perfected it. </connor>
<connor> - And then it hasn't been perfected since </connor>
<connor> but like- </connor>
<connor> - Well go on. </connor>
<connor> - Also like "Since We," is one of the best villains </connor>
<joey> in all of showing in as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah and "Togo" as well. </joey>
<garnt> - "Togo" as well. - Fucking "Togo" oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Such a good character. </garnt>
<joey> - Not gonna lie growing up, </joey>
<joey> I wanted to be Hiei so bad. </joey>
<joey> I was like I looked at Hiei </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like everything about this guy </joey>
<joey> is so fucking- - Is he the guy </joey>
<joey> with a black hair? - He's the guy </joey>
<joey> with black hair. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Everything about Hiei- </connor>
<connor> - Why Could I guess which one you're talking about? </connor>
<joey> - Everything about Hiei is so fucking cool. </joey>
<connor> - Is there's a "Serial Experiments Lain" at all? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's top left. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - I think because like well again, </connor>
<connor> I still think it's fucking insanely ahead of it's time. </connor>
<connor> Like this was made back in like the late 90s. </connor>
<connor> And it talks about fucking societal issues </connor>
<connor> that are relevant today. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And that's, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I think that's like a huge artist, like- </connor>
<connor> - I'm curious what kind of stuff does it talk about? </connor>
<connor> And to show what kind of society- </connor>
<joey> - So basically to grossly oversimplify, </joey>
<joey> "Serial Experiments Lain" is essentially this idea </joey>
<connor> that your digital identity, </connor>
<connor> and your real life identity, sees no barrier. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And so basically it follows obviously lane </connor>
<connor> who kind of goes through this like discovery of herself </connor>
<connor> and the world and being like, </connor>
<joey> wait, so we can create digital identities </joey>
<joey> of ourselves on the quote unquote, internet. </joey>
<joey> I mean, obviously back then it was very primal. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - All right. </garnt>
<joey> But- </joey>
<joey> - Just came out then like 1990- </joey>
<joey> - That's 98. - Eight. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just to give them the "Bloons Tower Defense." </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just before "Flash Player," right? </connor>
<connor> - Fuck. - But basically, </connor>
<connor> it's this idea that like, wait, </connor>
<garnt> so if things happen in the digital world, </garnt>
<garnt> then is there really no consequences of that </garnt>
<garnt> in the real world and- </garnt>
<garnt> - Very sensical. </garnt>
<joey> - And they did that in 12 episodes. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's, I will attest </garnt>
<garnt> that "Serial Experiments Lain" fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember I watched it </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time last year. </garnt>
<connor> So I watched it </connor>
<connor> pretty recently. - Oh, really? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Well 'cause he was on like to watch this forever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then I was just like you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm finally in the mood to watch this. </connor>
<connor> I'll give it a watch. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking man, </connor>
<connor> this normally when you see a piece of media </connor>
<connor> that focuses around technology, and like stories </connor>
<connor> around technology. - Bad. </connor>
<connor> - It ages horribly. </connor>
<connor> And I remember watching "Serial Experiments Lain" </connor>
<connor> and thinking how is this. </connor>
<connor> how does this seem like it's more relevant now </connor>
<connor> than it is- - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - When it first came out? </joey>
<joey> Over like- </joey>
<garnt> - Because this show- - Like 10, 20 years ago. </garnt>
<joey> - This show "Low Key" foretold the future of social media. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> - I think I can understand that </connor>
<connor> if you are really in touch with the internet back then, </connor>
<joey> you could probably see where it was going. </joey>
<joey> I think. - Right. </joey>
<connor> - And I think and obviously </connor>
<connor> I picked "Serial Experiments Lain" </connor>
<connor> that obviously because I love it, </connor>
<connor> but also I love I mean the shows that make you think, </connor>
<joey> quote unquote. - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That to dive more into that kind of stuff like you know, </joey>
<joey> yeah make you thonk right? </joey>
<connor> like "Ogre Proxy" is in the same field as that. </connor>
<connor> I love that show. </connor>
<connor> And you know "Rosaphone" as well was in there as well. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] And "Climate?" </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] I mean, I just think it's good in. </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<joey> It made me cry like a witch </joey>
<connor> It bought my love for mitogenic. </connor>
<connor> Bought my love for fucking- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Fooly Cooly. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Joey] Fooly Cooly. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Is just a monster piece. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I've never watched Fooly Cooly. </connor>
<connor> - It's seven episodes and it feels like </connor>
<joey> a fucking five hour long movie. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a very dense show. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Very dense. - I would say it does not- </garnt>
<connor> - Why does dense always just sound like an insult? </connor>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a dense model. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a thick show. </connor>
<connor> - What do you want to say? </connor>
<garnt> No, no, it's a it's a compact show. </garnt>
<garnt> (both mumbling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Compact are lesser than dense. </garnt>
<connor> Dense sounds like it's like brick shithouse. </connor>
<connor> Like filled with garbage. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, it's a compact show. </joey>
<connor> - Now I'm listening. </connor>
<connor> Compact? </connor>
<connor> Now I'm listening. </connor>
<connor> - There is like "Fooley Cooley" has 24, </connor>
<garnt> I would dare say 24 episodes worth of material packed </garnt>
<garnt> into seven episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would agree with that. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's one of the best soundtracks of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Soundtrack is fucking amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> - I've no more questions, you're free to go. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, okay. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<joey> You had a choice of any anime movies, </joey>
<garnt> and you pick a Ghibli movie? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, look, man, you gave it this 10 </joey>
<garnt> out of 10, was it on your list? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - And you also didn't change that school? </joey>
<garnt> - Is it a good movie? </garnt>
<garnt> Would I put it as like- </garnt>
<connor> - What anime movie is the best anime movie Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - He's gonna say "Your Name." </joey>
<garnt> - You're gonna find out when I went to- </garnt>
<joey> - Let's show it Garnt, shall we? </joey>
<joey> - Let's check out "Mine." </joey>
<connor> - Jump right into it. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's jump right into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's check out "Mine" and see see what you guys see that? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] All right Well, we can we can ignore </joey>
<connor> the filth in the middle but, honestly. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] What's that showing in the middle? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's "Oreimo." - [Garnt] It's "Oreimo." </garnt>
<garnt> Okay so let me let me let me spell out </garnt>
<garnt> my three by three. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] So from top left, going down, row by row. </garnt>
<garnt> So you got "Your Name, Bakino." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] "Fate Zero, Evangelion, Oreimo, Log Horizon, </garnt>
<garnt> One piece, Haruhi or The Disappearance, </garnt>
<garnt> and Black Lagoon." - [Connor] God this scream </garnt>
<connor> somebody's gone to anime "The Two Thousands." </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ, look at that. </connor>
<connor> (both mumbling) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Look at this. </connor>
<connor> Look at this fucking "Black Lagoon, </connor>
<joey> Evangelion and Haruhi" on the scene. </joey>
<joey> Fucking get out of here. </joey>
<connor> - Not gonna lie, I was not expecting "Black Lagoon" </connor>
<connor> to be there. </connor>
<connor> - I could see it. - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so- - There's nothing like it. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard anything </connor>
<connor> about "Black Lagoon" coming from Garnt's mouth. </connor>
<connor> - It's fucking good. - No, it's great. </connor>
<joey> I'm just I'm just curious why Garnt likes it. </joey>
<connor> - I watch the anime don't review on it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucking brilliant, it's one of the shows </garnt>
<connor> that I haven't had too much of a chance to talk about. </connor>
<garnt> But like before I get into that, </garnt>
<garnt> let me tell you the thought process </garnt>
<garnt> that I (coughing). </garnt>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me tell the- - Too much emotion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me tell you the thought process </garnt>
<connor> I put into like picking these. </connor>
<connor> - Tell me of your </connor>
<connor> process Garnt. - [Joey] Go on. </connor>
<connor> - Because I you know at the beginning, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "How the fuck do I pick my favorites?' </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I have like too many favorites </connor>
<connor> that I can talk about, right? </connor>
<connor> So then I thought okay, </connor>
<connor> here's a big thing. </connor>
<connor> What if I just picked the anime that I have rewatched? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - [Joey] All right, all right. </connor>
<connor> - Because if I've rewatched something, </connor>
<connor> and this is like rewatching not for my job, </connor>
<connor> but rewatching for my own enjoyment. </connor>
<connor> If I've rewatched something, </connor>
<joey> that means there is something fucking special </joey>
<joey> about that show that has stuck with me </joey>
<joey> that I've felt like I've wanted to go out of my way </joey>
<joey> to re-experience that. </joey>
<connor> - I agree with that, I agree qith that. </connor>
<connor> - And even even on some shows that I think is fucking great. </connor>
<connor> Like, for example, like stuff like "Monster" </connor>
<connor> or like clearly critically acclaimed shows. </connor>
<connor> - I do not want to rewatch more of those. </connor>
<connor> - No, no exactly. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's had its time in the sun. </connor>
<connor> But in terms of like, what I truly like enjoyed to the cool. </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't go out at the moment, </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't go out and rewatch "Monster." </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't do that but. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay hold on, but I get that right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'm looking at this right now being like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah, rewatch that, rewatch that." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Would you rewatch one piece? </joey>
<garnt> - I have rewatched one piece. </garnt>
<joey> - Is it even possible to rewatch one piece? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, I've okay, here's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh man you got that Steins Gate time machine </connor>
<connor> or some shit, Garnt how are you doing that? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, I've watched one piece basically up </garnt>
<garnt> to "The Time Skip" all the way once. </garnt>
<joey> And then I've rewatched it again once. </joey>
<joey> And then I've rewatched some my favorite arcs multiple time. </joey>
<joey> I fucking know it is. </joey>
<joey> And this was back when I had time to watch anime. </joey>
<garnt> And I would just like whenever I got, </garnt>
<joey> whenever I had time- </joey>
<garnt> - When you said rewatched right? </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you were talking about like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, I've rewatched "The Water Seven Article, </connor>
<connor> I've rewatched Alabasta." </connor>
<joey> I didn't think you really watched those. </joey>
<connor> - You really shown your age, </connor>
<connor> you need years to rewatch that. </connor>
<joey> No wonder you're older than me like fuck me, </joey>
<joey> you need like 10 years. </joey>
<joey> - I love how you compensate and be like no, no, </joey>
<connor> only up until before the time skip. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like it's still like 400 episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why like I was having trouble putting </garnt>
<garnt> a show in on 'cause I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> is show in that I actually truly love, </garnt>
<garnt> that I would you know, </garnt>
<connor> think that I would go back and design </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was gonna put "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<connor> And I was thinking. </connor>
<connor> - Not "Seven Deadly Sins," Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay. </connor>
<joey> You know my love for "Seven Deadly Sins" right? </joey>
<joey> But like one piece to me will go down when it finishes. </joey>
<joey> Will go down as well. </joey>
<joey> It already is one </joey>
<joey> of the greatest anime/ manga series of all times. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - But to me when I think back, </joey>
<connor> and I think back because one piece isn't the perfect show. </connor>
<connor> Right, yeah, I rewatch one piece so- </connor>
<connor> - No, does anyone claim it is? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like everyone forgets about the laws of one piece, </connor>
<connor> where everyone forgets about the fucking- </connor>
<connor> - "Sky Island." </connor>
<joey> - "Sky Island," I wasn't a fan of the "Foxy Ark," </joey>
<joey> which was a filler "Cannon Ark" </joey>
<garnt> that everyone doesn't talk about. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - What does that mean (mumbles). </connor>
<connor> - "Dressrosa" was was like, </connor>
<connor> it was way too long. - Way too long. </connor>
<garnt> - It was dragged out to shit, </garnt>
<garnt> but nothing in my opinion can touch the highs </garnt>
<garnt> of "One Piece." </garnt>
<garnt> When "One Piece" is at its best, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I think it is the greatest thing you can find on anime. </garnt>
<joey> - I will stand by and say, </joey>
<connor> even though I've watched every mitogen anime. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I've cried more times watching "One piece" </joey>
<connor> than any other show. </connor>
<connor> - When you have that many episodes. </connor>
<connor> Something's gonna hit right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Like fuck me. </connor>
<joey> - This is that I wasn't expecting. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like there's plenty of shows </garnt>
<garnt> that have a lot of episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> And haven't had the highs that "One Piece" has </garnt>
<connor> because- </connor>
<joey> - I know as I said man has some- (laughter drains speech) </joey>
<joey> - How do you know anything about such? </joey>
<connor> - Pokemon has some pretty high highs man. </connor>
<connor> - Well like what I find amazing </connor>
<joey> about "One Piece" it's been going on </joey>
<joey> for like, what 20 years now? </joey>
<joey> - Almost 30. </joey>
<joey> - Almost like, I can't remember when it's like. </joey>
<joey> I think it started in- - 96. </joey>
<joey> - 98 or 96 something like that. </joey>
<joey> But I remember I've just caught up with the manga </joey>
<joey> with like, what the one oak </joey>
<joey> which is now one of the longest oaks. </joey>
<joey> It's so long that has three parts . </joey>
<joey> And it still has moments that make me feel fucking magical. </joey>
<garnt> This is like one piece is like I watched some </garnt>
<garnt> of the best moments in "One Piece" </garnt>
<garnt> and I get reminded this is why I fucking love anime. </garnt>
<garnt> This is why I love fucking love manga . </garnt>
<garnt> This is why I love this medium. </garnt>
<connor> - Did the author of "One Piece" </connor>
<connor> like intend for it to be as long as it is </connor>
<connor> or just like fucking just popularized? </connor>
<garnt> - I think he had planned </garnt>
<garnt> because the thing about "One Piece" is that it's this long. </garnt>
<joey> And yet there is this foreshadowing slap </joey>
<joey> that's happened like fucking hundreds of chapters. </joey>
<joey> - He's not from this planet. </joey>
<joey> - That is being explored now, right? </joey>
<joey> And I think he didn't expect it to be this long. </joey>
<garnt> But he but when he got popular, </garnt>
<garnt> he realized he can explore basically every idea here </garnt>
<joey> that he wanted. </joey>
<garnt> - A lot of people, I feel kind of undermine Oda, </garnt>
<connor> just because it's like, oh yeah, you know, </connor>
<connor> he made one piece but whatever. </connor>
<connor> It's so long blah blah blah. </connor>
<joey> But I think people when you look deeply into it, </joey>
<joey> people really undermine his skill for storytelling </joey>
<connor> because I mean again- </connor>
<joey> - Let's be honest, you have </joey>
<connor> to be held accountable like captivated- </connor>
<joey> - He's been number one on "Shonen Jump" </joey>
<joey> for the past like 15 years. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you don't do that by luck. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not luck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unlike what I find amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> it's been going on this long and it's not one, </garnt>
<garnt> no it's not only still got fucking amazing moments in it, </garnt>
<garnt> even when some of the greatest </garnt>
<garnt> in some of the latest chapters </garnt>
<garnt> and some of the latest moments. </garnt>
<garnt> But to no matter how far you go into "One Piece," </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like there's still an upswing. </garnt>
<garnt> You still feel like he hasn't peaked yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Unlike how would you write a story </garnt>
<garnt> that's like almost a 1000 chapters long </garnt>
<garnt> and you still think man there's an upswing coming. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something great upcoming. </garnt>
<joey> - It's insane every time a new arc started. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I would keep up to date </connor>
<connor> with like what the manga was saying. </connor>
<connor> Everyone would be like, </connor>
<connor> how is it that the next arc is even better? </connor>
<connor> How does it keep getting better? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah how- </joey>
<connor> - I thought this was the peak of "One Piece" </connor>
<joey> and then it just keeps getting there. </joey>
<connor> - How's the hotdog stand arc, keep just blowing me away? </connor>
<garnt> How does the waterpocket venture supreme arc, </garnt>
<garnt> keep blowing me away? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah re- </garnt>
<connor> - And the name doesn't make fucking sense to me? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no it is literally that proZD video </connor>
<connor> where it talks about anime arc names. </connor>
<connor> Unlike any "One Piece" fan who's watched that video knows </connor>
<connor> that he's just calling out "One Piece" fans there </connor>
<connor> because we were literally talking about this video </connor>
<connor> before the podcast started. </connor>
<connor> And we were just, me and Joey we were just talking </connor>
<connor> about "The Big Mamak." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And then Connie </connor>
<joey> was just like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wait. </joey>
<connor> - That's a real arc, are you guys serious? </connor>
<connor> - I thought they were joking. </connor>
<joey> They were just like a big momma's house or something. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was just a joke. </joey>
<connor> - But I felt that right? </connor>
<garnt> I remember when I've watched the "Alabaster Rock" </garnt>
<garnt> in one case, I was like </garnt>
<garnt> this is the greatest thing ever made. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then "Water Seven Came" out was like, </garnt>
<garnt> how it getting better? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then the "White Beard Rock" came in. </garnt>
<joey> - "White Beard Rock" was just like oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - Guys, guys guys, I hate to rush you Garnet, </connor>
<garnt> we have nine anime to talk about. </garnt>
<garnt> So come on. - I don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> I can talk about one until the fucking </garnt>
<garnt> sun goes down. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] 'Cause frankly I don't really wanna hear </garnt>
<garnt> your opinions on this. </garnt>
<joey> I honestly do not know about it, even galieon- </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] I already know your opinions on "Eva," </connor>
<joey> I already know your opinions on "Your Name," </joey>
<connor> I already know your opinions "On Fate." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Back in there was like saying I like "Coming." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Back in there I was like I like "Six" </connor>
<garnt> of course you do. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's just fun, it's just fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And then we've gushed </garnt>
<connor> over "Hierarchy" obviously like disappearance </connor>
<joey> is fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> - "Motorizing as well very excited to see that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like I was thinking back to </garnt>
<garnt> because obviously I'm the fucking Issa Kai man, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I was thinking like, "Log Horizon" </garnt>
<garnt> is the Issa Kai come back to </garnt>
<garnt> because it's the only Issa Kai I've rewatched. </garnt>
<garnt> Out of everything like "Reasonable" I watch </garnt>
<connor> because it was my job. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I thought that was literally the only reason </connor>
<connor> I watched "Re:Zero." </connor>
<connor> "Log Horizon" is the only Issa Kai I've come back </connor>
<connor> to be like, man that was some good fucking moments </connor>
<connor> in this and I really wanted to re-experience some </connor>
<connor> of these ideas that. </connor>
<joey> - Well season three is out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm probably gonna rewatch- </joey>
<joey> - I think now, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, it's out this season. </joey>
<joey> So I'm probably gonna re like, </joey>
<joey> "Log Horizon" is the only like pure Isa Kai right now </joey>
<joey> that I can like recommend without it's got no catch. </joey>
<connor> Like it's not like "Re:Zero" </connor>
<connor> where it's like oh it's so time loop catch you know </connor>
<connor> that's the interesting thing about "Log Horizon" is just- </connor>
<connor> - Hey guys, hey guys. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's a gimmick. </connor>
<connor> - "Log Hhorizon" is just an Issa Kai </connor>
<connor> that is just like good Issa Kai. </connor>
<joey> - No, I agree. - I agree. </joey>
<connor> I agree, it deserves to be a it has its place. </connor>
<joey> - I just can't get over the fact </joey>
<joey> that you on ironically like "Arima" </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - I just like it for the longest time I'm like- </joey>
<joey> - What is "Arima or bound?" </joey>
<joey> I thought it was like </joey>
<joey> the child bound. - Incest. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, that's it, all right. </connor>
<connor> - It's not about incest. </connor>
<joey> It is about insects. - It is about incest. </joey>
<joey> - Incest just happens in it. </joey>
<garnt> (both mumbling) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a difference between the two Mr. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is about incest and Beskow getting cocked. </garnt>
<connor> That's what that's all about. </connor>
<joey> - You can't just say there is incest in it. </joey>
<joey> Like it's like a sense of of flavor. </joey>
<joey> You can't just drop that in there and be like, </joey>
<connor> oh, there's also like, What? </connor>
<connor> What do you mean is this a small thing incest to you? </connor>
<garnt> - It is something okay, so let me- </garnt>
<connor> - Defend incest 4k edition. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm a fucking doer man, I'm a fucking doer. </garnt>
<connor> I don't care if this like watch this get me counseled </connor>
<connor> in like four years or like fuck four years. </connor>
<connor> Watch this clip in 40 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Get counts it like one month, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Okay, everyone forgets that "Oreimo" </connor>
<joey> was a legitimately good fucking show, </joey>
<joey> when it first aired. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna have to stop you right there. </joey>
<joey> - It was a good show. - I'm gonna have </joey>
<joey> to stop you right there. </joey>
<joey> - Like everyone thinks I put "Oreimo" </joey>
<joey> on the same level or something like "Eromanga Sensei." </joey>
<joey> No fucking "Eromanga Sensei" was trashed from episode one. </joey>
<joey> And it knew it was trash. </joey>
<joey> And "Eromanga Sensei is what happens </joey>
<joey> when you take all the trashiest parts of "Oreimo" </joey>
<connor> and put that and put that into a show. </connor>
<connor> "Oreimo" was a nice, wholesome look at Otaku culture. </connor>
<connor> - With incest. </connor>
<connor> - And the thing is when it was airing, </connor>
<connor> everyone was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah, this is this is a parody </connor>
<connor> of all like the incest light novels </connor>
<garnt> and everything like that," right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was about a parody. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone thought that he was just taking the piss </garnt>
<garnt> out of like, you know, this, </garnt>
<garnt> the little girl Emoto fucking craze happening </garnt>
<garnt> in anime on line. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you don't watch the final three episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> you can watch the entire series of series of "Oreimo" </garnt>
<garnt> and just think that. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the final three episodes happened and it- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That has sparked an outcry I didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's sparked an outcry right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's definitely because </garnt>
<garnt> the reason the reason it sparked an outcry was </garnt>
<garnt> because no one was actually expecting it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it went from like, 20% incest to 99% . </joey>
<joey> - It was 100% . - It was 100%. </joey>
<garnt> - It was a 100 there was no percentage </garnt>
<connor> that could be shaved off. </connor>
<connor> It went full incest </connor>
<connor> and it was unapologetic person. </connor>
<garnt> - So fully admit that it would full incest. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yet it's in your top nine anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Because the reason it's okay. </garnt>
<connor> I have re watched it because it is- </connor>
<connor> - You've rewatched it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I've already said I've rewatched everything on this list. </connor>
<connor> - How do you? - I don't even want to see it. </connor>
<connor> - Because this show, </connor>
<garnt> like this show is the epitome of everything I love </garnt>
<garnt> about trashy Eromanga and anime. </garnt>
<garnt> It's- - When you say that </garnt>
<joey> it just sounds like satire. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean, it sounds like satire. </joey>
<joey> - It is not, it is not. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so remember when you went through my anime list, </joey>
<joey> and I gave "Iketose" a two? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like, back when I was a teenager, </joey>
<connor> I was just like yo- </connor>
<connor> - You couldn't have real interest. </connor>
<connor> - Yo, yo, I'm better than this fan service shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm better than this trashy anime. </connor>
<connor> I got a good fucking taste. </connor>
<connor> This is the show that fucking changed all that. </connor>
<joey> When I was just like, why am I enjoying this so much? </joey>
<joey> Why do I like this fucking filth trash show? </joey>
<joey> - I mean look, I have shows like that. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, "The Kisses" </joey>
<garnt> being a perfect example. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't put it in my fucking three by three though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, this buddy is putting incest </joey>
<garnt> in his fucking top nine, Joey. </garnt>
<connor> - In the middle of all places. </connor>
<connor> - That was a legitimate deliberate choice. </connor>
<connor> I put it in the middle because I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> this is this show. </garnt>
<garnt> This single show has probably </garnt>
<garnt> had the biggest overall effects </garnt>
<garnt> on my taste in modern anime. </garnt>
<joey> - You literally fucking made "Oriema" </joey>
<joey> out to be like the free space in a bingo card. </joey>
<garnt> You know what I mean, it's just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I fucking did it and because it is yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> it is a fucking trashy anime, right? </garnt>
<garnt> There are trash moments there but, </garnt>
<connor> I think I will defend the point. </connor>
<connor> That "Oriemo" wasn't complete trash. </connor>
<connor> There was some legitimately good heartwarming moments </connor>
<connor> in there and it wasn't complete. </connor>
<connor> It wasn't all trash, okay? </connor>
<connor> It was it wasn't </connor>
<garnt> an "Eromanga Sensei" - It really was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't "Eromanga Sensei" </garnt>
<connor> - Just saying, you're going to jail buddy. </connor>
<joey> - "Eromanga Sensei" is already EMA rescanned. </joey>
<joey> That's all it is and you have to admit to that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I don't. </garnt>
<joey> - You have to admit to it. </joey>
<joey> - "Eromanga Sensei" is the trashiest plus </joey>
<garnt> of "Oreimo" concentrated it is dense "Oreimo." </garnt>
<connor> - Your Honor, I didn't know she was 12, </connor>
<connor> I'll be honest, Your Honor. </connor>
<joey> - Ladies and gentlemen this man has the largest anime </joey>
<connor> YouTube channel on the platform, </connor>
<connor> that this is what he's saying. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm fucking proud of this shit, I put it. </garnt>
<connor> I literally put this stuff front and center, </connor>
<connor> and I regret nothing. </connor>
<garnt> I regret fucking nothing </garnt>
<garnt> - That is on my computer now, </garnt>
<connor> and I can't wait to use it as blackmail. </connor>
<connor> - All right, let's check corners. </connor>
<joey> - Gentlemen, gentlemen, here's my nine. </joey>
<connor> My arguably the strongest nine we've had today. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, you want to go from top left to bottom? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] So, "Hunter Hunter, Golden time, </connor>
<connor> Bow Corrado, Ping Pong Animation , </connor>
<connor> Sakamoto, Kaiji Mob Psycho 100, But on a Fish </connor>
<connor> and Jojo." </connor>
<garnt> - I'll tell you what this is. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the guys, I have good tastes in animi. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lick off. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just about to say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro isn't it good? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Like how? </connor>
<garnt> - Guys you wanna know what personality I have? </garnt>
<joey> Absolutely no fucking personality. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sorry that I don't like incest Garnt, </connor>
<joey> is that what you wanna see on my list? </joey>
<joey> Where is the lack of incest? </joey>
<joey> - This is the I cite my sources in my video essay. </joey>
<joey> Like levels of like animatates, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> No bro, these are legitimately. </joey>
<connor> If I had to use a name like the top nine shows </connor>
<connor> that I have and like a little bit of variation genre. </connor>
<connor> This would be it? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, because I looked at this list </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, yeah this is what my nine </garnt>
<connor> by nine would be, if I literally went </connor>
<connor> through my like modern Mao </connor>
<garnt> and just pick the top highest rated anime on that mount. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm trying to tell you my fucking tastes in anime Garnt, </connor>
<connor> and this is my taste. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sorry that's its too normy for you guys. </joey>
<joey> - This is no no, no, it's not even normy. </joey>
<joey> It's just it's try hot. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, it's legit. - That is what it feels like. </joey>
<connor> - This is legit my favorite nine shows. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, well I mean, obviously we don't have </joey>
<connor> hold on to get fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] We've talked about "Golden Time." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] "Golden Time" is like my favorite </connor>
<connor> like "Volcarona." - [Joey] We talked </connor>
<connor> about "Volcarona." - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] "Ping Pong." - [Connor] I fucking </connor>
<connor> love "Ping Pong." - [Joey] Can you still </connor>
<joey> like "Ping Pong?" </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] 100% right. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I love "Ping Pong." </joey>
<joey> - "Ping Pong," right? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Other than like mob, okay, </joey>
<connor> that's also why I love them all for the similar reasons. </connor>
<connor> Like "Ping Pong" is like one of the only animators right? </connor>
<connor> You get all these fucking stupid animates </connor>
<joey> when the guys Opie is fuck. </joey>
<connor> Like it no one fucking gives a shit right? </connor>
<connor> Like, okay, wow, Kyoto is a giant dick again, right? </connor>
<joey> Cool, we have another Isa Kai. </joey>
<joey> Oh, that overpowered . </joey>
<connor> Oh, they have an ability that's unique to them. </connor>
<connor> You know what real life sucks, man. </connor>
<connor> No one has a unique ability. </connor>
<connor> And I've really liked there's a fucking anime that was like, </connor>
<connor> bro, life kind of sucks, man. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes people just gonna be better at things </connor>
<connor> that that you love, even if they hate it. </connor>
<connor> That's was so real and hurt man. </connor>
<connor> It hurt because I've been on both sides </connor>
<connor> of the "Ping Pong" like animation, like the characters. </connor>
<connor> I've been talented at something that I fucking hated. </connor>
<connor> And I felt bad for people who really wanted </connor>
<connor> to be good at that thing that I was good at. </connor>
<connor> And I've also tried my fucking hardest at something, </connor>
<connor> and you speak Japanese fluently above. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, I've been on both sides of the spectrum </connor>
<connor> of things on the animation. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, I'm kidding now, but I mean really. </connor>
<connor> - "Ping Pong." </connor>
<garnt> What I call what I call "Ping Pong", </garnt>
<garnt> it's a life anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it hurt because I was like, fuck, </connor>
<connor> you really had to like pull that out of me. </connor>
<connor> That made me a little like goddamn okay. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, then I'm curious. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen a "March Comes in Like a Lion?" </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Okay 'cause I think if you love "Ping Pong," </connor>
<connor> you would love- - Everyone has told me that. </connor>
<connor> - Because "March Comes in Like a Lion" </connor>
<connor> is the complete opposite. </connor>
<connor> "March Comes in Like a Lion" is about a genius </connor>
<connor> who can't understand the idea of losing. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> But that in itself, </connor>
<connor> is what's causing him to lose in real life. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's literally the opposite of "Ping Pong." </connor>
<connor> - That just like school when they're like, </connor>
<joey> you're a gifted child </joey>
<connor> and they can't fucking do anything later on. </connor>
<joey> - Right, exactly. </joey>
<joey> I mean, and obviously like- </joey>
<garnt> - Well I wanna know, why why "Sakamoto" three? </garnt>
<garnt> (both mumbling) </garnt>
<connor> Why is that a top nine anime? </connor>
<connor> - That's so fucking funny man, that's shit- </connor>
<joey> - I'm about to stand with my boy here, </joey>
<joey> like "Sakamoto" is fucking hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - "Sakamoto" is one of the funniest animes- </connor>
<joey> - "Sakamoto" is so good. </joey>
<joey> - It's so fun. - It's so funny. </joey>
<joey> - You can put that shit on, </joey>
<connor> it's like the "Mr. Bean" of anime. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's like the "Mr. Bean" of anime, </joey>
<connor> if "Mr. Bean" was like a fucking like a millionaire </connor>
<connor> who was pocking any where. </connor>
<connor> - Shit so, you really got to diss me </connor>
<connor> when you just like what like yeah. </connor>
<connor> "Pedophilia, "Brotherly Love." </connor>
<joey> - Okay here is what I understand though. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - Every three by three right? </joey>
<connor> As we've established so far, </connor>
<joey> and every three by three I've seen back when it was big </joey>
<connor> has at least one show that shit. </connor>
<connor> Like universally, right? </connor>
<connor> I think all these shows are fucking fantastic. </connor>
<joey> Which is why I just press X to doubt. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't like shit shows Joey. </joey>
<connor> Which do you want to put like "My Whole Demon" </connor>
<connor> or some shit missing still. </connor>
<connor> This thing was made as fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, like, </joey>
<joey> you don't have like it. </joey>
<joey> Do you have a guilty pleasure anime? </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, no, no, really? </connor>
<connor> - I don't really watch anime ever. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wow, the grand reveal? </connor>
<connor> - I frankly, I've revealed this before. </connor>
<connor> I never fucking want to re watch anime, right. </connor>
<joey> - So you wouldn't re watch any of these? </joey>
<joey> - No. - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Why would I rewatch that I've already watched? </connor>
<joey> - Because it's great. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause do you don't want to re-experience it? </connor>
<connor> - Not really. </connor>
<connor> I'll be honest with you, </connor>
<garnt> I'd rather experience something different. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there's no like you will rewatch? </garnt>
<connor> - Like have you never gotten to the point right? </connor>
<garnt> Where you're just tired of trying something new. </garnt>
<garnt> And because no, no, you're you're tired </garnt>
<garnt> of trying something new. (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Why do you make it sound so sad? </connor>
<garnt> I'm just tired of trying. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna go back this. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it's fun. </connor>
<connor> - Because sometimes you try something new </connor>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Man this just ain't doing it for me." </garnt>
<garnt> You just want something. </garnt>
<garnt> - You want something that's it's comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know for me that feels sad. </connor>
<connor> It feels like you're trying </connor>
<connor> to capture something that's gone in your life. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean, I don't know it feel sad to me. </connor>
<joey> - I'm in this photo and I don't like it. </joey>
<connor> - Like I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like it's chasing something </connor>
<joey> that doesn't exist anymore in my mind. </joey>
<joey> - Why is Maylene laughing at me? </joey>
<joey> - Because in my mind, right? </joey>
<connor> I could I could easily I watch like "Sakamoto." </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't have rewatched any of these? </joey>
<garnt> Yes. </garnt>
<connor> Would I willingly do it of my own free will? </connor>
<connor> No. </connor>
<garnt> - Not because like to bring it the other way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like for me watching new shows is me chasing that high. </garnt>
<garnt> That that is me chasing that high </garnt>
<garnt> that I felt with the shows I've already liked. </garnt>
<garnt> But the more anime you watch, </garnt>
<connor> and just the older you fucking get </connor>
<garnt> that just gets harder and harder. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why I don't watch my channel anymore. </connor>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - That's the thing inside reveal of this video. </joey>
<joey> Connor doesn't watch anime. </joey>
<connor> - No I do, I watch anime I just don't enjoy it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean look, honestly like </joey>
<connor> I feeling sauce about this three by three. </connor>
<connor> Just because again because all nine of these shows </connor>
<connor> are like universally praised. </connor>
<connor> - All is "Golden Time" universally praised? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, "Golden Time" is fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> - I like "Golden Time." </connor>
<joey> - I felt it was trash. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking love "Golden Time." </connor>
<connor> - "Golden Time" took everything for- </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was trash and I liked it, </connor>
<connor> but it was trash. </connor>
<connor> - No "Golden Time" took everything "Toradora" did </connor>
<connor> and just perfected it. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would literally it's like if you like in my mind, </connor>
<connor> it's like my two favorite like romance or whatever like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "Todora and "Golden Time" but "Golden Time" </connor>
<connor> felt like the better version. </connor>
<garnt> - "Golden Time" is my favorite romance of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> I would think and yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought he doesn't like "Golden Time." </connor>
<joey> I love "Golden Time." - Okay shit, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I've met less people </joey>
<garnt> who say they didn't like "Golden Time." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Really? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like the thing about "Golden Time" </joey>
<joey> is that you know there were flaws </joey>
<connor> because who the fuck like binary as a character? </connor>
<connor> Let's be honest. </connor>
<connor> Like talking about compressing your memory. </connor>
<connor> Like I've only just remembered </connor>
<connor> that ghost boundary was a thing. </connor>
<connor> And that was just something I've just like </connor>
<connor> that was like sports. </connor>
<connor> In this like amazing series </connor>
<connor> that's I seem to remember "Golden Time." </connor>
<connor> But like I think that's "Golden Time." </connor>
<connor> I just think this is how adult romance should be. </connor>
<connor> This took everything that was good, </connor>
<connor> as you said about "Toradora" </connor>
<connor> and just made it better, perfected it. </connor>
<connor> Put it in university, </connor>
<garnt> didn't make it like just this high school romance. </garnt>
<garnt> Had enough adult elements that- </garnt>
<joey> - Didn't have an annoying us fucking lowly younger- </joey>
<connor> - True that was really fucking annoying. </connor>
<connor> I love "Kajou" the against the "Gambler" that was- </connor>
<joey> - "Kajou" is fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - "Kajou" is great. </joey>
<joey> - Whatever shows it's sad that no one gives a chance </joey>
<joey> but it also weird that it's only in 720P. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yes. </connor>
<connor> - That's really fucking weird, </connor>
<garnt> no for ATP I think or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that was never released- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah it isn't for ATP. </garnt>
<garnt> - It isn't for ATP </garnt>
<connor> And it's such a shame 'cause like it's such </connor>
<connor> a fucking good show. </connor>
<joey> But it was either that or like "One Outs," </joey>
<joey> I really fucking like "One Outs." </joey>
<joey> - "One Outs" is fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - "One Outs" is fucking dope, I mean, </joey>
<joey> I don't know like this, </joey>
<connor> I mean I guess it looks very basic from the outside looking. </connor>
<joey> - It's not basic, it's not basic. </joey>
<joey> - It's not basic in the sense where- </joey>
<connor> - I just thought we were putting on nine favorite shows. </connor>
<joey> Like oh like- </joey>
<connor> - No, no we were, </connor>
<joey> but what we're saying is that like </joey>
<joey> there isn't a single guilty pleasure animate here. </joey>
<connor> Because obviously- </connor>
<joey> - Refers to guilty pleasure anime, </joey>
<joey> well I can show you those bad. </joey>
<joey> "Oreamo" that's more than a guilty pleasure, </joey>
<joey> that's a criminal pleasure Joey I think. </joey>
<connor> - A guilty pleasure, in my opinion a guilty pleasure </connor>
<joey> is a show that you love no matter what </joey>
<joey> even though you know it is shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yep, okay, but then I when I was making this nine by nine, </connor>
<connor> looks like "Deadman Wonderland." </connor>
<connor> I loved "Deadman Wonderland" </connor>
<connor> I never finished and it was you know, </connor>
<garnt> it was kind of a mess of it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I don't think it's better than any </garnt>
<connor> of these shows for me personally. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I've talked to you </garnt>
<connor> and I know what your tastes are basically. </connor>
<connor> - You're trying to call me out? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I don't really see that represented here </garnt>
<garnt> because I know like- </garnt>
<connor> - You my tastes like you know me Garnt, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - I mean like you only hunging out for a couple weeks. </connor>
<joey> - Are you calling me a liar? </joey>
<garnt> Are you calling me a liar Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> - We hardly see each other everyday. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, like I know you love like fucking hot, </garnt>
<garnt> cold brutal shows like "Jojo, Baqi, Gantz:e." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised I thought "Baqi" was gonna be there. </joey>
<joey> - I thought "Baqi" was gonna be up there as well. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I love "Baqi" as like 'cause there's </joey>
<connor> a few episodes in "Baqi" the anime but it's like mate. </connor>
<connor> But there's just so many fucking funny moments </connor>
<connor> that like it'll stand to me forever. </connor>
<garnt> - Here's the best way I can do this. </garnt>
<garnt> I know you like Chad shows. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the best way- - I like a Chad show. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the best way can describe Connor's taste, okay? </joey>
<connor> Like it's just got Chad characters in it, </connor>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Chad characters. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I really want Conner </joey>
<connor> to watch or read "Face the North" stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - 'Cause I know </connor>
<joey> you would fucking love that. </joey>
<joey> - I like the right amount of chat. </joey>
<joey> If there's just too much chat, </joey>
<connor> sometimes a little too much. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean, you like "Jojo" </joey>
<connor> that's like a hall of a chat. </connor>
<connor> - That's a different, that's a different kind of chat. </connor>
<connor> "Jojo"is like the build different anime. </connor>
<connor> Like that is on own league like Garnt has said. </connor>
<connor> I think God should be treated as anime, </connor>
<connor> It's a lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's an artwork. </connor>
<joey> - But like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> like in "Facing the North Star," </joey>
<joey> when I see that I really find that appealing </joey>
<connor> because they're just like too match show. </connor>
<connor> I want a bit of weakness to the character, right? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if you've read it, </joey>
<connor> you'll know every character is weak as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Read it? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, fine, fine. Fine. </connor>
<joey> - I think you should read it, you'll love it. </joey>
<joey> - It pisses me off when I'm watching an anime, </joey>
<joey> and the main character is like a wimp beyond comprehension </joey>
<joey> and just causes any problems himself because he's a wimp. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, listen, we'll get to do what you say no, </joey>
<joey> ,and you wouldn't have been dragged off </joey>
<joey> to a call or something- </joey>
<joey> - Are you talking about "Daycare?" </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, something else. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of shows </joey>
<connor> where I'm just like this literally could have been avoided </connor>
<connor> if you just like stopped yourself right </connor>
<connor> from seconds like this whole problem, you know? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know ma like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not satisfied. - I have a good taste? </connor>
<joey> - I'm not satisfied with you. </joey>
<connor> - Will offer me? </connor>
<connor> Will you offer me? </connor>
<connor> - Just some shit. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean like- </connor>
<joey> - Are you're expecting me to have shit taste? </joey>
<connor> - This is like too polished. </connor>
<garnt> - I have good taste, what can I say? </garnt>
<connor> - I can I can make a better one three by three. </connor>
<connor> - Go on, make my three by three for me. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay it would be like I said it would be, </garnt>
<garnt> "Jojo, Baqi," </garnt>
<garnt> - "Baqi," yes I love "Baqi" </garnt>
<connor> but it's not in my top nine shows. </connor>
<garnt> - But you talked about it so often. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I love it but </garnt>
<connor> but it's I wouldn't put it higher than any of these </connor>
<connor> for enjoyment in my mind. </connor>
<connor> - But like it's it's okay because- </connor>
<connor> - Show that I love and shows that I want to talk about, </connor>
<connor> are like different I guess. </connor>
<garnt> But it's okay like this is like getting like it like- </garnt>
<connor> - I guess that we should have defined </connor>
<garnt> the rules more appropriately. </garnt>
<connor> It should be like Connor, give me the nine shows </connor>
<connor> that you think about, keep you up at night. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well you didn't tell me you said put </garnt>
<connor> your nine favorite shows that represent you. </connor>
<joey> - What like, What I don't understand is you say </joey>
<joey> that like the shows I talk about, </joey>
<joey> and it shows I like I'm not the same. </joey>
<connor> Why would you talk about a show if it's not your favorite? </connor>
<connor> - There's some shows just like well, "Ping Pong" right? </connor>
<connor> It's all of it is encaptured in the show. </connor>
<connor> There's nothing more to add on but you fucking watch it. </connor>
<connor> Like like it's amazing, I fucking love it and watch it. </connor>
<garnt> I can't improve it. - No buddy. </garnt>
<garnt> - By talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the exact point right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you sometimes you see a good show </garnt>
<joey> and you like fuck me, that was a good show. </joey>
<joey> - Like I'd like- </joey>
<joey> - I didn't talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, but sometimes you watch a show </joey>
<connor> and you're like, man, this is sticking with me. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> This is- </connor>
<connor> - Like "Ping Pong" stuck with me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, though I'm not saying </connor>
<connor> "Ping Pong" shouldn't be on this. </connor>
<garnt> - What shouldn't be on this? </garnt>
<connor> - "Hunter Hunter?" </connor>
<connor> - Bro, five dude. </connor>
<connor> "Hunter Hunter" through that shit move me man. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know man. </connor>
<garnt> - I see you talking more about "Pokey" than "Hunter Hunter." </garnt>
<connor> - That's because, okay let's be honest, right? </connor>
<joey> - "Mob Psycho: and "Hunter Hunter," </joey>
<garnt> I rarely hear you talking about. </garnt>
<connor> - I never had talking about this at all. </connor>
<joey> - Okay I talk about "One Punch" more than talk </joey>
<joey> about "Mob Psycho." </joey>
<joey> - Right, why did "One Punch make it there?" </joey>
<joey> - Because I think "Mob Psycho" is a better show </joey>
<joey> than "One Punch" man. </joey>
<joey> - Well then why wouldn't you talk about "Mob Psycho" </joey>
<joey> if it's a better show? </joey>
<joey> - Well again, 'cause it's a better show </joey>
<joey> and I feel like there's not much to say. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> Like, just go watch it. </joey>
<joey> - But this is like like my favorite show. </joey>
<joey> - Cause "Baqi" I love "Baqi" right? </joey>
<joey> Well, I have to sit there and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Listen get to the point where he fucks someone </joey>
<connor> and becomes extra powerful." </connor>
<connor> Like I love having that conversation. </connor>
<connor> Again, if you haven't seen "Baqi" </connor>
<connor> there was a scene where he has sex. </connor>
<connor> - It was on only one scene. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, honestly, and that one scene is enough </connor>
<connor> to be like anime of the year on my mind. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, give it an award. </connor>
<garnt> - That's exactly what I'm fucking about. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a scene that's stuck with you </joey>
<joey> and you can bring up and you want to bring up. </joey>
<connor> So why was that not this is dope? </connor>
<joey> - It's like the way that I see it, </joey>
<joey> is that like, let's say Garnt wants </joey>
<joey> to take me to like an event and he's like, </joey>
<joey> he has to specifically tell me like Connor, </joey>
<connor> don't bring up the "Baqi" sex scene to like my friends. </connor>
<connor> That's the level of like, </connor>
<connor> I just want to talk about it like that. </connor>
<connor> It's not like it's defined my taste. </connor>
<connor> For some reason, I just want to talk about that scene </connor>
<connor> and how fucking weird it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Because like Cannon when I'm talking to you, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know kind of shows you would like. </connor>
<connor> You look at someone's three over three </connor>
<connor> and you can like recommend some shows </connor>
<connor> that they would like for example. </connor>
<connor> Like I knew, for example, that you would love </connor>
<connor> a show like "Dota Had Dodo" you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> "Cause that that is grimy. </connor>
<joey> It's grimy, it's a Chad anime. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> It's just Connor it just you know? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just gonna say if I didn't see this three by three. </connor>
<connor> And you told, no, no, and if you ask me me recommend me </connor>
<connor> an anime, "Ping Pong" is the last one I would bring up. </connor>
<joey> - For me? - For you. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - It again it just doesn't seem like a show you would like. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> I love that that's actually like top three five. </joey>
<garnt> - I can see the biggest the biggest one for me </garnt>
<garnt> is like "Mob Psycho" and "Hunter Hunter." </garnt>
<connor> - Bro "Hunter Hunter" is my favorite show to the whole show. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, "Hunter Hunter" is my favorite show of all time. </connor>
<joey> - What about "Jojo?" </joey>
<connor> - I don't really count that as a show in. </connor>
<connor> - It is a show in. - But it is a show in. </connor>
<garnt> - It has to be categorized </garnt>
<garnt> but there's no "Jojo" category. </garnt>
<connor> But that should be as far as I'm concerned, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Okay that's it, then what is this "Jojo" category then? </connor>
<connor> - I just, "Jojo" is like its own beast right? </connor>
<connor> There's nothing you can compare "Jojo" to. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree with him. </garnt>
<garnt> - I disagree. </garnt>
<connor> - All right, compare "Jojo" to this something right now. </connor>
<connor> - "Baqi." </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck off. </garnt>
<connor> - No. - No, no. </connor>
<garnt> I's not the same. </garnt>
<connor> It's not exactly I'm not saying </connor>
<connor> that both the same thing. </connor>
<garnt> But they give off the same kind of feeling you know </garnt>
<connor> what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Where's just like there </connor>
<connor> is some ridiculous fucking things happening </connor>
<connor> and you're just having- </connor>
<connor> - A summer good time? </connor>
<connor> Yes, but also- - No, no, no, </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying that they're </connor>
<connor> on like the same level or anything. </connor>
<connor> But they give off the same vibe </connor>
<connor> is what I'm talking about. </connor>
<connor> But the thing is they're just both fucking insane. </connor>
<joey> - But the thing is- - I'd ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - Is that a bunch of 80s and 90s shown in back then </joey>
<joey> had this kind of feel to it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like "Face the North Star" also has scenes </joey>
<joey> where it's just like, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck did I just read? </joey>
<garnt> - And you just recommended them that to him </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you think he would- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - No, that's exactly </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm showing in. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Jojo" when like halfway through, </garnt>
<connor> is like, right let's just be gay now. </connor>
<connor> I love that. </connor>
<joey> - No, trust me. </joey>
<connor> There's a lot of gay parts in "Fcing the North Star." </connor>
<joey> - And is that really? - Oh yeah, </joey>
<connor> I just thought it was like the manliest manly anime </connor>
<joey> ever in existence like. - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - But I guess that's pretty gay and- </joey>
<joey> - That is pretty. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty gay. </joey>
<joey> - There is a thing called bara, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if you're a where of it. </connor>
<connor> - It's good to say the YMCA music video is pretty manly. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty manly, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But "Pinata Fish" is one of my favorite shows as well. </connor>
<connor> I fucking love "Pinata Fish." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "Pinata Fish" is great. </connor>
<connor> - "Pinata Fish" is a good show. </connor>
<connor> - But I was expecting that because you've talked </connor>
<joey> about it before, right? </joey>
<joey> You've even made a whole video on "Pinata Fish", </joey>
<joey> so I expected that but. </joey>
<connor> - So you're complaining that I picked good shows, is that? </connor>
<joey> - Yes. - What? </joey>
<joey> - Because everybody's three by three has </joey>
<joey> to have at least one show where it's like, </joey>
<joey> hold on a second. </joey>
<joey> - Let's see if I could put a bad show </joey>
<connor> that I like in my three by three. </connor>
<joey> - There's got to be at least one- </joey>
<connor> - You'll see the money conman. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What I'm saying is every three by three has </joey>
<joey> to have at least one shitty show that you know is shitty, </joey>
<joey> you just don't care. </joey>
<joey> - Look, look. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly what is it the </joey>
<joey> "Walled Garden Merits" that's a shit show. </joey>
<joey> - Would you put that on here? </joey>
<joey> - Also you probably would. </joey>
<joey> But you see what I'm making this right? </joey>
<connor> We had like what like an hour to make this. </connor>
<connor> I'm thinking like, boom, </connor>
<connor> I'm putting my favorites on that, they're classics. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, here is bit too I can word it. </joey>
<garnt> I understood more about you as a person </garnt>
<connor> from your hentai tastes, </connor>
<connor> than I did for this, okay? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean that's very good. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like anyone could get my hands citation figure out. </connor>
<joey> Connor recommends "Mother Knows Best" </joey>
<joey> I wonder what he's into. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> I look at this and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> this could be anyone's three by three. </joey>
<garnt> - This This was a randomly generated image. </garnt>
<joey> (both mumbling) </joey>
<joey> This was made by an AI learning program </joey>
<garnt> from like the randomly generated sample </garnt>
<garnt> from people's top like mouth less </garnt>
<joey> - I put in the AI, in offensive three by three. </joey>
<joey> This is what came out. </joey>
<connor> - There's a lot of them and like in good faith, </connor>
<joey> I couldn't put on max I'm like, remember not from the show. </joey>
<joey> So like, I don't know what to put on that. </joey>
<connor> Like, this is a nine shows </connor>
<connor> where if you like name nine shows </connor>
<connor> that you'd love right away. </connor>
<connor> These are the first nine I'll come around with. </connor>
<connor> I'll be honest with you. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, maybe it does make sense. </connor>
<connor> 'cause you think "Realm" is your fucking wife. </connor>
<connor> - I thought you love "Realm." </connor>
<garnt> (both mumbling) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just like zero. </garnt>
<garnt> That tells me zero about you as </garnt>
<joey> a person as well. - This is a three by three. </joey>
<joey> This is the most vanilla (laughter drains speech) </joey>
<connor> This is a vanilla three by three. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sorry there's no gangbang operate </joey>
<connor> or grape incest in here, okay? </connor>

<joey> So from top left to bottom right we have </joey>
<joey> "Monster, From the New World, Utano Prince Sama, </joey>
<joey> Jojo, Vampire Knight, Golden Kamuy, Story of Saiunkoku, </joey>
<joey> Ceres and Hakuoki Shinsengumi." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] What the fuck is "Story of Saiunkoku?" </joey>

<connor> - It is, yeah. - It is. </connor>
<connor> - You got "Jojo, Monster" and then you've got all the like. </connor>
<joey> - I've watched all of these at least two or two, </joey>
<connor> two to five times each. </connor>
<garnt> (crowd mumbling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I did not influencer her, </garnt>
<garnt> she's told the same thing with it's the shows you rewatch </garnt>

<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah because I've heard Maylene talking </joey>
<joey> about "Monster, Utano Prince Sama, Jojo, Golden Kamuy, </joey>
<joey> Ceres and Hakuoki." </joey>
<joey> It's the bottom three that I'm curious of. </joey>
<joey> - Most of my body pillows are the Hakuoki. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> (both mumbling) </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, let me preface that I think out </garnt>
<garnt> of all of us, Maylene owns more body pillows </garnt>
<garnt> than the three of us put together. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many do you own? - How many do you own? </garnt>

<joey> But hold on, hold on they're not all big body pillows. </joey>
<connor> - That's doesn't make it any better. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't matter we weren't asking about the size. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> We are asking about the number. </joey>
<joey> - And I do have that- </joey>
<joey> - Hey five zero. - Five zero. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I do have like kitchen. </joey>
<garnt> - A new queen of degeneracy has come along man. </garnt>
<joey> - I even have you know the body spray </joey>
<joey> to make the pillow smell like the official character. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - Because why not? </joey>
<joey> You wanna know what they know what they smell like? </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Do you boys honestly want me to be like this? </connor>
<connor> Is this what you wanted from me? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<connor> - Listen, you can be the weird one. </connor>
<connor> This guy likes his children, he can have that. </connor>
<connor> I'm very normal thank you very much. </connor>
<connor> I think enough else and the other show. </connor>
<connor> I got a thorough grilling on the entire episode </connor>
<connor> from having normal tastes. </connor>
<connor> I'm happy to have normal tastes this time. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I've heard of I've watched "Cres" actually. </joey>

<joey> - Yeah, that is very incestuous. </joey>
<joey> That is like "Oreimo" but with beautiful characters. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, I know </joey>
<garnt> that she's "Oreimo" gender based. </garnt>

<connor> (crowd mumbling drains speech) </connor>
<garnt> - This is what I'm saying. </garnt>

<connor> The only thing I know it's the only person </connor>
<connor> who love that show to about to be a pedophile. </connor>
<connor> So Maylene. - I'm not a pedophile </connor>

<joey> - "Jojo" counts as "Bujo" so? </joey>
<joey> - At the bottom three, is like all "Bujo' based. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm saying that out of all of this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like from "The New World" </garnt>

<garnt> Did you just put this into me like- </garnt>
<garnt> - This guys, guys. - No, no. </garnt>
