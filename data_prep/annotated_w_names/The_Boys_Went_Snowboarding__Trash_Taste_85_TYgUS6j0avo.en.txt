<garnt> i'm going to say </garnt>
<garnt> chris </garnt>
<garnt> and who was the last person sitting in </garnt>
<joey> this play point chris right technically </joey>
<joey> it was me we're blaming it on chris i </joey>

<garnt> hello and welcome back to trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> i'm your host for today gant and once </garnt>
<garnt> again with me are the boys </garnt>
<joey> this is technically our first trash </joey>
<joey> taste recording of 2021 even though oh </joey>
<joey> you hated it i know right i know </joey>
<connor> the matter is ruined people the </connor>
<garnt> immersion comes yeah the amount of </garnt>
<garnt> options people can tell like i i like </garnt>
<garnt> how people are able to tell the timeline </garnt>
<garnt> of when trash chase recordings happen </garnt>
<garnt> now based on joey's hair </garnt>
<joey> like because it's like one week i was </joey>
<joey> like oh he has a lot of hair yeah the </joey>
<joey> next week is like oh he has no hair </joey>
<garnt> it's your hair and my beard because like </garnt>
<joey> one week i just decided i'm gonna grow a </joey>
<joey> beard and then uh we we are the sundial </joey>
<joey> of trash </joey>
<joey> basically </joey>
<joey> like i'm calculating the the shading </joey>
<connor> of god's face and i can definitely guess </connor>
<joey> it sometime around january i like the </joey>
<connor> beard on here i think it seems yeah it </connor>
<garnt> looks good i think i did it literally </garnt>
<garnt> after a trash taste recording when i </garnt>
<garnt> went back after that recording where we </garnt>
<garnt> talked about beards and i'm like so they </garnt>
<garnt> should i grow a beard and cindy's like </garnt>
<garnt> just do it why not and uh yeah i kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like it now it's grown on me </garnt>
<garnt> pun intended </garnt>
<garnt> i'm already getting the dashboard i'm </garnt>
<garnt> already getting the dad jokes out shave </garnt>
<garnt> it off right now </garnt>
<garnt> jesus but yeah we've just come back from </garnt>
<garnt> our christmas holidays which is i i </garnt>
<garnt> think this was one of the first </garnt>
<garnt> christmas holidays that actually felt </garnt>
<garnt> like a christmas holiday </garnt>
<garnt> right because uh normally </garnt>
<garnt> christmas holiday is like the busiest </garnt>
<garnt> time of the year for me because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get like my end of year video </garnt>
<garnt> out and then i don't know what switched </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind to make me realize what if i </garnt>
<garnt> just don't do that and uh give myself </garnt>
<garnt> some time off and then i put the video </garnt>
<joey> out sometime next month god discovers </joey>
<joey> the word no </joey>
<joey> for the first time it's like taking a </joey>
<garnt> break yeah i can say that now wait a </garnt>
<garnt> minute what you mean the expectations </garnt>
<garnt> were just all in my head </garnt>
<garnt> and no one really cares if i just delay </garnt>
<joey> the video for like a few weeks never </joey>
<joey> trust anyone not even yourself </joey>
<garnt> you mean i was my own worst enemy </garnt>
<connor> i feel one i'm just recovering from </connor>
<garnt> being sick so if i'm a little quiet it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have to cover it don't worry </garnt>
<joey> about it yeah i'm negative boys i'm also </joey>
<garnt> negative in life </garnt>
<garnt> you just described yourself right </garnt>
<joey> negative person </joey>
<joey> what happened like you had like a sore </joey>
<connor> throat or something yeah i had like a </connor>
<connor> really bad sore throat and then it just </connor>
<connor> kind of went and that now i'm in like </connor>
<connor> the last days where i still sound sick </connor>
<connor> but i feel totally fine okay yeah uh but </connor>
<joey> you were sipping that manuka honey up </joey>
<connor> there though yeah </connor>
<garnt> absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's the problem it's like it's </connor>
<garnt> like i remember i saw the other day it </garnt>
<garnt> was like a job this big of manufacturing </garnt>
<garnt> like that it was like 60 bucks what is </garnt>
<garnt> manuka honey it's it's this plant right </garnt>
<garnt> there no it's it's a type of honey made </garnt>
<connor> from a certain i think species of bee </connor>
<connor> that's only found in new zealand i know </connor>
<connor> new zealand yeah yeah it's it's a key </connor>
<garnt> it's like a kiwi bee basically and it's </garnt>
<connor> like it's like halfway between i </connor>
<connor> remember because i saw like a whole </connor>
<joey> business inside a video on this yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like uh yeah because they did like </joey>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> pollinated something like really </connor>
<joey> specific like this </joey>
<connor> this is the honey that is spunked on </connor>
<joey> this i'm sure it's something like the </joey>
<joey> bee you know takes the pollen from like </joey>
<connor> a specific plant and only makes honey </connor>
<connor> out of it or something like that but </connor>
<connor> yeah it's uh i know it's like a kiwi </connor>
<connor> thing and the reason is because like </connor>
<connor> just the whole process of it is really </connor>
<connor> long yeah and arduous and also it's like </connor>
<connor> halfway between like royal jelly and </connor>
<joey> honey i think yeah that's that's how it </joey>
<connor> kind of works i don't know i don't know </connor>
<connor> i always recommend it it's really hard </connor>
<connor> to recommend because people like you're </connor>
<garnt> paying how much for a jar of honey can i </garnt>
<connor> not just buy honey you know that's just </connor>
<connor> normal honey isn't honey it doesn't do </connor>
<joey> the same thing no more peasant honeybee </joey>
<joey> honey </joey>
<joey> it's like peasant beef </joey>
<joey> when you when you you know when you pour </joey>
<joey> honey it pours the like manuka honey </joey>
<garnt> stuff doesn't pull it's like molasses </garnt>
<garnt> like a block and like i normally like if </garnt>
<garnt> i scream a bunch i'm doing a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> voice acting yeah i'll normally just </garnt>
<garnt> take a little teaspoon not fill it up </garnt>
<connor> just like a little bit i'll just eat it </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i don't know a lot yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why because there are a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of like products that are very expensive </garnt>
<garnt> and i'd say that they're not that much </garnt>
<connor> different from like the base product </connor>
<connor> like when you honey versus normal honey </connor>
<connor> but manuka honey i don't know what it is </connor>
<connor> i don't know if it is a placebo but it </connor>
<connor> could be people could be a placebo but </connor>
<connor> like every time every time i've taken </connor>
<garnt> something it's like my sore throat just </garnt>
<joey> immediately goes away yeah i mean i mean </joey>
<joey> it's that whole thing of like are you </joey>
<joey> wearing a product or are you wearing a </joey>
<joey> brand new thing right when it comes to </joey>
<joey> like clothes for example yo are these </joey>
<garnt> bees like minted by louis vuitton like </garnt>
<joey> what's going on here if you look really </joey>
<joey> close on the side of the body it says lv </joey>
<joey> they're like branded with lv </joey>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] the bees coming in with like the </garnt>
<garnt> drip jacket like hello they come to the </garnt>
<joey> farm hello i'm here to pollinate you </joey>
<joey> uh directions </joey>
<garnt> not from like a specific bee it's from </garnt>
<garnt> the manuka flower yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's a specific plant they </connor>
<joey> probably confuse you i said plenty sorry </joey>
<connor> sorry then joey came in like a wrecking </connor>
<joey> ball like this and i'm like hold up hold </joey>
<garnt> on pretty sure it's a plus </garnt>
<garnt> okay it's the plants wearing there you </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] drip jacket </connor>
<connor> should have should have been more </connor>
<joey> aggressive i don't know joey </joey>
<joey> i disagree </joey>
<joey> half this podcast is that doesn't sound </joey>
<joey> right but my my manuka honey knowledge </joey>
<joey> isn't enough to dispute you or dispute </joey>
<joey> you on that yeah people have google </joey>
<joey> yeah because because i've tried like a </joey>
<joey> bunch of things like i've tried like you </joey>
<garnt> know that </garnt>
<garnt> really expensive pink himalayan salt oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like the most of the cost goes </garnt>
<garnt> into </garnt>
<garnt> like mining this [ __ ] salt because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one of the rare assault or one </garnt>
<garnt> one of the hardest salts to mine durian </garnt>
<connor> they shout out my supermarket huh they </connor>
<garnt> sell at my supermarket do they actually </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i've got something it's like </garnt>
<connor> i don't know if it's probably not really </connor>
<joey> probably it's like two bucks it's </joey>
<connor> definitely not sea salt with pink dye on </connor>
<connor> it yeah it's probably sea salt and pink </connor>
<joey> dye it says himalayan salt on it got it </joey>
<joey> for like 150 yen yeah </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> i actually tried the second most </garnt>
<garnt> expensive i think it's the second most </garnt>
<garnt> but it's one of the most expensive </garnt>
<joey> coffee beans in the world yeah right </joey>
<connor> which is how they harvest this coffee </connor>
<connor> bean is i believe it it's like this </connor>
<garnt> the cat poop </garnt>
<connor> we've seen the bucket list guys we've </connor>
<connor> seen the movie we know wait what that's </connor>
<connor> why i became like really popular because </connor>
<connor> in the bucket list there was like a hot </connor>
<connor> this whole big joke in the movie was the </connor>
<connor> fact that he didn't know this expensive </connor>
<connor> coffee this rich guy was buying from </connor>
<garnt> poop down which uh which film was this </garnt>
<joey> the bucket list </joey>
<joey> with morgan freeman and uh jack </joey>
<garnt> nicholson oh </garnt>
<joey> that one okay i don't know i don't know </joey>
<joey> why i know that maybe i've never seen it </joey>
<joey> this is why their coffee became so well </joey>
<joey> known </joey>
<joey> yeah because in this well it was </joey>
<joey> obviously it it was a thing before right </joey>
<joey> right yeah it was a massive part of the </joey>
<joey> movie it was a big joke that this guy </joey>
<joey> was like he was like i have to have this </joey>
<garnt> coffee and he didn't know this whole </garnt>
<garnt> time that he was eating like cabbage </garnt>
<connor> that was pooping it out yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's not actually cats it's a kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like an animal right </garnt>
<connor> a big joke in the movie is that he's </connor>
<garnt> eating the the poop beans and he's like </garnt>
<garnt> and then yeah </garnt>
<connor> hilarious </connor>
<joey> that's why i became so alone that's why </joey>
<joey> everyone knows it god i'm what i'm more </joey>
<joey> surprised of the fact that they talk </joey>
<joey> about that in the bucket list is the </joey>
<joey> fact that you've seen the bucket list </joey>
<connor> what do you mean it's a it's an amazing </connor>
<garnt> figure i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i know who's seen it jack dickson and </garnt>
<connor> morgan freeman are you going to sit and </connor>
<joey> tell me you don't want to watch it it </joey>
<joey> was it was one of those movies that i </joey>
<joey> saw </joey>
<joey> like in my oh i'm [ __ ] dating myself </joey>
<joey> here i saw my local blockbuster back in </joey>
<joey> the day oh my god </joey>
<joey> like you i would say it was one of those </joey>
<connor> ones that was always on that like </connor>
<joey> highlighted shelf of like these these </joey>
<joey> are the talked about movies right now it </joey>
<joey> was always smack bang in the middle it </joey>
<joey> was like [ __ ] jack nicholson morgan </joey>
<connor> freeman don't like that like that kind </connor>
<joey> of face it just says the bucket list </joey>
<connor> that looks boring why did not watch the </connor>
<joey> bucket list i don't know it just never </joey>
<joey> interested me </joey>
<garnt> i didn't even know about it until now </garnt>
<joey> it's very good so how did they react to </joey>
<connor> it in the movie he was like shocked </connor>
<connor> obviously and distraught that he'd been </connor>
<garnt> eating did he enjoy it did he enjoy the </garnt>
<connor> coffee what was it good coffee no so he </connor>
<garnt> didn't he he was obsessed with this </garnt>
<garnt> coffee but he didn't know where it was </garnt>
<garnt> from all right and because jack nixon in </garnt>
<garnt> the movie plays a very wealthy man he </garnt>
<garnt> has all the money in the world and </garnt>
<garnt> morgan freeman is in the same hospital </garnt>
<garnt> room as him and it has no money yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's this whole joke of morgan freeman's </garnt>
<garnt> like oh by the way i found out about </garnt>
<garnt> those beans that you like so much the </garnt>
<garnt> cats poop them out and then it's like </garnt>
<garnt> haha </garnt>
<connor> rich man eats poop </connor>
<joey> that was it was that the tagline for the </joey>
<connor> movie the original bucket list </connor>
<garnt> it's a very good movie i'm not selling </garnt>
<joey> you on it but it's really good </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<garnt> oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i tried it and it was just </garnt>
<connor> uh </connor>

<connor> how it's the biggest [ __ ] deal on </connor>
<connor> there i've had it before as well and </connor>
<connor> it's like it's a good cup of coffee it's </connor>
<connor> a good cup of coffee but it's it is like </connor>
<joey> to die for no i'll be honest i can tell </joey>
<connor> when i put it off when i put it on my </connor>
<connor> bucket list probably i don't know how </connor>
<connor> much sydney like uh grinded when she </connor>
<connor> made our cups of coffee because when she </connor>
<connor> made our cups of coffee it was like i </connor>
<garnt> had three ex like a triple espresso or </garnt>
<garnt> something me and team were just like </garnt>
<garnt> sitting in our chairs being like </garnt>

<connor> trash chase of course you were </connor>
<connor> researching poop okay yeah i was because </connor>
<connor> i because after that i was researching </connor>
<garnt> the coffee right and that used to be the </garnt>
<garnt> most expensive coffee </garnt>
<garnt> in the world </garnt>
<garnt> i assume because of the bucket list but </garnt>
<garnt> now there's a more expensive coffee uh </garnt>
<garnt> which is based on elephant poop and it </garnt>
<garnt> comes from thailand and i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> what is it what is up with </connor>
<connor> what's stopping me from ingesting coffee </connor>

<connor> their code on the pc </connor>
<joey> you know you blow the dust [ __ ] on it </joey>

<connor> the keyboard and whenever the fart is </connor>
<joey> like traced on the board she types the </joey>
<joey> shittiest ouija board yeah maybe she has </joey>
<garnt> maybe she has a fart scanner where it </garnt>
<garnt> digitizes her farts into bits and that </garnt>
<garnt> gets that gets converted to an nft which </garnt>
<garnt> can be put on these </garnt>

<garnt> i mean it's it's like beauty products </garnt>
<garnt> right where the products like they </garnt>
<garnt> market </garnt>
<garnt> they market the story to you as like oh </garnt>
<garnt> we got this we we got this product from </garnt>
<garnt> like the the mountains of the himalayas </garnt>
<garnt> where like the only like the freshest </garnt>
<garnt> tree grows or something like that but </garnt>
<garnt> it's just someone in the in the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> lab that made it yeah and they put they </garnt>
<connor> stuck a label on it you know it's pretty </connor>
<connor> much it's no different so you know i i </connor>
<connor> haven't done enough my research on </connor>
<garnt> where spring where bottled water </garnt>
<connor> actually comes from i don't care </connor>
<connor> no i don't care </connor>
<connor> i have no it was the very </connor>
<garnt> noise of nose </garnt>
<joey> i'm like meh i like i will say you have </joey>
<joey> dismissed that argument any faster </joey>
<garnt> do you care no i just want to know do </garnt>
<joey> you actually care no before we go down </joey>
<garnt> this argument and start talking about </garnt>
<garnt> this i don't care it's like guys </garnt>
<garnt> i saw like those </garnt>
<garnt> those documentaries where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> nestle yeah where they just go into like </garnt>
<garnt> towns of america and just take all their </garnt>
<garnt> drinking water and then just sell it as </garnt>
<garnt> bottled water because they add like i </garnt>
<connor> don't know like a label to it they had </connor>
<connor> like a one </connor>
<connor> zero milligram of chlorine or something </connor>
<connor> and then they're like now it's treated </connor>
<garnt> water it's no longer tap water yeah what </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like a massive </garnt>
<garnt> controversy um in england at least was </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that dasani </garnt>
<garnt> um so dasani is still in america if i if </garnt>
<garnt> i remember correctly </garnt>
<garnt> in america but the reason the sani is </garnt>
<garnt> not sold in england anymore is because </garnt>
<garnt> there was this massive controversy where </garnt>
<garnt> dasani marketed it as you know fresh </garnt>
<garnt> spring water but it got found out that </garnt>
<garnt> they were just selling bottled tap water </garnt>
<connor> well the tap was coming from a spring or </connor>
<garnt> something anyway yeah but the obviously </garnt>
<garnt> the people in the uk are very i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know how to explain it stuff like that </garnt>
<connor> really pisses british people off right </connor>
<connor> the fact that like you would try and </connor>
<connor> sell us something that is just so basic </connor>
<joey> it's something </joey>
<joey> i'm just wondering if if it's spring </joey>
<joey> water </joey>
<joey> but it's connected to a tap and that </joey>
<joey> spring water is coming out of a tap is </joey>
<joey> it spring water is a tap water it's a </joey>
<connor> spring tackle [ __ ] sage it's just tapped </connor>
<joey> sprinkles </joey>
<joey> we've entered the water metal right okay </joey>
<garnt> i'm gonna bring you a step deeper in the </garnt>
<garnt> water metal okay okay so onsen culture </garnt>
<garnt> in japan yeah right are you gonna tell </garnt>
<garnt> me that every single onsen water is like </garnt>
<garnt> is is every single onsen we go to just </garnt>
<garnt> you know fresh from the earth or is it </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> like how where does that water come from </garnt>
<joey> it's from the ground but it's through a </joey>
<garnt> tap yeah is it </garnt>
<garnt> are you just taking a bath in tap water </garnt>
<connor> like everything no </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<joey> because tap water has to come from </joey>
<joey> somewhere right </joey>
<joey> a spring perhaps </joey>
<joey> i think tap water implies that it's like </joey>
<joey> the grid the national system </joey>
<joey> right yeah not not the [ __ ] thing </joey>
<garnt> you're taking offset bathroom guys </garnt>
<garnt> because because i see some onsen uh some </garnt>
<garnt> onsens have like the water get delivered </garnt>
<garnt> to them by trucks right yeah not not tap </garnt>
<garnt> water but they get they get it delivered </garnt>
<garnt> by trucks and i think well </garnt>
<connor> is it like </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<connor> it's the stuff in the water like the </connor>
<connor> minerals from like the whatever they dig </connor>
<joey> out so so there's so there's a clear </joey>
<connor> difference between an onsen and a </connor>
<connor> centaur which is a bath house </connor>
<connor> right acentor is just hot water it's no </connor>
<garnt> there's no minerals in it it's not it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have like any of like that you </garnt>
<garnt> know natural stuff that makes you you </garnt>
<garnt> know makes it healthier yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then an onsen is the stuff that is like </garnt>
<connor> mineralized like from the [ __ ] ground </connor>
<connor> like onsen water yeah right but i think </connor>
<joey> most people just assume that like oh </joey>
<joey> bath house equals onsen which it doesn't </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's two different things yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because like i i do notice depending on </garnt>
<garnt> the onsen we go to like the the </garnt>
<garnt> water is like very different depending </garnt>
<connor> on where you go oh yeah there's like </connor>
<connor> there's like 30 different types of </connor>
<joey> ridiculous yeah yeah it's probably yeah </joey>
<joey> so yeah because it's all just different </joey>
<joey> makeups right yeah like like the acid </joey>
<connor> one i went i went with chris into an </connor>
<connor> acid onsen </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<joey> the one we </joey>
<joey> that we just went on holiday yeah on a </joey>
<garnt> ski trip which uh we've revealed is not </garnt>
<garnt> going to be a special yeah unfortunately </garnt>
<garnt> we do like to hang out with each other </garnt>
<joey> and uh not always happen </joey>
<joey> we hang out outside of context outside </joey>
<joey> even though joey joey </joey>
<joey> which may or may not not be out by now </joey>
<joey> by now yeah but uh we went to </joey>
<joey> uh where did we go again you said koi </joey>
<joey> it's okay no coins that's a that's a </joey>
<joey> monster that's a manga i i completely </joey>
<joey> just i the </joey>
<garnt> second </garnt>
<garnt> musical that's that's it </garnt>
<connor> one of the most famous ski resorts in </connor>
<connor> japan probably like top two is the most </connor>
<joey> famous oh hakama and niska the two </joey>
<joey> famous ones oh yeah that's true they're </joey>
<connor> two big boys </connor>
<connor> that's not that famous though yeah it's </connor>
<connor> always famous in japan i've also been </connor>
<joey> there and is like very very old yeah </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's not as great every ski </joey>
<connor> lift is like a plank </connor>
<garnt> it just like took yeah i mean hand crank </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i would say that this is my first </garnt>
<connor> proper ski trip because unlike before i </connor>
<connor> only went for a day </connor>
<connor> and then i was like out of commission </connor>
<connor> for like every other day so i had like </connor>
<connor> one day of snowboarding this time i had </connor>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> like four days of snowboarding two like </garnt>
<connor> full hard days and two like kind of like </connor>
<garnt> softer take it easy days still four days </garnt>
<connor> of snowboarding and uh yeah it was a lot </connor>
<garnt> of [ __ ] fun yeah but my god did my </garnt>
<connor> body hurt the day after holy [ __ ] did </connor>
<connor> your mum ask you how the white person </connor>
<connor> sport was </connor>
<connor> so she asked you </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> it was so weird going to that ski resort </joey>
<garnt> and just going to that town and just </garnt>
<garnt> seeing more people speaking english then </garnt>
<connor> they were japanese i think i heard less </connor>
<connor> japanese like i heard more chinese and </connor>
<joey> english than i did japanese oh yeah </joey>
<joey> and that's only going to increase once </joey>
<garnt> the board is open yeah yeah yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> like every single staff member not just </garnt>
<connor> in the hotel we stayed at but just in </connor>
<joey> town for some reason </joey>
<connor> that spoke english and you know there </connor>
<joey> are a lot of a lot of aussies there a </joey>
<joey> lot of water </joey>
<joey> um and you know if they weren't speaking </joey>
<joey> english then they were basically </joey>
<joey> speaking you know </joey>
<joey> mandarin or cantonese </joey>
<joey> and then you had the very few people </joey>
<garnt> just speaking japanese the japanese </garnt>
<garnt> people were literally in the minority </garnt>
<garnt> yeah from what i could see and the </garnt>
<garnt> country's closed off so how bad is it </garnt>
<garnt> going to be when </garnt>
<garnt> the country actually opens up and </garnt>
<garnt> tourism comes back in because yeah </garnt>
<joey> because i remember because i remember </joey>
<joey> when i worked in uh hakuba which is the </joey>
<joey> other famous one nigata that is like </joey>
<garnt> it's like almost 99 percent are you </garnt>
<garnt> being sorry i'm sorry nagano yes sorry </garnt>
<garnt> uh it's like 99 </garnt>
<garnt> australians </garnt>
<garnt> like it's actually it's actually scary </garnt>
<garnt> like i remember some days being there </garnt>
<garnt> like going around to like restaurants </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff yeah and i would step outside </garnt>
<garnt> after the restaurant and i'd be like oh </garnt>
<connor> yeah i'm in japan </connor>
<connor> because when you're inside the </connor>
<joey> restaurant everyone's australian yeah so </joey>
<joey> it feels like i'm back home in australia </joey>
<connor> it feels like every country has their </connor>
<garnt> their national pests yeah </garnt>
<joey> australia has the cane toads yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> australian australians </garnt>
<garnt> localized resort </garnt>
<garnt> she's going and you're like oh yes it </garnt>
<garnt> can't yet </garnt>
<garnt> so you know when you're at home </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god no because yeah it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> super surreal for me being in a place </garnt>
<garnt> which was you know very clearly japan </garnt>
<connor> but you know all the signs were in </connor>
<connor> english the menus were in english um and </connor>
<connor> all the staff members spoke english as </connor>
<connor> well weird man it was weird like i tried </connor>
<connor> my best to speak japanese to like anyone </connor>
<garnt> i met you know whenever i went to a </garnt>
<garnt> cashier or something and anytime i did </garnt>
<garnt> they would just always reply back in </garnt>
<garnt> perfect english </garnt>
<connor> that's funny because when i was booking </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> hotel actually i picked the hotel for </connor>
<connor> results </connor>
<connor> but i booked it right i asked like for </connor>
<joey> like a shuttle service to pick us up </joey>
<joey> because it's like two hours two hours </joey>
<joey> and a half yeah from the airport yeah </joey>
<joey> and i was like well there's you know on </joey>
<joey> booking.com it says they have a shuttle </joey>
<garnt> service oh great great so i clicked it </garnt>
<garnt> two days before they uh they messaged me </garnt>
<garnt> they're like by the way we don't have a </garnt>
<garnt> shuttle service and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> what do you mean you know shuttle </garnt>
<joey> service they're like i have one but we </joey>
<garnt> can help you get one just go to these </garnt>
<joey> links and get the bus yeah and so i go </joey>
<garnt> and look for the bus there's no seats </garnt>
<garnt> left on the bus i'm like oh [ __ ] what'd </garnt>
<garnt> we do yeah i call up the hotel and then </garnt>
<garnt> i remember so this is where i i talked </garnt>
<garnt> to the guy and i'm like i'm like oh is </garnt>
<garnt> english okay in japanese and he's like </garnt>
<garnt> in english he goes oh thank god </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's great that's perfect </garnt>
<garnt> i was like yeah i don't really like </garnt>
<garnt> speaking japanese </garnt>
<garnt> he's like from the philippines </garnt>
<garnt> okay i was like all right i'm sick and </garnt>
<joey> he was like super chill he was like yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah we'll get you a taxi mate you'll be </garnt>
<joey> all right yeah </joey>
<joey> very expensive taxi oh my god </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up we didn't book beforehand like </joey>
<joey> normal people because we we booked the </joey>
<garnt> trip pretty late as well right we're </garnt>
<garnt> like two weeks before yeah yeah so it </garnt>
<connor> was like quite expensive but it was good </connor>
<connor> though but like it's like a smack bang </connor>
<connor> in the middle of the season as well so </connor>
<connor> it's probably like the most amount of </connor>
<garnt> people but it was really good yeah still </garnt>
<garnt> very good i would say this was like </garnt>
<garnt> probably the coldest weather i've </garnt>
<garnt> consistently been in because like </garnt>
<garnt> throughout my entire life like the </garnt>
<garnt> coldest weather i've really had to deal </garnt>
<garnt> with is like minus five minus six right </garnt>
<garnt> oh god okay so how did you manage huh </garnt>
<garnt> how did you manage so so like so like in </garnt>
<garnt> my mind when you guys were telling me to </garnt>
<garnt> pack winter clothes pack all these </garnt>
<garnt> different kind of like you know </garnt>
<garnt> thermal gear and everything like that </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like it's cold i get it i know </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to i know it's going to be </garnt>
<garnt> cold </garnt>
<joey> nothing in my mind could process really </joey>
<joey> just how cold it is up there and just </joey>
<joey> how cold it feels because to me </joey>
<joey> like it gets to -5 and anything below -5 </joey>
<joey> i'm just like [ __ ] it's cold i'm </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i know mother it is cold you know that's </joey>
<joey> how my mind processes it yeah but i </joey>
<joey> didn't like my body wasn't prepared for </joey>
<joey> just like the different types of </joey>
<joey> coldness because it just never had </joey>
<joey> experienced that before at least like </joey>
<joey> not too not to such a big degree because </joey>
<joey> i've been in you know wisconsin in </joey>
<joey> winter and it gets [ __ ] cold in in </joey>
<joey> there but we just stay inside all the </joey>
<joey> time we're not out there [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> snowboarding skiing yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah to put in perspective i think every </joey>
<joey> day on average it was like minus like 10 </joey>
<connor> or 11. it was yeah it was minus like 16 </connor>
<connor> at the top as well yeah yeah yeah it </connor>
<joey> wasn't </joey>
<joey> like shot down even lower yeah like </joey>
<connor> because you'd wear like this um i don't </connor>
<connor> know what you call it not a battle club </connor>
<joey> but like just like a cloth </joey>
<joey> like a like a face </joey>
<joey> mask well it's just like a piece of </joey>
<garnt> cloth that you put underneath your mask </garnt>
<garnt> that blocks here so you don't freeze </garnt>
<joey> your face off yeah but like the one of </joey>
<joey> the days was so cold that like after </joey>
<joey> like one run of going down like one of </joey>
<garnt> the things i tried to touch it and it </garnt>
<garnt> was rock solid yeah like it like really </garnt>
<garnt> moved it's just like frozen yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> crazy it was so cool though man it was </connor>
<garnt> such a such a cool ski resort it was uh </garnt>
<garnt> i guess being in that kind of cold </garnt>
<garnt> weather or being that in that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> cold place kind of put things into </garnt>
<garnt> perspective for me </garnt>
<garnt> with that if you are like ill-equipped </garnt>
<garnt> like just to go outside for like a quick </garnt>
<garnt> walk or something you'll probably die </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i guess i've never been in an </garnt>
<garnt> environment where i've needed to </garnt>
<garnt> worry about just having basic gear to </garnt>
<garnt> protect myself from the weather </garnt>
<garnt> otherwise my life would be in danger you </garnt>
<joey> know what i mean yeah and i yeah like it </joey>
<joey> gets cold but it's like bearable yeah it </joey>
<joey> gets cold but like just runs in there </joey>
<joey> it's combing in it just once in there as </joey>
<joey> tesco's and just warm up you you run a </joey>
<joey> bit more but like um the nearest comedy </joey>
<joey> was like 30 minutes yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because there's not there was nothing </joey>
<joey> right and i remember when we arrived </joey>
<joey> when we arrived to the hotel we got </joey>
<joey> greeted by the receptionist and </joey>
<garnt> everything like that and he said oh you </garnt>
<garnt> know um if you want to go into town </garnt>
<garnt> make sure you book a taxi because if you </garnt>
<garnt> don't book a taxi every taxi is going to </garnt>
<garnt> stop at about midnight </garnt>
<garnt> and they've had some people that have </garnt>
<garnt> gone into town which is a bit further </garnt>
<garnt> away from the ski resorts and had no way </garnt>
<garnt> to get back in like minus -10 weather </garnt>
<joey> it's like a 20-minute drive it's like a </joey>
<joey> 20-minute drive yeah it's like it's like </joey>
<connor> a two-hour walk yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because the ski resort has a bunch of uh </connor>
<connor> different areas around it yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah we we went to this village called </connor>
<garnt> hirafu which is technically on the next </garnt>
<joey> mountain over that just puts into </joey>
<garnt> perspective how far away that is yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> it just made me think [ __ ] man if if we </garnt>
<garnt> just forgot to call a taxi one day we'd </garnt>
<garnt> just be [ __ ] because nowhere would be </garnt>
<garnt> open we can be we can we can get home </garnt>
<garnt> and we just have to like survive outside </garnt>
<connor> in the wilderness and like minus 10 </connor>
<connor> minus </connor>
<connor> 10 degree weather celsius by the way </connor>
<connor> celsius we went to that one bar and was </connor>
<garnt> these australian or south african i </garnt>
<joey> think it was australian uh no no no he </joey>
<garnt> was dutch i believe was he really oh i </garnt>
<garnt> think his eyes wasn't he touched him his </garnt>
<joey> accent sounded like he's already had a </joey>
<connor> nausea this guy was just like he was </connor>
<joey> just like we're like what do we do if we </joey>
<joey> miss the cabs i wouldn't know if he was </joey>
<joey> also </joey>
<connor> okay so okay he definitely wasn't aussie </connor>
<joey> he was he was he was european we asked </joey>
<connor> him we're like what do we do if we miss </connor>
<connor> the cabs and the guy's like oh just walk </connor>
<joey> home no no </joey>
<joey> he said no he was like where are you </joey>
<joey> staying and i was like uh at the xyz </joey>
<joey> hotel he's like it's walkable </joey>
<joey> and i looked at the google maps it was </joey>
<joey> like an hour and 40 minutes an hour and </joey>
<joey> 40 minutes i'm like </joey>
<joey> it's certainly walkable </joey>
<joey> would i do it though </joey>
<joey> in minus 15 degree weather is a </joey>
<garnt> different question </garnt>
<garnt> i mean walkable is a technicality i can </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm sure a human would be able to </garnt>
<garnt> walk from one end to the other i mean </garnt>
<garnt> hokkaido to tokyo is walkable </garnt>
<garnt> like you can walk it if you would want </garnt>
<garnt> to i mean the south pole is walkable </garnt>

<joey> couldn't see anything it was amazing </joey>
<garnt> yeah so it's just like a real life </garnt>
<garnt> sensor and so this view we had of just </garnt>
<joey> the snow as well it looked </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] aesthetic it was just unfair </joey>
<joey> it looked like a wallpaper it was like </joey>
<joey> unreal engine fire </joey>
<garnt> it literally looked like an unreal </garnt>
<garnt> engine </garnt>
<garnt> of not real life </garnt>
<garnt> it looks so good that it looks </garnt>
<joey> unrealistic </joey>
<joey> that's the only part i regret not being </joey>
<joey> able to vlog because that was probably </joey>
<connor> like the most aesthetic part i can't </connor>
<connor> take a camera in there i can't take it </connor>
<joey> what's going on guys yeah [ __ ] dicks </joey>
<joey> out boys </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because it was it was so cold on </garnt>
<joey> top that as you were like as you were </joey>
<joey> just staring at the landscape your hair </joey>
<joey> would freeze yeah so like our hair was </joey>
<garnt> frozen solid while our bottom halves </garnt>
<garnt> were like nice nice and toasty it was so </garnt>
<joey> weird because like even though your hair </joey>
<garnt> is frozen and like your shoulders and </garnt>
<garnt> head are just like covered in snow </garnt>
<garnt> you're not cold because you're sitting </garnt>
<garnt> in boiling hot water yeah you're sitting </garnt>
<garnt> in boiling water so it's like this </garnt>
<joey> perfect weird balance and it's just yeah </joey>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> i don't know what minerals they had </connor>
<connor> going on in that bath but like every day </connor>
<joey> i felt like silky smooth </joey>
<connor> i felt amazing it was boring </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> sometimes a bit of bath water just slips </garnt>
<garnt> in god i sound like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> i sound like [ __ ] mail-in now </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<garnt> sometimes like my face was like freezing </garnt>
<connor> cold i needed to like warm it up </connor>
<connor> that's what the towel was for god </connor>
<garnt> oh you got that you got the you get the </garnt>
<garnt> water on the towel as well you know </garnt>
<connor> that's true how was your skiing a </connor>
<garnt> snowboarding gun it was uh </garnt>
<connor> you improved a lot i did think i </connor>
<joey> improved i think gone improved </joey>
<joey> definitely like i definitely my </joey>
<joey> confidence went way up from like day one </joey>
<joey> to day four having said that i think i </joey>
<joey> learned the most on day four </joey>
<garnt> right because </garnt>
<garnt> day one two and three i had one goal </garnt>
<garnt> survive right and uh </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] halo music starts </connor>
<garnt> an objective survive because like </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> you go you go down some of these slopes </garnt>
<garnt> and i was having a chat with connor </garnt>
<garnt> about you know there are like green </garnt>
<garnt> slopes there are like red slopes and </garnt>
<garnt> there are like black slopes but at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of the day it's just a [ __ ] label </garnt>
<garnt> you know god's not god's not there </garnt>
<garnt> creating mountains being like i'm going </garnt>
<garnt> to make this a green slope at exactly </garnt>
<joey> these the same angles throughout i'm </joey>
<joey> just like and the map is like yes </joey>
<garnt> he's just like playing like sim city </garnt>
<garnt> with the [ __ ] earth or whatever you </garnt>
<connor> know god's not [ __ ] doing that you </connor>
<connor> you're you you get what you're given </connor>
<connor> with the mountains not every mountain </connor>
<garnt> and not every slope even if it's labeled </garnt>
<garnt> a green slope there are different </garnt>
<joey> variations there are different variables </joey>
<joey> some of the red slopes are actually </joey>
<joey> easier than the greens i would say so i </joey>
<connor> would say so yeah so if you're not </connor>
<connor> familiar with uh snow sports at all uh </connor>
<joey> the slopes normally categorized in </joey>
<joey> colors or </joey>
<joey> diamonds wherever you're from shapes </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah normally it's uh green is </joey>
<joey> easiest then some some also use blue in </joey>
<joey> europe australia so in europe you </joey>
<joey> sometimes see green you sometimes don't </joey>
<joey> it depends on which country you're in </joey>
<joey> but it's normally blue red black and in </joey>
<connor> america you have black diamond japan </connor>
<joey> also uses black diamond as well yeah </joey>
<joey> it's red circle uh sorry green circle </joey>
<connor> red square black diamond yeah yeah oh </connor>
<garnt> wow yeah because in japan there's </garnt>
<garnt> squares like green circle green circle </garnt>
<garnt> because normally the the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> variation of difficulty comes in black </garnt>
<garnt> slopes yeah because they're like some of </garnt>
<joey> them are literally just like they're not </joey>
<joey> treated at all yeah some of them are </joey>
<garnt> just awful and so that's why there's </garnt>
<garnt> even uh normally a bigger scale but in </garnt>
<garnt> europe it's just all black yeah they're </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] it it's all so hard yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> you've been skiing before yeah so on the </garnt>
<joey> first day we just stayed on like </joey>
<joey> literally the baby beginner slope it was </joey>
<joey> literally like i did </joey>
<joey> me and god did because it was like the </joey>
<joey> warm-up slope yeah me joey and luke </joey>
<connor> stayed on the beginner slope the baby </connor>
<connor> park slope of this [ __ ] ski resort um </connor>
<connor> and then the next day we're like okay </connor>
<connor> we're feeling confident now </connor>
<connor> actually take the gondola up to like the </connor>
<connor> top of the mountain and ski down the </connor>
<connor> green slopes um so </connor>
<joey> there was like no distinction from me </joey>
<joey> from what was a green slope and what was </joey>
<joey> a red slope we actually followed connor </joey>
<joey> and we accidentally took a red slope i </joey>
<joey> didn't i couldn't tell the difference </joey>
<joey> exactly because they were that was just </joey>
<garnt> like me [ __ ] fighting for my life to </garnt>
<garnt> go down like the tiniest little slope </garnt>
<garnt> and that's that's like i couldn't tell </garnt>
<garnt> the difference between like a few </garnt>
<joey> degrees not to mention the weather that </joey>
<joey> day was so [ __ ] like the visibility was </joey>
<connor> like five meters yeah yeah so the so </connor>
<connor> this uh this resort had a beginner slope </connor>
<connor> and i when i said beginner slope this is </connor>
<joey> the most beginner slope i've ever seen </joey>
<joey> yeah it is literally like a flat surface </joey>
<joey> that sometimes it goes to a one percent </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like a one or two so you know </joey>
<joey> really </joey>
<garnt> amazing if you're actually like </garnt>
<garnt> beginners beginners which luke was yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah yeah yeah yeah with a friend </garnt>
<joey> who came with us luke who had never </joey>
<joey> skied in his life yeah and it was a good </joey>
<joey> start i mean i think he got confident on </joey>
<joey> that yeah yeah he did he's like oh i've </joey>
<joey> only fallen over once i can go to the so </joey>
<garnt> if you wanted to go and do any other </garnt>
<garnt> slopes that were kind of difficult we </garnt>
<garnt> had to go all the way to the top yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and that's where it kind of gets you </garnt>
<garnt> don't really have a choice if some of </garnt>
<connor> them are difficult or not yeah yeah but </connor>
<garnt> the day before we went up </garnt>
<connor> we went up the day before and it was </connor>
<garnt> like the visibility was awful yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> you could maybe see like five meters </garnt>
<garnt> ahead of you yeah and we go pretty fast </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like just like i'm just hoping </garnt>
<garnt> i don't find someone because if i do i'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna hit someone and it's like oh god </garnt>
<joey> oh god it was really sketchy really bad </joey>
<joey> and then but even the second day the </joey>
<connor> visible is quite [ __ ] right yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> the first day was a lot worse i </connor>
<joey> literally couldn't like maybe i couldn't </joey>
<joey> see what that camera oh wow maybe no no </joey>
<joey> maybe ashley where ashley is that was </joey>
<garnt> about where it starts to get blurry and </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't see anything right right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but the next day was it was still bad </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it was bad so so we went with </garnt>
<garnt> another friend uh ohara he's a youtuber </garnt>
<garnt> uh who lives here and then we were he's </garnt>
<garnt> chris as well yeah and chris </garnt>
<garnt> as well all right so to give you to give </garnt>
<garnt> you a gauge of like the skill levels i </garnt>
<connor> guess like what would you put yourself </connor>
<connor> what would you put yourself i would say </connor>
<connor> it's it's </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so so like </connor>
<connor> uh i've like no issue doing like black </connor>
<connor> slopes or whatever so me and ohara </connor>
<connor> because we were like the most confident </connor>
<garnt> ones you're like alright i was like you </garnt>
<garnt> go in the front you like direct them and </garnt>
<garnt> i'll go in the back and i'll like if </garnt>
<garnt> they fall over i'll help you but i'll </garnt>
<garnt> help them get back out </garnt>
<garnt> luckily i'm glad i was there because </garnt>
<garnt> luke at one point lost his ski in like </garnt>
<garnt> really thick snow </garnt>
<garnt> and when you're in ski boots you can't </garnt>
<garnt> really go up the mountain if you're not </garnt>
<garnt> used to it like if you're if you're like </garnt>
<garnt> a beginner it's really hard to like feel </garnt>
<garnt> confident running around </garnt>
<garnt> and i was wearing snowboard boots so i </garnt>
<garnt> was like all right just wait there i'll </garnt>
<garnt> go and dig through the snare and after </garnt>
<garnt> like five minutes i've managed to find </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] ski buried in the snow it </garnt>
<garnt> had gone underneath the snow slid so you </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't even there was no sign yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh [ __ ] it was there so i just had </garnt>
<garnt> to like rummage through yeah eventually </garnt>
<garnt> found it so we went down anyway but like </garnt>
<garnt> so we took these guys up and it was just </garnt>
<garnt> a mess because like none of them could </garnt>
<garnt> like stand up chris is good at skiing </garnt>
<garnt> but chris is lazy right </garnt>
<garnt> i did notice that i didn't know chris </garnt>
<garnt> chris ken and eric and chris could </garnt>
<garnt> probably do a black slope right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe yeah if chris really tried </garnt>
<garnt> yeah problem is black slopes are really </garnt>
<garnt> tiring and take a lot of effort yeah </garnt>
<garnt> chris doesn't want to do that and chris </garnt>
<garnt> also is like he'll do reds but you </garnt>
<joey> really have to convince him he's trying </joey>
<garnt> to do greens he's like chris you could </garnt>
<connor> do reds so easily what are you doing </connor>
<joey> yeah because i remember like the third </joey>
<connor> or fourth day he came with me gotten </connor>
<connor> luke on a green slope because that's </connor>
<connor> when we started to get a little more </connor>
<connor> confident and he was like yeah i think </connor>
<connor> i'll stick on the green too and i'm like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] off almost get out of here you </connor>
<joey> passed the exam </joey>
<garnt> he's like [ __ ] skiing past us with no </garnt>
<garnt> problem whatsoever come on boys catch </garnt>
<garnt> second day we tried to take them down </garnt>
<garnt> and uh yeah how long did it take us to </garnt>
<garnt> get to them okay so </garnt>
<garnt> if if i went from top to bottom without </garnt>
<connor> stopping and i went as fast as i could i </connor>
<connor> could probably do it in five minutes </connor>
<connor> right yeah but that's like dangerously </connor>
<joey> it probably took us </joey>
<joey> 30 to 45 minutes no it took us like an </joey>
<garnt> hour </garnt>
<garnt> it took like two hours the first time at </garnt>
<joey> least the first time because </joey>
<garnt> like we i swear we spent like 15 to 20 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes looking for what you were </garnt>
<garnt> looking for uh luke's skis and then uh </garnt>
<garnt> before that as well because this was </garnt>
<garnt> right at the start so the visibility was </garnt>
<garnt> so poor </garnt>
<garnt> i probably would have a hard time seeing </garnt>
<garnt> joey from where from where he's sitting </garnt>
<garnt> that's how poor the visibility was um </garnt>
<garnt> and this was also like basically my only </garnt>
<garnt> like my second full day skiing uh so </garnt>
<garnt> it's snowboarding so </garnt>
<garnt> um i didn't know how to properly control </garnt>
<garnt> my board </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember we were trying to stick </garnt>
<garnt> close to a group right we're trying to </garnt>
<garnt> stay close to a group and i'm trying </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm fighting for my life just like </garnt>
<garnt> see where the group was right and so we </garnt>
<garnt> and so before every hill we all stop </garnt>
<garnt> before hill um unfortunately my control </garnt>
<garnt> of the board was not good enough that i </garnt>
<garnt> knew how to stop yet </garnt>
<garnt> so so these guys were stopped waiting </garnt>
<garnt> for me and luke and um so i come along </garnt>
<garnt> and i try to stop and i realize that i'm </garnt>
<garnt> stopping too late and i'm sliding down </garnt>
<garnt> the slope so i start shouting out oh </garnt>
<connor> guys i i'm going now i'm just gonna go </connor>
<connor> ahead and like and and nobody looked </connor>
<connor> nobody looked nobody looked back and i </connor>
<connor> just started stumbling down this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hill get halfway down and i turn around </connor>
<connor> to see if anyone's followed wait a </connor>
<connor> minute </connor>
<connor> wait two minutes wait five minutes </connor>
<connor> there's nobody and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] where is everybody </connor>
<garnt> i am on this slope at the top of this </garnt>
<connor> mountain by myself and i can't even </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] stop correctly so i had to like </garnt>
<garnt> i was like messaging the lion group </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get their attention luckily um </garnt>
<garnt> luckily i waited long enough for you </garnt>
<garnt> guys to come down because they these </garnt>
<garnt> guys were waiting for me this entire </garnt>
<connor> yeah i thought that garm was behind us </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's how poor the visibility was um so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we wasted just 20 minutes where you </garnt>
<garnt> were waiting for me and i was waiting </garnt>
<garnt> for you </garnt>
<garnt> just because we couldn't [ __ ] see </garnt>
<connor> each other because i was very worried </connor>
<connor> because this uh the way that this </connor>
<connor> mountain was laid out is that like </connor>
<garnt> basically you have to do like </garnt>
<garnt> really big s's to stay on the easy ones </garnt>
<garnt> and if they take if they took any turn </garnt>
<joey> at any point they would go down a black </joey>
<joey> slope yeah it's just a cliff and i was </joey>
<garnt> like uh they're gonna die if they go </garnt>
<joey> down a black slope yeah so i was like i </joey>
<garnt> got to do my best to make sure like we </garnt>
<garnt> got i'm like like uh what are they what </garnt>
<garnt> are the [ __ ] sheep dogs like </garnt>
<garnt> trying to round them around up all the </garnt>
<garnt> sheep </garnt>
<garnt> come on boys stick together yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was kind of like that uh which </garnt>
<garnt> is why i think i learned the most on the </garnt>
<garnt> last day because uh on the last day we </garnt>
<garnt> just found like this one slope that was </garnt>
<garnt> perfect for beginners and had like a ski </garnt>
<garnt> lift take us back up and you just had </garnt>
<garnt> like the freedom to just do what you </garnt>
<garnt> want without worrying about </garnt>
<garnt> dying or just you know breaking </garnt>
<joey> the weather was absolutely good and the </joey>
<connor> weather was like yeah so we had three </connor>
<joey> days of god-awful weather really bad </joey>
<garnt> weather and finally the last day when </garnt>
<joey> we're leaving it's amazing and it's a </joey>
<garnt> shame really because the next few days </garnt>
<garnt> after that was also really good yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> we kind of booked it the wrong time but </garnt>
<connor> it was amazing weather really good stuff </connor>
<garnt> in the last day i'm really impressed </garnt>
<garnt> that nobody got injured like yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i agree yeah there's six of us i </connor>
<garnt> mean did you guys take any bad tumbles </garnt>
<joey> during uh yeah </joey>
<joey> i let's just say i'm really glad i </joey>
<joey> rented out a helmet because uh </joey>
<garnt> i think about 80 of my falls involved me </garnt>
<joey> just my head just getting [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> whiplash back right didn't you like kill </connor>
<garnt> a toddler </garnt>
<connor> i almost did i i </connor>
<connor> i because like like on the first like </connor>
<connor> two three days i didn't know how to stop </connor>
<garnt> so my technique for stopping uh involved </garnt>
<garnt> falling over um and if i didn't fall </garnt>
<garnt> over i would just basically just take </garnt>
<joey> out whoever like was in front of me this </joey>
<joey> is this great photo that luke took of </joey>
<joey> you just like there's this kid right </joey>
<joey> here and then there's just gone </joey>
<joey> menacingly behind me like i'm about to </joey>
<joey> destroy </joey>
<garnt> i must have decked at least like three </garnt>
<garnt> kids on the slope for like the first </garnt>
<connor> three days oh my god god </connor>
<joey> the kid killer thank god no one got </joey>
<joey> injured except for those three </joey>
<garnt> like it was because it was like a </garnt>
<garnt> competition because like </garnt>
<garnt> me and luke just kept [ __ ] crashing </garnt>
<garnt> into each other in the first two days </garnt>
<garnt> because we had zero control yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know how to control our balls </garnt>
<garnt> right and i remember uh luke decked joey </garnt>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] legs sweeped me i had a </connor>
<garnt> great pov of this i was like really i </garnt>
<joey> was i was my i was like leading everyone </joey>
<joey> down the right slopes </joey>
<joey> and then i was waiting for them at the </joey>
<joey> bottom and i saw joey just </joey>
<joey> slowly like going down like this </joey>
<joey> yeah and then out of nowhere like rko i </joey>
<garnt> just see our friend luke who doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> know how to stop she's coming coming and </garnt>
<garnt> i see jerry </garnt>
<joey> and i'm like i'm about getting my </joey>
<joey> popcorn out </joey>
<joey> just waiting for this to happen so yeah </joey>
<joey> joey's going joey's going doesn't move </joey>
<joey> his head at all and then suddenly he </joey>
<joey> just goes doom </joey>
<connor> right in the back of his legs and joey </connor>
<connor> just flips over like i'm so funny </connor>
<joey> because all i heard was i was i was i </joey>
<garnt> was slowly going down because it was </garnt>
<garnt> kind of a narrow stretch and also i was </garnt>
<garnt> waiting for luke right yeah so i was </garnt>
<garnt> slightly going down because i saw you </garnt>
<garnt> guys there and i i remember specifically </garnt>
<joey> behind me i could hear luke in the </joey>
<joey> distance going sorry sorry sorry sorry </joey>
<joey> this is getting louder and louder and </joey>
<garnt> louder but i thought he was saying that </garnt>
<joey> to other people right that were behind </joey>
<garnt> me yeah so i was like well luke you know </garnt>
<joey> silly hear me silly him it gets louder </joey>
<joey> sorry sorry sorry and then just bam </joey>
<joey> right in the back of my knees </joey>
<joey> let's get flipped over </joey>
<connor> i should have been more concerned but it </connor>
<joey> was so funny i wish you had filmed that </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> by the time i realized it was happening </joey>
<garnt> was like five seconds </garnt>
<joey> couldn't have got my phone out but i </joey>
<garnt> wish i did i wanted to see i wanted to </garnt>
<connor> shut up we should have my gopro on </connor>
<garnt> permanent yeah right i was too busy like </garnt>
<garnt> falling over myself to really see what </garnt>
<garnt> everyone else was like falling over over </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember i had a few bad </garnt>
<garnt> tumbles but actually like some of the </garnt>
<garnt> worst tumbles was when i was just </garnt>
<garnt> actually not going the fastest it was </garnt>
<garnt> like because when you go fast sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> like you saw you guys saw me do have </garnt>
<garnt> some pretty big fours where i did like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] triple backflip or whatever yeah </garnt>
<connor> or whatever but to me those falls are </connor>
<connor> fine because you take the momentum and </connor>
<connor> then you just like literally roll with </connor>
<connor> it right and you hardly feel it some of </connor>
<connor> the worst falls i had was on like the </connor>
<connor> second day because he saw this one yeah </connor>
<connor> these guys were trying to like warn me </connor>
<connor> not to stop myself with my hands right </connor>
<joey> because sometimes if you have a bad four </joey>
<joey> and you stop yourself with your hands </joey>
<joey> you uh you could break your wrist you </joey>
<joey> could snap your wrist or break your arm </joey>
<joey> or something so they were telling me uh </joey>
<joey> you've got to you've got to fall on your </joey>
<joey> arms you've got to do this make sure </joey>
<connor> make sure you don't try to catch </connor>
<connor> yourself you've got to do this i need </connor>
<connor> like like this right and i took that as </connor>
<connor> i'm going to do this </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> not realizing the mistake i was about uh </connor>
<connor> to encounter because what happened is i </connor>
<connor> had a like i was taking a bunch of </connor>
<connor> tumbles i was like this doesn't hurt i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm a [ __ ] pro at falling over with a </connor>
<connor> with a snowboard so there's one time i </connor>
<connor> was going down this really like this </connor>
<connor> this this if the slope wasn't steep at </connor>
<connor> all it's going pretty slowly but i just </connor>
<connor> catch the edge and i'm about to fall </connor>
<connor> straight to my face so i do what they </connor>
<connor> tell me and i tuck my arms in </connor>
<garnt> unfortunately my fists were right in </garnt>
<garnt> front of my face right so what happens </garnt>
<garnt> is i fall on my arm and i just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> deck myself in the face </garnt>
<garnt> i just go </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember </garnt>
<garnt> i fall over and you know </garnt>
<garnt> like you know when you have a bad four </garnt>
<garnt> and you just gotta like lay there yeah </garnt>
<garnt> just question life for a bit that's when </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's bad yeah yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember i lay there for a few seconds </garnt>
<garnt> and i just hear kind of going right on </garnt>
<garnt> because i just saw this like because </garnt>
<garnt> obviously it looks like ants in the </garnt>
<garnt> background i just saw he can't just fall </garnt>
<garnt> on his face and i was like get back up </garnt>
<garnt> come on </garnt>
<connor> get back </connor>
<connor> get back up and then he didn't get up </connor>
<connor> and i'm like oh no he hurt himself </connor>
<joey> that was like it was a couple of times </joey>
<joey> like like on the last day i think where </joey>
<joey> you did that like triple back flip right </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i saw it in the distance and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh that that that looked like </joey>
<joey> it hurt and then god just did a move for </joey>
<joey> about 20 seconds i was like oh he's dead </joey>
<joey> oh he's straight up dead </joey>
<connor> yeah i never seen that one i just saw </connor>
<connor> like someone doing like flips but not </connor>
<joey> good i could hear the ssx music playing </joey>
<joey> when that was happening </joey>
<garnt> he took so many falls i did i did </garnt>
<garnt> i think that's when i learned the most </garnt>
<garnt> though when you when you do take the </garnt>
<connor> falls it's not about how many times you </connor>
<joey> get hit down it's how you get how many </joey>
<connor> times you get back </connor>
<joey> yeah that's about the drive it's </joey>
<joey> actually like the most embarrassing fall </joey>
<joey> i took wasn't even on the slopes it was </joey>
<joey> on the ski lift </joey>
<joey> oh yeah uh yeah because uh well joey was </joey>
<joey> there because uh me and joey were trying </joey>
<joey> to get on the ski lift together for two </joey>
<joey> minutes so two it was a yeah it was a </joey>
<joey> two-man ski lift so me and joey line up </joey>
<joey> together so we're just gonna have a nice </joey>
<joey> chill ride up on the mountain and so i </joey>
<joey> look back i've done the skeeter for a </joey>
<joey> bunch of times so i'm not even a </joey>
<garnt> beginner anymore i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i i like know how to get on the ski lift </garnt>
<connor> right so so you think it is </connor>
<garnt> it is a lot harder on a snowboard than a </garnt>
<garnt> ski yeah also i thought because i just </garnt>
<garnt> so i'm standing there waiting for the </garnt>
<garnt> ski lift to come around i look back </garnt>
<garnt> and in my mind i take a mental note of </garnt>
<garnt> the momentum </garnt>
<garnt> of this ski lift right so i know how </garnt>
<garnt> fast this thing's going yeah and so </garnt>
<garnt> right before </garnt>
<garnt> uh it gets to uh it gets near us i turn </garnt>
<garnt> around thinking it's gonna have the same </garnt>
<garnt> momentum not thinking that they're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> slow down slow it down for us </garnt>
<garnt> so what i do is i turn around and i just </garnt>
<garnt> sit </garnt>
<garnt> and you know that feeling where you take </garnt>
<garnt> a step where you think there's like a </garnt>
<garnt> stare yeah and then there's just not </garnt>
<garnt> so i just </garnt>
<garnt> i had that i had that feeling where i </garnt>
<joey> sit down </joey>
<joey> and i just feel nothing and i'm like oh </joey>
<joey> no and like i just i just collapsed yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and then the next thing i notice is </joey>
<joey> i feel like the [ __ ] bump on the back </joey>
<joey> of my helmet which thank god i was </joey>
<joey> wearing a helmet at this point yeah and </joey>
<joey> so i'm just like they're gonna stop the </joey>
<joey> ski lift so my instinct uh is just to </joey>
<joey> adopt the fetal position well while they </joey>
<joey> hopefully stop the ski lift </joey>
<joey> plot twist they don't stop the ski lift </joey>
<joey> and so the ski lift just goes over me </joey>
<joey> and joey just like joey i guess just </joey>
<joey> snowboards over me because i look at </joey>
<joey> yeah i look up thinking what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> happening and i just see joey just </joey>
<garnt> looking back on the skeely being right </garnt>
<garnt> you're right [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> it was because it was amazing because </joey>
<connor> like i'm surprised they didn't stop it </connor>
<connor> they said yeah they should stop right </connor>
<connor> because like because how i usually do it </connor>
<connor> with like skis or snowboards is i wait </connor>
<connor> for the the chair to physically hit me </connor>
<connor> in the back of the knees so that's where </connor>
<connor> i know oh it's right underneath kind of </connor>
<connor> like bend over yeah just get my butt </connor>
<connor> ready so i was i was doing that i was </connor>
<connor> looking back you know just waiting </connor>
<connor> waiting waiting waiting until it hits me </connor>
<joey> right here and then i look over look up </joey>
<joey> sit down thinking it's all good and then </joey>
<joey> i i hear like this horrible scraping </joey>
<joey> sound from somewhere i was like what's </joey>
<joey> what's going on i look over and god's </joey>
<joey> just down there </joey>
<joey> under the thing just like this </joey>
<joey> and i was like oh they're gonna stop it </joey>
<joey> they don't stop it it's right over gun i </joey>
<garnt> was like all right that's cruel </garnt>
<garnt> and then they finally stop it after </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's gone past you yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> the woman comes over being like you're </garnt>
<joey> alright i'm like what do you mean you're </joey>
<joey> all right yeah you should have stopped </joey>
<joey> why did you why did you check up on him </joey>
<connor> after you left the chair </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like watching a fight </connor>
<connor> with the teachers like watching the kids </connor>
<joey> like when it's over like oh you guys </joey>
<joey> you're sorry i was like i'll wait for </joey>
<joey> them to throw a few yeah i'll break it </joey>
<connor> up break it up let's bring it over here </connor>
<joey> well that was the most embarrassing one </joey>
<joey> because they're just like everyone was </joey>
<joey> just obviously staring at me i stopped </joey>
<joey> the entire ski lift and yeah that was </joey>
<joey> just just like social anxiety up through </joey>
<joey> the roof because i'm just like it </joey>
<joey> happens yeah i know it happens they </joey>
<connor> can't see your face yeah that's true </connor>
<joey> that's true you're completely coughed up </joey>
<connor> yeah aside from that had a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> wonderful time uh my body hurt a lot but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was worth it </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm like just wearing i'm raring to </garnt>
<connor> go again honestly it's probably some of </connor>
<connor> the best snow i've ever snowboarded or </connor>
<garnt> skied on my life this is amazing how is </garnt>
<garnt> it compared to like european ski resorts </garnt>
<connor> um i think i like european ones more </connor>
<connor> there's normally they're normally bigger </connor>
<connor> way more like options but i mean it was </connor>
<connor> the quality of snow was insane it was so </connor>
<joey> good powder it's it powdered snowed like </joey>
<connor> so like two meters a day or something </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so most of the black slopes </connor>
<joey> weren't like groomed so we went on one </joey>
<joey> and it was literally just like i was </joey>
<joey> like on a cloud yeah yeah and i fell </joey>
<joey> over on one of them because it's too </joey>
<joey> deep and it's so hard to turn and it was </joey>
<garnt> really bad because i basically just </garnt>
<garnt> shoveled a [ __ ] ton of snow into my </garnt>
<garnt> jacket and pants </garnt>
<joey> and i was freezing and i was like in the </joey>
<joey> cold of my my hand trying to scoop this </joey>
<joey> out </joey>
<joey> minus 15 trying to get all the snare </joey>
<joey> because if you just leave it in it'll </joey>
<garnt> just melt and then you'll be wet yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't even worse </garnt>
<garnt> try to get it out like [ __ ] [ __ ] and </garnt>
<garnt> then i had to like ski for another hour </garnt>
<garnt> my my ass was completely numb </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't feel anything it was so bad </garnt>
<garnt> and i i when i got back to the room i </garnt>
<garnt> was like i can't i can't feel my ass at </garnt>
<garnt> all it's been numb for like a good two </garnt>
<garnt> hours </garnt>
<garnt> someone could have smacked my ass and i </garnt>
<joey> wouldn't know that clip is definitely </joey>
<joey> going to be taken out </joey>
<joey> i can't kill my mouth i just took such a </joey>
<garnt> beating it's so numb </garnt>
<garnt> doing too much riding on the board </garnt>
<garnt> it's so good though it was really cool </garnt>
<joey> there's really good ski resorts i want </joey>
<garnt> to go </garnt>
<joey> pain in the ash to get to but good </joey>
<connor> yeah i think if i if i go there again </connor>
<connor> i'd probably want to like go to sapporo </connor>
<joey> for a bit or something yeah and then go </joey>
<joey> there i think i think that's what like a </joey>
<joey> lot of uh tourists do is they're like </joey>
<joey> kind of maybe dedicate like a week or </joey>
<connor> two for like the whole thing because it </connor>
<connor> is kind of out of the way especially if </connor>
<connor> you're coming from tokyo is a really fun </connor>
<connor> city yeah as far as grace is a really </connor>
<garnt> chill city like all i wanted to do on </garnt>
<garnt> this ski trip was just get the basics </garnt>
<garnt> down for my snowboarding and i think i </garnt>
<garnt> managed to do that </garnt>
<connor> yeah so now i'm like more confident </connor>
<connor> thank you came along very well </connor>
<joey> improved a lot but uh yeah now i'm just </joey>
<joey> ready to like tear it down with the boys </joey>
<garnt> for real hopefully and try and try and </garnt>
<joey> keep up with them the real ssx trickies </joey>
<connor> i want everyone to get better so that </connor>
<garnt> then chris feels obliged </garnt>
<connor> but he has no choice because no one </connor>
<connor> wants to do greens anymore yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> we accidentally went down a reds on our </garnt>
<joey> second day like like we just said it </joey>
<joey> didn't go amazing but we made it down </joey>
<garnt> didn't go amazing uh but we survived </garnt>
<connor> that's the important thing we have yeah </connor>
<connor> there was like there was this um there's </connor>
<connor> basically there was this tiny little and </connor>
<connor> little little sign that was like go this </connor>
<connor> way if you want to go back to where you </connor>
<joey> came from on a green yeah and if you go </joey>
<joey> down straight which is like the whole </joey>
<joey> thing you know you wouldn't it's really </joey>
<joey> hard to see this thing because it also </joey>
<joey> goes back in on itself yeah so the slope </joey>
<joey> goes down this way and there's a little </joey>
<connor> cut off here where it goes down and back </connor>
<connor> around and then joins off to like </connor>
<joey> another mountain it's impossible to see </joey>
<connor> considering and the entire thing is </connor>
<joey> white </joey>
<joey> the conditions are really bad so it's </joey>
<joey> just everything explains and then i was </joey>
<joey> last because i was making sure everyone </joey>
<joey> was all right and then i i was like oh </joey>
<connor> no the </connor>
<connor> luke who i was with at the time because </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty sure he was last he went down </connor>
<connor> the red and i was like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> moments before a disaster he just went </connor>
<garnt> down </garnt>
<garnt> and then i'm like oh my god they've all </garnt>
<garnt> gone down the green and then we're stuck </garnt>
<garnt> here and it's like lunch time yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and we was already it was like 1 1 30 </garnt>
<garnt> and i was like oh we probably would be </garnt>
<garnt> eating by now like we're [ __ ] because </garnt>
<garnt> we want to go meet have lunch with them </garnt>
<garnt> as well so how do we get back like but </garnt>
<connor> then luckily all these [ __ ] idiots </connor>
<joey> went down the red as well turns out we </joey>
<joey> all missed it </joey>
<connor> so we all met up yeah yeah but then this </connor>
<connor> green was really annoying as well </connor>
<connor> because it was like you had it was like </connor>
<connor> a flat really really flat and i told the </connor>
<connor> guy i was like guys you got to make sure </connor>
<connor> you get as much speed as you can on your </connor>
<joey> snowboards yeah like walk anywhere we're </joey>
<joey> like got it put snowboards on two </joey>
<joey> seconds later falls on our ass all right </joey>
<connor> taking it off walking the whole way yeah </connor>
<connor> so i'm going as fast as i can as i can </connor>
<connor> i'm like getting low to the ground like </connor>
<connor> get out of aerodynamics i get i get over </connor>
<connor> there and i'm like oh my god i made it </connor>
<connor> all right nice i'm waiting i'm like </connor>
<connor> they'll come any second now like 10 10 </connor>
<connor> minutes later they come around the </connor>
<connor> corner walking </connor>
<connor> and i was like what is this </connor>
<garnt> okay to be fair we did </garnt>
<garnt> we did attempt to snowboard to to me it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't a case of getting to the end to </garnt>
<garnt> me it was a case of how far can i get </garnt>
<garnt> before i fall over because like i knew </garnt>
<garnt> once i fought i fell over that was it </garnt>
<garnt> momentum was going i gotta take off my </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] it is hard to </connor>
<joey> uh go fast on a snowball much easier on </joey>
<joey> skis um i don't know i i just kind of </joey>
<joey> again i like i was like i'm i'm all </joey>
<connor> self-taught with it yeah so i just you </connor>
<connor> just kind of get a feeling for it oh </connor>
<joey> yeah sure yeah by the end of the week we </joey>
<connor> all i think definitely got a feeling for </connor>
<garnt> it go fast go fast i mean we were going </garnt>
<garnt> a hell of a lot faster on the last day </garnt>
<joey> compared to the first day that's true </joey>
<joey> like god was [ __ ] blitzing down this </joey>
<connor> mountain and i was like oh god he's </connor>
<joey> about to ssx tricky right now i could i </joey>
<connor> could feel it </connor>
<connor> yeah well we had to get back to like our </connor>
<connor> ski resort </connor>
<joey> and </joey>
<garnt> the they closed their like way of </garnt>
<garnt> getting over yeah yeah what would you </garnt>
<garnt> call the what's the another brilliant </garnt>
<garnt> thing what's the it's like a pathway </garnt>
<garnt> what's there's a word for this right </garnt>
<garnt> well pathway no no slalom </garnt>
<garnt> there's a i've got the word i forgot </garnt>
<garnt> what it was there's a word for like an </garnt>
<garnt> entrance </garnt>
<joey> that is like a i don't know </joey>
<joey> an entryway </joey>
<joey> you're literally using all the words i </joey>
<connor> know i know so there's a path right and </connor>
<connor> it closes at like 3 30. so we had so i i </connor>
<garnt> was like [ __ ] okay if you don't go back </garnt>
<garnt> over as well you have to get like a 30 </garnt>
<garnt> 40 minute bus ride yeah yeah and i'd i'd </garnt>
<garnt> rather kill myself than your bus </garnt>
<garnt> it's just so depressing when you've got </garnt>
<garnt> your ski gear yeah yeah you've got to </garnt>
<garnt> sit on this bus and it's like oh no i </garnt>
<garnt> why would i do that when i can ski back </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah i'm not so i me and ohara </garnt>
<garnt> were going to go back over and then we </garnt>
<garnt> asked the guys we're like are you guys </garnt>
<garnt> coming and they're like ah no we'll get </garnt>
<garnt> the bus because it was like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> tough we had to ski a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> quickly get on a chair lift ski over </garnt>
<garnt> then walk over and then ski back down it </garnt>
<garnt> is kind of difficult especially if </garnt>
<joey> you're tired right yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they weren't doing it and i was like all </joey>
<joey> right no worries we'll do it we'll do it </joey>
<garnt> so we were going and then right before </garnt>
<garnt> we were about to cross it they they </garnt>
<garnt> called us and they were like oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> actually we'll we'll do it i think we </garnt>
<garnt> can do it yeah run like oh [ __ ] it's </garnt>
<garnt> like mission impossible </garnt>
<garnt> gotta get these boys back i'm trying </garnt>
<garnt> to start saving private ryan back to the </garnt>
<garnt> hotel we've got to get them back over so </garnt>
<garnt> we had to quickly like rush these guys </garnt>
<joey> and we were like no falling just go </joey>
<garnt> don't don't stop just just be good </garnt>
<connor> yeah because they shut it off at 3 30 </connor>
<joey> for some reason i don't know why </joey>
<joey> it's just 3 30 the sun [ __ ] sets so </joey>
<joey> you just can't see anything especially </joey>
<joey> up there like even during the day the </joey>
<joey> visibility was so bad right that's </joey>
<garnt> pretty bad yeah yeah i definitely </garnt>
<garnt> understand why people will snow and ski </garnt>
<garnt> board from this trip though especially </garnt>
<garnt> on the last day where the visibility was </garnt>
<garnt> clear and i just kind of realized oh </garnt>
<connor> snowboarding and skiing is just hiking </connor>
<connor> but the fun part </connor>
<connor> right because you're going down yeah go </connor>
<connor> go you got the </connor>
<garnt> you get like the amazing view but you </garnt>
<garnt> don't have to put in the effort of like </garnt>
<connor> getting that amazing view isn't it crazy </connor>
<connor> when you like you're on the ground and </connor>
<garnt> you look up at the mountain and you see </garnt>
<garnt> us steep some of these things yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and you're like [ __ ] i i skied down </garnt>
<garnt> there i snowballed down there it's crazy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i remember on the first day </garnt>
<garnt> when we stayed on the beginner slope so </garnt>
<garnt> the beginner slope had this ski lift to </garnt>
<garnt> take us up the beginning slope and </garnt>
<joey> taking us up because it was so slow it </joey>
<garnt> took us like what 15 minutes i think </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like 10 10 10 10 15 minutes so </joey>
<garnt> in my mind i'm like oh we're going up </garnt>
<garnt> like half the mountain holy [ __ ] and </garnt>
<garnt> then i remember on the second day when </garnt>
<garnt> conor was like oh yeah we're gonna go to </garnt>
<garnt> the top of the mountain today and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like cool where was the beginner slope </garnt>
<garnt> and he points this point which is like a </garnt>
<garnt> tenth of the way up the mountain and </garnt>
<joey> you're like </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<joey> you mean you mean we were this low </joey>
<joey> but the view was so good it was already </joey>
<garnt> amazing what's going on </garnt>
<garnt> 10 out of 10 would uh recommend skiing </garnt>
<garnt> to uh anyone who like me as a kid one </garnt>

<connor> it's auto chess isn't it what does that </connor>
<connor> mean i don't [ __ ] know it's hard to </connor>
<joey> explain right because like </joey>
<joey> it doesn't like the blockchain yeah it's </joey>
<joey> not the blockchain it like it's a game </joey>
<joey> that you can't easily describe </joey>
<joey> how you describe kind of like the </joey>
<joey> blockchain </joey>
<joey> maybe if god played it he's really god's </joey>
<connor> really good at giving short descriptions </connor>
<connor> to stuff i've noticed </connor>
<garnt> that's why it's my job that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> literally what i do </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not when i play this game it's like </garnt>
<garnt> well it's kind of like ah </garnt>
<connor> it's like a </connor>
<connor> battle simulation </connor>
<connor> chess thing you buy units and then you </connor>
<connor> place them and then it plays out on its </connor>
<connor> own the battle </connor>
<connor> so it's like tower defense but chess but </connor>
<connor> then every like it's one battle and then </connor>
<connor> you you lose health all don't miss </connor>
<connor> health depending on what happens yeah </connor>
<joey> but like tower defense is kind of like </joey>
<joey> that right you buy units and then it </joey>
<garnt> plays away right yeah but you're playing </garnt>
<connor> against another player </connor>
<garnt> so you're so he's buying stuff and </garnt>
<garnt> you're buying stuff and you're placing </garnt>
<garnt> them on the board right and then you go </garnt>
<garnt> against each other and then you have to </garnt>
<garnt> you also get like stuff that comes up </garnt>
<garnt> and you it's a game gambling but like </garnt>
<garnt> there's like rerolling for like more </garnt>
<garnt> choices </garnt>
<garnt> it is a very boring game when you </garnt>
<garnt> explain it extremely so </garnt>
<garnt> right it's fun you say that about most </garnt>
<joey> things it's one of those games again </joey>
<garnt> like i wouldn't recommend playing it </garnt>
<garnt> alone there's uh </garnt>
<garnt> with friends it's great yeah i think </garnt>
<garnt> with friends it's really fun yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of ways it's like chill </garnt>
<connor> because it's not too intense like you </connor>
<connor> can talk like league is too intense i </connor>
<garnt> feel league like i never like i've tried </garnt>
<garnt> playing league with mates before and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just that silent guy because i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> concentrating too much on the gameplay </garnt>
<garnt> to be able to communicate with my </garnt>
<garnt> friends um or like have a good time it's </garnt>
<connor> great there's a lot of down time in the </connor>
<garnt> game yeah you're not doing anything so </garnt>
<garnt> you can just chat yeah it's you can do </garnt>
<connor> it very casually it's really chill yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's a fun game i recommend it okay i've </garnt>
<garnt> been i've also have been trying to game </garnt>
<connor> i've been trying to get can i sound any </connor>
<garnt> more boomer </garnt>
<connor> but i've been trying to find a game to </connor>
<joey> get into still still kind of looking uh </joey>
<joey> i started pokemon recently the newest </joey>
<garnt> pokemon uh the switch diamond first </garnt>
<connor> pokemon ever right huh is it your first </connor>
<garnt> pokemon game ever no it's not my first </garnt>
<garnt> pokemon game ever it's my first pokemon </garnt>
<connor> since pokemon ruby </connor>
<joey> the original pokemon ruby holy [ __ ] on </joey>
<connor> the uh </connor>
<garnt> i don't know when does pokemon get good </garnt>
<connor> i've forgotten that that means you're </connor>
<connor> playing it yeah no no that means she's </connor>
<garnt> not enjoying it yeah i'm i'm not really </garnt>
<garnt> enjoying it i'll be honest because i've </garnt>
<connor> done like the first two like gyms now </connor>
<connor> for pokemon diamond and i'm just like i </connor>
<connor> remember being huh that's it oh that's </connor>
<joey> well that's to be fair that's how far i </joey>
<connor> got it's like [ __ ] ten minutes </connor>
<garnt> it's like it's like two two hours two </garnt>
<joey> three four hours yeah </joey>
<joey> is it really </joey>
<joey> it's i mean it's like maybe like an hour </joey>
<joey> is it there's a lot of dialogue you have </joey>
<garnt> to sift through there is a lot of </garnt>
<joey> dialogue a lot of like because okay </joey>
<garnt> here's the thing when you go to newtown </garnt>
<garnt> do you talk to everyone [ __ ] no okay i </garnt>
<joey> talk to everyone i'm like i'm like okay </joey>
<joey> this is he's a classic jrpg this is this </joey>
<garnt> is me this is jrp </garnt>
<joey> being like i have to talk to everyone </joey>
<joey> and about </joey>
<joey> i can't miss the items right about an </joey>
<joey> hour and i'm just like this is really </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] boring </connor>
<connor> but why are you talking every so often </connor>
<garnt> they give me an item so i must talk to </garnt>
<garnt> everyone otherwise i'm not going to get </garnt>
<connor> all of the items a potion yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> five five hundred of them they gave me </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes they give me a super potion oh </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> it's like 500 pokemon how many potions </garnt>
<garnt> like not needed to change my pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> once since like my main pokemon yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe uh maybe my experience is </garnt>
<garnt> different from my experience as a </garnt>
<garnt> childhood because as a child </garnt>
<garnt> it was just so easy for me to immerse </garnt>
<connor> myself into a game this is why pokemon </connor>
<joey> like challenges are so good and they've </joey>
<joey> got that's why people love them on </joey>
<joey> youtube like it's a way to turn a </joey>
<connor> pokemon game into a more challenging and </connor>
<connor> i suppose adult </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> way more fun i can't i can't play </joey>
<joey> pokemon vanilla anymore i have to make </joey>
<garnt> it a challenge so fun randomizers are </garnt>
<joey> fun because because i i came into this </joey>
<joey> thinking i haven't played pokemon since </joey>
<joey> pokemon ruby i can just play this </joey>
<joey> casually and have kind of the same </joey>
<joey> experience i did as i did as a kid yeah </joey>
<joey> and i don't know if i'm just not far </joey>
<garnt> enough into the game yet but i mean to </garnt>
<garnt> me like two three hours into a game is </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> mostly most of the time that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> give a game before i'm just like do i </garnt>
<garnt> stick with this game and fully commit or </garnt>
<garnt> do i try another game i don't think you </garnt>
<connor> like the game gun maybe maybe i don't </connor>
<connor> maybe i don't maybe you should try a </connor>
<connor> nuzlocke version of it that'd be more </connor>
<connor> fun what's the mazlock again nuzlocke is </connor>
<connor> like permadeath basically oh so if you </connor>
<joey> poke my face you die it dies quote </joey>
<connor> unquote and you have to release it and </connor>
<connor> you can only catch one pokemon in one </connor>
<joey> area there's lots of different rules </joey>
<joey> it's really good there's lots of local </joey>
<joey> rules as well you can you can kind of </joey>
<joey> mix it up with like different other </joey>
<garnt> rules why wouldn't you just if your </garnt>
<garnt> pokemon's gonna die why wouldn't you </garnt>
<joey> just like grind like crazy well i mean </joey>
<joey> some people do but the challenge but </joey>
<joey> then there's a challenge element of like </joey>
<joey> do i want to grind for 50 hours or do i </joey>
<connor> just want to like gamble and go for it a </connor>
<connor> lot of the time people aren't willing to </connor>
<connor> grind for 20 hours just to secure that </connor>
<connor> pokemon well it's more fun and on stream </connor>
<garnt> it's very good it's very good </garnt>
<garnt> it sounds like great stream content that </garnt>
<garnt> just sounds stressful to me it is </garnt>
<joey> stressful yeah </joey>
<connor> that looks a hell stress i saw someone </connor>
<connor> do uh one pp challenge what's that </connor>
<joey> every pokemon they're only allowed to </joey>
<connor> use the move once oh [ __ ] in like one </connor>
<connor> battle i think yeah yeah unless it heals </connor>
<joey> up again right yeah yeah there's there's </joey>
<joey> some pretty [ __ ] obscure challenges </joey>
<joey> and there's the soul link which looks </joey>
<joey> really good </joey>
<garnt> basically like where you both of you do </garnt>
<garnt> another together and like if joey's </garnt>
<connor> pokemon dies when we caught it at the </connor>
<connor> same time my pokemon dies too yeah </connor>
<garnt> do you think pokemon should have a </garnt>
<garnt> difficulty setting i think they should </garnt>
<connor> just well i don't know why they haven't </connor>
<garnt> had their own nuzlocke into the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> game just call it whatever they want to </garnt>
<garnt> call it they'll they'll remove their </garnt>
<garnt> name nozzle because it's pokemon they </garnt>
<garnt> won't they don't give credit to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh but i don't know why they </garnt>
<garnt> haven't put it in the game people do it </garnt>
<joey> because it's at the end of the day it's </joey>
<connor> still a children's game yeah but like </connor>
<connor> people are doing this to their games </connor>
<connor> anyway and people are going to do it why </connor>
<connor> not just add the option like it's not </connor>
<joey> that it's a children's game </joey>
<joey> people but like surely adding like the </joey>
<joey> especially like a randomizer right </joey>
<joey> surely that's easy to add oh yeah it's </joey>
<connor> helpful go in the code be like random </connor>
<joey> all and yeah it should work right super </joey>
<garnt> easy i know because like for me i've </garnt>
<garnt> never i never got the pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> conversation before because i just </garnt>
<garnt> hadn't played a pokemon in so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> long but now that i've now now that i've </garnt>
<garnt> started to play i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> when does like when does this get fun </garnt>
<garnt> how long how long do i not need to be on </garnt>
<connor> autopilot for before this is yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<connor> you're playing normally i think if you </connor>
<connor> tried another lock on on a stream you'd </connor>
<garnt> enjoy it a lot but i i like if i'm not </garnt>
<joey> supposed to play it normally as a casual </joey>
<joey> player who knows zero about pokemon gold </joey>
<garnt> for that </garnt>
<connor> am i too old for that connor you've </connor>
<garnt> played too many games you know how to </garnt>
<garnt> game so i'm not even a gamer i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> even a gamer i'm not jrpgs right yeah i </garnt>
<joey> play like grinding for like 15 hours to </joey>
<joey> like get one sash or something i don't </joey>
<joey> know you're too good </joey>
<garnt> you're too good at like grinding yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but and pokemon now actually doesn't </garnt>
<connor> require any grinding you can just do it </connor>
<garnt> like you'll start a pokemon stomps when </garnt>
<garnt> did that happen i remember in the </garnt>
<connor> original pokemon as a kid i had to like </connor>
<joey> grind the [ __ ] out like even just like </joey>
<connor> the first two </connor>
<joey> first two gym leaders </joey>
<joey> that's so [ __ ] broken yeah </joey>
<connor> what did they have that was such a like </connor>
<joey> added that in like x and y i think no it </joey>
<connor> was before that i think really black and </connor>
<joey> white wait no oh no black and white they </joey>
<connor> didn't have it i think it was x and y it </connor>
<joey> was always an item but it always only </joey>
<joey> gave it to one pokemon yeah yeah and </joey>
<connor> then now they just they were like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it just turn it on for everyone you get </connor>
<joey> experience by catching pokemon as well </joey>
<garnt> which was never a thing yeah you get </garnt>
<garnt> experienced by catching when you catch a </garnt>
<garnt> pokemon yeah the pokemon in your party </garnt>
<garnt> get experience yeah yeah as if you as if </garnt>
<joey> you defeated it yeah they just they just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] they're just oprah winfrey and </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] the experience like you're </joey>
<joey> getting xp you hit exp </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> as as as a gacha gamer i'm disgusted by </garnt>
<garnt> the lack of grinding i need to do in </garnt>
<garnt> this game </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> as a gamer i'm disgusted by you </garnt>
<garnt> i haven't yeah i have been thinking to </garnt>
<joey> do maybe like shiny runs or like uh you </joey>
<garnt> know like stuff like that where it's </garnt>
<garnt> like a little more challenging you know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the really a really fun one i did </garnt>
<connor> was uh i did like a pokemon emerald mod </connor>
<connor> where when and whenever you enter a </connor>
<connor> building it teleports you to a random </connor>
<connor> part of the map oh yeah i've seen that </connor>
<connor> one that one was really fun but because </connor>
<joey> it was so [ __ ] hard because you had </joey>
<joey> to like route everything </joey>
<joey> on your own yeah so if you weren't </joey>
<joey> familiar with the map of the game you </joey>
<joey> were just [ __ ] true </joey>
<joey> that was really fun though because it's </joey>
<joey> like it gives on a completely different </joey>
<joey> challenge to it yeah it actually becomes </joey>
<garnt> like really entertaining and fun </garnt>
<joey> so all new pokemon games just this easy </joey>
<garnt> unless you like they all artificially </garnt>
<joey> add difficulty to your own run yeah okay </joey>
<joey> i'd say ever since like black and white </joey>
<joey> or x and y is where it's really starts </joey>
<garnt> like hold your hand i honest i </garnt>
<garnt> understand gamers now </garnt>
<garnt> i thought you guys were being babies </garnt>
<joey> complaining about this </joey>
<garnt> it actually it actually holds your hand </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<joey> especially if you've played pokemon ever </joey>
<joey> since the beginning yeah yeah i go from </joey>
<joey> that which is like if you catch a </joey>
<joey> pokemon you need to commit to leveling </joey>
<joey> it up oh dude like kids if i want to </joey>
<joey> give a kid today who grew up on like </joey>
<garnt> sword and shield yeah like the new </garnt>
<joey> remakes give them like the original blue </joey>
<joey> or like red and black play this game and </joey>
<joey> yeah watch them like have a mental </joey>
<joey> breakdown of how difficult it is </joey>
<garnt> compared to what they get today did you </garnt>
<connor> did you see the uh [ __ ] what was it </connor>
<garnt> called [ __ ] um i totally forgot no sorry </garnt>
<joey> oh </joey>
<connor> great </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> yeah no because i remember as a kid i </joey>
<joey> don't know it's it like some things just </joey>
<garnt> felt rewarding that i don't feel </garnt>
<connor> rewarded with this game for example when </connor>
<connor> you level up your pokemon every pokemon </connor>
<garnt> just levels up automatically yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> like it's like an auto leveler </connor>
<joey> it was the pokemon let's go eevee and </joey>
<joey> pikachu oh yeah yeah yeah they gave your </joey>
<joey> starter pokemon like increased stance </joey>
<garnt> the eevee or pikachu and it had a </garnt>
<garnt> special move yeah just one shot </garnt>
<connor> everything yeah so they gave they gave </connor>
<joey> you like a starter they could just one </joey>
<joey> shot the most [ __ ] part about evie i </joey>
<joey> really enjoyed evie to be fair but like </joey>
<joey> the most [ __ ] part about evie was uh </joey>
<joey> i did an eevee only run on stream once </joey>
<joey> because it's just so [ __ ] easy but </joey>
<joey> like in in some of the pokemons you go </joey>
<joey> to there's just this dude who's like i </joey>
<joey> can teach your eevee any move of any </joey>
<joey> type for free which one would you like </joey>
<joey> it's like fire move and it's like and </joey>
<joey> they're like really [ __ ] powerful </joey>
<joey> moves as well so it's like uh </joey>
<joey> what's the catch it's like no catch </joey>
<joey> it's because you talked to me i was like </joey>
<joey> oh good and i did i think i did the </joey>
<joey> eevee only run in like four hours it was </joey>
<joey> like one of the easiest [ __ ] games </joey>
<joey> ever </joey>
<garnt> i only did it because i like evie so </garnt>
<garnt> when it's like was it after pokemon ruby </garnt>
<garnt> that everything started to just get </garnt>
<joey> easy the original diamond and pearl was </joey>
<garnt> still like in that same difficulty range </garnt>
<garnt> right i think i reckon it was around </garnt>
<joey> like x and y like 6th gen </joey>
<joey> where they introduced like the whole </joey>
<joey> like experience sharing and like the </joey>
<garnt> really like holding your hand element </garnt>
<garnt> because sun and moon was just so like </garnt>
<garnt> ridiculously easy right same with sword </garnt>
<garnt> and shield as well and then everything </garnt>
<joey> every other remake since then it's just </joey>
<connor> been like baby mode i remember when i </connor>
<connor> was a kid in the games this is like </connor>
<garnt> boomer i remember i was back in my day </garnt>
<garnt> back in the morning every game was just </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] impossible [ __ ] yeah right but </connor>
<joey> now we've gone too far </joey>
<joey> i remember crying trying to beat the </joey>
<connor> first stage of mega man 2. you know i </connor>
<joey> ride a game on game boy right it was </joey>
<connor> dalmatians 101 </connor>

<garnt> the [ __ ] is going on i don't i don't </garnt>

<garnt> take the ip put it into the mario </garnt>
<garnt> universe change the [ __ ] design a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit you have a game </garnt>
<garnt> so that's what the mickey mouse game was </garnt>
<garnt> the one that i scammed to my friend </garnt>
<garnt> basically it was like it was basically </garnt>
<joey> just a mario platformer but it was </joey>
<connor> stupidly hard actually remember i had </connor>
<connor> this like ps1 game and it was like a </connor>
<garnt> shrek game </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a shrek </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> a shrek picnic game or something </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm sure shrek enthusiasts can </garnt>
<garnt> inform you about this game right right </garnt>
<garnt> remember the whole point of this game </garnt>
<garnt> was to like </garnt>
<garnt> you were assembling like i i could be </garnt>
<joey> describing this completely correctly </joey>
<joey> like the parts to your picnic </joey>
<joey> yeah and you had to go and like beat </joey>
<joey> bosses and [ __ ] but like nothing worked </joey>
<joey> in the game i remembered </joey>
<joey> i have to look this up okay can we </joey>
<joey> communicate </joey>
<joey> it doesn't sound like a real game shrek </joey>
<joey> ps1 games google it right shrek i just </joey>
<joey> remember it's like a fever dream in this </joey>
<garnt> game the polygons were so it's a shriek </garnt>
<garnt> treasure hunt that's it that's it this </garnt>
<joey> game right i played this game oh my god </joey>
<joey> there was like one polygon in this whole </joey>
<joey> that looks like arsed what is </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's 78 like this video game what </garnt>

<joey> with fiona the three blind mice steal </joey>
<joey> all the picnic equipment such as foods </joey>
<connor> and drinks so shrek must go on an </connor>
<connor> adventure doing mini games to get the </connor>
<connor> items back before fiona arrives </connor>
<connor> but i remember it was like a bunch of </connor>
<connor> mini games right and these mini games </connor>
<joey> just like all broken up it didn't work </joey>
<joey> i love games with these kinds of shitty </joey>
<joey> plots because you can just imagine it </joey>
<joey> just being like fiona i have to go again </joey>
<connor> i should've been with the hair the </connor>
<garnt> camera was like unusable and it kept </garnt>
<garnt> breaking my ps1 </garnt>
<garnt> and then eventually it like just broke </garnt>
<joey> and i was so close to the end of this </joey>
<garnt> game i was distraught yeah what's the </garnt>
<garnt> last picnic item i couldn't believe it i </garnt>
<garnt> remember you have to go to like some </garnt>
<garnt> castle or something to fight these </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] mice or something like that and </garnt>
<connor> i was just so angry that i couldn't </connor>
<joey> finish it i have to i have to find that </joey>
<connor> and play it you got to play it right </connor>
<connor> sounds amazing it's a great game it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you just stream it i guess i should </connor>
<joey> maybe i'll stream it if you want me to </joey>
<joey> i want to see it </joey>
<garnt> i actually have a game recommendation </garnt>
<joey> though that i found okay um it is a jrpg </joey>
<garnt> though all right </garnt>
<joey> it is called 13 sentinels oh i've heard </joey>
<garnt> of that have you heard of that yes so i </garnt>
<garnt> i've found this by like complete [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> accident because i'm just like trying to </garnt>
<garnt> look through my game library of like </garnt>
<garnt> games that sound interesting </garnt>
<garnt> and uh i just kind of downloaded it on a </garnt>
<garnt> whim because i'm just like anime game </garnt>
<garnt> brilliant yeah somehow it's not pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> anymore i say that but pokemon's an </garnt>
<garnt> anime game </garnt>
<garnt> but uh yeah i download it and it is got </garnt>
<garnt> it has got a really [ __ ] ins </garnt>
<garnt> interesting concept </garnt>
<garnt> so the story how i can best describe </garnt>
<garnt> this it's like if you take boca rano </garnt>
<garnt> and mix that with steins gates right </garnt>
<garnt> so the reason you have it's called 13 </garnt>
<garnt> sentinels is because you have like </garnt>
<garnt> basically you have 13 main characters </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and so the way this story unfolds is </garnt>
<garnt> that you're able to select </garnt>
<garnt> um a perspective of part of this main </garnt>
<garnt> character and the basis of this is uh at </garnt>
<garnt> some point in the future </garnt>
<garnt> um like [ __ ] kaiju come along and try </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] destroy the world </garnt>
<garnt> and so these 13 kids have to save the </garnt>
<garnt> world from this kaiju attack right but i </garnt>
<garnt> think they fail or something um so time </garnt>
<garnt> travel exists right </garnt>
<garnt> so you're watching you're playing this </garnt>
<garnt> perspective this game from like 13 </garnt>
<garnt> different perspectives and these </garnt>
<garnt> perspectives like jump between timelines </garnt>
<garnt> and universes depending on who you </garnt>
<garnt> choose </garnt>
<garnt> and you know and uh </garnt>
<garnt> whose perspective you're on um and you </garnt>
<garnt> think this would be a complete [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> mess right yeah like how can you tell a </garnt>
<garnt> coherent story when you can choose </garnt>
<garnt> between 13 different perspectives well </garnt>
<garnt> how how the game works is that you can </garnt>
<garnt> only progress to a certain amount of </garnt>
<garnt> point in one person's perspective before </garnt>
<garnt> you have to play another person's </garnt>
<garnt> perspective so one person's story </garnt>
<garnt> root is unlocked by playing a certain </garnt>
<garnt> part of another person's story roots </garnt>
<garnt> right so the way you would get you the </garnt>
<garnt> way you get delivered this story is like </garnt>
<garnt> little by little and you get to piece </garnt>
<garnt> together what the [ __ ] has happened </garnt>
<garnt> between </garnt>
<garnt> this entire [ __ ] timeline it's </garnt>
<joey> actually like insane it's cool yeah like </joey>
<joey> i remember yeah i remember my my twitch </joey>
<joey> chat like telling me all about it be </joey>
<joey> like you'd [ __ ] love this good </joey>
<garnt> ratings it does have good ratings that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's kind of that's kind of why </garnt>
<joey> i like aegis rim 13 13 sentinels aegis </joey>
<joey> room oh it's an atlas game of course </joey>
<joey> that's why it's good </joey>
<garnt> of course </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so so the gameplay is kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like a turn-based strategy it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> the the best way i can describe it like </joey>
<joey> it looks gorgeous yeah that looks cute </joey>
<joey> it looks really cute yeah it is a very </joey>
<garnt> atlas game i realized because it's </garnt>
<joey> basically a mix between a visual novel </joey>
<garnt> but with gameplay elements to break up </garnt>
<joey> the story of that visual novel switch </joey>
<joey> versions coming out in april this year </joey>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> but uh i i i highly recommend that </garnt>
<garnt> because that was just a that was that </garnt>
<garnt> was just something i played on the whim </garnt>
<garnt> because like i said i give everything </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> two hours or something try and grab me </garnt>
<garnt> and this one like grabbed me immediately </garnt>
<garnt> it has a very original storytelling </garnt>
<garnt> method and uh i'm about halfway through </garnt>
<garnt> and like they use like some of the </garnt>
<garnt> twists and turns i've seen in the story </garnt>
<garnt> are like [ __ ] insane atlas don't miss </garnt>
<joey> me yeah yeah you really don't miss yeah </joey>
<garnt> so except their new catherine game that </garnt>
<joey> was [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> i know more about the memes of the </garnt>
<garnt> catherine game than actual actual people </garnt>
<joey> that have played catherine </joey>
<garnt> it was not that good because it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> because like a lot of atlas games just i </garnt>
<garnt> hear more about the japanese side </garnt>
<connor> talking about it but like i'd hardly </connor>
<connor> ever hear anyone in the western </connor>
<connor> hemisphere talking about it unless it's </connor>
<joey> persona yeah that's basically the </joey>
<connor> western hemisphere or the western the </connor>
<joey> western world the western i don't know </joey>
<connor> why i said well i don't know why i said </connor>
<garnt> hemisphere there isn't japan in the </garnt>
<garnt> western hemisphere </garnt>
<connor> technically anywhere </connor>
<garnt> depending on where you're working i kind </garnt>
<garnt> of realized that yeah yeah i feel like </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> i feel it's because like in the west </garnt>
<connor> it's like very it's it's a very cool fan </connor>
<connor> base for those games you know yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because they are like the jrpg players </connor>
<connor> jrpgs a lot of people like anime game no </connor>
<garnt> thank you yeah exactly yeah they take </garnt>
<joey> one yeah rightfully </joey>
<garnt> yeah they take one look at the the </garnt>
<garnt> visuals or like the concept and they're </garnt>
<garnt> just like nope </garnt>
<garnt> i'd rather play bang bang bang </garnt>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> there's a certain kind of </joey>
<garnt> expectation that comes with anime games </garnt>
<garnt> that in my experience is always the same </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you always get that same feeling </garnt>
<garnt> yeah even if the stories are different </garnt>
<garnt> the gameplay is different something </garnt>
<joey> about it just always comes off as the </joey>
<joey> same in my mind i don't know why i don't </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<connor> i don't fault people after thinking that </connor>
<garnt> though that's what i like about it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's the consistency yeah i don't </garnt>
<garnt> fault people for thinking that though </garnt>
<garnt> because that's exactly how i feel with a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of fps games yeah where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> the concept is different but at the end </garnt>
<garnt> of the day it's still bang bang bang </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah so i i don't it's fine oh </garnt>
<garnt> no more jrpgs for me but like even like </garnt>
<garnt> western driven story driven games as </garnt>
<garnt> well it's just like i don't know i i </garnt>
<garnt> guess it's the same reason why i'm into </garnt>
<garnt> anime versus movies and tv shows right i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i will always watch a movie and tv </garnt>
<garnt> show but those aren't the core pieces of </garnt>
<garnt> entertainment that i like for example </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember playing the last of us and </garnt>
<joey> it's a great game but i just have like </joey>
<joey> zero emotional attachment to it like </joey>
<joey> right i i play it and i can like </joey>
<connor> objectively view as a anime huh because </connor>
<garnt> they're not </garnt>
<connor> if they were more anime you'd be like i </connor>
<garnt> care </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't know why it was just </garnt>
<garnt> it's the way western storytelling works </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's it's it's it's got like </garnt>
<garnt> different tropes and a different method </garnt>
<garnt> of storytelling but </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know why i gravitate more to </garnt>
<garnt> like the anime style of storytelling </garnt>
<garnt> because i i do think they do have a </garnt>
<connor> different style oh definitely definitely </connor>
<connor> different cultures yeah different </connor>
<connor> different cultures and everything like </connor>
<connor> that and you know the way joel and ellie </connor>
<connor> were written as characters were great </connor>
<garnt> they're they were great characters i </garnt>
<garnt> just i don't know i just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> emotionally attach myself to either of </garnt>
<garnt> those characters even though i could </garnt>
<connor> tell that they were great characters why </connor>
<connor> do you emotionally attach yourself more </connor>
<joey> to anime characters then </joey>
<joey> because he's a weeb </joey>
<connor> right like what what about the way that </connor>
<connor> they do their characters is more </connor>
<garnt> appealing i think it's because they're </garnt>
<connor> unrealistic i i was gonna say because </connor>
<connor> that's what bothers me yeah </connor>
<garnt> i i like the fact that with anime </garnt>
<garnt> characters there's like a clear </garnt>
<garnt> distinction between reality and fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> right and i i like having that easy </garnt>
<garnt> separation in my mind where you can have </garnt>
<joey> great </joey>
<joey> really well-written anime characters </joey>
<joey> that are still clearly like really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] unrealistic like just take any </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tsundere for example yeah you </joey>
<joey> can have great written cinderellas but </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day if you meet a real </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] real life singer you're just </joey>
<joey> going to think that they're they're a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] and </garnt>
<garnt> why why are they putting like why are </garnt>
<garnt> they doing domestic violence on their </garnt>
<connor> like partner or whatever right do you </connor>
<connor> think that the authors who are like </connor>
<connor> writing these are intentionally making </connor>
<connor> unrealistic characters or they that's </connor>
<connor> like they're they're intending to do </connor>
<connor> real characters but it just comes off as </connor>
<joey> unrealistic </joey>
<joey> i think it's i think it's all based on </joey>
<joey> just like not only like the cultural </joey>
<joey> understanding and like norm of that </joey>
<connor> author but it's also the fact that a lot </connor>
<connor> of these authors are also hashing off </connor>
<connor> other japanese creations and other </connor>
<connor> japanese characters right so yes you </connor>
<connor> know that like i i don't really know of </connor>
<joey> many or any like japanese author who </joey>
<garnt> takes direct influence from like western </garnt>
<joey> stuff for instance yeah right like the </joey>
<garnt> only one i can think of is like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> iraqi yeah you know which is why his </garnt>
<garnt> characters are so [ __ ] different </garnt>
<joey> compared to the traditional norm like </joey>
<joey> manga anime character character yeah not </joey>
<joey> just like visually but also like as like </joey>
<joey> a characteristic of that particular </joey>
<garnt> person right yeah like why why is like </garnt>
<joey> so many anime set in high school why is </joey>
<garnt> that like is that a cultural thing it's </garnt>
<joey> a cultural thing why why so it's because </joey>
<joey> it's for a lot of people </joey>
<connor> like high school is kind of seen as like </connor>
<connor> this basically like golden time </connor>
<connor> it's depressing </connor>
<connor> it's like for a lot of people high </connor>
<connor> school is like you know the whole thing </connor>
<garnt> of like in the west of like high school </garnt>
<garnt> is like you know usually movies that are </garnt>
<garnt> based in high school in the west are </garnt>
<garnt> based off bad memories yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> being like oh man my high school [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sucked blah blah blah there were all </garnt>
<garnt> these [ __ ] people the jocks the bullies </garnt>
<garnt> blah blah blah right that's the norm in </garnt>
<connor> the west in japan it's glorified because </connor>
<garnt> to a lot of people high school was a </garnt>
<connor> really fun time with like friends </connor>
<garnt> they'll never get back and like yeah the </garnt>
<connor> last because it's also the last years of </connor>
<connor> that person being young and free i mean </connor>
<connor> i liked high school but i wouldn't say i </connor>
<connor> liked my </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i think as well in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> like a storytelling like standpoint as </garnt>
<garnt> well like i feel like kids in high </garnt>
<garnt> school or like kids going through </garnt>
<joey> puberty is just already a really </joey>
<joey> interesting like character dynamic like </joey>
<joey> you can like you can get characters to </joey>
<joey> get away with a lot of [ __ ] just because </joey>
<garnt> they're in puberty yeah but i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many [ __ ] shows and so </garnt>
<joey> many anime where you look at the </joey>
<joey> characters and they could be in any </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] setting oh yeah yeah because </joey>
<joey> like some of the [ __ ] that these high </joey>
<joey> schoolers go through they like go </joey>
<joey> through like two world wars they're like </joey>
<joey> like they're like like fighting avengers </joey>
<garnt> level threats when they've reached the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] 13 years old and you're probably </joey>
<joey> not a well-written character yeah </joey>
<joey> that's clearly just an author being like </joey>
<joey> i like high school settings let's put </joey>
<joey> them into high school you know but don't </joey>
<joey> actually take full advantage of it </joey>
<joey> unfortunately but there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> authors that take full advantage of like </joey>
<joey> the high school characters and that </joey>
<garnt> whole setting and actually like work it </garnt>
<connor> into their characters and story mind you </connor>
<garnt> that's the minority in my opinion a lot </garnt>
<connor> of them are just like high school rel </connor>
<joey> realistic uh relatable with audience am </joey>
<joey> i right let's just throw them in there </joey>
<joey> you know i watched uh the gretzky the </joey>
<joey> new season oh it's good that was good </joey>
<joey> very refreshing depressing as you're </joey>
<joey> always depressing as [ __ ] yes which is </joey>
<joey> great to see because it's like one of </joey>
<joey> the only anime out there that will </joey>
<connor> actually like commentate </connor>
<connor> on adult life in japan and be realistic </connor>
<joey> about yeah </joey>
<joey> but it also says a lot when it no one </joey>
<garnt> knows about it in japan yeah is that </garnt>
<garnt> true it is absolutely it is absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> unknown in japan oh [ __ ] yeah like it is </garnt>
<garnt> not popular at all probably because it's </garnt>
<garnt> too real </garnt>
<connor> in japan very japanese things in it as </connor>
<garnt> well it's so japanese but like yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> such a good take on the japanese works </connor>
<garnt> like awesome how awful it is yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> cause like i i mean it's ironic that </garnt>
<garnt> this has come from the same company that </garnt>
<garnt> you know made hello kitty yeah </garnt>
<garnt> just to put it into perspective like how </garnt>
<joey> deep they're going so in japan right </joey>
<garnt> they have a thing called say shine right </garnt>
<joey> yeah which is like an employee for life </joey>
<joey> yeah you can't you can never fire this </joey>
<joey> employee they have to do something like </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] right they have to leave </joey>
<joey> on their own right but like even the </joey>
<joey> only way they can get fired is if they </joey>
<joey> actually do something like illegal right </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> the only way they can leave that you </joey>
<joey> cannot it's like going to jail you could </joey>
<garnt> literally do the shittiest job on earth </garnt>
<joey> like you could like not turn up and you </joey>
<joey> cannot be fired right yeah so in japan </joey>
<joey> obviously because they decided job </joey>
<garnt> security so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so obviously if you told that to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> in any western country they'd be like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think that sounds like a good idea </garnt>
<garnt> and because it's not because it's not </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like let's just be honest </garnt>
<garnt> obviously job security is good and you </garnt>
<garnt> know that's that's good but like it's a </garnt>
<garnt> terrible idea for any business right </garnt>
<garnt> like you need you need to be able to get </garnt>
<garnt> rid of employees yeah yeah of course but </garnt>
<garnt> obviously in the west we you know it's a </garnt>
<garnt> little uh </garnt>
<garnt> especially in some places they're a </garnt>
<garnt> little too happy to fire employees yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah so you know it has to be </garnt>
<garnt> a balance it's a balance there's a whole </garnt>
<garnt> arc or like story in the new season i </garnt>
<garnt> won't spoil who it is or what it is but </garnt>
<garnt> there's a character who uh because they </garnt>
<garnt> can't fire him uh they just relocate him </garnt>
<garnt> to some [ __ ] and they don't give him </garnt>
<garnt> any work yeah and they basically just </garnt>
<connor> like morally make him want to quit yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah and it's a whole thing and </garnt>
<joey> it's pretty [ __ ] that's the only way </joey>
<garnt> that says shane can quit yeah so they </garnt>
<joey> they basically just pressure yeah they </joey>
<connor> bully you yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah so so there's a whole thing where </joey>
<joey> they like just make him [ __ ] off and </joey>
<garnt> like make him you know because obviously </garnt>
<garnt> people are people don't want to people </garnt>
<garnt> want to be valued right when they do </garnt>
<garnt> work right and if you're just not doing </garnt>
<garnt> anything you're going to be like why am </garnt>
<garnt> i here yeah obviously if i was there i'd </garnt>
<garnt> be like fantastic i can catch up </garnt>
<garnt> fantastic let's uh let's just play apex </garnt>
<garnt> that's why it works in japan </garnt>
<joey> i'm like are you telling me i could just </joey>
<joey> do whatever i want </joey>
<joey> and you're gonna give me the salary </joey>
<joey> what's going on </joey>
<joey> what's the latest the great school </joey>
<garnt> season </garnt>
<garnt> all right thanks for the paycheck </garnt>
<garnt> this is where i'm never gonna be hired </garnt>
<garnt> full-time say </garnt>
<garnt> that i've said that </garnt>
<garnt> this is bad maybe that's for the better </garnt>
<joey> yeah true true yeah they go to some </joey>
<garnt> really dark stuff and it's a shame that </garnt>
<connor> it's not being japanese i feel like it </connor>
<joey> could make waves maybe it's too real i </joey>
<joey> think it is i think it's just purely the </joey>
<joey> fact that you know a japanese person </joey>
<joey> will look at that and be like i don't </joey>
<joey> want to see this because it's just going </joey>
<joey> to remind me of a reality and uh so a </joey>
<joey> lot of japanese people that's not the </joey>
<connor> reason why they're watching there's not </connor>
<connor> really one [ __ ] dark bit i mean i'm </connor>
<joey> sure you can remember it in the new </joey>
<connor> season right can i spoil it i won't say </connor>
<joey> who it is i'll just say what happens </joey>
<joey> oh no no i know what you're talking </joey>
<connor> about yeah yeah maybe we should you </connor>
<connor> can't say this really is it that bad </connor>
<joey> it's a it's a bit of a it's a bit of a </joey>
<connor> twist all right yeah yeah yeah i've been </connor>
<joey> watching this just pretty much just </joey>
<connor> watch later season it's [ __ ] amazing </connor>
<connor> honestly your great scary is like </connor>
<garnt> killing it i've i've heard mixed mixed </garnt>
<connor> reviews about the fourth season actually </connor>
<connor> really some people have said that it's </connor>
<connor> just like it's </connor>
<connor> said everything it's needed to say now </connor>
<connor> and it's getting like it's like they're </connor>
<connor> trying a lot </connor>
<garnt> to like bring something new on the table </garnt>
<connor> first five episodes really good yeah </connor>
<garnt> last first episodes boring [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like completely unnecessary i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> like it that's how i felt yeah i felt </garnt>
<connor> like they had a good thing going </connor>
<joey> and then they just definitely it fizzles </joey>
<joey> out at the end yeah right right but it's </joey>
<connor> still a salt season though i also </connor>
<garnt> watched uh all of my sugar contents oh </garnt>
<connor> i'll see you watching adam i said i said </connor>
<garnt> i was going to all of it </garnt>
<garnt> one entrance round </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's a bunch of comments </garnt>
<garnt> that are like i hope connor doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> watch it because i know he's going to </garnt>
<garnt> hate it </garnt>
<garnt> did you hate it </garnt>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> wow i liked it wow okay okay that was </connor>
<connor> good honestly yeah it's really good um </connor>
<connor> i can see why people think i would hate </connor>

<connor> like </connor>
<connor> all right </connor>
<connor> we're champ </connor>
<garnt> all right </garnt>
<connor> i mean listen listen the way it starts </connor>

<garnt> he gets he gets isakai does you do </garnt>
<garnt> because he's the first isakai right </garnt>
<joey> that's all i knew about it was it was </joey>
<garnt> the only thing i knew about the show is </garnt>
<garnt> that it was the first e6 i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> whenever conor hears isa kill i like </garnt>
<connor> flashbacks of like me talking like yeah </connor>
<garnt> basically basically </garnt>
<garnt> and so you know i went into this with an </garnt>
<garnt> open mind i didn't read any reviews i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't watch any videos i didn't i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know anything about my shock attention </garnt>

<garnt> he doesn't he didn't just admire the </garnt>
<garnt> tits he like makes a shrine out of like </garnt>
<garnt> one of their panties right yeah so the </garnt>
<connor> whole first like two episodes it was </connor>
<garnt> just him being like an insect </garnt>
<joey> i completely forgot about that </joey>
<connor> that was the one episode of just like a </connor>
<joey> race because i was like he's like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and i was like are we </joey>
<joey> seriously just gonna watch </joey>
<joey> a guy </joey>
<joey> another show where an in-cell just gets </joey>
<joey> rewarded with like a massive [ __ ] in the </joey>
<joey> new universe bestowed confidence uh </joey>
<garnt> magical powers the most opie guy and </garnt>
<garnt> never has to overcome the fact that he </garnt>
<garnt> has really unhealthy views towards women </garnt>
<garnt> and sex and everything yeah but this one </garnt>
<garnt> was good because i felt like they he </garnt>
<garnt> actually at least somewhat </garnt>
<garnt> learned that hey maybe maybe the way i </garnt>
<garnt> viewed women was kind of [ __ ] up in </garnt>
<connor> the past yeah and i was like </connor>
<garnt> holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it can be done </garnt>
<joey> and they can do it not only was this the </joey>
<joey> first this guy but it was the first </joey>
<connor> self-realized insult on top of that it </connor>
<connor> was a good show and i was like i was </connor>
<connor> like this is great this is fantastic </connor>
<connor> because not only was the world building </connor>
<connor> amazing i was really i was really like </connor>
<connor> into the world i loved all the </connor>
<connor> characters you know even the parents who </connor>
<connor> they usually could have just been like </connor>
<connor> oh it's just [ __ ] parents i was </connor>
<garnt> really surprised fill everything up yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was really surprised when the parents </garnt>
<joey> were just characters because normally </joey>
<joey> you see like anime parents are just like </joey>
<joey> half the time they're not even [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> there yeah you know and i remember </joey>
<joey> watching when they are there you can't </joey>
<joey> see their eyes yeah i remember like </joey>
<joey> watching because i'm like so used to </joey>
<joey> like isaikai speed running this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> right where like he gets transported he </joey>
<connor> starts like getting the girl starts </connor>
<connor> beating up the dudes i don't know i'm </connor>
<connor> like five episodes into my show </connor>
<connor> contestant i'm like what the [ __ ] he's </connor>
<connor> still with the parents what the [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> going on </connor>
<connor> what's going on and then i realized wait </connor>
<garnt> a minute so i'm actually getting </garnt>
<garnt> invested in the the the family dynamic </garnt>
<joey> and the family story and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> really it's like the slow cooker </garnt>
<joey> obviously guys </joey>
<connor> everything else is just like a microwave </connor>
<connor> you know can i explore one minor plot </connor>
<joey> point it's not a big deal it's really </joey>
<connor> not a big deal but she's spoiled </connor>
<connor> the moment i knew the show was built </connor>
<connor> different </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<connor> was the </connor>
<garnt> sitting there you're not watching </garnt>
<garnt> episode six or seven it just starts and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the first thing that happens </garnt>
<garnt> is it's like normal family life is like </garnt>
<garnt> the husband has cheated on the wife with </garnt>
<garnt> the maid yeah and she's pregnant and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] is this show doing like what </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] is going on there was like a </garnt>
<garnt> whole point where he like our 10 year </garnt>
<garnt> old protagonist was diffusing this jerry </garnt>
<garnt> springer episode and i'm like i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> what is </garnt>
<garnt> was like i was like is this good this is </garnt>
<connor> good right i think this is fun this is </connor>
<connor> great yeah </connor>
<connor> and then and then they actually get into </connor>
<connor> like world building later on and it's </connor>
<garnt> amazing yeah i mean what i like about it </garnt>
<garnt> is that it does take that time to like </garnt>
<joey> build up [ __ ] with like all this like </joey>
<joey> jerry springer [ __ ] just to say like hey </joey>
<joey> dad's kind of an [ __ ] as well he can </joey>
<joey> do he can do [ __ ] bad things you know </joey>
<joey> he ain't the perfect human being and </joey>
<joey> then like it helps it just like it all </joey>
<joey> plays a part into like his journey i </joey>
<garnt> guess i think the biggest down point was </garnt>
<garnt> you finish the first season you're like </garnt>
<garnt> this this the story hasn't even begun </garnt>
<connor> yeah i thought i missed an episode or </connor>
<connor> something when it ended i was looking </connor>
<garnt> because i thought oh i'm on episode 11. </garnt>
<garnt> it must be 12 because it ended so bro </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh yeah i was like oh where is it </garnt>
<joey> it's episode 12. and then i was starting </joey>
<connor> on the new season oh saying i mean that </connor>
<joey> that i had one less episode you had a </joey>
<joey> hit on me i've only seen first season </joey>
<joey> sex scene is amazing yeah the second </joey>
<garnt> season is really good second season </garnt>
<joey> where is where you get so much of the </joey>
<garnt> payoff </garnt>
<garnt> of what was like the world building </garnt>
<garnt> that's built up from the first season </garnt>
<connor> yeah i would be quite annoyed if i </connor>
<connor> watched it and season two wasn't out </connor>
<garnt> because i think yeah i felt i feel blue </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah but it was a great </garnt>
<garnt> show like again like i wanna i wanna i </garnt>
<joey> can't give credit enough but the fact </joey>
<joey> that they actually like just something </joey>
<joey> different did something different and it </joey>
<connor> and it worked and the fact that this is </connor>
<connor> like the first isakai which makes me </connor>
<joey> like really concerned yeah like why did </joey>
<joey> they not take </joey>
<connor> the good parts of this [ __ ] so like what </connor>
<connor> i can't understand is how they take this </connor>
<garnt> concept of like the main guy being an </garnt>
<garnt> insult right yeah that's what he is </garnt>
<joey> right i'm gonna keep saying it i i </joey>
<connor> absolutely hate these characters as well </connor>
<joey> yeah right because what was that uh </joey>
<joey> correct technically the light novels </joey>
<garnt> were like re-zero and like yeah i was </garnt>
<garnt> okay yeah i was i was going to correct </garnt>
<garnt> him afterwards so it's not the first </garnt>
<garnt> isekai but it's one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> prominent isekai's that popularized a </garnt>
<connor> lot of this popularity okay okay </connor>
<connor> why </connor>
<connor> why when okay so let's say this is like </connor>
<connor> one of the first big ones right if </connor>
<garnt> everyone is trying to take from this why </garnt>
<garnt> do they take all the worst assets </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> because each kind of me is like like i </garnt>
<garnt> said earlier it's just dudes who like </garnt>
<garnt> don't have to ever like address the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that they were shitty in the life before </garnt>
<joey> and they just get a free do-over where </joey>
<garnt> they get everything done for them yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean it's it's weird seeing like because </garnt>
<garnt> it was weird watching this after </garnt>
<garnt> watching so many isakai that have been </garnt>
<garnt> inspired by this show because with most </garnt>
<garnt> genres you have like the progenitor </garnt>
<garnt> right the thing that popularized a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of the tropes and by the time </garnt>
<joey> by the time you watch that one right you </joey>
<joey> you've already seen all the tropes </joey>
<joey> before so you're like well this just </joey>
<joey> feels dated now like i'd like i don't </joey>
<joey> get why everyone hyped this thing up in </joey>
<joey> the first place because by the time you </joey>
<joey> see it everyone's already done all the </joey>
<joey> tropes differently and better yeah right </joey>
<joey> yeah but with mushokadense it's like </joey>
<joey> so many so many stories just missed the </joey>
<joey> point of why </joey>
<joey> this isakai is the way it is you know </joey>
<joey> why is it an easter egg in the first </joey>
<joey> place well it's because </joey>
<joey> he's transported to another world to </joey>
<joey> give himself another chance at life and </joey>
<joey> a lot of stories took that as just oh </joey>
<joey> let's just put this kind of fantasy </joey>
<joey> world and just disregard the fact that </joey>
<joey> he had a previous life you know that's </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> there's like there's so many subtle </joey>
<joey> things about michoacan tennessee as a </joey>
<joey> story that i feel just got </joey>
<joey> lost over time yeah in like the </joey>
<joey> different iterations of ec </joey>
<joey> that's not to say there's there's not </joey>
<joey> other sky shows that's come after it </joey>
<garnt> that haven't been good but like </garnt>
<joey> it's it seems like yeah they're a dime a </joey>
<connor> dozen yeah it's yeah oh yeah like the </connor>
<joey> fact that he had to sorry to go jordan </joey>
<garnt> yeah it just seems like so many stories </garnt>
<garnt> just took the surface level elements of </garnt>
<garnt> this story without really thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> why those elements were there in the </garnt>
<connor> first place this is like maybe re-zero </connor>
<connor> did this a little bit but not to the </connor>
<connor> same extent but like this is the only </connor>
<connor> other issue that i've watched i'm sure </connor>
<garnt> there are others have done it where like </garnt>
<garnt> he actually had to like deal with the </garnt>
<garnt> trauma and fears that he had in his pr </garnt>
<garnt> past life carried over into this one </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like let's say you come </garnt>
<garnt> into this new life right and you were </garnt>
<garnt> scared of snakes you're not gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> magically not scared of snakes </garnt>
<garnt> you've got the same brain right like </garnt>
<garnt> he's still scared of going outside i </garnt>
<garnt> like that they had to deal with that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah like i love that he had to </garnt>
<garnt> work through all of his issues of course </garnt>
<garnt> i wanted the plot to go ahead and i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted him to like become op and like </garnt>
<garnt> kill everything and become the giga chad </garnt>
<garnt> but i also wanted to see him actually </garnt>
<joey> have to work through the [ __ ] you wanted </joey>
<joey> it to be believable when it happens </joey>
<joey> right yeah and it's so much better </joey>
<connor> payoff when you get to see that yeah </connor>
<joey> absolutely because like i was also </joey>
<garnt> at the point where i was like when's the </garnt>
<garnt> i'm enjoying this but when's the plot </garnt>
<garnt> gonna happen and then i've slowly come </garnt>
<garnt> to realize that whenever an episode is </garnt>
<garnt> labeled turning point i'm just like pack </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] put your seat belts on boys </joey>
<joey> because some some [ __ ] is gonna go down </joey>
<joey> like and i've heard from like like novel </joey>
<joey> readers that they're just like oh just </joey>
<joey> wait till you get like to turning point </joey>
<joey> four or five or something i'm like </joey>
<joey> that's turning point five what what is </joey>
<garnt> going on that's so good basically just a </garnt>
<connor> drift course </connor>
<joey> i love shows that are confident in their </joey>
<joey> world </joey>
<garnt> and like they don't need the characters </garnt>
<joey> to be the world yeah it's like they they </joey>
<joey> assume the world lives independently </joey>
<joey> from the characters it's like you're </joey>
<joey> just you just we just happen to be </joey>
<joey> following some characters in this world </joey>
<connor> that's interesting we could follow any </connor>
<connor> of the characters and you still have a </connor>
<connor> great time i honestly i'll give it like </connor>
<garnt> a nine out of ten so far because i i </garnt>
<garnt> feel i feel like like a proud father </garnt>
<connor> i love it i love it </connor>
<garnt> honestly it's so good like if you're </garnt>
<connor> like me and you're so done with isa kai </connor>
<connor> i would give this one a shot it is </connor>
<connor> genuinely worth it when's this episode </connor>
<connor> coming out </connor>
<connor> up probably the yeah of the month right </connor>
<garnt> end of the month end of the month of </garnt>
<garnt> february i think early first week of </garnt>
<garnt> february first week of february why </garnt>
<garnt> what's up </garnt>
<garnt> the first week of every year all right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's why i gave me show content </garnt>
<garnt> semi anime of the year </garnt>
<connor> i just didn't want to spoil that </connor>
<garnt> no i mean i i understand i feel like i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i haven't watched like odd taxi or </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that yet but yeah i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> was watching it and i'm like god damn </garnt>
<connor> it's doing everything right yeah i don't </connor>
<garnt> know i can't complain about anything </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean the only thing i put it </garnt>
<garnt> above that was arcane uh as </garnt>
<garnt> as the best show of this year it's been </garnt>
<connor> zero days </connor>
<connor> literally arcade okay okay okay okay </connor>
<garnt> movies i don't know arcade's pretty damn </garnt>
<garnt> good though okay arcane's pretty damn </garnt>
<garnt> good um but yeah i mean that's uh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm i'm i'm so [ __ ] happy i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] happy about that it's it's </garnt>
<joey> like when your son finally starts </joey>
<garnt> getting an introduction like football </garnt>
<garnt> all the way down gratification feels </garnt>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<connor> you're happy i like what if i came in </connor>
<connor> here guns blazing and [ __ ] can't i i </connor>
<connor> honestly thought you wouldn't like it </connor>
<garnt> because why why why'd you think that </garnt>
<garnt> because like a lot of the characters </garnt>
<connor> like i said before they are well written </connor>
<connor> characters but a lot of them are like </connor>
<connor> very tropey you know very awesome yeah </connor>
<connor> very trophy but i still think like </connor>
<connor> they're well-written characters </connor>
<garnt> um but i just i just i just thought </garnt>
<garnt> you'd look at that and just be like not </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] cinderella with like red hair </garnt>
<connor> i mean she was annoying yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> she was probably my least favorite </garnt>
<garnt> character yeah out of all the characters </garnt>
<joey> yeah i felt like you know it's it is </joey>
<connor> hard to look past the trope sometimes i </connor>
<connor> didn't really like the main character </connor>
<garnt> much actually i didn't really like him </garnt>
<garnt> as well well i i kind of liked but i </garnt>
<connor> understand yeah he's not i don't think </connor>
<connor> his intention was to make him likeable </connor>
<garnt> yeah i actually think who's the </garnt>
<connor> character i probably the character i </connor>
<connor> liked the most actually was the spur i </connor>
<connor> love the spelling the green the snake </connor>
<garnt> the green hair guy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah he's sick like you said i </garnt>
<garnt> like the languages that they actually </garnt>
<garnt> spoke languages i know right that was </garnt>
<joey> cool yeah that was really refreshing </joey>
<garnt> yeah for once where you're like are they </garnt>
<joey> speaking a foreign language because </joey>
<connor> they're always just speaking japanese </connor>
<joey> finally </joey>
<connor> because i remember when they were </connor>
<connor> speaking i'm just like when are they </connor>
<connor> gonna switch to japanese it's just like </connor>
<garnt> world building man they just </garnt>
<garnt> make sure like </garnt>
<garnt> and then you know it pays off when he he </garnt>
<connor> learns how to speak these languages yeah </connor>
<garnt> like oh my god oh my god this is what </garnt>
<connor> it's like to learn a language oh my god </connor>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> a reasonable boundaries like the real </joey>
<joey> world it's like the real world holy [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> who would have [ __ ] thought </garnt>
<garnt> i have so much of an appreciation </garnt>
<garnt> appreciation for that knowing what he </garnt>
<connor> went through to learn that </connor>
<garnt> this is one of those </garnt>
<joey> shows where i'm actually glad it's a </joey>
<joey> light novel before it's an anime or </joey>
<garnt> anything because i think that it's </garnt>
<joey> really going to benefit from </joey>
<joey> being in uh like a long form written </joey>
<joey> yeah so you can hash out the details so </joey>
<joey> they can really get like the world set </joey>
<garnt> because you know sometimes when shows </garnt>
<garnt> come this big right they kind of get to </garnt>
<garnt> the point with like oh we gotta we gotta </garnt>
<garnt> get the seasons out come on people yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's the hot [ __ ] come on we gotta </garnt>
<garnt> finish it yeah so i'm hoping that </garnt>
<connor> doesn't happen i hope the anime because </connor>
<connor> i'm not gonna read the light novels </connor>
<garnt> because the anime is so good and why </garnt>
<garnt> would i yeah i mean like the anime is so </garnt>
<garnt> good the production values were like </garnt>
<garnt> insane yeah um like some of some of the </garnt>
<connor> too the jump from season one to two was </connor>
<connor> definitely noticeable i know it's there </connor>
<garnt> it got better like it looked a lot </garnt>
<connor> crisper yeah i mean it's just it's just </connor>
<garnt> an all-around amazing production watch </garnt>
<joey> watch the show watch my show </joey>
<garnt> i'll definitely have to watch season two </garnt>
<garnt> i've been talking about it for [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> ever and i'm like so so [ __ ] funny </connor>
<joey> right now i'm i'm happy i'm happy you </joey>
<connor> know what connor maybe i'll play </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna play </connor>

<garnt> i took all of january off </garnt>
<garnt> uh i didn't do any i didn't upload any </garnt>
<garnt> videos in january yeah well maybe one i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i don't know because this is </garnt>
<garnt> before the end of january yeah yeah i'm </garnt>
<joey> just like how are you saying this when </joey>
<joey> uh when we </joey>
<connor> are right in january </connor>
<garnt> all my plans always go correctly without </garnt>
<garnt> any backfiring yeah yeah this might be a </garnt>
<garnt> uh enthusiasm yeah yeah so yeah i took a </garnt>
<garnt> month off it was pretty chill really </garnt>
<garnt> weird waking up and not thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> youtube videos yeah kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about like oh my stream later i </garnt>
<joey> play some games go </joey>
<joey> gym yeah live live life yeah </joey>
<garnt> have a [ __ ] life for once </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i noticed that you haven't </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you two haven't really thought so </garnt>
<garnt> much about your upload schedule which </garnt>
<garnt> you did before </garnt>
<connor> is that just </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i just want to take a month </joey>
<garnt> off and get some stuff in on in order </garnt>
<joey> i've got a bunch of videos that are </joey>
<garnt> really big that i need to finish yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i know that if i'm trying to do </garnt>
<garnt> them weekly it'll be a mess so i just </garnt>
<garnt> want to get them i've got like three big </garnt>
<garnt> videos in the works at the moment okay </garnt>
<garnt> so i'm trying to get them all done and </garnt>
<garnt> then hopefully gen uh february will be a </garnt>
<connor> nice roll in </connor>
<garnt> probably gonna do a bunch more back to </garnt>
<garnt> normal </garnt>
<garnt> do you do you feel like after you do the </garnt>
<garnt> big projects that you're just gonna go </garnt>
<garnt> back to your normal upload schedule or </garnt>
<garnt> are you gonna focus more on streaming </garnt>
<connor> now maybe i'll miss a week here and </connor>
<connor> there and not feel too guilty about it </connor>
<garnt> i'll probably try and do three a month i </garnt>
<garnt> think that'll be my soft target three a </garnt>
<garnt> month yeah i'll probably try and do once </garnt>
<connor> a week but um </connor>
<garnt> just above my upload schedule </garnt>
<garnt> actually well i feel like if i miss a </garnt>
<garnt> week it's not a big deal i'm like now </garnt>
<garnt> right on my phone i checked i checked </garnt>
<garnt> the other day because i was like i </garnt>
<garnt> haven't uploaded in like two and a half </garnt>
<connor> weeks i wonder if anyone's saying </connor>
<connor> anything no no no one's commenting no of </connor>
<garnt> course so clearly nobody misses me so </garnt>
<garnt> i'll be all right </garnt>
<garnt> that's exactly what i realized when i </garnt>
<garnt> realized oh i don't have to do an anime </garnt>
<garnt> of year video on the new year yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> could just wait a few weeks and uh </garnt>
<garnt> people were just like great i'll still </garnt>
<garnt> watch your content who would have </garnt>
<joey> thought that the only ones who care </joey>
<joey> about our timetable is us </joey>
<connor> and no one else i mean i feel like when </connor>
<connor> you do weekly it does post you a bit </connor>
<joey> more you do yeah of course but you also </joey>
<joey> i feel it also limits yourself to like </joey>
<garnt> what you should actually be doing right </garnt>
<joey> yeah which is why like this year for me </joey>
<joey> i'm definitely going to like slow it </joey>
<joey> down and just like really focus on like </joey>
<joey> making each video as big as possible </joey>
<joey> yeah and for everything else like you </joey>
<joey> know i got trash taste and like my </joey>
<joey> second channel and stuff like that so </joey>
<garnt> yeah whatever so what is the main </garnt>
<joey> challenge anymore when trash tastes this </joey>
<joey> is the main channel this is let's be </joey>
<joey> real this is where the big ideas are </joey>
<joey> going this is where it's all going we're </joey>
<joey> doing more specials this year we're </joey>
<joey> gonna [ __ ] stream every week </joey>
<joey> you're out of here first </joey>
<joey> i hope this doesn't become poorly age </joey>
<joey> things yeah i really </joey>
<garnt> i'm saying it publicly so there'll be </garnt>
<connor> breaks yeah of course yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> but yeah i think i think for all of us </joey>
<garnt> like our for this year like definitely </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste is like slowly becoming more </garnt>
<joey> of the priority i think when it comes to </joey>
<garnt> just like making cool [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because we enjoy it because we </garnt>
<joey> enjoy it and uh who knew that just </joey>
<garnt> having a job with your best mates uh is </garnt>
<connor> fun pretty sure </connor>
<connor> god forbid have a carry every week </connor>
<connor> that's life </connor>
<garnt> speaking of watching anime i know a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of people who have also been </garnt>
<garnt> watching anime very publicly uh probably </garnt>
<connor> very old news by the time this episode </connor>
<connor> gets really dumb as [ __ ] of 2022 so far </connor>
<joey> but </joey>
<garnt> but somebody twice has just begun we're </garnt>
<garnt> already taking an l but yeah basically </garnt>
<garnt> at the time of recording uh pokemane has </garnt>
<garnt> been banned for watching avatar the last </garnt>
<garnt> airbender and also disguise toast has </garnt>
<garnt> also been banned for watching death note </garnt>
<garnt> i believe um on their twitch streams </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh to their tens of thousands of </garnt>
<garnt> viewers and i i </garnt>
<garnt> by the time this gets released maybe </garnt>
<garnt> more people will be banned maybe not </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know but it's definitely </garnt>
<garnt> sparked a discussion about </garnt>
<joey> copyright and dmca and i think people </joey>
<joey> online are calling it the tv matter </joey>
<joey> which uh i couldn't [ __ ] believe was </joey>
<joey> a real thing polygon wrote this article </joey>
<joey> that was like oh this guy starts he was </joey>
<joey> just testing out the tv matter and i </joey>
<joey> think my favorite comment i saw on a </joey>
<joey> quote retweet was like calling it the tv </joey>
<joey> meta is like shooting yourself in the </joey>
<joey> head and calling it the gun better </joey>
<joey> it's the dumbest argument it's crazy </joey>
<joey> like watching stuff like the uh totally </joey>
<joey> not mark right with like toei yeah just </joey>
<connor> like nuking his channel yeah for like </connor>
<joey> talking about one piece yeah for not </joey>
<joey> even breaking dmca you know and then </joey>
<connor> you know the twitch stream we should go </connor>
<connor> and watch the entirety of hunter hunter </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i remember like when i </garnt>
<garnt> first heard about this i thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> i thought it was actually just like a </garnt>
<garnt> joke yeah i thought i thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> like a parody article i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> where's the onion article and then i </garnt>
<garnt> then i log on to and then i log on to </garnt>
<garnt> twitch </garnt>
<garnt> and then i see you one of like the </garnt>
<joey> biggest streamers on the pla i'm just </joey>
<joey> gonna [ __ ] i saw xqc yeah streaming </joey>
<joey> hunter hunter like innocence like a </joey>
<joey> hundred thousand people and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like i was watching because i was like </joey>
<joey> is that is there a meme like where's the </joey>
<joey> meme come and then i slowly realized oh </joey>
<joey> they weren't joking people are actually </joey>
<joey> doing this and then um conor informed me </joey>
<joey> that ludwig had already made a video </joey>
<joey> about it and i think what bothered me </joey>
<joey> was that people were like calling </joey>
<connor> like calling him out for calling other </connor>
<garnt> people out for being like yeah why are </garnt>
<garnt> you why are you knocking on people or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> imagine you're like broadcasting a </garnt>
<garnt> football match in a football stadium </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't own because that's what </garnt>
<connor> the equivalent of it is right they're </connor>
<connor> broadcasting this to like 90 000 people </connor>
<connor> one guy's like uh is that is that </connor>
<connor> allowed and like and people are just </connor>
<connor> actually like shh don't tell people and </connor>
<garnt> it's just like are you [ __ ] kidding </garnt>
<garnt> me there's 90 000 people watching this </garnt>
<garnt> right now </garnt>
<garnt> how can you snitch on someone when </garnt>
<garnt> there's 90 000 people watching this one </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] thing </joey>
<connor> so dumb and the fact that people trying </connor>
<joey> to argue it's fair use or anything it's </joey>
<joey> just so stupid </joey>
<joey> yeah the theory is ridiculous i </joey>
<joey> understand right because a lot of the </joey>
<garnt> viewers who are watching this probably </garnt>
<garnt> enjoyed it they probably loved watching </garnt>
<joey> sqc watch hunter hunter yeah of course </joey>
<joey> i'm sure everyone would love to watch us </joey>
<joey> watch jojo unfortunately we can't do </joey>
<joey> that yeah because one </joey>
<connor> we're not [ __ ] dumb we don't just </connor>
<joey> watch [ __ ] we literally </joey>
<garnt> literally be breaking the law i i did a </garnt>
<connor> watch along of jojo on my stream </connor>
<garnt> uh but i didn't show the visuals i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't show audio i should have a </garnt>
<garnt> timestamp yeah you can go to your </garnt>
<garnt> netflix and we can watch along yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> not as good of course it sucks because </garnt>
<joey> you can't see it yeah but it gets the </joey>
<joey> law to do that yeah and also we live in </joey>
<joey> japan we probably actually throw it in </joey>
<joey> jail if we did that yeah oh yeah no you </joey>
<joey> will </joey>
<joey> um you know it's just like what what </joey>
<joey> annoyed me the most about it was again </joey>
<garnt> like it was people </garnt>
<garnt> trying to be like it was very like </garnt>
<garnt> tribal in a sense they were like you </garnt>
<garnt> can't say my stream is bad for doing it </garnt>
<garnt> they were just watching you know it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't do any harm so what if they get </garnt>
<garnt> banned it's like yeah but yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> that streamer already makes like five </garnt>
<garnt> million dollars a year of course they </garnt>
<garnt> don't give a [ __ ] if they get banned </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but like what about the guy you </garnt>
<garnt> know there's other smaller streamers who </garnt>
<joey> maybe enjoy the the freedoms of the </joey>
<joey> current copyright system where they can </joey>
<joey> kind of you know tell the line a little </joey>
<joey> bit </joey>
<joey> safer you know not not watching stuff </joey>
<joey> but maybe i can show you a clip yeah </joey>
<joey> remember you couldn't watch youtube on </joey>
<garnt> twitch before yeah you know you can now </garnt>
<garnt> and even then that's controversial </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> i just feel like it's selfish of like </garnt>
<garnt> the bigger creators who already are well </garnt>
<joey> established don't have to worry about </joey>
<joey> income or anything and they can get away </joey>
<joey> with it </joey>
<garnt> yeah right they'll come back you know </garnt>
<connor> they'll get banned they'll come back </connor>
<connor> they don't give a [ __ ] that you know i </connor>
<joey> you know if anything them getting banned </joey>
<joey> is just more publicity to them yeah </joey>
<connor> because that's why right it's like it's </connor>
<connor> like you can get banned and you're a </connor>
<connor> headline and people are like oh my god </connor>
<connor> you're banned that's so crazy we'll come </connor>
<connor> back and like you'll get even more </connor>
<connor> viewers and you come back it's like it's </connor>
<connor> just i don't know it just seems selfish </connor>
<garnt> to me it is and the the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's trying to call it a meta and </garnt>
<garnt> play a joke with it and stuff is really </garnt>
<garnt> frustrating when you know you know we we </garnt>
<garnt> work in japan right we talk a lot with </garnt>
<garnt> the you know with the anime companies </garnt>
<garnt> and try and work with them and try to </garnt>
<connor> convince them that youtubers and stuff </connor>
<garnt> aren't psychopaths </garnt>
<connor> i think that's what like </connor>
<connor> bothered me the most yeah which is like </connor>
<connor> as someone who does make content that </connor>
<connor> really does require fair use and a </connor>
<garnt> strong argument for fair use even i </garnt>
<garnt> think like sometimes i'm still like </garnt>
<garnt> touting the line sometimes with how </garnt>
<garnt> companies view my content right because </garnt>
<garnt> it's such a new concept that it's going </garnt>
<garnt> to take time to like convince big </garnt>
<garnt> companies that hey please don't strike </garnt>
<garnt> my stuff because it is under fair use </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> when you have when you have like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like this and then on the other end of </garnt>
<garnt> the spectrum you have people just </garnt>
<garnt> broadcasting licensed tv shows movies </garnt>
<garnt> anime whatever it's just what is what's </garnt>
<garnt> going to happen is that it's just going </garnt>
<garnt> to make it harder for the [ __ ] 60 70 </garnt>
<garnt> year old guy looking at new content to </garnt>
<garnt> be like well i guess everyone's just </garnt>
<garnt> broadcasting my [ __ ] right well i guess </garnt>
<garnt> i should strike down everyone what is it </garnt>
<garnt> what is the thing that's going to happen </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's going to make it hard for </garnt>
<garnt> big corporations to tell the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between what is fair use and what isn't </garnt>
<joey> because when there's people who are </joey>
<joey> abusing the system because this is an </joey>
<joey> abuse of the system then it's just gonna </joey>
<joey> be harder for the guy who was actually </joey>
<garnt> trying to stay within the system to </garnt>
<joey> prove that he is actually staying within </joey>
<joey> the system yeah i feel there's just so </joey>
<joey> many like youtubers on twitch streams </joey>
<garnt> just content creators who are like you </garnt>
<garnt> know doing our best to like at least try </garnt>
<garnt> and like yeah as you were saying like </garnt>
<garnt> show the japanese corporations being </garnt>
<garnt> like hey you know fair use is a thing </garnt>
<garnt> we're not using your stuff all the time </garnt>
<garnt> for malicious intent we do it because we </garnt>
<joey> genuinely love it we want people to know </joey>
<joey> about it yeah and but we will follow the </joey>
<joey> rules that are laid out as much as we </joey>
<joey> can but at the same time you know i </joey>
<joey> scratch your back you scratch mine you </joey>
<joey> know like kind of like forgive me </joey>
<joey> sometimes you know but now with this </joey>
<garnt> whole [ __ ] tv meta [ __ ] if i feel </garnt>
<garnt> all that effort it's just gone back to </garnt>
<joey> zero yeah especially on twitter if if </joey>
<joey> it's not speculating of course but like </joey>
<connor> obviously like it you know it could it </connor>
<joey> could really change sometimes right yeah </joey>
<garnt> i mean like i mean the music industry </garnt>
<connor> did it with twitch eventually they were </connor>
<garnt> like oh [ __ ] uh yeah you shouldn't be </garnt>
<joey> streaming music it's not good and people </joey>
<garnt> are like whatever i'm testing out the </garnt>
<garnt> music matter you know yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> the thing though the thing the other </garnt>
<garnt> thing that bothered me is that </garnt>
<garnt> you know you can't really feign </garnt>
<garnt> ignorance because there is a precedence </garnt>
<garnt> for this </garnt>
<garnt> youtubers have felt it for [ __ ] years </garnt>
<garnt> with their copyright system even twitch </garnt>
<garnt> streamers and i know a lot of twitch </garnt>
<garnt> streamers i complained a lot when they </garnt>
<garnt> had their dmca </garnt>
<garnt> controversy with the music thing that </garnt>
<garnt> happened right where basically every </garnt>
<garnt> piece of music just got claimed and you </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't even play some games because </garnt>
<garnt> some of the music was called it was </garnt>
<connor> bound to happen anyway yeah which is </connor>
<garnt> about youtube have been dealing with </garnt>
<garnt> that for years yeah like it's you know i </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know it's very entitled you know </garnt>
<garnt> and that's what it is it is entitlement </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the the streamers that were </garnt>
<garnt> doing this yeah just like don't give a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] because </garnt>
<garnt> why would they they don't mind yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> get the headlines they get the views </garnt>
<connor> they already got paid they already have </connor>
<connor> these contracts with these companies </connor>
<joey> and they know they'll come back yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah okay because they get special </garnt>
<garnt> treatment yeah and then you have like </garnt>
<garnt> people on the other side of the fence </garnt>
<garnt> people like totally not mark who like if </garnt>
<joey> you don't know the story behind what </joey>
<joey> happened with tony not mark i i believe </joey>
<joey> like toei strikes hundreds of his videos </joey>
<joey> over 150. over like 150 videos at once </joey>
<garnt> uh some of them not even even like </garnt>
<garnt> having any copyrighted material on there </garnt>
<garnt> right some of them were just like i </garnt>
<garnt> believe his face or like </garnt>
<joey> some of them some of those were drawings </joey>
<garnt> of dragon ball characters that he yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and so his channel basically got </garnt>
<garnt> completely like so many of these videos </garnt>
<garnt> got completely wiped away and he was </garnt>
<garnt> like fighting tooth and nail yeah to </garnt>
<garnt> like try to get in contact with toei to </garnt>
<garnt> be like please toei bring my videos out </garnt>
<garnt> of copyright jail please this is fair </garnt>
<garnt> use and i believe that even now it's not </garnt>
<garnt> been sorted no i believe now is he he </garnt>
<garnt> basically just like gave up yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> believe he just is so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> heartbreaking because i think like a </garnt>
<garnt> third of his channel just disappeared </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly and that's like it's like </garnt>
<joey> could you imagine that it's just like </joey>
<garnt> years of work </garnt>
<garnt> gone yeah and that to me it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> well it's like there's this guy fighting </garnt>
<joey> tooth and nail to try and prove that his </joey>
<joey> videos are [ __ ] fair use and his </joey>
<joey> videos do deserve to be and they are </joey>
<joey> used yeah two to two to like a company </joey>
<joey> that doesn't know the difference between </joey>
<joey> fair use not and then on the other side </joey>
<joey> of the spectrum you have other people </joey>
<joey> who are abusing the system to be like </joey>
<joey> well you know whatever the ban the </joey>
<joey> banham is coming down i think i can i </joey>
<joey> can take like a </joey>
<joey> two-day vacation a month vacation </joey>
<joey> whatever um and the people who feel the </joey>
<joey> repercussions are the people who </joey>
<joey> are like on the load end of the tier </joey>
<joey> list with </joey>
<joey> let me rephrase that no end of the </joey>
<garnt> spectrum lower end of the spectrum of </garnt>
<garnt> twitch streamers yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> the smaller content creators that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's the [ __ ] word i was looking </garnt>
<connor> for the smaller concerts are greatest </connor>
<garnt> you know a lot of these the bigger </garnt>
<garnt> content creators you know i know or you </garnt>
<garnt> know i i think highly often it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> sad seeing them do this and like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> some of them just not caring and i was </garnt>
<garnt> just like this is just sad </garnt>
<joey> like you know i i also just think you </joey>
<connor> should to be a good example yeah like </connor>
<joey> why not just like make stuff i don't </joey>
<joey> know like because what's gonna happen is </joey>
<joey> the big streamers do it then everyone </joey>
<joey> goes oh if the big streamer is doing it </joey>
<joey> i can do it too yeah but of course they </joey>
<joey> don't realize those big streamers if </joey>
<joey> they get in trouble all they'll get is a </joey>
<joey> slap on the wrist if the smaller creator </joey>
<joey> does it they're probably [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> permabanned yeah because i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> like to preface this i don't this isn't </garnt>
<connor> like us trying to start drama with any </connor>
<connor> of the content creators that did this </connor>
<connor> because a lot of the content creators i </connor>
<connor> actually respect as content creators you </connor>
<connor> know yeah um it was like kind of said i </connor>
<connor> was just a bit disappointed that they </connor>
<connor> did </connor>
<garnt> yeah they didn't set a better example uh </garnt>
<garnt> because they i like i know that </garnt>
<garnt> you know we're all content creators we </garnt>
<garnt> we know what's going on here you know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we know what the repercussions are </garnt>
<garnt> going to be or that what they could be </garnt>
<garnt> so it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like i couldn't understand why they were </garnt>
<garnt> poking the hornet's nest i guess some of </garnt>
<connor> them were doing it you know </connor>
<garnt> intentionally trying to get banned as </garnt>
<garnt> well right some of them admitted that </garnt>
<garnt> that they wanted to be banned right </garnt>
<garnt> because it's good for headlines as well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah you know if you're if you're a </garnt>
<joey> bigger name and you have more websites </joey>
<joey> you know because there are websites that </joey>
<joey> are just dedicated to you know literally </joey>
<joey> just talking about twitch streamers yeah </joey>
<garnt> and then like post these articles they </garnt>
<garnt> get them recommended to me all the time </garnt>
<garnt> on google oh yeah yeah of course you </garnt>
<garnt> won't believe what ludwig said and it'll </garnt>
<connor> be like ludwig's i i like jump king so i </connor>
<connor> i hate these articles they're so [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> it's a little thing called independent </joey>
<joey> journalism but it's like how have you </joey>
<joey> then you know at least take a clickbait </joey>
<joey> and not even made it somewhat </joey>
<connor> interesting </connor>
<garnt> even more boring </garnt>
<garnt> yeah no because like i i think what the </garnt>
<garnt> other thing that made me like lose brain </garnt>
<garnt> cells when i was like scrolling on my </garnt>
<garnt> twitter to see what the reaction was was </garnt>
<garnt> the amount of people who were calling </garnt>
<garnt> out people who were like </garnt>
<garnt> basically saying hey you maybe you </garnt>
<garnt> shouldn't you know stream </garnt>
<garnt> uh or broadcast anime movies to like </garnt>
<garnt> your audience or whatever and anyone who </garnt>
<garnt> said that </garnt>
<garnt> was basically </garnt>
<garnt> basically called out to being like for </garnt>
<garnt> being like a corporate bootlicker or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that you know or just </garnt>
<joey> like why are you defending the </joey>
<joey> corporations and it's just like this it </joey>
<joey> turned the argument into something </joey>
<joey> completely different because we all know </joey>
<garnt> dmca is like a decade old [ __ ] law </garnt>
<garnt> that is outdated for how the internet </garnt>
<garnt> works right yeah um we're like we're </garnt>
<garnt> content creators we we know that there </garnt>
<garnt> are so many things that are broken about </garnt>
<garnt> the dmca system we know that but that's </garnt>
<garnt> a separate issue to what is going on </garnt>
<garnt> here you know a system can be broken and </garnt>
<garnt> people can also abuse the system at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time </garnt>
<garnt> they don't have to be mutually uh they </garnt>
<garnt> don't have to be the same thing they can </garnt>
<garnt> be mutually exclusive </garnt>
<garnt> um and just just seeing people try to </garnt>
<garnt> defend this just like kind of kind of </garnt>
<garnt> just made me [ __ ] lose it was wheels </garnt>
<connor> it was really weird seeing how open </connor>
<connor> everyone was like yeah no of course it's </connor>
<connor> okay and i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> just because you like it doesn't mean </connor>
<joey> it's okay and just because you can't be </joey>
<joey> bothered to go into google and look it </joey>
<connor> up yourself it's like like obviously it </connor>
<connor> would be sick to watch anime with 90 000 </connor>
<joey> people live oh it would be safe </joey>
<connor> i would love to do that yeah we can't </connor>
<joey> we're not allowed </joey>
<joey> until until again these like ip holders </joey>
<garnt> understand that it's okay and we're not </garnt>
<garnt> saying this shouldn't be the case you </garnt>
<garnt> know what i would say that if a company </garnt>
<garnt> wants to be [ __ ] five heads they </garnt>
<garnt> would allow people they would they would </garnt>
<garnt> allow people to stream all their old </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] forgotten shows and bring it to </garnt>
<garnt> a new audience i think that would be a </garnt>
<garnt> five-head move but until they come until </garnt>
<garnt> people allow it it's still illegal you </garnt>
<garnt> know you still you're still like you're </garnt>
<garnt> still putting risk that you're putting </garnt>
<garnt> you're still putting risk on an entire </garnt>
<garnt> platform that you're going to put the </garnt>
<garnt> clamp down for all the content creators </garnt>
<connor> on that platform you know it's like that </connor>
<connor> japanese youtuber who got to react to </connor>
<connor> all of attack on titan and like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> right he like uploaded all of him yeah </joey>
<joey> he had he had this uh he had this deal </joey>
<connor> with the attack on titan ip </connor>
<connor> and he was just like oh yeah so uh you </connor>
<garnt> got a second channel and it's got like a </garnt>
<garnt> million subs uh just put all of attack </garnt>
<garnt> on titan on it you're like yeah without </garnt>
<joey> reacting yeah i saw that with him </joey>
<joey> reacting to it and it was completely </joey>
<joey> legal you know what's crazy to me is </joey>
<joey> that like </joey>
<joey> the whole entire youtube community </joey>
<garnt> everyone everyone online hated reaction </garnt>
<joey> channels yeah they came down so goddamn </joey>
<garnt> hard in them and like 2015-16 yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then like why is it different now i </garnt>
<connor> don't understand no everyone what </connor>
<connor> happened like is it because it's live is </connor>
<connor> that the only difference like i don't </connor>
<joey> understand the twitch meta the tv the </joey>
<garnt> react meta the three members the reactor </garnt>
<garnt> i guess </garnt>
<garnt> i guess what we've learned what we've </garnt>
<garnt> learned </garnt>
<joey> what we've learned is that </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's a bad thing to do </joey>
<joey> unless your favorite content creator is </joey>
<joey> doing it then it's not yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> all right that's a good message to </connor>
<garnt> entertain </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i just want to go throughout like all of </garnt>
<garnt> history and just just start calling like </garnt>
<garnt> the most despicable acts of human </garnt>
<connor> history just like a meta </connor>
