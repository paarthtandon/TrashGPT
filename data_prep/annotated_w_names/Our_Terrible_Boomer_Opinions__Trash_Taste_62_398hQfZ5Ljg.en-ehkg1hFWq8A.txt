<garnt> - Mugs. </garnt>
<garnt> "Trash Taste" mugs. </garnt>
<connor> - You know who's not a mug? </connor>
<connor> You. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Wow, love this mug. </connor>
<connor> I love the lid that it comes with </connor>
<connor> and how well built it is </connor>
<connor> and handcrafted the mug is. </connor>
<joey> - But unfortunately, boys, </joey>
<joey> there's only one week left to get this. </joey>

didn't have the chance </garnt>
<garnt> to buy one of these mugs. </garnt>
<connor> - It's almost the perfect size mug </connor>
<connor> for any kind of beverage. </connor>
<connor> Beer, tea, coffee, water, urine. </connor>
<connor> Anything you can imagine
that you'd like to drink, </connor>
<connor> you can contain in this mug. </connor>
<joey> - So if you love "Trash Taste" </joey>

<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey groans) </garnt>
<joey> - Squirted all over myself. </joey>
<joey> - Hell yeah, you did.
- Always happens to me. </joey>
<joey> - Just nutted on myself. </joey>
<joey> - Gonna nut. </joey>
<joey> (gentle music) </joey>
<joey> - What up, squad. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode </joey>
<joey> of the "Trash Taste" podcast. </joey>
<joey> I'm Joey and I'm with the boys. </joey>
<connor> - Well, that was the most
depressing intro we've had yet. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
- Wait, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - "I'm with the boys." (groans) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We could lay a bit
more build-up than that. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't even have any pre-talk there. </connor>
<joey> We just, like- </joey>
<joey> - Hey, guys. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Welcome to "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know we were recording. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, wait, is the
lights on? Are we rolling? </connor>
<connor> Are we rolling?"
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, "Dora the Explorer" energy </connor>
<connor> as opposed to "Clockwork Orange" energy. </connor>
<joey> - Did you want "Dora the Explorer" energy? </joey>
<joey> Aright, I'll give you
"Dora the Explorer" energy. </joey>
<joey> Hey, everybody. </joey>
<joey> It's time for "Trash Taste" podcast. </joey>
<joey> Are you ready? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Hold on, I need coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> - Good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hold on, I need a bit more
time for this coffee to sink in </garnt>
<garnt> from these amazing mugs
that we're drinking out of </garnt>
<garnt> right now.
- Is that a "Trash Taste" mug? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, we've already been
promoting them by this point, </connor>
<joey> but we are actually drinking out of them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we're drinking
out of them for once. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, these are the first batch though </garnt>
<garnt> so the lid's a little too big. </garnt>
<joey> But the ones that you
guys will be drinking from </joey>
<connor> won't have a big ass lid. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, the lid will fit a lot better. </garnt>
<joey> But I really like these mugs. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we've already promoted them. </joey>
<joey> You already know. You already
know what we're talking about. </joey>
<joey> - It's a "Trash Taste" mug.
- We don't know how good </joey>
<connor> or bad it did. (laughs)
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> Or it's like, eh. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe everyone hates them </joey>
<connor> and this is like a poorly
aged bit, I don't know, like- </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs)
- Poorly aged episode. </connor>
<joey> But it's been roughly two weeks, I think, </joey>
<joey> since we all gathered last time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it feels a lot longer. </garnt>
<joey> Like two weeks without the boys? </joey>
<joey> Jesus. I don't know how I went so long </joey>
<joey> without seeing you guys so often </joey>
<joey> before we moved to Japan.
- Yeah, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Like, what, it just feels
like a part of my life </garnt>
<garnt> has just been taken away from me </garnt>
<garnt> just because I didn't record a podcast. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I think last time I saw Connor, </joey>
<joey> we were getting our second shot. </joey>
<joey> - On my birthday. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which felt like a month ago. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that was like a week ago though. </joey>
<joey> - God, how fucked were you
guys with that second shot? </joey>
<joey> - I was very sick, very sick.
- Can we just talk about that? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- The 5G, it was, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the 5G.
- So for the record, </connor>
<joey> we got Moderna shots.
- Yep. </joey>
<joey> - So did you guys feel
anything for the first shot? </joey>
<joey> - Ah, well, I had that
like, lower back pain </joey>
<garnt> for some reason.
- Oh, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> we did talk about that, didn't we, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I was like, I mean,
obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> the arm that we got the shot </connor>
<connor> hurt like a motherfucker.
- It was a bit sore. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- But for some reason, </connor>
<connor> only Aki and I got this
really bad lower back pain </connor>
<connor> for some reason.
- I got it on the second dose. </connor>
<connor> - You got it on the second dose? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my lower back was hurting all day. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't it feel like </connor>
<joey> someone just drop-kicked you in the back? </joey>
<connor> - It was more of like an uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, really?
- Like if someone was, like, </joey>
<joey> poking my back constantly. </joey>
<connor> and I couldn't get it. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know why. </connor>
<joey> It was very frustrating.
- Oh, mine was like </joey>
<connor> if someone was fucking doing that </connor>
<connor> to my lower back just constantly. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Maybe when you and Aki are sleeping, </connor>
<connor> she wakes up and just
does like WrestleMania. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
And then vice versa when- </connor>
<garnt> - She practices elbow drops </garnt>
<joey> as I'm sleeping.
(Garnt and Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Ladybeard just invades your dream, </joey>
<connor> and just like, ah. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, ah. </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe you passed Ladybeard
in the hallway, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, the chat energy
pulled my back out. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like "Nightmare
on Elm Street," right? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) Like, anything
he does in your dreams </joey>
<joey> just affects you in real life.
(Garnt and Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Freddy Krueger just
came out from the bed, </garnt>
<joey> stabbed me in the back.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I had a fantastic birthday, </joey>
<joey> celebrating by being sick in my home. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It was beautiful birthday. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause we all shared on our
line a message that we have, </garnt>
<garnt> like, what the temperature
of everyone's was. </garnt>
<connor> Yours was through the fucking roof. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You were like 39 degrees. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it shot up to like 39.
- I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Is this the last time
I'm gonna see this man? </garnt>
<garnt> - 39?
- That's what it was, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, fuck, I didn't
realize it went that high. </garnt>
<connor> - It was actually dangerous levels. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't feel like I was sick </connor>
<joey> when I woke up.
- Really? </joey>
<connor> - When I woke up, I was like, "Wow, </connor>
<connor> it's just kinda hot, isn't it?" </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs)
- Oh, really? </garnt>
<connor> - It's little bit spicy in here. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) That's kind of
what a fever is, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I didn't particularly feel bad. </connor>
<connor> I've had fevers before
where I felt really sick </connor>
<connor> and I didn't feel good, </connor>
<joey> but this one, I was just like,
"Wow, I'm just really hot." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - Wow. And then I got out of bed </joey>
<joey> and I went to take my temperature </joey>
<connor> and I was like, "Oh, it's high." </connor>
<connor> It's high.
- Yes. </connor>
<joey> Oh, I'm cooking from the inside. </joey>
<connor> That's probably why.
- And then I was like, "Okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go and get some
energy drink from the store." </connor>
<garnt> Er, not energy drink. </garnt>
<garnt> Like Gatorade or whatever, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> just like the generic water-
- Yeah, I was gonna say, </garnt>
<garnt> Red Bull is probably not the best thing </garnt>
<garnt> to be drinking on a fever.
- Water. </garnt>
<connor> It's literally just any drink
that's water featuring sugar. </connor>
<connor> You know those drinks.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like Pocari Sweat, something like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I got it. </connor>
<connor> And then by the time I got home, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Okay, now I
actually think I feel sick now." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, right. </connor>
<connor> - I think I feel pretty shitty. </connor>
<connor> And so I didn't do
anything on my birthday. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's the opposite
for me. I immediately woke up </joey>
<garnt> and all of my joints were
just aching like crazy, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was weird because
I checked my temperature </garnt>
<garnt> and I only had like, 37 or something, </garnt>
<joey> so I only had like a slight fever, </joey>
<joey> but, man, my bones were just rattled. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was really weird for me </garnt>
<garnt> because I woke up and
I felt completely fine. </garnt>
<garnt> I woke up to, like, we
have like a group chat </garnt>
<garnt> where all the staff
members of "Trash Taste" </garnt>
<garnt> were just like, "Are we recording today?" </garnt>
<joey> And everyone posted their temperature </joey>
<joey> and were like, "No, we're
definitely not recording today." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Nope. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, that's not a thing that's happening. </joey>
<joey> And then I took my temperature </joey>
<joey> and mine was just like, 37 on the dot. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yeah,
I feel completely fine. </joey>
<joey> And got up, started doing work, </joey>
<connor> being like, "Oh, these guys
just have weak immune systems." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Got up like Zen.
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Can you imagine having
weak immune systems? </connor>
<connor> And then fucking two o'clock rolls over, </connor>
<connor> I'm sitting at my computer, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Ooh, I'm getting chills. </connor>
<connor> What's happening here? </connor>
<connor> What's happening here?"
- (laughs) Serves you right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then I went from
being completely fine, </connor>
<garnt> to just having the worst headache </garnt>
<garnt> and just properly just having the flu. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just like, "Man, this
is vaccine's got hands, man." </garnt>
<joey> It's fucking fighting, man. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) This is a
bit delayed, wasn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs)
- Yeah, it was a bit delayed. </joey>
<joey> So, yeah, in the end, I
woke up completely fine, </joey>
<garnt> and then for most of
the day after 2:00 p.m., </garnt>
<joey> I was just completely bedridden. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How long were you guys in bed for? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I was
watching the Olympics. </connor>
<joey> You know, just chilling.
- Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just watching people do sports. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Wow, that could be me. </joey>
<connor> That could be me right now." </connor>
<connor> - I still haven't seen
anything from the Olympics, </connor>
<garnt> except the opening ceremony.
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw that </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we had like a little
viewing party at our place </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause one of our friends
really wanted to see the opening </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason. </garnt>
<connor> And to be fair, it's probably
like the most interesting part </connor>
<connor> of the Olympics, honestly.
- Oh, I don't know about that. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know about that.
- I mean, </connor>
<joey> if you're not into sport, right? </joey>
<connor> - I feel like you don't
even need to be into sport </connor>
<joey> to be into the Olympics.
- Oh, no, I like sport. </joey>
<connor> - There's so many good
storylines, you know? </connor>
<joey> It's a story. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, true, </joey>
<joey> but I think for the majority of people </joey>
<joey> who aren't into sport and
don't care about the Olympics, </joey>
<joey> the opening and ending ceremony </joey>
<joey> are probably like the
two biggest highlights </joey>
<connor> of just seeing, you know? </connor>
<joey> - I guess. </joey>
<connor> I don't really care
about sports in general. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, something
about the Olympics is fun. </connor>
<connor> It's a thing where there's
just sport that's on all day </connor>
<connor> and it's changing
constantly between events </connor>
<connor> so you don't have a chance to get bored. </connor>
<connor> Like I've been watching like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I might be watching the
cycling for too long. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Alright, okay." </connor>
<connor> But then next, the boxing comes on. </connor>
<connor> I say, "Ooh, ooh, okay, ooh."
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, it
keeps changing and, okay, </connor>
<connor> now you're like, "What
the fuck's going on?" </connor>
<garnt> Like what is actually-
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who is winning? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, for me, the Olympics is, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never been really too
interested in the Olympics. </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably one of my least
favorite sporting events </garnt>
<garnt> just because there's a bit
too much going on for me. </garnt>
<connor> Like, at least-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> No, 'cause we talked about- </garnt>
<garnt> - Least favorite sporting event. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, we
talked about storylines. </garnt>
<joey> - What's worse than the Olympics? </joey>
<joey> - What's worse than the Olympics? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt sighs) </joey>
<joey> - Every other sporting event. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - What's better than the Olympics? </connor>
<connor> - What's better than the Olympics? </connor>
<connor> Well, I like most major sporting events </connor>
<connor> when they're like a build-up-
- Yeah, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - League doesn't count. </connor>
<connor> - League does count.
- Dude, League does count. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
- League does count. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love the League finals. </connor>
<connor> - What are you, a fucking dad?
- Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - What is this? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Video games ain't sport.
- What am I listening to here? </connor>
<connor> - I love the World Cup, I love the Euros, </connor>
<connor> I love the Rugby World Cup as well. </connor>
<connor> It's just like it's, for me, </connor>
<connor> it's easier to follow along the storyline </connor>
<garnt> if there's just one event
or one tournament going on. </garnt>
<garnt> With the Olympics, it's just
like, what stage are we at? </garnt>
<joey> What sport is this? </joey>
<joey> I've never even heard of this sport. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck is handball?
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> How do I get invested in handball </connor>
<connor> when I don't even know the
fucking rules of handball?" </connor>
<garnt> - It's just tennis
against the wall. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - (laughs) I totally agree with you. </connor>
<connor> And so I could have
watched it on Japanese TV. </connor>
<connor> The problem is, </connor>
<connor> is that I don't understand
fully what's being said </connor>
<connor> all the time. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I realized when I'm
watching on Japanese TV, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, wow, actually
knowing who the people are </connor>
<connor> and why I should give a shit
is actually really important. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I thought just being able to leave it on </connor>
<joey> in the background, </joey>
<joey> that'd be entertaining enough. </joey>
<joey> - That's the whole point
of commentators, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, and I realized, </joey>
<joey> so I got my VPN on </joey>
<connor> and I watched it on the British website. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you use Express VPN? </garnt>
<connor> - I did use Express VPN.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And, yeah, </connor>
<garnt> I was watching it with
the British commentary, </garnt>
<garnt> and the commentary was really good. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't realize
how much it added to it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there was some commentary </garnt>
<garnt> that had me, like,
actually dying, laughing. </garnt>
<connor> Like I think the British rowing team </connor>
<connor> didn't win any gold medals, </connor>
<connor> and one of the commentators
just couldn't hold back. </connor>
<connor> He was so pissed off. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "The absolute
state of British rowing. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> We invested 27 million
pounds in British rowing </connor>
<connor> and we didn't get a single gold medal." </connor>
<connor> And it's was just like live on TV, </connor>
<connor> like right after they just lost. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, he's just going in. </connor>
<connor> He's like, no chill.
- Like holy shit, man. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I felt embarrassed. </connor>
<connor> I was like, imagine you're the rowers </connor>
<connor> that made this guy on BBC go off one, </connor>
<connor> just like go on a tirade.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Legendary. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like all the other good sports </connor>
<connor> that I don't know anything about. </connor>
<connor> Like TaeKwonDo, I don't
know anything about. </connor>
<garnt> But the commentators
help explain everything </garnt>
<garnt> as you're going. </garnt>
<garnt> And it is annoying when you're
watching it for too long, </garnt>
<garnt> because then they start over again </garnt>
<garnt> and they start explaining it again </garnt>
<garnt> because they assume that
people are only watching </garnt>
<garnt> for short amounts of time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because nobody knows
what the hell the rules are </garnt>
<garnt> for the sport.
- Yeah, yeah, so it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I was watching diving as well. </garnt>
<connor> Diving is really fun to watch. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, diving's super fun to watch. </joey>
<connor> - It was really far. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Whoa, okay,
I'm really invested." </connor>
<connor> - I think that's the
only sports that I like </connor>
<connor> in the Olympics, </connor>
<connor> just the obscure ones that you
never get to see otherwise. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, with tennis and rugby, </connor>
<connor> it's like, you know, that's
playing all year round, right? </connor>
<connor> - Rugby is shit in the Olympics. </connor>
<joey> Have you seen it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's pretty bad. </joey>
<connor> - It's like five minutes
a side or something </connor>
<connor> and there's only like 10 minutes of rugby. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, most major sports
that have bigger competitions </garnt>
<connor> are pretty shit in the Olympics, I find. </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely.
- They send the B team. </connor>
<connor> They don't send the actual-
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> You look at the football
or the rugby or the tennis- </connor>
<connor> - Or the baseball as well.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Oh, there's baseball there?
- Yeah, there's baseball. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, there's baseball in America, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Or like basketball as well, right? </garnt>
<connor> - There's basketball. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like sports
that have a competition </connor>
<connor> that's just more prestigious
than the Olympics </connor>
<connor> for that specific sport, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like it just takes
a bit of the wind out. </garnt>
<garnt> The real magic of the Olympics </garnt>
<garnt> is watching this small sport
that you've never heard of. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah, because
a lot of these sports </connor>
<joey> don't have any major leagues to push them </joey>
<joey> and give them a lot of money </joey>
<joey> and they obviously don't
tell them where they get to. </joey>
<connor> - I did see a bit of the skateboarding </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was interested in that. </connor>
<joey> I think Japan got a
gold medal in it, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like it's all kids as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's like 10-year-old kids. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Fuck, dude." </joey>
<joey> - God, imagine being a fucking- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> All is I know you're 10 years old. </joey>
<connor> - I realized watching the
Olympics this year has been awful. </connor>
<connor> Like every single athlete, right? </connor>
<connor> He looks like 30. </connor>
<connor> They interview him, he's like, "21," </connor>
<connor> and he's just won the gold medal. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What the fuck, man?" </connor>
<connor> This man is built like a
Greek god and he's won a medal </connor>
<connor> and he's got his shit together. </connor>
<connor> What am I doing? </connor>
<garnt> - Like you've reached the point where, </garnt>
<connor> you reached that point when you- </connor>
<connor> - Literally everyone in the
Olympics is younger than me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, not even the Olympics. </connor>
<connor> When you grow, when you're young, </connor>
<connor> everyone you watch on TV
is just older than you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like
something you get used to. </connor>
<connor> Like every athlete,
every major personality </connor>
<connor> is just older than you.
And then you get to a point </connor>
<joey> where you start seeing people
that's younger than you and- </joey>
<joey> - Achieving these amazing things, right? </joey>
<connor> - Achieving these amazing
things and starting football- </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm like, jeez, at 21, </garnt>
<garnt> I was fucking masturbating
and eating Cheetos. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Meanwhile, these kids just won
a fucking Olympic gold medal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was getting really pissed off </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause every single time
they introduce someone, </garnt>
<garnt> they were just younger than me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What the
fuck is this?" (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Where is the 30-year-old?
Get him, go and get him in. </joey>
<joey> What does he do? </joey>
<joey> - He's the veteran.
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Fuck, bro. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - The coach is like 27 years old. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, Jesus.
- It's just pissing me off. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, surely there
has to be someone aged 24. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I kind of almost
prefer the Winter Olympics </joey>
<joey> a lot of times. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel that in the Winter Olympics, </joey>
<joey> there's more of those more niche sports </joey>
<connor> that you really only get
to see in the Olympics. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise you really
have to go deep for it. </connor>
<connor> Like curling, for example, is like- </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Now curling's hard work. </garnt>
<connor> - I never thought I
would care about curling </connor>
<connor> until I watched the curling
like two Winter Olympics back. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Damn, I'm wanna try this. </connor>
<connor> This looks fun as fuck," </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't even know the
rules to curling at first. </connor>
<connor> I was like, it's just a bunch
of people scrubbing some ice. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Alright, cool, sick." </connor>
<connor> But then when you actually learn </connor>
<connor> the intricacies of the game, </connor>
<joey> it's just like, alright,
that's actually really cool. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand why every country </connor>
<connor> just doesn't agree to take a
week off during the Olympics. </connor>
<joey> - What, to just sit down and watch it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, sit down, chill, and watch it. </connor>
<connor> Why not? </connor>
<connor> Every country you can, you know,
have a week off. (chuckles) </connor>
<garnt> - Seems like the world economy
might have a different, </garnt>
<connor> small issue with that.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's alright. </connor>
<connor> That's alright.
- Oh no, oh no, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's like, once every
what, four years, right? </connor>
<connor> The Olympics?
- Yeah, take a week off. </connor>
<joey> - (chuckles) I mean, okay- </joey>
<connor> - A week off in four years. </connor>
<joey> - Do you get patriotic at
all during the Olympics? </joey>
<connor> - I listen to what the
commentators tell me to do. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> The commentators tell me I
should care about something, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Alright, I'm caring." </connor>
<joey> - Do you get patriotic at
all about any sporting event? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, "League of Legends." </connor>
<joey> I want the EU boys to win. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I mean obviously.
- Obviously, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I want the EU boys to win.
- Anything else? </joey>
<joey> - For me, the World Cup and the Euros. </joey>
<connor> I actually stayed up to watch the Euros </connor>
<connor> and watch England get beaten this time </connor>
<connor> in the finals once again. </connor>
<connor> - Good. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] (laughs) How was that? </connor>
<connor> - It was horrible. </connor>
<connor> I had to record "Trash
Taste" that day as well, </connor>
<connor> which is why I was- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you stayed up 'til like 4 a.m. </connor>
<connor> - Remember the last time
we recorded "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> where I was absolutely dead, </connor>
<connor> it's 'cause I was up
watching England just end. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well, see, I do get
patriotic over Wales in rugby. </connor>
<connor> I want Wales to win rugby. </connor>
<connor> And then if Wales get
knocked out of something </connor>
<connor> and England is still in it, </connor>
<joey> it's like, okay, now I'm
rooting for England to lose. </joey>
<joey> You'd think most people would be like- </joey>
<connor> - They be like, "Oh, I'm
rooting for England now." </connor>
<connor> - But it's not England.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I can't let England win now </connor>
<connor> because they never... </connor>
<connor> The problem is with English people </connor>
<connor> is that they're the worst when they win </connor>
<connor> at the sport they like.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Every time they win, </connor>
<joey> it's like every single country hates them, </joey>
<connor> 'cause they somehow are the
worst country at winning. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they're like bad losers. </joey>
<connor> Or bad winners. </connor>
<joey> - Well, it's just like
every single country </joey>
<connor> hates having their fans in
their country, the English fans, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're the worst. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - Like people will think,
because you're Welsh, </connor>
<connor> part of Great Britain, </connor>
<connor> then if Welsh aren't in it, </connor>
<garnt> you're gonna root for England, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's the complete fucking opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckles) Except if it's
the other way around. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember when Andy
Murray won Wimbledon. </garnt>
<connor> It was Britain's first win in Wimbledon </connor>
<connor> for God knows how many years. </connor>
<connor> It was fucking decades, right? </connor>
<connor> And it was the only
time where a British... </connor>
<connor> Like English people are happy </connor>
<connor> to cheer for Scottish people, </connor>
<joey> 'cause Andy Murray's Scottish, I believe, </joey>
<joey> but they aren't happy to
share the other way around. </joey>
<joey> Everyone hates English people, right? </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
- Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) And normally,
English people won't cheer </joey>
<joey> for Scottish people or Welsh people, </joey>
<joey> but once it's Great
Britain, everything's fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Everyone's buddy-buddy. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone's buddy-buddy again. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
It's team GB now. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is really fucking confusing </connor>
<connor> 'cause depending on the sport, </connor>
<connor> it's totally up to the sport </connor>
<connor> whether or not it's a Welsh,
Scottish, and English team, </connor>
<joey> or if it's a British team or some, </joey>
<joey> I think there's one or two sports </joey>
<joey> where Wales and England are
combined, but Scotland isn't. </joey>
<connor> So it's really confusing.
- That whole system </connor>
<connor> of Wales, Scotland, </connor>
<connor> it's just so confusing to
someone outside of that country. </connor>
<joey> Like I've had it explained to
me about three or four times, </joey>
<joey> I believe by YouTube, </joey>
<joey> and I still don't understand what it is. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
- It's not that complicated. </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, so what's considered UK, </joey>
<joey> what's Great Britain, </joey>
<joey> what's the Commonwealth, </joey>
<joey> what's all of this shit? </joey>
<joey> Like it's just really confusing to me. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, do we wanna get... </connor>
<connor> Search for the video on it.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I could try to explain it, but- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause there's
plenty of videos on it. </connor>
<joey> We're not gonna explain it, but- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you should learn the Wales exists. </connor>
<joey> - See, but at least, you know, </joey>
<connor> in the case with Wales and England, right? </connor>
<connor> Like at least you got, you know, </connor>
<connor> I feel a lot of the same sports </connor>
<connor> you guys are either good
at or bad at, right? </connor>
<connor> So like say, for example,
in the rugby, right, </connor>
<connor> Wales and England, pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- They're not like top-top, </connor>
<connor> but they usually stay
up near the top, right? </connor>
<connor> So at least you have that choice. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't have that choice
with my two countries </connor>
<connor> because the sports that
Australia is good at, </connor>
<connor> Japan sucks at. </connor>
<garnt> And sports that Japan is
good at, Australia sucks at. </garnt>
<garnt> So in the soccer, right,
Japan's pretty good. </garnt>
<joey> Australia is shit in the cricket. </joey>
<joey> Japan don't even play cricket. </joey>
<joey> And the rugby is probably
like the only thing, </joey>
<joey> because, you know, I think
last Rugby World Cup, </joey>
<garnt> Japan came eighth, I think?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Top eight or something.
- It was hosted in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> so they were the host country. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is hype as fuck, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because Japan is never that good. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the only time where I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Alright, Japan, you did good, </joey>
<joey> but I'm gonna have to go back
to Australia after that." </joey>
<connor> - Is Australia good at rugby? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Australia's really good. </joey>
<joey> And they're in top four. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't watch sports often, </connor>
<connor> mainly because of, you know, </connor>
<connor> since we live in this time zone, </connor>
<joey> when the fuck is this shit happening? </joey>
<joey> The reason why it's so easy for me </joey>
<joey> to keep along with the Olympics </joey>
<garnt> is 'cause it's just all day.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's great. </garnt>
<connor> I wake up, it's on. I go to bed, it's on. </connor>
<connor> It's perfect. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's kind of what I liked </garnt>
<garnt> about big sporting competitions, you know. </garnt>
<connor> Any age I was where you turn on the TV </connor>
<connor> and it's just sports
playing, and it's just fun. </connor>
<connor> And it's fun to watch something </connor>
<connor> where every match matters to somebody. </connor>
<connor> I just wish I knew more
about who was competing </connor>
<connor> in the Olympics.
- Yeah, </connor>
<connor> but there's no way you can though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's no way you can. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like there's so much information. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, you know, I was getting confused </garnt>
<connor> 'cause even in some of the sports, </connor>
<connor> like TaeKwonDo or some
of the martial arts, </connor>
<connor> there's weight divisions. </connor>
<connor> And there's so many weight divisions, </connor>
<connor> there's so many competitors
in the weight divisions, </connor>
<connor> and there might be multiple
ones from your country </connor>
<connor> in the one weight division. </connor>
<connor> So it's really hard to
be like, "Alright, wait, </connor>
<connor> who am I rooting for?" </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is going on? </connor>
<joey> - I just see the flag </joey>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Oh, I recognize that one. </garnt>
<garnt> Go, that one." (laughs)
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's basically what
it boils down to, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, "I like that country. </garnt>
<joey> Let's see that country do well." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, "Ooh, </joey>
<joey> I've never heard of Lichtenstein before. </joey>
<connor> I think they're good at this sport. </connor>
<connor> Go them." </connor>
<connor> - Are they competing in the Olympics? </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know. </connor>
<joey> Dude, okay, watching the opening ceremony, </joey>
<joey> and you know how they have to
go through all the countries? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There was like over a hundred countries </joey>
<joey> that were competing this year. </joey>
<joey> But it was funny because they were going </joey>
<joey> not in alphabetical order, </joey>
<joey> they were going in
Japanese hiragana order, </joey>
<joey> which is completely different.
- Oh. </joey>
<joey> I was wondering what kind
of order they were going in </joey>
<joey> because it just seemed
like the most weird order </joey>
<garnt> that had ever been done. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's why there
were like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> some countries starting with C </joey>
<garnt> that came after countries starting with K, </garnt>
<garnt> because in Japanese alphabet,
it's in the same order. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember my sister in
Australia was texting me </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause she was watching it as well, </garnt>
<garnt> and she was like, "Oh, it's really funny </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause these Australian commentators </garnt>
<garnt> have been explaining
for the past 10 minutes </garnt>
<connor> why these countries are
coming out in this order." </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> They literally have to explain
the Japanese writing system </connor>
<connor> to an Australian fucking audience. </connor>
<connor> So they're like, "Okay, so hear me out. </connor>
<connor> This is how it works and this
is why it's the weird order." </connor>
<connor> But I heard, </connor>
<connor> dude, there was so many countries in there </connor>
<joey> where I was like, yeah, that
sounds like a made up word, </joey>
<connor> like that's not a real country. </connor>
<connor> - Well, some of them, if I'm correct, </connor>
<connor> aren't even countries. </connor>
<connor> Like, I think like- </connor>
<joey> - Some of them are micronations. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, some of them are territories </connor>
<joey> or territories of other countries. </joey>
<connor> Like there's the Cayman islands as well, </connor>
<connor> it's listed as its own country? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "I don't think that is." </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, I saw some drama happen live </garnt>
<garnt> while I was watching boxing. </garnt>
<garnt> There was like a British
guy versus a French guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's drama already. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's drama
already, which is that- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] (laughs) Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Let's go back to history, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's hotter if you got
drama over here. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Napoleon just makes a
fucking, like, expose video </connor>
<connor> or whatever. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was literally like that. </connor>
<garnt> And they were boxing, right? </garnt>
<connor> And so obviously when you're boxing, </connor>
<connor> sometimes they do the hugging thing. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, okay, cool. </connor>
<connor> So when they were doing the hugging thing, </connor>
<connor> I think the French guy </connor>
<connor> was like, headbutting the British guy. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, shit.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he made him bleed. </connor>
<connor> And the ref was like,
"Hey, don't do that again." </connor>
<garnt> He did it again. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he just immediately
disqualified him. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right, right.
- The guy. </garnt>
<joey> - The French guy?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And he had a fucking mentdown, </joey>
<joey> like a mental breakdown, </joey>
<joey> and started like shouting and stuff, </joey>
<joey> going up to all the cameras, </joey>
<connor> being like, "No, I won, no,
I won," into the cameras. </connor>
<connor> - Wow.
- And they were announcing it. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "No, stop announcing it. </connor>
<connor> Stop announcing it."
- Stop the count. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> he was doing like,
"Stop, this is bullshit. </garnt>
<joey> There's no way." </joey>
<joey> And he was like throwing a massive fit. </joey>
<joey> It was so crazy.
- Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> How did I not see that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> When it was happening, </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh, shit,
am I watching drama live? </garnt>
<garnt> Yo, sick."
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I did what any good person watching drama- </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) use to watch "World Star." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was watching- </garnt>
<garnt> - He watched a highly
televised "World Star." </garnt>
<garnt> - It was great. </garnt>
<garnt> The lively pop-pop thing
start popping up, like midway. </garnt>
<connor> It was great.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I immediately went to Twitter, </connor>
<connor> as any good person would
when featuring drama. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, this is great." </connor>
<connor> So I went to Twitter, I watched it, </connor>
<connor> and I was watching everyone else </connor>
<connor> talk about the drama I was watching. </connor>
<joey> It was great.
- Oh, that's weird </joey>
<joey> because I've seen so many clips
of the Olympics on Twitter. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a lot more drama in
the Olympics that happened. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I've watched
more Olympics on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> than I have on television.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The other clips I saw of the Olympics </garnt>
<joey> was that they were playing
a lot of anime music. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, a lot of people are
doing anime stuff, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like so when you come out in boxing, </joey>
<joey> you're allowed to play your own music. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And some of them, one of
them had "Demon Slayer," </joey>
<connor> one of the Japanese guys.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I saw that. </connor>
<joey> - I saw there was a
Greek person who did a- </joey>
<joey> - The "One Piece" thing. </joey>
<joey> - He did "Gear 2" and "One Piece." </joey>
<joey> And won the fucking gold medal as well. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs)
- (laughs) What a bad ass. </joey>
<joey> - And I think he set a record as well. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, yo, "One Piece" stands, </joey>
<joey> "One Piece" stands, </joey>
<garnt> like fucking stand up, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I think one of
the volleyball matches </joey>
<garnt> with the Japanese team, </garnt>
<garnt> they were playing the
"Haiku" theme as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Like during the interval and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, that's so cool.
- Of course they were. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> the only cool part about
the opening ceremony </garnt>
<joey> was the fact that, from what I saw, </joey>
<joey> 'cause admittedly, </joey>
<joey> compared to some of the
other opening ceremonies </joey>
<joey> that I've seen- </joey>
<connor> - It was a very artistic one, I'd say. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was-
- You know what that means. </joey>
<joey> - Artistic. </joey>
<garnt> - It's very bare bones. </garnt>
<joey> - It was bare bones.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like the references I think
that people were looking for </joey>
<joey> were not in the opening, </joey>
<joey> so I think a lot of people
are hoping that it comes out </joey>
<joey> in the ending ceremony. </joey>
<connor> But I think the only cool thing was that, </connor>
<connor> during the time when all the
countries were coming out, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's like an
hour and a half segment </connor>
<connor> of all the countries coming out, </connor>
<connor> they were playing just
basically the entire discography </connor>
<joey> of Square Enix games.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like literally every Square
Enix game you could think of, </joey>
<joey> they were playing the music of. </joey>
<joey> So they literally opened with
the "Dragon Quest" theme, </joey>
<joey> and they were playing "Final
Fantasy" and "Chrono Trigger." </joey>
<garnt> They played the fucking
"NieR:Automata" song. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I heard the
"NieR" song. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - But not just any "NieR:Automata" song, </garnt>
<joey> literally the most darkest
depressing "NieR:Automata" song </joey>
<connor> that plays in a really
sad scene in the game. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - And, man, it was like melted. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, (laughs)
(Connor and Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> fucking like, (wailing), </connor>
<connor> this fucking sad "NieR:Automata" music. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) It was really weird. </connor>
<connor> But I'm just thinking like, </connor>
<garnt> because, you know, I think the
biggest question everyone had </garnt>
<garnt> who watched the opening is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where's all the Nintendo shit?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I was-
- Where's Pokemon? </garnt>
<garnt> Where's Mario? </garnt>
<joey> Where's all that stuff that they promised </joey>
<joey> at the last thing.
- It's kind of odd, </joey>
<connor> 'cause normally Japan
has been quite patriotic </connor>
<joey> with all of its, </joey>
<joey> especially Pokemon.
- Right. </joey>
<garnt> - Japan is not as... </garnt>
<garnt> Ah, what's the word? </garnt>
<connor> Japan has not been
scared to embrace Pokemon </connor>
<joey> as a national symbol. </joey>
<joey> - And, you know,
considering the fact that, </joey>
<garnt> at the end of the last Olympics, you know- </garnt>
<garnt> - We had the Mario thing.
- Yeah, </garnt>
<connor> like our prime minister came out of a pipe </connor>
<joey> dressed up like Mario, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well, it could be a thing </joey>
<joey> of Nintendo didn't wanna do it. </joey>
<connor> Or it could have been a thing of- </connor>
<joey> - Or I think what a lot
of people are waiting for </joey>
<joey> is because they were like, "Square Enix, </joey>
<joey> we'll let you take the opening." </joey>
<joey> But Nintendo is the end, bro.
- I don't know- </joey>
<joey> - I think that's what people are hoping. </joey>
<joey> - By the time this has come out, </joey>
<connor> we'll know the answer.
- Yeah, I guess so. </connor>
<joey> But as of right now, </joey>
<joey> that's what I think all
the theories are, but. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like, </garnt>
<garnt> do you think the opening
was purposefully done </garnt>
<connor> the way it is, </connor>
<connor> or is it just because
of the world situation </connor>
<connor> that they couldn't make it bigger? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause that's what I assumed.
- (inhales) I feel... </garnt>
<connor> I think it's the latter. </connor>
<connor> - Did you go back and watch
other opening ceremonies? </connor>
<joey> - I did.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I watched the one at
the Beijing Olympics. </connor>
<joey> Like that one was insane,
compared to Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, the Japanese one was
good, don't get me wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> but I definitely did feel that, </garnt>
<joey> I think the world situation
really did screw it over </joey>
<joey> in a lot of ways, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, 100%. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was like, </joey>
<joey> I like the idea that they were going for, </joey>
<garnt> but I feel it was a little underperformed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like, where's the budget? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> It really did feel that way. </connor>
<connor> - The British one had the
fucking Queen skydiving. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, how much
did that cost? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> Yeah, that Daniel Craig be James Bond. </joey>
<joey> There's no way he did that
for less than $50 million. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- No. </joey>
<connor> - He literally hates James Bond, </connor>
<joey> as we've established.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Why would he wanna do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, right? </garnt>
<connor> - For queen and country,
obviously. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Bullshit, bullshit.
- So that's what I was- </connor>
<connor> - Only if I get to wear
my gloves. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So that's why I was hoping
that they would have at least, </connor>
<garnt> you know, some more
notable, big, big people </garnt>
<garnt> coming out in the opening, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like that's, you know, </garnt>
<connor> the way to open for your country </connor>
<connor> and be braggadocious about
your country for once. </connor>
<connor> But I feel they're like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's the one time
you can actually brag </connor>
<joey> about what's going on.
- Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> And people are waiting for you to brag. </joey>
<joey> But I feel like the references
that they did throw in </joey>
<joey> were super fucking subtle
and kind of offhand, almost? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, what was that
guy that was tap dancing? </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't get that. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> He was literally, </garnt>
<joey> I think it was he's the
greatest tap dancer in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Right, so explain, what was going on? </connor>
<connor> I watched it, I don't remember this. </connor>
<joey> - So there was this tap...
So what they did instead was, </joey>
<joey> instead of bringing out
these notable names, </joey>
<joey> they brought out Japan's best blank. </joey>
<joey> So they had Japan's best tap
dancer and he was performing </joey>
<joey> and then they had Japan's best, like, </joey>
<connor> jazz pianist.
- I do remember this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I do remember this </joey>
<joey> and I think I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Why are they bringing
in tap dancers in Japan." </connor>
<joey> Isn't that not a Japanese thing? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, also during a really
traditional wood scene as well, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "It's like
400 years difference </joey>
<joey> between tap dancing and (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, when I think Japan, </joey>
<joey> I don't think tap dancing, no.
- No, not at all. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think tap
dancing and jazz piano. </garnt>
<joey> That's why I don't get it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was just so surreal
seeing a tap dancer </joey>
<joey> dancing on a stage with nothing on it </joey>
<garnt> to a crowd of zero people </garnt>
<garnt> in a stadium that's
meant for 30,000 people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Oh, it's so depressing </garnt>
<connor> seeing all the stadiums empty.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I actually read that, </joey>
<joey> the guy who designed the actual stadium, </joey>
<connor> to make, you know, </connor>
<connor> because obviously they couldn't
put people into the stadium. </connor>
<connor> So what they did was he
purposely designed the seats </connor>
<connor> and arranged the colors </connor>
<garnt> to make it look like
there were people sitting </garnt>
<garnt> from a distance. </garnt>
<garnt> - What, how can you do that?
- There did not look like </garnt>
<garnt> there were people sitting
in the distance at all. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] You decide if that
actually worked, but (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - I can say I tried to make
my fart smell like watermelon, </connor>
<connor> doesn't mean it fucking
worked, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) But I ate a
shitload of watermelons. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean, you tried? </joey>
<joey> No you fucking didn't.
- Yeah, </joey>
<connor> that was the intent, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (chuckles)
- But, yeah, obviously, </connor>
<joey> you know, to varying degrees of success. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I think a
lot of it was unfortunate </garnt>
<garnt> because I think another
thing about the tap dancing </garnt>
<connor> is that it's 'cause of
the stadium was so big </connor>
<connor> and I don't think the microphones
were sensitive enough. </connor>
<connor> I could hardly fucking hear it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> At that point, </connor>
<garnt> it was just like fucking
stepping with attitude. </garnt>
<garnt> That's kind of what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> - The commentators, I was
watching it on Japanese TV, </garnt>
<garnt> they were explaining what was going on </garnt>
<joey> more than they were
letting the audio play. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- (giggles) Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So how good of an
opening ceremony is that </joey>
<connor> if I need, I actually need, </connor>
<connor> a narrator telling me what's happening? </connor>
<joey> - Like, legit, some of the stuff </joey>
<connor> was so avant-garde-
- Yeah, it was crazy. </connor>
<connor> - But like 60% of the commentators </connor>
<connor> were doing the fucking audio commentary. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they were describing
exactly what was going on. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What is this?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so this represents
blah, blah, blah. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Just let me watch it. </connor>
<connor> Shut up, just me watch it." </connor>
<garnt> - It's not very good if I
can't discern what's going on. </garnt>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<garnt> Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was watching it
through the British commentary </garnt>
<joey> and there was not too much commentary </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think they were
just as confused as I. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) They're
like, "What's going on?" </joey>
<joey> - Also, it's not a good opening ceremony </joey>
<connor> if you fucking talk over all of it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I don't go watch "Of Mice and Men" </connor>
<connor> and have someone narrate in my ear </connor>
<joey> why Lenny is doing all this shit. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean, right? </joey>
<joey> I don't need this shit. </joey>
<connor> Let it speak for itself. </connor>
<connor> It's, oh my god. </connor>
<joey> - I think the speech afterwards
of the Olympic Committee </joey>
<connor> actually went on for longer
than the performance did. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> I zoned out when it happened.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, yeah, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> maybe that was because
of a budget problem, </connor>
<connor> maybe it was because
of the world situation, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, I think a lot more people... </connor>
<joey> I think the only good
thing that came out of it </joey>
<joey> was probably Square
Enix's stocks went boom </joey>
<joey> because of the amount of music
they used at the beginning. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna know how
Square Enix was basically </garnt>
<joey> just got to take over
the opening ceremony. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I have no idea. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause there's so many other Japanese- </connor>
<garnt> - Slipped someone a tenner, man. </garnt>
<joey> - (laughs) Yeah.
- Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> But they literally like, you know, </joey>
<joey> had the actual spotlight at that point. </joey>
<connor> I remember as well, </connor>
<joey> like it wasn't just Square Enix music. </joey>
<connor> They literally played a song </connor>
<joey> from fucking "Sonic Adventure 2." </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. One of the songs
that played in the set, </joey>
<joey> because the set piece
was leaked on Twitter </joey>
<joey> before the actual
beginning of that segment, </joey>
<joey> and in the list there
was a fucking Sonic song. </joey>
<joey> ♪ Rolling around at the speed of sound ♪ </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) It wasn't that one.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I think if someone played it, </connor>
<connor> I would've actually lost my mind. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I would've given it a standing ovation. </connor>
<connor> I would've been like, "They did it. </connor>
<connor> They fucking did it."
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, best opening
ceremony of all time, woo! </garnt>
<garnt> - But, yeah, they legit... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it was "Sonic Adventure 2," </garnt>
<garnt> but it was one of the Sonic games. </garnt>
<connor> But they legitimately played a Sonic song </connor>
<connor> and I was just like- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, Sonic's pretty fucking iconic. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, hey, man, </garnt>
<joey> they did it, I guess. (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - But how did Sega get in, </garnt>
<garnt> and then Nintendo just didn't then? </garnt>
<joey> - And I think that's why, </joey>
<joey> like that's where the confusion arose </joey>
<connor> of like, okay, so obviously
more people know... </connor>
<joey> When you think of Japan from
like a foreigner's perspective, </joey>
<connor> you think Pokemon and Mario.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you don't think of
"Final Fantasy" and Sonic. </connor>
<connor> - Would you say Sonic's more
famous than "Final Fantasy"? </connor>
<connor> It is, right? </connor>
<connor> - Sonic?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Probably.
- Probably, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that weird? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause he's only had
like, three good games. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He's literally just like, </joey>
<joey> he's cashing in on the brand-
- You mean on the first three? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, he's literally cashing
in on the brand recognition. </connor>
<garnt> - Sonic is one of those- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo, "Sonic Riders" though.
- Okay. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, "Sonic Riders" is good.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I recognize that it is not
the best game. (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> "Sonic Riders," "Battle
Adventure 2" is good and "Mania." </joey>
<joey> - "Sonic Heroes" was weirdly good too. </joey>
<joey> - But isn't it strange, though, </joey>
<joey> how Sonic hasn't had the
biggest smash hit games, </joey>
<connor> yet he's still the one of the most </connor>
<joey> recognizable game figures?
- That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> Sonic is not purely surviving
off of character design. </joey>
<connor> - Brand recognition, bro. </connor>
<garnt> It's branding.
- I mean, he's just an icon. </garnt>
<connor> - His character design
is fucking brilliant. </connor>
<connor> It's brilliant.
- Porn. </connor>
<connor> It's gotta be all porn. </connor>
<connor> I'm convinced it's all porn.
- Yeah, that too. </connor>
<connor> - Go on, sorry.
(Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - It's just a cult following, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - You know, after "Sonic 3," right, </connor>
<connor> we haven't had a single good Sonic game. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, "Sonic Mania."
- "Mania." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I mean, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But, I mean, it's kind of a remake of- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's up for debate, right? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's all been 2D Sonics. </joey>
<joey> There hasn't been a good 3D Sonic. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, all the 2D Sonics were fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Except for, you know, "Riders." </garnt>
<garnt> - All the 3D Sonics except for
"Riders" was absolute trash. </garnt>
<garnt> And yet they can somehow pump out </garnt>
<joey> all these shit Sonic games </joey>
<joey> and people are still just like, </joey>
<joey> "I mean, the next one might be better." </joey>
<connor> - Did you play "Mario and
Sonic at the Olympic Games"? </connor>
<joey> - No, I haven't. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking loved that game.
- Oh, I remember that, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is that a good game?
- Dude, you're like- </joey>
<joey> - I've always wanted to play that game. </joey>
<connor> - On the the 2008 Beijing Olympics one, </connor>
<connor> you couldn't get a copy of that in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Really?
- It was sold out everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm surprised they
didn't do a re-release </garnt>
<garnt> for this Olympics. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think they did last year. </garnt>
<garnt> - They did last year.
- Oh, okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they did last year.
- Yeah. </joey>

<joey> Links in the description below. </joey>
<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> One thing that I noticed </connor>
<connor> that I saw a lot of
athletes complaining about </connor>
<joey> was how bad the temperature is here. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Like how bad the heat is. </joey>
<connor> - It's absolutely brutal here right now. </connor>
<joey> - These poor people doing
like triathlons and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and cross-country cycling. </joey>
<garnt> It looks great on TV. You
can't even tell it looks hot. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it just looks like,
"Oh, good weather, nice." </garnt>
<connor> It's disgusting here. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, we talked
about this last week, </garnt>
<garnt> but the summer here is fucking disgusting. </garnt>
<connor> - It's insane. </connor>
<connor> And just these poor athletes </connor>
<garnt> who have to do hour long
events in this heat. </garnt>
<joey> - Alright, right now where
we are, it is 34 degrees, </joey>
<joey> but because of the humidity,
it feels like 41 degrees. </joey>
<garnt> - It's insane.
- Fuck that. </garnt>
<joey> - It do be like that. </joey>
<joey> - It do be like that.
- Like, even just walking </joey>
<connor> from the train station to the office, </connor>
<connor> it's a nice, brisk five, 10 minute walk, </connor>
<garnt> I'm fucking dying by the time I get here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't care where you live </garnt>
<garnt> or what fucking temperature it is, </garnt>
<connor> no one should be doing
sports in 41 fucking celsius. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> No one should be doing a
triathlon in 40 degrees celsius. </joey>
<connor> - No.
- I don't care </connor>
<connor> if you were raising the
magma crust of this earth. </connor>
<connor> I know there's gonna be one comment </connor>
<connor> who's like, "Oh, it's 50, right?" </connor>
<connor> Fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you're not doing a
triathlon in 50 degrees, are you? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm wondering, like, </joey>
<joey> how the fuck are they doing this? </joey>
<garnt> Or how is anyone meant to
compete in this weather? </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder why. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure I read something. </connor>
<connor> I could be totally, totally
wrong with this one, </connor>
<connor> that apparently they did try and ask, </connor>
<connor> Japan did try and tell them </connor>
<connor> like, "Hey, we should do it
in September or something." </connor>
<connor> But the IOC was like, "Nope,
we're doing it in July." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - And of all the sports that
are perfect for this heat, </joey>
<joey> AKA, the swimming, is done indoors, </joey>
<garnt> so it's like not a point.
(Garnt and Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> At least do that outside, you know? </garnt>
<joey> It will feel good for the athletes. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Jesus. </garnt>
<connor> I feel bad now. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even think about that. </connor>
<connor> They must be absolutely
dying out there in the heat. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, it's brutal.
- Ripperonies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But like, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> how much is left of the
Olympics now that we are- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, not many Olympic
days left at where we are. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's only like a
two week event, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we're on day-
- Is it that short? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Shit. </connor>
<connor> - We're like day 12 or something. </connor>
<joey> - I thought it was like a
couple of months or something. </joey>
<joey> - No, it has to be done. </joey>
<joey> I think one of the rules in the contract </joey>
<joey> with the Olympics Committee
to the local government </joey>
<connor> is that it needs to be
done within like two weeks. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - And no longer, no less. </connor>
<connor> Like it has to- </connor>
<joey> - Why does it feel like every Olympics, </joey>
<joey> it lasts so much longer than that? </joey>
<joey> Is it because it's just so stacked? </joey>
<connor> - Because, like, the
hype for it is built up </connor>
<connor> more than any E3 event tenfold. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And "No Man's Sky" wishes
that it had this much hype. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> We've lived in Japan for
like two years now, right? </connor>
<garnt> And since day one, since we've been here, </garnt>
<garnt> you've been seeing Tokyo 2020 stuff </garnt>
<garnt> everywhere.
- That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it's insane. </garnt>
<garnt> Like everything is Tokyo 2020. </garnt>
<connor> Like you go and get a chocolate bar, </connor>
<connor> Tokyo 2020 is on it for some reason. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Why is this on there? </connor>
<joey> - We did actually buy some
Tokyo 2020 merchandise </joey>
<joey> just because, like... </joey>
<joey> Well, think about it, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, it's one of the few,
if not the only Olympics, </connor>
<connor> that has ever been in this
like weird world situation </connor>
<connor> where it's been delayed by a year, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's so telling of its... </connor>
<connor> I think Aki bought a Tokyo 2020 face mask. </connor>
<garnt> That, 50 years from now, is
gonna be a great story to tell </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like, you know-
- Should've done that myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just to say that like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> we'd lived through a time </garnt>
<garnt> when there was such like
an insane world pandemic </garnt>
<joey> that we literally had to A,
cancel the Olympics for a year, </joey>
<joey> but B, everyone had to fucking
wear this for two years. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's weird, right, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like this
Olympics, the hype just... </garnt>
<connor> Like you talked about the hype, </connor>
<garnt> but I just haven't felt the hype at all </garnt>
<garnt> behind this year's Olympics. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, because I think the
last year, before COVID hit, </connor>
<joey> the hype was definitely building up. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, it was definitely there. </joey>
<joey> - But I think the moment COVID hit </joey>
<connor> and it got pushed back
a year is when I think- </connor>
<joey> - And then the hype for COVID happened. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I think
pretty much the general people </connor>
<joey> just turned against the Olympics </joey>
<joey> and they were like, "We
don't want it anymore." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Even though Japan is
doing exceedingly well </joey>
<garnt> this Olympics as well.
- Are they? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. They've won a
lot of gold medals already. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, they're third
right now, I think, actually. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, shit. okay. </connor>
<garnt> - No, they're doing very well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, see, I just haven't
been following along </garnt>
<connor> as much as I used to just
because, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like I said, the hype
just doesn't feel there </connor>
<connor> obviously in Japan, </connor>
<connor> 'cause Japanese people
don't want it to happen </connor>
<connor> for obvious reasons. </connor>
<connor> But also internationally, </connor>
<garnt> it just feels like there's
been a lot less talk </garnt>
<connor> about it as well. </connor>
<connor> You see the odd article,
we see the odd clip. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's been a rough year, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> I think also political
situations are getting rough </garnt>
<connor> and you're seeing it in
the Olympics as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's been in a lot of talks, </joey>
<joey> just not for the right
reasons a lot of the time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it just feels like, you know, </connor>
<connor> at least like Olympics pre-,
I don't know, like 2012, 2016, </connor>
<joey> maybe not 2016, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> it didn't feel as fucked
politically as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of politics in
it now. And there always was, </joey>
<connor> maybe I was just younger
and I didn't realize, </connor>
<connor> but it just, yeah, it feels very tense. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, the world is
in a tense state right now, </garnt>
<garnt> just in general, </garnt>
<garnt> so it definitely just doesn't help. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone's just on edge now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like it's, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone loves the idea of the Olympics, </garnt>
<connor> just like every nation gets together </connor>
<connor> and we just play a bunch
of sports and have- </connor>
<connor> - And put our differences aside. </connor>
<connor> - Put our differences-
- Play some ball. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, put our differences
aside and play some games. </connor>
<joey> - Friendly competition.
- Friendly competitions. </joey>
<joey> And you know, in any other Olympics, </joey>
<joey> I feel like that is the case. </joey>
<joey> In this Olympics, it just
feels like nobody really, </joey>
<garnt> everyone's just forgotten to care </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can we just have the world open back up?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I just wanna go to Denny's. </garnt>
<garnt> - I see the empty seats there. </garnt>
<joey> It's reminding me that it's
still a depressing situation </joey>
<joey> in the world. </joey>
<connor> Well, most of the world, at least. </connor>
<connor> So I don't know, it's been difficult. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Definitely, definitely. </joey>
<joey> Just want it to be open. </joey>
<joey> - Who has been winning the Olympics? </joey>
<connor> I have not been keeping up with it at all. </connor>
<connor> - Ah, China's winning
right now, if I saw before. </connor>
<garnt> - It's always China and
USA at the top, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then Japan. </connor>
<connor> And then I think Australia and Britain </connor>
<connor> are neck and neck for fourth, </connor>
<connor> but it's hard to tell what's gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> But, I mean, China or
USA normally always win. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they're usually the top two. </joey>
<joey> - And then that's like the
Cold War-esque thing for them </joey>
<joey> where it matters who
wins that politically. </joey>
<connor> - That's the friendly
competition, unless... </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
- Friendly? (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] Know ranking? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, what's the ranking now? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, what's the ranking? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] So People's
Republic of China, 32 golds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Uh-huh.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] United
States of America, 25 golds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] Japan,
number three, with 20 golds </garnt>
<garnt> - Nice.
- Oh, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] Australia, 15 golds. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Let's go. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] ROC, Republic of... </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, that's Russia.
- That's Russia. </joey>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] ROC is
fifth, Great Britain sixth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, shit, I was wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - Guess Britain isn't doing
too well this Olympics, are we? </garnt>
<connor> - Like that commentator said, man, </connor>
<garnt> absolute embarrassment for British rowing. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs)
- The absolute stink. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - The absolute stink British rowing. </connor>
<connor> Well, it was one of the events
that Britain used to win </connor>
<connor> at least somewhat consistently. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like
it's somewhat big part </connor>
<garnt> of British culture.
- Yeah, what have we got? </garnt>
<connor> - One of the only sports
that's like one of the things </connor>
<connor> where we actually have a big deal about. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like rowing
and cycling, right, </garnt>
<connor> that we usually just like- </connor>
<garnt> - Cycling, we normally have
a really good turn out. </garnt>
<garnt> British people love fucking
cycling for some reason. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- 'Cause we invented football </connor>
<garnt> and then everyone, every nation
just beat us at football. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're like, okay, we've
gotta find another sport. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did we invent cricket? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if we invented cricket. </joey>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure we invented cricket. </connor>
<connor> - I think you guys invented cricket. </connor>
<connor> - And rugby.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then Australia was like.
(everyone laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I saw that meme where it was like, </connor>
<connor> Britain invents a sport, </connor>
<connor> gives it to other country, </connor>
<connor> they become better at it. </connor>
<connor> And then America is like, </connor>
<connor> invent a sport, </connor>
<connor> no one plays it, </connor>
<connor> become number one. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's true.
- It's crazy. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> American football, lmao. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, have you watched the
American football before? </joey>
<joey> Are you into it at all? </joey>
<connor> - No, but I love watching the drama </connor>
<connor> around American football. </connor>
<connor> It's very good. </connor>
<connor> - What drama? </connor>
<connor> - You know, there's always
documentaries about it. </connor>
<connor> I've watched, what is it, </connor>
<connor> "Last Chance U," I think
it's called, on Netflix. </connor>
<connor> It's about college football
and they get, like, </connor>
<connor> they follow a team and try
and get to win the league, </connor>
<connor> and it's just very funny.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just insane, </connor>
<connor> the lengths they go to get
these kids to play football. </connor>
<joey> - Based on a true story? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no, so literally
just following them. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's like a documentary. </joey>
<joey> Right, right, right.
- Yeah, they just literally </joey>
<joey> pick a school and follow them.
- Okay, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And, yeah, that's
pretty good, on Netflix. </joey>
<joey> I watched the one thing
about that NFL player </joey>
<joey> who killed a guy. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- What? </joey>
<joey> - It was like an NFL player
who killed someone and, yeah. </joey>
<joey> These NFL players are crazy, man. </joey>
<connor> Like a lot of them are like, </connor>
<connor> they get up to very interesting
stuff in their free time. </connor>
<joey> - Like killing people. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Also the whole thing where they
get mad concussions from it </connor>
<garnt> and they all get like, brain damage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, like I've seen
that Will Smith movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's pretty rough, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I watched the super... </connor>
<connor> I was about to say super
bowel, for a second. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs)
- Superbowl. </connor>
<connor> - I just like super bowel, my favorite. </connor>
<garnt> - Superbowl.
- The Superbowl. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you feel like it's
like the most foreign thing </garnt>
<garnt> to a British person,
hearing the word Superbowl. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "What is that?" </garnt>
<garnt> "What is it?" The whole-
- Okay, okay, so- </garnt>
<connor> - Growing up, you hear
about the Superbowl. </connor>
<connor> - That's a really big bowl. </connor>
<connor> - So there's me watching the Superbowl </connor>
<connor> before I watch "Eyeshield 21."
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And there's me watching Superbowl </connor>
<connor> after I've watched "Eyeshield 21." </connor>
<connor> - See, I watched Superbowl after reading- </connor>
<garnt> - They're like, "Where's
the Devil Bat Ghosts?" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "Where's the Rodeo Drives?" </connor>
<connor> - I watched the Superbowl
after reading "Eyeshield 21," </connor>
<connor> which is a football manga.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I still don't know
what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<garnt> - Really?
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of get the rules, but I- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you get the rules
now at least, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't understand
how the Superbowl is formed. </garnt>
<garnt> How does it become? </garnt>
<connor> Who gets to play in the Superbowl? </connor>
<garnt> What are the rules? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you follow the
LEC and the LCS, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Mm, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's exactly the same format. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, just playoffs? </connor>
<garnt> - They literally based
League from American sports. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, why is it called the Superbowl? </connor>
<garnt> What about it- </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's like the final, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why it's
called the Superbowl. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there a reason? </connor>
<connor> - It's just-
- Why not "The Playoffs"? </connor>
<joey> That sounds good. </joey>
<joey> I understand the playoffs. </joey>
<joey> The playoffs makes sense.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Maybe it has to do with the UN? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, the playoffs
lead to the Superbowl, </garnt>
<garnt> so the Superbowl is like
the final of the playoffs. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, so Superbowl is the
name for the final match. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - British man learns about
American football, man. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) I don't know,
this is so foreign to me. </connor>
<garnt> - I only know this 'cause I follow League, </garnt>
<joey> and League is based on American
football, American sports. </joey>
<joey> - I think it has to do with </joey>
<connor> the name of the actual cup you win, right? </connor>
<connor> - Do you watch American football? </connor>
<joey> Oh, yeah, wait, no, that's not a bowl. </joey>
<joey> It's like a... </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is.
- Maybe it is, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's why the Ashes
are called the Ashes, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, can't figure that out. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude, I know more about
the American sports system </garnt>
<garnt> than I do about cricket. </garnt>
<connor> I like- </connor>
<connor> - So do you watch American football? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I watch the Superbowl. </garnt>
<garnt> And anytime I go to America, </garnt>
<joey> they're always watching
football every week, </joey>
<joey> and I pretend to care about-
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I watch the football in
America when it's on TV. </joey>
<joey> I don't willingly go and watch it. </joey>
<joey> But when it's on, I'm like,
okay, that's pretty cool. </joey>
<connor> - Watching normal football, </connor>
<connor> you know, you get the
ads just in the halftime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That's when you get the ads. </connor>
<connor> There's no other ads. </connor>
<connor> The 40 minutes is straight playing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it was really weird and jarring </connor>
<connor> when I watched American football. </connor>
<joey> And every time there's
like an attempt, I think, </joey>
<joey> there's an ad. And I was
like, whoa, what the- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because there's
so many starts and stops. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, the starts and stops, </joey>
<joey> and of course they put ads
there, but it's just so jarring. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, fucking, I don't
wanna hear about fucking Cheetos </joey>
<connor> and Bud Light, man. </connor>
<connor> I just, like, I can't do this. </connor>
<joey> - That's literally the two
forces that drive the NFL. </joey>
<connor> - It was hard to get invested </connor>
<garnt> 'cause every 10 seconds there'd be an ad. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh my god." </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's just
everything is monetized </garnt>
<connor> in American sports.
- Yeah, and also, </connor>
<connor> watching American TV in American hotels </connor>
<connor> is really weird as well because, you know, </connor>
<connor> we have our ads before the program starts </connor>
<connor> and in the middle of the program, right? </connor>
<connor> And when I was watching American TV, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if they changed it or what, </connor>
<connor> but I was watching it </connor>
<garnt> and they let the show
play for like two minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they have an ad. </garnt>
<joey> - And then they have an ad.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, "What is this? </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> Is it YouTube video? </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck is this?" </joey>
<garnt> - It's more consistent than a mid-roll? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> They put two mid-rolls and two end-rolls, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they have the intro, </garnt>
<garnt> they have the clickbait intro.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
- Then they have an ad, </garnt>
<connor> and then the actual
intro to the show plays, </connor>
<connor> half the show plays, ad, </connor>
<connor> second half of the show plays, </connor>
<connor> and then they have an ad. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, there's
like an end credit scene </connor>
<connor> or something like that, </connor>
<connor> or a scene that plays during the credits. </connor>
<connor> So they have an ad, and
then an end credit scene, </connor>
<garnt> and then it goes on to the next show. </garnt>
<joey> - Or sometimes it's even worse. </joey>
<joey> It's sometimes the end start rolling, </joey>
<connor> that minimizes into a
corner and shows an ad. </connor>
<connor> It's like another one that I've seen. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Am I watching an end credit </joey>
<joey> or am I watching an ad?" </joey>
<connor> - I think I was watching "South Park" </connor>
<connor> and they played legitimately
the first two minutes </connor>
<connor> of the actual episode </connor>
<connor> and then they played an ad, right? </connor>
<connor> And then they played like
20 minutes of the episode. </connor>
<garnt> Nearly near the end, right
before the end, another ad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right before the end, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Like a minute or two
before the show finishes. </connor>
<garnt> - Right.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then before it
concludes, they play an ad. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they play the two
minutes of the episode, </garnt>
<joey> and then they don't have
a break or anything, </joey>
<joey> they immediately start the
next episode of "South Park." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh, right. </connor>
<connor> - And let two minutes of that play </connor>
<connor> and then they play an ad again, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<garnt> - And so it's like, I was losing my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're all in the wrong place. </garnt>
<joey> - I was actually getting so
angry watching "South Park" </joey>
<joey> because I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Why do they keep putting
the ads like this?" </joey>
<joey> It feels like I'm being bombarded. </joey>
<joey> I can't think straight. </joey>
<connor> Where is the clear act of
we put an ad in the middle </connor>
<connor> and before the show? </connor>
<connor> When did this go out the window? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's because viewers </garnt>
<joey> are more likely to keep watching the show. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fucked up, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucked up.
- I know why it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it.
- It's so fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate it from like an
entertainment standpoint, </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, </garnt>
<joey> just let me watch a clear
chunk of this one episode, </joey>
<joey> have a clear moment where, you know, </joey>
<garnt> the episode ends and the next one begins </garnt>
<garnt> and that's where the ad break goes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they don't give you
a chance to take a pee break </joey>
<joey> in between an episode.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's 'cause they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you might change the channel. </joey>
<joey> So we'll just play it immediately." </joey>
<joey> So the next two minutes, now
you can go for your pee break. </joey>
<garnt> - When did this change? </garnt>
<joey> When was it like this? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's always
been like this in America. </joey>
<garnt> - Has it really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I have no idea.
- Fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, ever since, </garnt>
<garnt> like the first time I went
to America, it was like this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember that was
one of the first thing </garnt>
<garnt> I noticed as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you look at like, how, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause normally when you
binge watch American TV shows, </connor>
<connor> there's a very clear cut of
where they put the ads in. </connor>
<connor> And it's just at a weird moment </connor>
<connor> compared to British TV shows, </connor>
<connor> which is just beginning, </connor>
<garnt> halfway through the episode, then ending. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we have really strict
rules on advertising and stuff </connor>
<garnt> so there's never any overlays
or anything on the program. </garnt>
<joey> - Meanwhile, Japanese TV is like, </joey>
<joey> put as many ads in as you
possibly can every five minutes. </joey>
<connor> - It's so weird, the stuff
they promote in Japan. </connor>
<connor> But then you remember
it's for elderly people. </connor>
<joey> Elderly people only watch TV, </joey>
<joey> so then it all kind of makes sense. </joey>
<joey> Like they advertise futons all the time. </joey>
<joey> - Futons?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The hell kind of shows
are you watching? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Just normal, like NHK,
they'll just cut to a futon. </joey>
<joey> And there's so, so many telecall shows. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, telemarketing shows, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Telemarketing shows, so many. </joey>
<joey> - What's telemarketing shows? </joey>
<joey> - There's like three or four channels </joey>
<joey> of telemarketing.
- Where they like, </joey>
<joey> basically just play ads
and it's literally just, </joey>
<connor> it's literally whole networks. </connor>
<connor> And they're not like way back, </connor>
<connor> they're like four or five on the remote. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like a whole
network dedicated to ads, </connor>
<connor> and they show you the product, </connor>
<connor> then you can call up and buy it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's literally like- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it's like QVC or one of those- </garnt>
<connor> - But imagine if QVC
was like, number five. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) QVC is number
20 in the UK or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - It's like way, way
down, as it should be. </joey>
<connor> It's just ads, no one wants to watch that. </connor>
<connor> - Just think of, like, </connor>
<joey> if the ShamWow guy was
just constantly promoting </joey>
<joey> different types of ShamWow 24 hours a day. </joey>
<garnt> - So it's just an infomercial channel? </garnt>
<joey> - Literally an infomercial channel. </joey>
<joey> - There's like, three of them, </joey>
<joey> and they're the first
10 shows or something. </joey>
<garnt> I could be chatting out my ass, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, like-
- There's a lot of them. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I can kind of see why </garnt>
<garnt> there would be so many
infomercial kind of channels. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, I don't know, like- </garnt>
<connor> - Old people don't use the
internet to buy things. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they don't know what Amazon is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so when you're a kid, right, </garnt>
<garnt> and you had a sick day, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so I remember as a kid, you know, </garnt>
<connor> you'd enjoy the fact
that you had a sick day </connor>
<connor> 'cause, great, I don't
have to go to school, </connor>
<connor> but what do you do? </connor>
<connor> So back when I was a kid, </connor>
<connor> I did had nothing but just
had television, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you had the morning TV shows, </connor>
<connor> you had CBBC, when I was growing up, </connor>
<connor> and then it was like between 8:00 a.m. </connor>
<connor> to I think around 10:00 a.m., </connor>
<connor> which was just like, "Brilliant, I'm sick, </connor>
<connor> I get to watch TV programs
for as long as I stay home." </connor>
<connor> And then 10:00 a.m. hits </connor>
<connor> and then there is just
nothing to fucking watch. </connor>
<garnt> Like there is nothing on TV at all. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember I'd just be like, "Great, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I'll just
fucking put on QVC then," </garnt>
<connor> 'cause there's literally </connor>
<garnt> nothing else interesting on.
- What? </garnt>
<connor> There was "Jeremy Kyle" back then. </connor>
<garnt> You could watch- </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't get "Jeremy Kyle"
as a fucking seven-year-old. </garnt>
<connor> - I did when I was a
10-year-old. I loved it. </connor>
<connor> I loved the shouting and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and all the people jumping around. </connor>
<connor> I loved it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, well, I think it's
because during weekdays, </joey>
<connor> you know, in the middle of the day, </connor>
<connor> the only people who are watching TV </connor>
<joey> is anywhere below eight and
anywhere above 80, right? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause everyone else is at work or school. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause if I can't
watch something on the TV, </garnt>
<garnt> at least like watch some shiny products. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how my brain's wired, right? </garnt>
<connor> - You're like, "Oh, if
I can't watch something, </connor>
<joey> I might as well be advertised to." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laugh)
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I may as well. </garnt>
<connor> Mum, we have to get this diamond necklace. </connor>
<connor> The guy on the TV said we get three </connor>
<connor> if we purchase one. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling)
- God. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember seeing
all those infomercial stuff </connor>
<connor> during childhood, and even
10-year-old me was watching </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Who
the fuck's buying this?" </joey>
<connor> Like, "Who is buying this shit?" </connor>
<connor> - My permanent favorite thing of those </connor>
<garnt> is that like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> so they're advertising the product, </garnt>
<garnt> it looks fantastic, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, "Wow, this looks great. </garnt>
<connor> It's a mop that cleans my
floor and it cleans itself. </connor>
<connor> This is fantastic." </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Great,
I'm already sold." </connor>
<connor> And you get to the end and it's like, </connor>
<connor> "But if you act now, </connor>
<connor> you can get not one, not
two, but three extra mops." </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Whoa,
this is just too many mops. </connor>
<garnt> I only wanted the one." </garnt>
<garnt> Now you have three. </garnt>
<garnt> "And if you buy now on this exact moment, </garnt>
<garnt> you get two extra days free shipping." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, alright,
this is just ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> They keep throwing things in like, </garnt>
<connor> "And if you pay by card, </connor>
<connor> we'll come to your house
and install it for you." </connor>
<connor> It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. </connor>
<connor> And then the program will end, </connor>
<connor> and then you can tell they've done this </connor>
<connor> 'cause they did it all the fucking time, </connor>
<connor> they would record an extra bit </connor>
<connor> after it clearly didn't
sell well enough, whatever, </connor>
<connor> and they would cut to another
bit and it would be like, </connor>
<connor> "But fuck that part. </connor>
<connor> If you buy now, you'll
get five instead of three, </connor>
<connor> only for today." </connor>
<connor> It's like, what is going on?
- What's going on? </connor>
<connor> - I'm losing my fucking mind.
- Yeah, </connor>
<joey> they literally just keep adding on shit, </joey>
<joey> and it's always like, it needs
to be now that you call it. </joey>
<joey> Like before the next
thing comes, you need it. </joey>
<garnt> So there's people probably
just sitting there </garnt>
<joey> just waiting to call, "Oh,
wait, there's another thing." </joey>
<joey> Can I call it now? </joey>
<joey> Can I call it? </joey>
<joey> - Half the time I was sold before, </joey>
<joey> and now they're just raising my concerns </joey>
<connor> 'cause now this is now too much. </connor>
<connor> This is too much fodder. </connor>
<connor> - Now it's too good to be true. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, now this is way too
many products for the price. </connor>
<connor> I was sold on the $50 pen, </connor>
<connor> and now you're telling me
you're gonna include three pens? </connor>
<garnt> No way. (Joey laughs)
This is a cast iron pen. </garnt>
<connor> It should not be costing $10
per pen, including shipping. </connor>
<connor> This is a joke. </connor>
<garnt> - What set me off was
when they would introduce, </garnt>
<connor> when they would include a product </connor>
<connor> that had nothing to do with the product </connor>
<connor> that they were advertising.
- Yeah, yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - Or they just tacked it on for free. </connor>
<connor> Like, where did this come from? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You get the jewelry and they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "And now we're throwing
an extra Tenga on top." </garnt>
<connor> Alright, well, this is totally unrelated. </connor>
<connor> It's a bloody joke. </connor>
<connor> - All of this is worth $300,
but we're selling it for $30. </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) It's like,
is it really? Really? </joey>
<joey> - There's no way all of these
companies are making money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure I saw this thing, </joey>
<joey> that you're tacking on
yesterday's infomercial, </joey>
<joey> so it clearly didn't sell well. </joey>
<connor> - They have like a golden age. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I felt like there was a time </connor>
<connor> when the products were
actually semi decent. </connor>
<connor> Like you'd go to the supermarket </connor>
<connor> and you actually see the section
of "As seen on TV" product </connor>
<connor> and some of them were
actually pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean, </connor>
<joey> look at how much the
fucking ShamWow sold, right? </joey>
<joey> Like that side isn't- </joey>
<joey> - I think it was just before
the internet was invented. </joey>
<joey> So now you can just
search up whatever product </joey>
<connor> you kind of need, </connor>
<connor> and if not, then Japan has
a whole store for them. </connor>
<connor> It's called fucking Daiso.
- (chuckles) Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So you just walk into Daiso </garnt>
<garnt> and then you just find products </garnt>
<garnt> that you never knew you needed
until you walked into Daiso. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we need a sign now </garnt>
<garnt> that just says, "As seen on Daiso." </garnt>
<joey> As seen at Daiso. (laughs)
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Like, Japan is just like the king </joey>
<joey> of creating these little devices </joey>
<joey> which have just exactly one use, </joey>
<garnt> one very, very specific use
that you never thought about </garnt>
<garnt> until you see it in the store. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like, "Wow, I
guess I do need gloves </garnt>
<garnt> that can clean dishes at
the same time." (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - There's a lot of stuff like that. </connor>
<joey> - I guess I do need slippers
that have mops on them </joey>
<joey> so that I can walk around
while mopping the house. </joey>
<garnt> I guess that's a thing.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It's only 200 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck it, I'll take it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, why not? </garnt>
<garnt> Meanwhile, if I saw that on TV, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be like, "Who the fuck buys this? </garnt>
<garnt> Who needs some slipper
that wipes the floor?" </garnt>
<connor> - They also like, it's
like 100 yen stores, </connor>
<connor> so like less than a dollar, </connor>
<connor> it's around a dollar but just under, </connor>
<connor> and my favorite thing is
that sometimes in Daiso, </connor>
<connor> they'll have the same
product but different brands </connor>
<connor> and they're all the same price. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "What is this?" </connor>
<connor> Like, if you're gonna have your
competitor right next to you </connor>
<connor> for the same price, and what
I think is the same quality, </connor>
<connor> what is the purpose of this? </connor>
<connor> Illusion of choice? </connor>
<connor> - Well, there's clearly
not much competition. </connor>
<joey> - There's obviously not a
lot of competition out there. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, "Dragon's Den"
would never work for Japan </garnt>
<garnt> because you get the CEO of Daiso there, </garnt>
<garnt> and he'll just say yes to every idea. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> He'll be like, "I'll put in an offer." </garnt>
<garnt> - He just opens mouth, "I'm sold. </garnt>
<connor> I don't even wanna hear what it is, </connor>
<connor> I'm putting it in my store."
- Give it to me. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Could imagine "Dragon's Den" in the UK? </connor>
<connor> They'd have 10 fucking
minutes introducing each other </connor>
<connor> before they even actually
start the fucking pitch. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, they hand out business cards. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<connor> The person pitching would have to go </connor>
<connor> and fucking pour him water and everything, </connor>
<connor> like it's like they can't even start, </connor>
<connor> and oh my God.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> - They'd have to start with
a board meeting or something </garnt>
<garnt> before they even get in the room. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they would, they
would. Could you imagine? </connor>
<garnt> I bet the people being
pitched would be like, </garnt>
<connor> "No, we know exactly what's happening. </connor>
<connor> I want to see the script
of the man pitching </connor>
<connor> before he pitches it." </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like insane. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I would love to see it actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I never understood
about those shows </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's sold as, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> these are very real
businesses and very real ideas </garnt>
<garnt> that some of them actually go
on to be successful and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> But you look at some
of the people going on </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I've watched 'Dragon's Den' before." </garnt>
<garnt> Or 'Shark Tank,' which is
the American version, right? </garnt>
<garnt> There's a very simple formula, </garnt>
<garnt> there's very specific questions </garnt>
<garnt> that all the dragons ask
every single fucking time, </garnt>
<garnt> and somehow 90% of the contestants </garnt>
<joey> never know their fucking numbers. </joey>
<joey> Surely that's the first thing you do </joey>
<joey> if you figure out you're going
on "Dragon's Den," right? </joey>
<garnt> You're like, "Alright, </garnt>
<connor> let me just figure out my
fucking profit margins." </connor>
<connor> That's literally the
first thing you should do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like,
"What's your gross like?" </connor>
<joey> "Uh, sorry, what?" </joey>
<joey> What is it?
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gross, thank you very much. </joey>
<connor> - They'll ask like, "What
is your target audience?" </connor>
<connor> or whatever, and they'd
be like, "I don't know." </connor>
<connor> - People. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> People with money. </connor>
<connor> - I saw this one clip and
it made me fucking laugh. </connor>
<connor> It was on the British one. </connor>
<connor> It was from the guy who's like
the worst, he's like so... </connor>
<connor> What is he called? </connor>
<garnt> I think it was Touker?
- Touker? </garnt>
<garnt> - Touker, toot-toot, Touker? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sounds like a "Breaking Bad" character. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Touker, right? </connor>
<connor> He's like the guy who all
the other dragons hate </connor>
<connor> on the British one. </connor>
<connor> And it's just a great moment. </connor>
<connor> He's pitching their offer to them </connor>
<garnt> and he's like, "Okay,
so I'm gonna give you </garnt>
<garnt> the 50,000 pounds you asked for." </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen this clip. </garnt>
<garnt> - "For 90% of the business." </garnt>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - And then the dragons were
like, "So all of the business. </connor>
<connor> So you're trying to buy the
business off of him." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what's the remaining 10%? </connor>
<garnt> - You can't do anything with 10%. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - (laughs) Oh, I remember. </joey>
<joey> So the person he was pitching to was like, </joey>
<joey> "So who are you giving the money to?" </joey>
<garnt> And he's like, "I'm giving
the money to the business." </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "But you
own 90% of the business." </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So you're giving the money
to yourself. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) And I'm just like-
- That was so good. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And all the other dragons are
like, "What the fuck, bro? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is this?" </connor>
<connor> - Ultimate money laundering.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But imagine if he got to accept, </connor>
<connor> he'd be like, "Shut up, dragons, shut up. </connor>
<connor> He's gonna agree to it." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - Like, what is this? </joey>
<joey> These are supposed to be professional... </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you see the Dragons, right? </joey>
<garnt> You're like, "You're not a
fucking good businessman. </garnt>
<garnt> You just got really fucking
lucky with one business </garnt>
<garnt> and managed to convince
this TV show to let you on." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of them have no fucking idea </garnt>
<connor> what they're doing, I swear. </connor>
<connor> They'll be like, "Yeah, </connor>
<connor> he's got a multimillion dollar business." </connor>
<connor> And then when you think about businesses, </connor>
<connor> multimillion dollar business
is actually not that difficult. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, 'cause it's so stark, </garnt>
<garnt> the contrast between "Shark
Tank" and "Dragon's Den." </garnt>
<garnt> Like "Shark Tank" have Mark Cuban </garnt>
<connor> and full-on fucking billionaires. </connor>
<connor> - Like, really, really,
really, really, really- </connor>
<connor> - Like, really, really-
- Successful people, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Super, super fucking wealthy. </connor>
<garnt> And then compared to
like the dragons, it's- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think half the
dragons are pretty successful, </connor>
<connor> but they've had trouble
keeping the seats filled. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And they always bring in
people. And a lot of the time </connor>
<connor> they've had businesses that they just sold </connor>
<connor> and made like 4 million, </connor>
<connor> which is obviously a shit ton
of money, don't get me wrong, </connor>
<connor> but we're talking businesses. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's not really a good proven- </connor>
<joey> - In the business world,
4 million's not like- </joey>
<joey> - You know, </joey>
<connor> I wouldn't say it's a
hardcore proven track record </connor>
<joey> that you know how to run a business 100%. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Alright, you might've
got lucky here and there, </joey>
<joey> you had a good idea. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't prove that you... </joey>
<joey> I don't think that's good enough </joey>
<joey> where you can go on and
start telling people </joey>
<joey> how to run their businesses. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Possibly, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Nah, I get it, I get it. </joey>
<connor> - I was just kinda like,
"Alright, okay, alright." </connor>
<connor> They introduced something like, </connor>
<connor> "He made $2 million off of
his online card business." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What? </connor>
<connor> what is that?" </connor>
<connor> - Never even heard of it </connor>
<connor> - That's hardly a business. </connor>
<connor> Oh, who am I kidding, I'm insulting them. </connor>
<connor> $2 million (laughs), piss off.
- Child's play. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just
think when you, you know, </connor>
<connor> we're talking a lot of businesses here, </connor>
<connor> that's not that much in business terms. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, in the business world, </joey>
<connor> it's not that much, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - In layman's terms, it is. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think that's how the show works </joey>
<joey> is that most people
watching the show in the UK, </joey>
<joey> obviously a million pounds is- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like, whoa, 2 million pounds. </joey>
<joey> That's fucking insane, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Most people can't comprehend that. </joey>
<joey> But, you know, when you work
with some businesses and stuff </joey>
<connor> and you understand the
margins they're working with, </connor>
<connor> that's not that much.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - But I guess it doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> It's TV at the end of the day. </connor>
<connor> They're not actually trying to, like, </connor>
<garnt> it's not actually trying to
give good business advice. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
It's a fucking TV show. </connor>
<connor> - Entertainment, yeah.
- No, if they did, </connor>
<garnt> people would know what their net profit is </garnt>
<connor> and their margins are. </connor>
<connor> - I swear some of the
British ones are staged. </connor>
<connor> - They must be. They must be.
- No way. </connor>
<garnt> Some of the stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's one time they
had a pyramid scheme come on, </garnt>
<garnt> on the British TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a guy that came in </garnt>
<garnt> who just advertised the Ponzi scheme. </garnt>
<garnt> - (chuckles) Did he actually? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and the dragons were like, </connor>
<connor> "This sounds awfully a lot
like a pyramid scheme." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh)
Just type it in. </connor>
<connor> It's called "Pyramid Scheme Dragon's Den." </connor>
<connor> It will come up. </connor>
<connor> It was a good clip. </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Bokksu. </joey>
<garnt> - Hey, guys, come have
a closer look at this. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's up? </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you like some
delicious and tasty snacks </garnt>
<garnt> straight from Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> - Snacks? </garnt>
<garnt> - Straight from Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> Yes, we do.
(Joey gasps) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, Bokksu's got you covered. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god.
- Ah! </garnt>
<garnt> - Bokksu's the monthly snack
box subscription service </garnt>
<garnt> that delivers original assortments </garnt>

<joey> And shipping to the US is the free. </joey>
<connor> - (gasps) This month we're
celebrating the Moon festival. </connor>
<connor> (Joey gasps)
It goes by many names. </connor>
<connor> Mid-Autumn festival, Otsukimi, and Jugoya. </connor>
<garnt> - Nihongo Joseph. </garnt>
<garnt> - All of these indicate the 15th night </garnt>
<garnt> of the eighth lunar moon, </garnt>
<garnt> the night of the Harvest Moon. </garnt>
<connor> - I know that game. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Look at these usagi no shippo, </garnt>
<garnt> green tea buns.
(Joey gasps) </garnt>
<connor> They make my heart go pyong, pyong. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I got these Setouchi lemon mochi. </joey>
<joey> Don't they look so lemony? </joey>
<garnt> - Eh. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm drinking some
Hoshino hojicha latte, </garnt>
<garnt> which is delightful.
(Joey gasps) </garnt>
<garnt> - So use our code TRASHTASTE10 </garnt>
<garnt> and the link in the description </garnt>
<garnt> to get 10% off your Bokksu subscription. </garnt>
<joey> - Thank you to Bokksu for the
sponsor. Back to the show. </joey>
<connor> - You guys play "Pokemon Unite" yet? </connor>
<joey> - No, I haven't. (sighs) </joey>
<connor> - Why not? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I don't give a shit about MOBAs. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, true. </joey>
<garnt> - But you do give a shit about Pokemon. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, But there's a... I
don't know if you've heard, </joey>
<connor> but there's about a hundred
other Pokemon games out there </connor>
<connor> that I could also play. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> But, yeah, I don't know, </joey>
<connor> I saw a piece of news on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how true this
is, but I think it was day two </connor>
<connor> or day three that "Pokemon Unite" came out </connor>
<connor> and the League players were
like, "Oh, oh, what's this?" </connor>
<connor> And then they invaded it </connor>
<joey> and now apparently it's just full of, </joey>
<joey> it's either you're versing
children who are eight years old </joey>
<garnt> or you're versing League players. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "That sounds
like a terrible place." </garnt>
<joey> - That just sounds like League 2.0. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I like you, Pokemon, but no thank you." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the games are either very fun </connor>
<connor> or not fun at all. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - You either get stomped or you don't. </connor>
<garnt> - As a gamer and a mobile player, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you find it? </garnt>
<garnt> - As a toxic gamer, how do you find it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, as a toxic gamer, I enjoyed it. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't like the fact that
I couldn't racially slur </garnt>
<connor> within 10 seconds of getting
in the game, obviously. </connor>
<connor> That was very unfortunate.
- Of course. </connor>
<connor> - There was no chat feature. </connor>
<connor> There's actually voice chat apparently. </connor>
<connor> - Is there? </connor>
<connor> - Apparently. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to hook up the mic </garnt>
<joey> through Nintendo's
bullshit way of doing it. </joey>
<joey> You plug it into your phone.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I saw a voice
chat option on the game. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, no, I have done that </joey>
<joey> through "Animal Crossing" actually. </joey>
<connor> And it does not work. (laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Well, there's a chance that,
if you're a League player, </connor>
<connor> you could say something horrible
to that 10-year-old kid. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- Nah, I'm kidding, obviously. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, yeah, it's fine, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> It's Pokemon, </joey>
<connor> but it definitely feels
like it's been developed </connor>
<connor> not by Nintendo. </connor>
<connor> Like you can- </connor>
<garnt> - So has it been developed by Nintendo? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's by Tencent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Tencent has, I
guess, a monopoly on MOBAs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's weird, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like when you haven't
seen that family member </garnt>
<garnt> in like 10 years </garnt>
<joey> and he comes back and he's really weird, </joey>
<joey> and he's like, "Yeah,
I'm the same guy, right?" </joey>
<connor> You're like, "No. </connor>
<connor> No, what is this? </connor>
<joey> You're not the same person."
- Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, you know, you boot it up, </joey>
<connor> there's Gacha, there's loot boxes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's so weird. </connor>
<joey> - You can buy gems. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh my God, this isn't Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> - Nintendo micro-transactioning? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Nintendo's been
getting real comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> with those micro-transactions lately. </garnt>
<connor> They've been getting real
comfortable with those loot boxes. </connor>
<connor> Alright, okay.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I haven't
played "Pokemon Unite," </garnt>
<garnt> but I've seen clips, looked
into it, and it's so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> Where did this come from? </garnt>
<garnt> Was this announced a while ago? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause the whole idea </garnt>
<joey> of a Pokemon MOBA is just
like, how did this happen? </joey>
<joey> When I think Pokemon, </joey>
<garnt> I don't think "League of
Legends", "Dota," "Pokemon." </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, people
thought that about Pokemon </joey>
<connor> when fucking "Pokken" came out, right? </connor>
<connor> Like people were like, "Wait, what?" </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - "Pokken's" a great game, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Which is a great game now, right? </connor>
<connor> But I remember when it
was first announced, </connor>
<joey> people were like, "This looks horrible. </joey>
<joey> This just doesn't-"
- Really? </joey>
<connor> I thought it looked epic when it came out. </connor>
<joey> - No, I thought it looked epic. </joey>
<joey> But I saw a lot of people were
like, "That doesn't work." </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, there's
just something sad. </connor>
<joey> There's something sad
about seeing a child's game </joey>
<connor> by Nintendo like this that's
just shoved full of these </connor>
<connor> egregious micro-transactions. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, you know, it's whatever. </joey>
<joey> You can have a differing opinion on it. </joey>
<connor> I wouldn't give a shit, I don't mind. </connor>
<joey> - So did you fall for the Gacha yet? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Tectone. </connor>
<connor> I played with a friend of ours </connor>
<connor> and he was like-
- Oh, Lord. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - And he is Gacha whale,
that is pretty much his job. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's more like a leviathan, isn't he? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, within five minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> he was like, "Spend a hundred bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> Just spend a hundred bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> Just get everything. </garnt>
<garnt> Just unlock everything." </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, "No, I'm not gonna do that." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "I'll
give you a hundred bucks </connor>
<connor> to spend on it right now."
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<joey> - This man, when it comes to Gacha, </joey>
<joey> this man loses all sense of money. </joey>
<connor> - He has no way of holding back, </connor>
<connor> but I respect it, you know, it's his job. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I just didn't want it
'cause I could tell that... </garnt>
<garnt> I ended up spending 40 bucks on it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "I'm not
gonna play this again, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm gonna do it so I can play ranked." </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it free to play? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - That doesn't excuse it, Garnt. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) No, I was just asking. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just asking. </garnt>
<garnt> You said you spent 40
bucks, which is like- </garnt>
<joey> - Free to play is the
road to losing. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - There is items you can buy </joey>
<garnt> that'll boost your stats
in-game so you can actually- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's kind of like the way- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it pay-to-win? </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> The way it was explained to me </garnt>
<garnt> and the way I understand it, is that, </garnt>
<garnt> you know how "League of Legends" </garnt>
<garnt> used to have a thing called
runes that weren't pay-to-win, </garnt>
<garnt> they would give you an edge, </garnt>
<garnt> but you could unlock
them through the game, </garnt>
<garnt> but they give you a noticeable
advantage, I'd say, at times. </garnt>
<garnt> Like back in the day, 'cause
you had to buy runes, remember? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you have described
runes as pay-to-win back then? </garnt>
<connor> It's kind of like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> with the advantages the
runes gave back in the day, </garnt>
<connor> you wouldn't be able to take advantage </connor>
<connor> of that small stat increase </connor>
<garnt> unless you're at the fucking higher tiers </garnt>
<garnt> where its truly optimized it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's kind of like that. </garnt>
<garnt> The game's just came out </garnt>
<garnt> and no one's really had the time to grind </garnt>
<garnt> to get the stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> so if you do just buy it,
you do get an advantage. </garnt>
<connor> It's not massive, but
you do get an advantage. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how big it is. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, from what I
understand, it's not that much. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, obviously any advantages </garnt>
<connor> should be a big no-no
in video games, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Especially a children's game as well. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) It's like that.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> You know, what's next? </garnt>
<joey> Fucking "Tetris" with the
micro-transactions in it? </joey>
<joey> Like what are we doing? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, you know,
technically speaking, </joey>
<joey> that's not the first Pokemon game </joey>
<joey> with micro-transactions, right? </joey>
<joey> Remember "Pokemon Go" back in the day? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and even then, </connor>
<connor> I felt like that was
like, it's weird, man. </connor>
<connor> It's just strange. </connor>
<connor> I feel like Nintendo, they're like, </connor>
<joey> "Well, if another company
develops it, it's not us." </joey>
<joey> - That is true, that is true. </joey>
<joey> "Pokemon Go" was also not them. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then Nintendo also does
weird other micro-transactions </joey>
<joey> or brand partnerships, </joey>
<joey> like they have fucking
Mercedes in "Mario Kart 8." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What the hell is with Mercedes? </connor>
<joey> - I remember that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Like what was going on with that? </connor>
<joey> What?
- I thought it was like a joke </joey>
<joey> that someone at the dev team threw in, </joey>
<joey> then I realized, oh no,
it's an actual brand, like. </joey>
<joey> - How did this happen? </joey>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<joey> It actually baffles me. </joey>
<joey> I mean, whatever, I don't give a shit. </joey>
<connor> - I pick it every time I play "Mario Kart" </connor>
<connor> just 'cause it's hilarious-
- Yeah, it looks so stupid. </connor>
<connor> - To see fucking baby Mario in a Mercedes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just a full
Mercedes, that's so absurd. </connor>
<garnt> - I never played "Mario Kart 8" </garnt>
<garnt> so this is the first
time I'm hearing of this. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a dead-ass Mercedes </garnt>
<connor> with the logo and everything.
- Was it just a Mercedes? </connor>
<joey> - It's the car, just a Mercedes car, </joey>
<connor> it's like three Mercedes cars. </connor>
<joey> - And it's just hilarious
to see baby Mario- </joey>
<garnt> - How did that happen?
- I don't know, it's bizarre. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's just in the game?
- In the game. </connor>
<garnt> - Always? Since release?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not even like an unlockable, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just there by default.
- What? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can just pick a
Mercedes if you want. </garnt>
<garnt> - What?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] You didn't know this? </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you guys were meme-ing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's legit.
- No, no, no, </garnt>
<joey> it's a straight up Mercedes. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<garnt> - When you select the cars, </garnt>
<joey> it literally says Mercedes.
- You can even see the logo. </joey>
<garnt> - Where does this fit in
the fucking Mario law? </garnt>
<garnt> How did this happen? </garnt>
<joey> - You know, Mario was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm sick of going
through all these levels. </joey>
<connor> Let me just hop in my Mercedes." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
- It is bizarre. </connor>
<joey> - Running over all the enemies. </joey>
<connor> - You know, at least EA you
know what you're getting into. </connor>
<connor> You know, I mean, with Nintendo, </connor>
<connor> I can't figure out what the
fuck they're trying to do. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what they're doing. </connor>
<joey> - Everything. They're trying
to do everything, man. </joey>
<connor> - It's just bizarre. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I get it, whatever. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, good on them, I guess, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, whatever, go get that grind. </connor>
<joey> - Get that coin, man. </joey>
<joey> - I just think unfortunately </joey>
<garnt> micro-transactions is just
kind of creeping its way </garnt>
<garnt> into the future of gaming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which is sad </garnt>
<joey> 'cause Nintendo obviously
was the one company </joey>
<joey> that for a long time was like, "No." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But then now they're
like, "Yes, yes, yes." </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause Genshin's come along </connor>
<connor> and just proved how much
fucking money there is </connor>
<connor> to spend on anime waifu's apparently. </connor>
<joey> It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember I
watched the live stream </joey>
<connor> of the new Genshin announcement
for the 2.0, Inazuma, </connor>
<connor> where they announced the new area. </connor>
<joey> And I think it was getting almost- </joey>
<joey> - It was 400,000 people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 400,000 people.
- Fuck me, wow. </joey>
<joey> - On Twitch.
- On Twitch, not YouTube. </joey>
<joey> Twitch, live, concurrent.
- That's kinda crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Which is like, </joey>
<joey> how much does press conferences on EA </joey>
<joey> or press conferences on E3 and stuff get? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, not that much.
- It's not that much. </joey>
<joey> - 100K max. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like 100K, 200K maybe. </joey>
<joey> A Genshin update stream
was getting 400K viewers </joey>
<joey> concurrent on Twitch. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> - Which, mind you, </garnt>
<joey> a lot of the stuff that they announced </joey>
<joey> had already been leaked as well. </joey>
<connor> So it's like people are tuning
into at league shipping, </connor>
<joey> like it's confirmed, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure if I was a fan
I'd get behind the hype. </connor>
<joey> I'd be very happy for it, but
I don't really play it, so. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, obviously it
did very well for them, right? </joey>
<connor> But, yeah, it just blew me away </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, "Oh, there's
a Genshin stream happening </connor>
<joey> with 400,000 people </joey>
<joey> just sitting there waiting
for a fucking update?" </joey>
<joey> Like, are you serious? </joey>
<connor> - And now more Gacha. </connor>
<connor> Whoa, yes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, more waifus. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like I haven't
gotten back into Genshin, </garnt>
<garnt> I've been thinking about
it 'cause of the new area, </garnt>
<joey> but, you know.
- Don't do it, man. </joey>
<joey> - Out of the three of us, </joey>
<joey> the person who was most into
Genshin was probably me. </joey>
<garnt> And you acknowledge
this is a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> watching an anime waifu game right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Could you imagine if
"Fate/Grand Order" had an update </joey>
<joey> and those 400,000 people were watching it? </joey>
<joey> - Don't do that to me. </joey>
<garnt> Don't give me hope. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Is Genshin is it, sorry, </garnt>
<connor> is it majoritively played on mobile or PC? </connor>
<connor> - I'm assuming PC. </connor>
<connor> Actually, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Honestly, this is a complete assumption. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we don't know, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Of half the people I
know that play Genshin, </joey>
<connor> half of them play on mobile.
- Seriously? </connor>
<joey> - Like all of my Japanese
friends who play Genshin </joey>
<joey> play on mobile. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, god. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought it would be
more majoritively PC. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean you'd think so, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because I did not have a fun time </joey>
<garnt> playing Genshin on mobile at all. </garnt>
<joey> - I think some people
just play it on both. </joey>
<garnt> Like when they're home,
they'll play it on PC, </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes, you know, </garnt>
<joey> they gotta get on that
grind while on the go, </joey>
<joey> they gotta play on mobile. </joey>
<garnt> - One of the biggest
advantages that Genshin has </garnt>
<connor> over a lot of AAA games, </connor>
<connor> which is the fact that it's
so fucking easy to play. </connor>
<connor> You know, like every account is linked, </connor>
<joey> and now you can even link your PS4 account </joey>
<connor> to every other account, </connor>
<joey> so it just makes it
ridiculously easy to play. </joey>
<connor> - Is it on the Switch as well?
- Not yet, no. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like we're
reading an ad-read. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) It does, doesn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it on the Switch? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and apparently
there's a lot more characters. </connor>
<joey> - Did you know there's a
new area you can go to? </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - This is the problem when I'm a fan, </connor>
<connor> I have a lot of the things
I also end up promoting, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately.
- Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - I've fully disconnected
myself from gaming hype. </connor>
<connor> I don't get hyped about games anymore. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, me neither. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if that
means no happiness for me, </connor>
<connor> but I've just stopped getting hyped </connor>
<connor> and I've stopped watching
announcements for video games. </connor>
<joey> - I think I've just stopped </joey>
<connor> getting hyped about things
in general 'cause I've just- </connor>
<connor> - That's kind of sad.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It is kind of sad.
- It's called pessimism. </joey>
<joey> - Because I've ran into so many situations </joey>
<joey> where I just get hyped </joey>
<connor> and I either experience hype fatigue or- </connor>
<connor> - Fatigue. (laughs)
- Fatigue. </connor>
<garnt> - Fatigue.
- Fatigue. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fatigue.
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Fatigue.
- It's fatigue, okay. </garnt>
<connor> So I either experience hype fatigue, </connor>
<connor> or I just end up getting disappointed </connor>
<garnt> with the final result, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Oh,
well then, what the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> You know, give me back my hype, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So now I'm- </garnt>
<garnt> - Give me back my hype.
- Give me back my hype. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I want a refund,
I want a refund. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Refund all my hype, please. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm still waiting for my
"Cyberpunk" hype refund. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm firmly of the mindset </connor>
<connor> you should never pre-order a game ever. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - Never.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - No matter how good or
100% it looks amazing </connor>
<connor> or the bonus deals, don't do it. </connor>
<connor> It's a bad practice and I
think it's bad for gaming. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<garnt> - It is.
- Here we go, here we go. </garnt>
<connor> - It's bad for gaming, man. </connor>
<connor> It sucks. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, 'cause I'm not into gaming </connor>
<connor> as much as I used to be, </connor>
<connor> and even back then, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've ever pre-ordered a game </connor>
<connor> or at least like, </connor>
<connor> I think the only game I ever
tried pre-ordering was GTA. </connor>
<connor> But that was just because it was GTA. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also do you remember? </garnt>
<joey> Picture it, year 2013, </joey>
<joey> everything is a pre-order bonus. </joey>
<joey> Literally everything is pre-order. </joey>
<joey> Like everyone is pre-ordering everything. </joey>
<connor> That's just how it is. </connor>
<connor> You pre-order fucking everything. </connor>
<connor> Luckily now everyone's chilled out, </connor>
<garnt> but it was insane back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I also think, kind of back then, </garnt>
<garnt> it made more sense, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because back then, </garnt>
<garnt> the game you're buying on the day </garnt>
<garnt> was the game you were getting, right? </garnt>
<garnt> There was no updates,
no patches, no nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - And it also made more sense 'cause </connor>
<connor> I think it really hit
its peak right before, </connor>
<joey> maybe just during online
shopping started popping up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, and this was before, </garnt>
<garnt> when you didn't really wanna download it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause people's internet speeds
really weren't good enough </garnt>
<connor> to really download a full 20 gigabyte game </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<joey> But now, you know,
people's internet speeds, </joey>
<connor> it's not really a problem. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and also back then, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like you just had a lot less choice </connor>
<connor> of what games you could play, you know. </connor>
<connor> As a kid, I'm just like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I waited for fucking five
months for the new Mario game </connor>
<connor> 'cause there was nothing
else to look forward to. </connor>
<joey> There's literally nothing
to fill that void. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't get a free to play
game like Genshin. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Free to play game, that's just- </joey>
<joey> - It's free to play? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Like "Fortnite" or "League of Legends" </joey>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<garnt> There was nothing to fill up that void. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the only games
that I've pre-ordered </joey>
<joey> are the ones that I know
100% I'm going to love. </joey>
<connor> - I've ordered every single
Mario release of late </connor>
<connor> and I haven't played any of them. </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that sounds like
your problem too. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> They brainwashed me. </joey>
<joey> - I think the last game I pre-ordered </joey>
<joey> was "Final Fantasy VII R" </joey>
<joey> but I 100-percented that 'cause
I knew I was gonna like it </joey>
<joey> 'cause I liked the original. </joey>
<joey> And "Persona 5 Royal" as
well, I pre-ordered that </joey>
<joey> because I liked "Persona 5." </joey>
<garnt> - I have so many fucking
games that I've bought </garnt>
<joey> in my library that I just haven't- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, same.
- I've downloaded them, </joey>
<joey> I've installed them, </joey>
<garnt> and I just never opened them. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I've never opened them. </garnt>
<connor> - When was the last time you
got really hyped for a game? </connor>
<connor> - "Final Fantasy VII R" probably. </connor>
<connor> - Did it live up to your hype? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I 100-percented it. </joey>
<connor> It was fantastic.
- What about you, Garnt? </connor>
<joey> When was the last time
you pre-ordered a game </joey>
<connor> and got very excited about it? </connor>
<connor> - I haven't pre-ordered... </connor>
<garnt> Like the last time I got
hyped for a game, "Cyberpunk." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not joking. </garnt>
<joey> That was the last time
I got hyped for a game. </joey>
<connor> - And everybody laughed.
(Connor laughing) </connor>
<joey> Everybody laughed.
- That's a good one. </joey>
<connor> - And you know why I still
haven't even played it. </connor>
<garnt> - I beat sci-fi, I don't give a shit. </garnt>
<connor> It's a fucking terrible game, oh my god. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because I was just like,
"Great, it's a sci-fi game, </garnt>
<garnt> it's 'Cyberpunk.' </garnt>
<garnt> this looks like everything
I've ever wanted </garnt>
<joey> to fill up that void </joey>
<joey> that 'Mass Effect' has
just left me for years." </joey>
<joey> - And now that hole is
even deeper. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - And now the hole is even fucking deeper. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a shame </garnt>
<connor> you couldn't pre-order therapy
with it as well. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Comes with a free psychiatrist. </joey>
<connor> - No, I'm like, every few months, </connor>
<garnt> I just Google, "Is
Cyberpunk 2077 playable?" </garnt>
<connor> - I saw a good article. </connor>
<connor> It was like, </connor>
<connor> "'Cyberpunk' is nowhere near
a 'No Man's Sky' turnaround." </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) Oh, brutal. </connor>
<connor> - The devs are like, "We're
nowhere near fixing it." </connor>
<connor> Like "No Man's Sky" did
something like that, </connor>
<connor> according to something like that. </connor>
<connor> And they had to say a "No
Man's Sky" turnaround. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, of course.
- Oh. </joey>
<joey> - I mean that is like, </joey>
<joey> "No Man's Sky" is the
fucking anime redemption </joey>
<joey> of the gaming industry. </joey>
<garnt> I think it's one of the only redemption- </garnt>
<joey> - That's when the antagonists
turned into the protagonists. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Because most companies,
you just cut your losses </connor>
<joey> and you're like, "Fuck it, make
the next fucking 'Fallout.'" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck 76, make a new one.
You know, that's how it is. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, when was the
last time you got hyped? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, as the gamer? </joey>
<garnt> - (sighs) "Borderlands 3." </garnt>
<garnt> I was very hyped for "Borderlands 3." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- Was it good? </garnt>
<garnt> - Uh, no.
- Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was extremely hyped
for "Borderlands 3." </garnt>
<connor> "Borderlands 2" is one
of my favorite games. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt sighs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was gonna ask. </joey>
<connor> I've never played 3, but I've played 2, </connor>
<connor> and 2 was great.
- Have you played 2? </connor>
<garnt> - I haven't played "Borderlands 2." </garnt>
<connor> - What was the sigh there, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> That was a dramatic sigh. </connor>
<garnt> - I just realized what the game </garnt>
<connor> before "Cyberpunk 2077-"
- Okay, we'll get into it. </connor>
<garnt> - What the last game I
was hyped before that. </garnt>
<connor> - "Borderlands 2," right? </connor>
<connor> I loved "Borderlands." </connor>
<connor> So I bought "Borderlands
1" originally on Xbox 360, </connor>
<connor> and I thought it was shit. </connor>
<connor> I hated it 'cause I didn't
have friends to play with. </connor>
<garnt> So it was a terrible game to play alone. </garnt>
<joey> But when I finally went
back to it, months later, </joey>
<connor> my friends bought 'cause it
went on more sale, cheap as art, </connor>
<connor> and, yeah, I loved it. </connor>
<connor> I thought, "Wow, okay,
this game is actually sick </connor>
<connor> when you play it with friends." </connor>
<connor> Then "Borderlands 2" came out </connor>
<connor> and it looked like they
just improved everything. </connor>
<connor> And they did. </connor>
<connor> And it was amazing. </connor>
<connor> "Borderlands 2" is such a good game </connor>
<connor> and playing it with friends is amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like this game is so much
replay value with friends. </connor>
<connor> And I absolutely had some
of the best gaming memories </connor>
<connor> playing "Borderlands 2." </connor>
<connor> So naturally, </connor>
<connor> "Borderlands 3" was coming out </connor>
<connor> and I had a monster
gaming PC, I was ready. </connor>
<connor> All my friends were getting it. </connor>
<connor> There was endless people
I could play with. </connor>
<connor> It was gonna be good. </connor>
<connor> So I play it and, yeah, </connor>
<connor> it's just kind of like "Borderlands 2" </connor>
<joey> but with a worse story. </joey>
<joey> Like the stuff they add isn't very good. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, since when have you
fucking cared about story? </joey>
<joey> - Well, "Borderlands 2"
actually was such like... </joey>
<joey> Handsome Jack is such an engaging villain. </joey>
<joey> But even when you don't
care about the story, </joey>
<joey> he's there, always making you laugh. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- And that was something that, </joey>
<connor> even if I didn't care what was happening, </connor>
<connor> I knew that I liked Handsome Jack </connor>
<connor> and that he was funny as fuck. </connor>
<connor> But I loved having that. </connor>
<connor> And the two main villains </connor>
<connor> were YouTubers or Twitch
streamers in the third one. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- It was just cringe </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm a YouTuber and Twitch streamer, </joey>
<joey> so it was cringe watching them like- </joey>
<garnt> - I am the bad guy. (laughs)
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was just like poking
fun at me in the worst way. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right, right. </garnt>
<connor> - And I was like, "This isn't this funny." </connor>
<connor> - This isn't the
representation I asked for. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) This is slander.
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm all down </garnt>
<garnt> for when people make fun of
YouTubers and Twitch streamers. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm all down for it. </garnt>
<connor> But sometimes they do it in a way where- </connor>
<connor> - Distasteful way, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In a way where you've
clearly never watched something </connor>
<connor> because there are so many other things </connor>
<connor> you could have gone for. </connor>
<connor> You know, they do the whole thing </connor>
<connor> of like, "Oh, hi, guys," whatever, </connor>
<joey> and they could have gone for like, </joey>
<joey> "Why don't you thank me
for the $10 donation?" </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> That would've been funny as fuck. </joey>
<joey> You know, like Bo Burnham
did a great parody of it. </joey>
<connor> I mean, Bo Burnham used to
be a YouTuber, so obviously. </connor>
<connor> He did a great parody of
Twitch streamers and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and that was great, </connor>
<connor> but I felt like it was a terrible parody </connor>
<connor> and it was also, they
were just so unlikable </connor>
<connor> and there's so many bugs in it as well. </connor>
<joey> Like there's so many game-breaking bugs </joey>
<joey> that just happened throughout. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "This
shouldn't be happening. </joey>
<joey> I waited years for this. </joey>
<joey> I got hyped for this. </joey>
<joey> I felt invested in this." </joey>
<joey> - Give my hype back. </joey>
<joey> - Also I didn't really
like any of the characters </joey>
<joey> that you could play as. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Which kind of sucked. </connor>
<connor> "Borderlands 2," I felt
like every single character </connor>
<connor> was like Pog.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's how I got burnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - The game I got hyped for
before "Cyberpunk" was... </garnt>
<garnt> This just shows my track record </garnt>
<garnt> and why I don't get
hyped for games anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> It was "Mass Effect: Andromeda." </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were
about to say "Fallout 76." </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I thought you were
gonna say "No Man's Sky." </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's like, "'No
Man's Sky,' 'Fallout 76,' </connor>
<connor> 'Mass Effect: Andromeda.'"
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I love Dunkey's video. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never played "Mass Effect." </garnt>
<garnt> I've just watched Dunkey's videos on them. </garnt>
<connor> And his video on "Andromeda" is so funny. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've played like an hour </connor>
<joey> of "Mass Effect: Andromeda" </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "This
just isn't doing it for me." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - By that point, </joey>
<joey> I think "Cyberpunk" was just a, yeah, </joey>
<garnt> this looks like a game
that could appeal to me, </garnt>
<connor> but I think "Mass Effect" </connor>
<garnt> was really what just killed my soul </garnt>
<connor> inside of me. (chuckles)
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - There's something so
heartbreaking about it </connor>
<connor> in a way that I've never experienced, </connor>
<connor> where the game just
lets you down like that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like your dad just
never came home, you know? </joey>
<connor> Like it's like, damn. </connor>
<joey> - But it's like, it feels
like your dad came home, </joey>
<joey> but with a different woman.
(everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - A new son.
(everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is you now, alright? </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's the first time </connor>
<joey> you get to really experience
betrayal as a young adult. </joey>
<joey> A true betrayal.
(Garnt giggling) </joey>
<joey> - I trusted you. I followed
you all the way through, </joey>
<joey> and this is how you repay me? </joey>
<joey> - I stuck with you for years. </joey>
<joey> I had memories with you that I can't, </joey>
<joey> I've never even had with anyone else, </joey>
<joey> and this is how you repay me? </joey>
<joey> It's gone like that.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, </joey>
<joey> now I just try to keep as little knowledge </joey>
<connor> of the gaming industry and
what's coming out as possible </connor>
<connor> because I've kind of realized </connor>
<connor> my favorite gaming experiences recently </connor>
<connor> have just been games
that I had no idea about </connor>
<connor> until they were out. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know anything
about "Breath of the Wild" </connor>
<connor> and it blew me away.
- Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, didn't know anything
about "Breath of the Wild." </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, it's been fucking, </connor>
<joey> I hadn't played Zelda since "Wind Waker" </joey>
<connor> and it was fucking amazing.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> "Horizon Zero Dawn"? </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What kind of game franchise is this?" </connor>
<joey> I had no idea what it was about. </joey>
<garnt> It was fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I'm not hyping myself up </garnt>
<garnt> for "Breath of the Wild 2," right? </garnt>
<joey> Because I don't want a
fucking "Andromeda" to happen. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Like God forbid it ever happens, </joey>
<joey> but you never know, right? </joey>
<joey> So I'm just gonna wait. </joey>
<connor> I'm just gonna wait. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and also like, </connor>
<garnt> obviously everyone's streaming a lot now. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, when E3 happens or
a Nintendo press conference, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's like, "Oh, did you watch it? </garnt>
<connor> Did you watch the E3 conference?" </connor>
<connor> Why would I watch an hour of ads? </connor>
<connor> Why?
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> What, so I can get excited </connor>
<connor> and give my money to a company
that's gonna let me down? </connor>
<joey> No. No, thank you. </joey>
<joey> When the game comes out and I
hear it's good, I'll buy it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, why would I sit down
and watch an hour conference </joey>
<garnt> of getting myself hyped for something </garnt>
<garnt> that I probably won't be hyped about? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I think it's pretty fun. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not even invested in it.
- Sometimes it's fun. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, sometimes when... </joey>
<joey> Like I still remember </joey>
<joey> when "Final Fantasy VII
Remake" was announced </joey>
<garnt> and just the reaction around that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I don't give
a shit about "Final Fantasy," </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm fucking hyped. </garnt>
<connor> - Never mind me who never
played "Final Fantasy." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What's going on? </connor>
<joey> What's going on?"
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile, I was the one
going, "Yeah," in the crowd. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then they get announced </garnt>
<garnt> "Shenmue III" afterwards.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "What kind of a press conference is this?" </connor>
<connor> Like, I think I was more
hyped about press conference </connor>
<garnt> than the actual games themselves. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, "Shenmue III," </connor>
<garnt> that turned out to be a great game, huh. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel like it's a fun little event, </garnt>
<connor> you know, if you take part of it. </connor>
<garnt> I just feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't wanna get hyped. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the Nintendo Directs, right? </joey>
<joey> That's like another one </joey>
<joey> where it's just like, "Did you watch it? </joey>
<joey> Did you watch the Nintendo Direct?" </joey>
<connor> - There's something about Nintendo Directs </connor>
<connor> that really pissed me off. </connor>
<connor> I can't put my finger on it. </connor>
<connor> I get angry watching Nintendo Direct. </connor>
<connor> - (chuckles) Why?
- I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I think it's the way they present games </connor>
<connor> that clearly no one gives a shit about. </connor>
<connor> They'll be like, "And
now is 'Just Dance 17.'" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
And it's like, why? </connor>
<connor> - But they always have to sandwich it </connor>
<connor> between two big titles, right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is fair enough, right?
- I understand. </connor>
<connor> - They clearly know, </connor>
<joey> but it's also just like, I don't
care about "Just Dance 76." </joey>
<connor> - Well, sometimes they
do ad spots, I think, </connor>
<connor> for other companies to, </connor>
<connor> where they give, I think it's an ad spot. </connor>
<connor> I think they do this. </connor>
<connor> And that they'll show
a game that looks awful </connor>
<joey> for like 30 minutes and
they'll do a play-through. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Stop this,
stop this right now. </joey>
<joey> Show me an ad. Show me
an ad over this, please. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs)
Anything else other than this. </joey>
<connor> I can't stand this. </connor>
<connor> - Show me a Bud Light ad. </connor>
<connor> - I'll take it.
- I'll take a Bud Light ad. </connor>
<connor> - Give me a "Fallout
76" demo or something. </connor>
<connor> God damn it, please, I'm
begging for something else. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I think I'm just getting
to that point in my life </connor>
<connor> where I'm becoming extremely
bitter about everything </connor>
<connor> that makes other people happy. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) Welcome to adulting. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I'm getting to that point. </joey>
<joey> - It's called being adulting </joey>
<joey> and it's called being British as well. </joey>
<connor> It's like the worst combination. </connor>
<connor> - An old angry bastard is all you become. </connor>
<connor> - I think I sit there on my
porch, just rocking my chair, </connor>
<garnt> thinking, "Oh, you young kids
getting excited over games, </garnt>
<garnt> how naive of you." </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine being happy. </garnt>
<connor> Imagine being excited.
- How naive of you. </connor>
<garnt> - If only I could feel
these emotions anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you think "Mario
Golf" is gonna be fun? </garnt>
<connor> Really? </connor>
<connor> Have fun playing "Mario Golf." </connor>
<connor> One time at a party and they're
never playing it ever again. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> "Mario Tennis," you thought that was fun? </connor>
<connor> I never felt angrier than
when I bought "Mario Tennis," </connor>
<joey> the new "Mario Tennis."
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fucking terrible game. </joey>
<joey> Have you played it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I like it. </joey>
<connor> - It's terrible, it's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - Why?
- Well, why is it terrible? </connor>
<connor> - Wait, have you played
the original though? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's probably why. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> I have to have prerequisite
knowledge of another game? </connor>
<joey> - Well, compared to the
original, it's much better. </joey>
<garnt> - I loved the original.
- I like the original too, </garnt>
<joey> but I think the new one
just improved on it. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I loved the
original 'cause I was a kid </garnt>
<garnt> and I had zero taste in video games. </garnt>
<connor> Everything was fine.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm sure I pissed off a lot. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sorry I don't have
taste in video games, wow. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure I pissed people
off saying it's terrible. </connor>
<connor> I played it </connor>
<connor> and I was so bored out of
my mind playing this game. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, </joey>
<joey> clearly it's just not a
game made for you, right? </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> Why is it not? </connor>
<connor> I would have loved this. </connor>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<connor> What's going on? Why do I hate this game? </connor>
<connor> - You sound like the same crowd of people- </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's not toxic enough for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - You sound like the same crowd
of people who are pissed off </garnt>
<connor> when Nintendo released the Nintendo 2DS, </connor>
<connor> which was intended for
like, five-year-olds. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </connor>
<joey> How dare Nintendo not release
a console made for me? </joey>
<joey> - I like the 2DS. </joey>
<connor> I thought it was affordable and, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I liked the ergonomics of it. </connor>
<connor> It looked cool. </connor>
<joey> - It looked like a fucking Fisher Price, </joey>
<joey> fucking like children's toy.
- Yeah, I liked it. </joey>
<joey> - And adults are like,
"What the fuck, Nintendo? </joey>
<joey> How dare you not make? </joey>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<joey> I'm not gonna buy this."
- How dare you make a toy? </joey>
<garnt> What are you, a toy company? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not one of those people
who gets angry at Nintendo </garnt>
<joey> for not making adult-oriented products, </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's not what they do. </joey>
<joey> But, you know, for stuff like Pokemon, </joey>
<joey> I wish that they would
put a difficulty option </joey>
<garnt> or something where you could
add something, like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish they would include something. </garnt>
<garnt> - The toxic gamer is coming out right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it insane of me to ask Pokemon </connor>
<connor> to include something that
makes it more difficult? </connor>
<joey> - Are you talking about "Pokemon Unite"? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Or just Pokemon in general?
- The normal Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> - Well, the great thing about Pokemon </connor>
<connor> is that you can make it as
difficult as you fucking want. </connor>
<connor> That's the beauty of the game.
- Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<joey> - That's why Nuzlockes are a thing. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I know, </joey>
<joey> but I wish there was a way
the in-game was baked into it </joey>
<connor> that allows you to make it more difficult </connor>
<connor> or to do certain things. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why- </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't think that's-
- I disagree with that. </connor>
<connor> - I disagree, </connor>
<garnt> because I think purposely
leaving it open-ended </garnt>
<connor> to how difficult you want it </connor>
<connor> is what makes that game
so appealing to people. </connor>
<garnt> If you put a difficulty... </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you went into a Pokemon game </garnt>
<joey> and you were like,
"Choose the difficulty," </joey>
<joey> immediately people will be like, "Oh." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, actually, in
regards to difficulty, </garnt>
<connor> I fucking hate choosing difficulty. </connor>
<connor> I hate it so much.
- I do hate it too. </connor>
<garnt> - I hate it as well.
- It depends on the game. </garnt>
<garnt> It depends on the game, </garnt>
<connor> because on some games, </connor>
<connor> it's completely stupid
and unnecessary, right? </connor>
<connor> Like first person shooters, </connor>
<connor> I hate it because it just
makes them more bullock-spongy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's all it does. But
on some games like Pokemon </joey>
<joey> where it's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> even a 12-year-old would
probably find this too easy, </joey>
<joey> like especially the new one. </joey>
<joey> The new one was like mind- </joey>
<joey> - Well, the new one's hold
your hand, that's why. </joey>
<joey> - It was beyond mind... </joey>
<connor> Like even like, you know,
you play "Platinum"- </connor>
<garnt> - That's a problem with
the game itself, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's just not difficult enough. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like even adding
10% more difficulty to this </connor>
<garnt> is like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like with "Pokemon Platinum," </garnt>
<joey> I was playing that, I did a Nuzlocke, </joey>
<joey> but even the core game itself </joey>
<joey> was actually kind of challenging. </joey>
<connor> You can't just fall asleep
and just spam one Pokemon. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I feel that's the
problem with just Pokemon games </joey>
<connor> in general where like... </connor>
<connor> Like I played "Sun and Moon." </connor>
<connor> That shit holds your hand the entire way, </connor>
<connor> even as an adult.
- It's so insulting. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, dude, </connor>
<connor> like ten-year-old me was crying, </connor>
<joey> trying to get past the
June 3 of silver, right? </joey>
<joey> And the game didn't give a fuck. </joey>
<connor> It was just like, "Just get good." </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Figure it out, you're 10. </connor>
<garnt> You should start thinking, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> Use that fucking 10-year-old
thick skull of yours." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- I feel like nowadays, </connor>
<joey> people have less patience </joey>
<joey> when it comes to completing games, man. </joey>
<connor> There's no way-
- But, oh, come on. </connor>
<joey> Making a Pokemon gym slightly harder </joey>
<joey> is hardly asking for like... </joey>
<joey> We're not adding in "Dark
Souls" level of difficulty </joey>
<joey> to a children's game. </joey>
<joey> You should in a Pokemon game, </joey>
<joey> I think even if you're like 10 years old, </joey>
<joey> you should fail the first gym probably </joey>
<joey> and be forced to be like, "Maybe
I should buy some potions. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I should consider doing something. </joey>
<connor> Not just fucking steamrolling this shit </connor>
<connor> with my Mudkip every time." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just give it good game design </joey>
<joey> so that you don't have to say anything </joey>
<joey> to get the player to figure it out, right? </joey>
<connor> - Even when I was a much younger kid, </connor>
<connor> you know, when I was 10,
whatever, playing these games, </connor>
<connor> I hated it when games were
completely steamrolling, </connor>
<connor> like you could just do
it without thinking. </connor>
<connor> It's like, having some form
of difficulty there is good. </connor>
<connor> And it's also important, I
think, for the kid to learn </connor>
<joey> that not everything is
gonna be fucking easy. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> Like I remember when I was
fucking eight years old </joey>
<garnt> playing "Mega Man 2" for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "This
is fucking impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> No one can beat this game." </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I fucking love that game though. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one of my favorite
games of all time </garnt>
<joey> because I learned success through failure. </joey>
<garnt> - Kids have it too easy nowadays, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - The problem is, right, </garnt>
<garnt> is that, as an adult, </garnt>
<connor> I have absolutely zero patience </connor>
<connor> for games that are bullshit hard. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Kids do not. </connor>
<joey> Kids will play the bullshit hard game </joey>
<joey> over and over and over again </joey>
<joey> because it's, one, </joey>
<garnt> it's probably the only
game they're getting, </garnt>
<garnt> and also they love it.
- But it's not anymore. </garnt>
<connor> It's not. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem, it's not anymore. </connor>
<connor> - That's the point I'm trying to make. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean, if you're
mobile gaming, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I feel like there's just, </connor>
<connor> games are a lot more affordable nowadays. </connor>
<connor> Back then, you had one game
every few months maybe. </connor>
<connor> - But there's still, </connor>
<connor> if they're getting like
an Xbox or something, </connor>
<connor> okay, yeah, they can play
"Fortnite" for free on it. </connor>
<connor> But if they wanna buy another
game and it's difficult, </connor>
<connor> they're probably gonna try and complete it </connor>
<connor> 'cause they bought the game or
they wanted it for Christmas </connor>
<garnt> or something.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Adults try to understand kids. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm just thinking
from my perspective. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. I mean, most
of them are just happy </garnt>
<joey> with "Fortnite" and stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I mean, you know. </connor>
<connor> - I think the other thing as well </connor>
<connor> is that at least with the
old games is that, you know, </connor>
<connor> because they could only be so long, </connor>
<connor> that they literally had
to be like, alright, </connor>
<connor> this game, if you blast through it, </connor>
<joey> you can probably complete
it in less than an hour. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But like, we want you to
play this game for a long time </joey>
<joey> so we're just gonna make it bullshit hard </joey>
<joey> to the point where 40 minutes of gameplay </joey>
<joey> is gonna take you about 40 days. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, there are a lot of bullshit moments </garnt>
<joey> in a lot of older games.
- Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember thinking back </joey>
<connor> and I'm thinking, "How the fuck did I play </connor>
<connor> so many levels of 'Battletoad' </connor>
<connor> and 'Contra'-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Did you actually play "Battletoad"? </connor>
<garnt> - I did play "Battletoad."
- Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually a really
fucking good game. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, it's a good game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's fucking great game. </connor>
<joey> - It's the shit. </joey>
<joey> - Like to this day, </joey>
<connor> I remember playing the
fucking motorbike, like the- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, the hoverboard.
- Yeah, the hoverboard level. </connor>
<connor> - That's a notorious level,
it's fucking impossible. </connor>
<joey> - I think I played it for
a full week, in my room, </joey>
<garnt> trying to complete that fucking level. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I remember </joey>
<joey> beating "Mega Man 2"
lots of times as a kid. </joey>
<connor> And then I recently played
it a couple of years ago, </connor>
<connor> I could barely get past fucking Woodman. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "How the fuck did
I do this as a 10-year-old?" </connor>
<joey> Oh, it's because I literally
spent like a month of my life </joey>
<joey> just grinding this game. </joey>
<garnt> - Also I can't play "Mega Man" at my age. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna get fucking carpal tunnel. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> I tried playing "Mega Man X," </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Oh, I'm
getting a fucking cramp here </connor>
<connor> from just doing the wall jump." </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> My God. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's great though, I love it. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess I'm angry that I'm getting older </joey>
<joey> and these children games
aren't getting older with me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I guess so. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, like with difficulty, </joey>
<joey> I now like when a game has
just one set difficulty, </joey>
<joey> even if it's easy, </joey>
<joey> even if it's steamrolling.
- No, I agree, I agree. </joey>
<joey> - I get anxious that </joey>
<joey> with any game or any piece of media </joey>
<joey> where I want to enjoy it the most, right? </joey>
<joey> I wanted to enjoy it the most
on my first play through. </joey>
<connor> And sometimes I've had games where </connor>
<connor> I load it up and I hit the
difficulty level selection </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, "(inhales)
I'm getting anxiety just now. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) I'm already getting anxiety. </connor>
<connor> You know what? </connor>
<garnt> Maybe I'll play this
game another time, yeah." </garnt>
<connor> - This is why I like games that, </connor>
<connor> even if they have difficulty options, </connor>
<connor> they let you just change it on the fly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I like that a lot. </connor>
<connor> - And there's consequences for it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Alright, well, </connor>
<connor> this section is kind of
bullshit, I'ma knock it down." </connor>
<joey> - How do you feel about people </joey>
<joey> who purposely select easy mode? </joey>
<connor> - Well, it depends on the game. </connor>
<connor> There's some games where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> you're actually just not playing the game, </joey>
<joey> if you've pick the easy one
'cause it's far too easy. </joey>
<joey> - But, like, there's that whole stigma, </joey>
<joey> I guess, like, connotation, </joey>
<connor> that like, "Oh, you're not a real gamer </connor>
<connor> if you're playing it on easy mode. </connor>
<connor> Get good, scrub." </connor>
<joey> Like levels of things, but like- </joey>
<connor> - I mean, obviously if I was
there in the room with them, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "I'm a strong little baby. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna click normal?"
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> But, you know, on the podcast, </connor>
<connor> and if a general audience asked me, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "Yeah, of course, </connor>
<connor> you can you pick whatever
difficulty you want." </connor>
<connor> But obviously if you're my
mate, I'm gonna rinse you. </connor>
<connor> - Play baby mode 'Mario Kart.' </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "Are you playing 'Mario Kart' </garnt>
<garnt> with baby mode on?" </garnt>
<connor> No, you're not.
- No, you're not. </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, no, no. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. Yeah, I mean,
it's different, right? </connor>
<connor> Obviously you'll poke fun at your friends, </connor>
<garnt> you'll fuck around with it.
- Yeah, of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> But obviously in general, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that you can play </garnt>
<garnt> whatever fucking difficulty you want. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would I care? </garnt>
<connor> What does it take away from me? </connor>
<garnt> - Just have fun. </garnt>
<connor> Just have fun with the game.
- Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - If you wanna be a little baby bitch, </garnt>
<garnt> you can be a little baby bitch. </garnt>
<joey> I don't care. You have
the right to do that. </joey>
<joey> You paid the 60 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - You have the right to be a baby bitch. </joey>
<joey> - You paid the 60 bucks, you get to do it. </joey>
<joey> I think it's good 'cause
not everyone, you know, </joey>
<joey> obviously some people
have disabilities as well. </joey>
<joey> They can't play the game
on the hardest difficulty </joey>
<joey> 'cause maybe they can't do it. </joey>
<joey> You know, I just think
accessibility is good in gaming. </joey>
<joey> I think that one of the things
that pisses me off most, </joey>
<joey> and it's always the Japanese
game companies that do this, </joey>
<connor> is it like the accessibility
options in their games </connor>
<connor> are terrible. </connor>
<connor> Like they don't let you change anything. </connor>
<connor> No button remapping, none of that. </connor>
<connor> I love it when games are like,
"Bro, what do you wanna do? </connor>
<connor> How big do you want the
character models to be? </connor>
<connor> No, not that, sorry. </connor>
<connor> How bold do you want the outlines to be? </connor>
<garnt> - Do you ever use button remapping? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, all the time.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> I've never used it. </joey>
<joey> - I've never used it in my life. </joey>
<joey> - I love button remapping. </joey>
<connor> And it pisses me off that
a lot of games don't do it. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of the indie devs </connor>
<connor> are normally the ones who include </connor>
<connor> a shit ton of accessibility options. </connor>
<connor> - But that's a lot of PC games as well. </connor>
<joey> Not a lot of console games
have button remapping, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, the
beauty of console games </garnt>
<joey> is that it's just plug and play. </joey>
<connor> It's very simple. </connor>
<connor> Just put a disc in or whatever,
or you download the game, </connor>
<garnt> and you just start playing. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so the argument
behind accessibility options </connor>
<connor> and button remapping especially, </connor>
<garnt> especially with people who are, </garnt>
<joey> you know, maybe someone has a disability </joey>
<joey> where they can't use one
of their hands properly </joey>
<joey> and maybe there's a button
where they can't press jump, </joey>
<connor> but they can press the jump
button with this finger. </connor>
<connor> So the idea is that, </connor>
<connor> even though, yes, this is
probably the best layout, </connor>
<connor> someone out there might
have a way easier time </connor>
<joey> with this button being on this one, right? </joey>
<joey> So just give them the option to remap it. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, yeah.
- Why wouldn't you? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> No, I'm definitely not
against button remapping, </connor>
<joey> I've just personally never used it, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Nintendo's gotten
a lot better at it as well, </joey>
<joey> I think, actually, I think so. </joey>
<joey> But they're awkward sometimes with it. </joey>
<joey> And also colorblind options. </joey>
<garnt> "The Last of Us" had amazing
accessibility options. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you could change it </garnt>
<garnt> so everything in the
thing was just two colors. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's all gray </garnt>
<garnt> and the models are just bright red </garnt>
<garnt> and bright blue.
- Oh, that's cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - So even someone who's
completely like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> has a really bad a case of
vision can play the game </joey>
<connor> 'cause they can see the
models' outlines and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then you can also just
turn stuff on for yourself, </connor>
<connor> like if you prefer color... </connor>
<connor> Like a lot of people play "Apex Legends" </connor>
<connor> with the colorblind settings on </connor>
<connor> to change the color of the bars and stuff </connor>
<connor> to make it more visible, you know? </connor>
<connor> I think that especially... </connor>
<connor> Oh, another one. Okay, sorry,
I'm doing another rant now. </connor>
<connor> This is one thing that I think
there's absolutely no excuse </connor>
<connor> why there shouldn't be an option
on every single video game. </connor>
<joey> Subtitles. </joey>
<connor> Why is there not subtitles
on every single video game? </connor>
<connor> They have the script. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I hate it. </connor>
<connor> - I agree with that. </connor>
<connor> - I hate games that don't have subtitles. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes I don't wanna
have to listen to it </connor>
<connor> at full volume, </connor>
<connor> and sometimes maybe there's
explosions and shit going on, </connor>
<connor> I want to read it. </connor>
<connor> They have the script,
just plop that shit in. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like, what is
it about, not just gaming, </garnt>
<garnt> but movie audio mixing, </garnt>
<joey> especially if you're like...
- Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember I watched the
"Night Crawlers" yesterday </joey>
<joey> with Sydney and, you know,
we watched a few movies. </joey>
<connor> And we turned up the TV
to almost full volume. </connor>
<connor> Character starts speaking, and
it was just like, (mumbles). </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "What? </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> Is there a subtitle option?" </connor>
<connor> And then we turn on the TV to full volume </connor>
<connor> and it's still like, (mumbles). </connor>
<connor> And suddenly, out of nowhere, </connor>
<connor> boom, boom, boom. </connor>
<joey> I'm getting earache right now. </joey>
<connor> What the hell's going on? </connor>
<connor> - I had some compression
on this shit, my god. </connor>
<connor> - I literally had that happen to me </connor>
<joey> when I watched "Interstellar" last week. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughing)
Like, oh my god, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a fantastic movie,
don't get me wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> and I love Matthew McConaughey, </garnt>
<garnt> but, man, listening to him </garnt>
<joey> is like listening to a
subwoofer that barely works. </joey>
<joey> This is like (imitates subwoofer). </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause when they're mixing these movies, </connor>
<connor> they're mixing them on these
gigantic audio editing suites </connor>
<joey> where you can hear everything. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "No, edit this
on a fucking ear port, bro, </connor>
<connor> so you can hear what most
people are gonna listen to, </connor>
<connor> like when they're listening to this." </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, it's this
amazing scene, you know, </joey>
<joey> when Matthew McConaughey is giving this </joey>
<connor> really intense speech, </connor>
<connor> and all I'm hearing is
just these fucking organs. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, "Ah." </connor>
<connor> And Matthews like, (mumbles), </connor>
<joey> Like, I don't know what
you're saying. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Speak up.
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I suppose some of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> like the audio mixing
online video games as well, </garnt>
<connor> it's like watching a bass-boosted meme. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> You know, where the dialogue is so quiet </garnt>
<connor> and your ears just get fucking destroyed. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey growling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I fucking love YouTube
videos from small YouTubers </garnt>
<connor> whose audio is way too fucking quiet </connor>
<connor> and the music is like, dun, dun, dun, dun, </connor>
<connor> do, do, do, do, do, </connor>
<connor> and you can't fucking hear them. </connor>
<connor> I dunno why I love it.
- It's my favorite. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so charming.
- I know, it's so pure. </garnt>
<joey> I love it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, subtitles on video games. </joey>
<joey> This is why we need it, </joey>
<garnt> even in your own language, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, so there should
be absolutely no reason </connor>
<garnt> why there shouldn't be subtitles, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause they have to write
the script for the game. </connor>
<joey> Just put the fucking script </joey>
<connor> into the software that can do this. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, someone has to time
it, okay, that sucks, but- </connor>
<joey> - And I hate how it's, like, </joey>
<connor> a lot of games, the default is off. </connor>
<connor> Just make it on, </connor>
<joey> and if you don't like it,
then you can turn it off. </joey>
<connor> - Also, I think a lot of
games as well do this, </connor>
<connor> and I think every game should do this, </connor>
<connor> is that they let you choose
how big you want the text, </connor>
<connor> the color of the text, </connor>
<connor> the outline of the text,
the shadow and stuff, </connor>
<connor> so you can get the subtitles just right. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, again, </connor>
<connor> if you can't really see very
well, you know, you should... </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why </connor>
<connor> games don't just give
you all these options. </connor>
<connor> I get it, it's a crunch,
they don't have time, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, it's like, "Alright, </connor>
<connor> well, just fuck the people
who can't play the game </connor>
<connor> like everyone else, right? </connor>
<connor> Just fuck them, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, fuck them." </connor>
<connor> Which is why everyone
loves to clown on Xbox, </connor>
<connor> and I get it. </connor>
<connor> You know, I'm an Xbox
boy myself, I love Xbox. </connor>
<connor> I think Xbox have done some
of the most amazing things </connor>
<connor> for accessibility. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen the controller they've made? </connor>
<connor> It's like this pad, right, </connor>
<connor> and you can literally
hook anything up to it, </connor>
<connor> literally anything into a controller. </connor>
<connor> And it's set up </connor>
<joey> so that you can just turn
anything into a controller </joey>
<joey> so that no matter how your position is </joey>
<joey> or what disability you have, </joey>
<joey> you can set it up </joey>
<joey> so that you can get a way
where you can play games. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, that's cool. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like, they have
so many mods with it as well, </joey>
<joey> so they have inbuilt mods. </joey>
<garnt> But you can do anything. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so cool. Could you
pull it up, Nabby, actually? </garnt>
<garnt> What's it called? </garnt>
<garnt> - Thought you were
talking about the elite. </garnt>
<connor> - Could you get the coffee,
actually, real quick </connor>
<garnt> while I bring it up?
- Yeah, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - This episode is sponsored by ZenMarket. </garnt>
<connor> - Gentlemen, have you ever come across </connor>
<connor> an exclusive piece of anime merch </connor>
<connor> that you could only get in Japan </connor>
<connor> and you wanted it so bad

<garnt> - I'm glad I'm alive
because I'm here in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm not being killed
because we have lovely stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> like the exclusive JoJo

<garnt> which Joey is wearing right now. </garnt>
<joey> - I wear it every day.
That's how exclusive it is. </joey>
<connor> - And those are bad-ass (indistinct) bags </connor>
<connor> you can't get, but you could have got, </connor>
<connor> if you'd gone to ZenMarket earlier. </connor>
<garnt> And you see these exclusive glam shirts </garnt>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Xbox made this controller </connor>
<connor> called the Xbox Adaptive Controller </connor>
<connor> and you can literally just
plug anything you want, </connor>
<connor> like a massive button,
something that you blow on, </connor>
<connor> literally anything you want.
- That's so cool. </connor>
<joey> Is this recent? </joey>
<joey> - It's been out for like two, three years. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - It's been around for a while. </joey>
<joey> - Never heard of it. </joey>
<joey> - And it's done some amazing things. </joey>
<joey> It's so cool that Xbox thought to do that </joey>
<connor> because they're probably not
gonna make much money off that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, that's not something
you make money off of </connor>
<connor> so a lot of the companies won't do it. </connor>
<connor> But, you know, I thought, fuck,
fair play to Microsoft, man. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, that's great cred, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, </connor>
<joey> just like, why wouldn't you do that? </joey>
<joey> It's a great idea. </joey>
<joey> - They're looking out
for all gamers out there. </joey>
<connor> - And also, you know, a
lot of the stuff that Xbox- </connor>
<connor> - (giggling) It's just we were
talking about serious stuff, </connor>
<connor> but just the way, "They're
looking out for all gamers." </connor>
<connor> - I meant that with sincerity. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) It just sounds so facetious. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like the term "gamers" has
just, like, been ruined. </connor>
<joey> - That's what it means.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - For the record, I meant that
in all sincerity, alright. </joey>
<joey> Please. </joey>
<connor> - Any game company or whatever
that spends money and time </connor>
<connor> to develop stuff for accessibility options </connor>
<connor> that they know is probably
not gonna be valued </connor>
<connor> by 99% of people, </connor>
<connor> that's mad respect, you know?
- Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - It deserves to be praised. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like in terms of
customization and accessibility, </connor>
<garnt> well, maybe not accessibility,
but definitely customization, </garnt>
<garnt> it's always been the PC gaming crowd </garnt>
<garnt> that's been leading the charge, </garnt>
<connor> and, you know, obviously
Xbox Microsoft, you know. </connor>
<connor> It kind of feels like
it fits within their IP. </connor>
<connor> Whereas Nintendo is kind of like </connor>
<joey> the Apple of the gaming world, </joey>
<joey> where it's like, "This is
how we're doing things. </joey>
<joey> You can buy peripherals. </joey>
<garnt> You can't buy your own peripherals. </garnt>
<connor> It's always gotta be our peripherals." </connor>
<garnt> - It sucks, right? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause imagine it, like Miyamoto's there, </connor>
<connor> this kid who can't use his hands, </connor>
<connor> and Miyamoto's like, "Yeah, you
don't get to play my games." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Why? Oh, 'cause you
don't make enough money. </connor>
<connor> Do you make money? Do you
make millions of dollars? </connor>
<connor> No, bye-bye. </connor>
<connor> That's just like, why would
you deny someone the option </connor>
<connor> to get to play your games? </connor>
<connor> You know, I'd like to think
that if something happened to me </connor>
<connor> or, you know, if I had
a kid who loved gaming </connor>
<connor> and he wasn't able to use
the standard controller, </connor>
<connor> I'd wanna think that there's a chance </connor>
<connor> that he can play his favorite
games, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I said "he" like I know it's a boy. </connor>
<connor> Of course it's gonna be a boy. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't allow it. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Ew, girls, daughters,
disgusting. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, no excuse.
- Gamer girls, ugh. </joey>
<garnt> Those don't exist.
- Ugh. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's not hard to make
something that's like that, </connor>
<connor> that you can just allow
someone to customize, you know? </connor>
<connor> Obviously you still need
help from someone else </connor>
<connor> to help set it up for you, </connor>
<connor> but, I mean, I don't know.
- Why not? </connor>
<connor> - It pisses me off when they won't do it. </connor>
<connor> - Like all these companies
have all this money, right? </connor>
<joey> Like at least spend it on
something that, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like Nintendo at one point, </connor>
<joey> I think it was a year ago, </joey>
<connor> it was the most cash rich
company in Japan. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, dude, that pandemic
did fucking wonders for them. </connor>
<joey> - They have cash laying around. </joey>
<connor> Make a fucking accessible
controller, Nintendo. </connor>
<joey> Fuck me. </joey>
<joey> Stop making Joy-Cons that
don't fucking work. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> Goddamn it.
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Stop making Joy-Cons that
break after six months. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - It literally is like an Apple periphery. </connor>
<connor> - It is, it is.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, oh, it
breaks after six months, </connor>
<joey> just buy a new pair. </joey>
<connor> Just buy a new pair. </connor>
<connor> - I had a friend who was like, </connor>
<joey> he didn't know anything about
Joy-Con drift, any of that. </joey>
<connor> and they were like, "Yeah,
I don't know why your- </connor>
<garnt> - What's Joy-Can drift? </garnt>
<garnt> . You don't know anything
about Joy-Con drift? </garnt>
<garnt> - I obviously don't play my Switch enough. </garnt>
<joey> - It's when the D-pad just stops working. </joey>
<joey> - So unfortunately there's
a massive lawsuit going on, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if it's been resolved, </connor>
<connor> with Nintendo and a bunch. </connor>
<connor> It's a class action. </connor>
<garnt> Essentially, the controllers,
after a random period of time, </garnt>
<garnt> they just start drifting the Joy-Con, </garnt>
<garnt> like the joystick on its own. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - It's not just the Joy-Cons either. </connor>
<joey> The Pro Controllers do the same thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it's been a massive problem </connor>
<connor> and people have to buy so many Joy-Cons. </connor>
<joey> And Joy-Cons aren't cheap. </joey>
<joey> They're like 60 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - 60, 70 bucks, yeah.
- It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and they just, they drift. </joey>
<joey> And I had a friend who was playing it, </joey>
<joey> and bless them, they're
not really a gamer, </joey>
<connor> and they were like, "Yeah,
so when I'm playing it, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I just go to the side. </connor>
<connor> Why is that?"
(Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "First time, huh?"
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, so Nintendo made a shitty product </connor>
<connor> that doesn't fucking work </connor>
<connor> so you have to deal with it. </connor>
<connor> Buy a new one if you don't like it. </connor>
<garnt> - Spend more money. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Nintendo says
they'll fix it as well, </connor>
<connor> that they have like warranty or... </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna deal with that shit. </connor>
<connor> - I think the last thing </connor>
<connor> that something like that happened to me </connor>
<garnt> was the infamous Xbox red rings of death. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, that was such a debacle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I like how we completely
forgot about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a fucking clown
fiesta that was, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you have to send your
Xbox away to Microsoft? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> So like I did this like,
fucking guerilla tactic </garnt>
<garnt> that I found on the internet of, </garnt>
<garnt> now that I know what I'm doing, </garnt>
<joey> I was just basically overheating the Xbox. </joey>
<joey> So what you do is you fucking
wrap a towel around it </joey>
<joey> and then... </joey>
<joey> No, I'm actually serious.
- What? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You wrap a towel around it
and then you turn on the Xbox </joey>
<joey> and leave it for like a few hours. </joey>
<joey> So you're just basically overheating it. </joey>
<joey> - You're cooking it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're overheating </joey>
<garnt> or cooking your fucking CPU or something. </garnt>
<connor> - You should have like a 4chan thread </connor>
<connor> to set your house on fire.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, very, very much
like a fire hazard. </garnt>
<joey> - How to be an arsonist with an Xbox. </joey>
<joey> - But some reason, </joey>
<joey> for some inexplicable reason, it worked. </joey>
<garnt> And I have no idea why.
- Wait, wait, </garnt>
<joey> so do you wanna explain what
the red ring of death is </joey>
<garnt> for people who don't know? </garnt>
<garnt> - So back when Xbox
released their Xbox 360- </garnt>
<connor> - They rushed it out and
it was poorly manufactured. </connor>
<connor> It had many problems. </connor>
<connor> - Right, so if you bought
one of the first consoles, </connor>
<connor> first generation consoles
that were released, </connor>
<connor> you basically had a time limit, right? </connor>
<connor> It was basically like a year or two. </connor>
<connor> And every Xbox had this, where you play, </connor>
<connor> and then one day, for one
reason that nobody could tell, </connor>
<connor> it just wouldn't work. </connor>
<connor> And so you would get
the three rings, right? </connor>
<connor> So when the Xbox turns on, right, </connor>
<garnt> you'd see a green ring
around the power button. </garnt>
<garnt> And basically it was
split into four segments. </garnt>
<garnt> And the red rings of death
meant three segments were red, </garnt>
<garnt> which would mean something
was wrong with the start-up. </garnt>
<garnt> And we called it the red rings of death </garnt>
<connor> because everyone had this issue </connor>
<garnt> and it never got resolved. </garnt>
<connor> And how you would resolve it, </connor>
<garnt> is to basically send it
back to the manufacturer. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it cost Microsoft
billions 'cause of all this shit, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it happened so often. </connor>
<connor> And my friend, I had
two friends who had it, </connor>
<connor> so we had a group of four
of us who all played Xbox. </connor>
<connor> And I never got it, thank God. </connor>
<connor> I would have actually cried, </connor>
<connor> 'cause what my friend had to go through </connor>
<connor> sounded like my worst
nightmare as 16-year-old me. </connor>
<connor> He got the red ring of death
and he had to send it back. </connor>
<connor> And then they sent back a box, </connor>
<joey> an Xbox that was refurbished
and it was someone else's </joey>
<joey> and it didn't work.
- What? </joey>
<connor> - And, again, like they're- </connor>
<joey> - So they're just recycling Xboxes? </joey>
<connor> - Apparently they were
doing stuff like this. </connor>
<connor> It was pretty widespread.
- Jeez. </connor>
<connor> - So he sent it and he called them up. </connor>
<connor> Again, this is like, over months. </connor>
<connor> I think it took like half a year </connor>
<connor> to get it fixed, overall.
- Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - He had to send it about three times </connor>
<connor> before they finally fixed it. </connor>
<connor> And then it broke six months later </connor>
<connor> and he just gave up. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "I'm not doing it again. </connor>
<connor> I'm not sending it back."
- Yeah, fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that literally
scared me to death. </connor>
<connor> I was like, the thought of my Xbox dying. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this is my lifeline. </connor>
<connor> Like, if this goes, what am I gonna do? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what I'm going to do. </connor>
<connor> If I can't play "Halo: Reach," </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna to lose it.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's gonna be everyone's problem. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you remember memory cards? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever had like a save file </connor>
<garnt> that's just been corrupt? </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually trauma from my childhood </garnt>
<garnt> of my fucking GameCube ones
just dying for no reason. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- The GameCube ones died </connor>
<connor> all the fucking time. </connor>
<garnt> - The GameCube ones died constantly. </garnt>
<garnt> - The GameCube ones were
the worst, oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember I just ended
up with a pile of them. </connor>
<joey> - Do you know why? </joey>
<joey> It's 'cause I bought the Mad Catz ones. </joey>
<joey> - Ah, I see. </joey>
<joey> - Back in the day, </joey>
<joey> Mad Catz was like, everything. </joey>
<joey> Like if you wanted controller
or another memory card </joey>
<connor> or any peripheral that was
half the price, Mad Catz. </connor>
<joey> - So we have like the Xbox now, </joey>
<joey> not the Xbox, sorry, the
GameCube in our room right now. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh, okay, </joey>
<joey> I gotta buy some memory cards for it." </joey>
<garnt> And the trauma kicks back. </garnt>
<garnt> The moment I said that to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "We've gotta buy memory cards. </garnt>
<garnt> We've gotta buy memory cards." </garnt>
<connor> I just ended up buying
like 10 memory cards, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, I'm
just expecting the worst. </connor>
<connor> One of these memory cards is gonna die </connor>
<connor> in like, two days, guaranteed. </connor>
<connor> Luckily it hasn't happened yet. </connor>
<connor> So I just have this like pile
of memory cards in my room </connor>
<connor> that are just unused, just in case. </connor>
<joey> But, yeah, it sucked as well </joey>
<joey> because there was no pattern to it. </joey>
<garnt> - No, there wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> There was never a pattern. </garnt>
<joey> - It's was just one day the
memory card was like, "See ya." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- See ya, peace. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think playing with
memory cards on the GameCube </garnt>
<joey> has given me a permanent
fear of playing JRPGs. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like it was like, you know, "Mario Kart," </joey>
<joey> you know, fucking any Zelda game. </joey>
<garnt> Okay, Zelda's bad enough, okay, but like- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, dude, </joey>
<joey> like I've had some "Wind Waker" accounts </joey>
<joey> just completely die on me for no reason. </joey>
<garnt> - But there is nothing worse
than a fucking JRPG corrupting. </garnt>
<joey> And I've had it. </joey>
<garnt> I've had it on GameCube,
I've had it on PS2. </garnt>
<garnt> I still have never finished "Star Ocean 3" </garnt>
<garnt> because I've gotten fucking
60 hours into the game, </garnt>
<garnt> I was invested, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the memory card got corrupted </garnt>
<garnt> and I just lost 60 hours of my life </garnt>
<garnt> and I've never gotten it back </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know what the
ending of that game is. </garnt>
<joey> - I had it even worse once. </joey>
<joey> I think it was the second time </joey>
<joey> I played a "Final Fantasy" game. </joey>
<joey> I was playing "Final Fantasy VI" </joey>
<joey> for the first time on Super Nintendo, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, 40 hours in. </joey>
<connor> I think I was maybe two bosses away. </connor>
<connor> And just one of my cousins walked past, </connor>
<connor> kicked the SNES, and
completely reset my file. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck?
- Just like a light tap, </connor>
<connor> like that. </connor>
<joey> It just went, blip, just died. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "What happened?" </connor>
<connor> Flicked it back on, corrupt, all gone. </connor>
<connor> - Bro.
- And I was like, </connor>
<joey> I'd never been that close to
committing murder in my life. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughing) </joey>
<joey> But I was that close. </joey>
<joey> Like, eight-year-old me was like, </joey>
<joey> "Is this how serial murders start?" </joey>
<connor> - Joey was a good boy until the day. </connor>
<joey> - Until he wasn't. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Until that day </joey>
<joey> when someone kicked his SNES. </joey>
<joey> - And then that's when I realized </joey>
<connor> just the absolute fragility
of these old consoles. </connor>
<connor> They're literally just a tiny... </connor>
<connor> It wasn't even like a boot. </connor>
<joey> It was literally just
like a little light tap. </joey>
<connor> - It was either you had an absolute tank </connor>
<connor> or you got very unlucky
and one tap did it. </connor>
<connor> Like I swear to God, </connor>
<joey> I dropped my Nintendo DS like
a million times as a child </joey>
<joey> and it never broke. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, dude, those things
are brick shithouses. </joey>
<joey> - Don't know how it never broke, </joey>
<joey> but somehow, you know, </joey>
<joey> my PS2 would just shit
itself all the time. </joey>
<connor> But I swear everyone
else's PS2 was a tank. </connor>
<connor> So I don't really understand. </connor>
<garnt> - For some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> always the Sony ones were
just the most fragile things. </garnt>
<garnt> Like being a Nintendo kid- </garnt>
<connor> - Xbox 360s, I've seen like
how those things survive, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know, man. Even
though the red ring of death, </connor>
<garnt> like, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> Garnt, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - I know, like, dude, </connor>
<garnt> did you ever have that experience
on a PS2 where, you know, </garnt>
<connor> you go up to the loading screen </connor>
<connor> and then you put the disk
in and you just like, </connor>
<connor> you're praying for a
few seconds of silence. </connor>
<connor> You're praying to God </connor>
<connor> that you're gonna get the shoop. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And when you don't, you have this, </connor>
<connor> it's like this fucking
hellish dimension, right, </connor>
<connor> where the PS2 just turns
into the gates of, like, </connor>
<garnt> the fucking gates of hell open up. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
It's all red, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Oh, I've
got a corrupt disk, oh no." </garnt>
<connor> - How do you even do that?
How do you get a corrupt disk? </connor>
<connor> How does that even happen? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, how do you not do that? </garnt>
<garnt> Have you never had a faulty disk? </garnt>
<joey> - Even the OG Xboxes, </joey>
<garnt> if there was one micrometer of dust on it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, actually over being scratched? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, not even a scratch. </joey>
<joey> If there was like just a
tiny bit of dust on it, </joey>
<joey> it just wouldn't run. </joey>
<connor> - I remember there was
disk cleaning services </connor>
<connor> at game stores. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, in the UK. </joey>
<joey> And they just didn't fucking work. </joey>
<joey> Like, at all.
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like you pay like 30 pounds, </joey>
<connor> which is the cost of a game at that time, </connor>
<connor> and you get two disks back </connor>
<connor> and they just didn't do anything. </connor>
<connor> It didn't work. They'd be
like, "Yeah, it's good to go." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "No, it's not. I put it in. </connor>
<connor> Did you even try it?" And
they're like, "Yeah, it worked." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Fuck off, it didn't." </joey>
<joey> - That's why I like the Super
Nintendo cartridges, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, if it didn't work- </connor>
<connor> - Cartridges are pretty nice. </connor>
<connor> - Blow on that bitch, </connor>
<connor> like smack it against
the wall if you want, </connor>
<joey> and you pop it in and it magically works. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, speaking of the cartridges </garnt>
<garnt> and things you should never do, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I had a fucking dickhead... </garnt>
<connor> You know, some kids are just dickheads </connor>
<connor> for absolutely no reason?
- Yeah, of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> - So we had this distant
relative friend who- </connor>
<connor> - Who is no longer a friend.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - He's just a distant relative now. </connor>
<connor> - You'll hear this story, </connor>
<connor> 'cause, you know, at family reunions, </connor>
<garnt> especially Asian family reunions, </garnt>
<garnt> there are some kids there, </garnt>
<garnt> some people that you don't
know how you're related to </garnt>
<connor> or your family's related to.
- And they're the worst. </connor>
<connor> - But it's like a family friend, cousin, </connor>
<connor> and they're always fucking worse. </connor>
<connor> So I remember we were playing
"Goldeneye" on the N64. </connor>
<connor> - I bet he chose Oddjob, didn't he? </connor>
<connor> - Huh?
- Bet he chose Oddjob. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, no, he didn't do that. </connor>
<connor> He got smashed, he got battered, </connor>
<connor> and he was a pretty young kid.
- (laughs) Schooled him. </connor>
<connor> - We schooled him. </connor>
<connor> It was a four player game. </connor>
<connor> He died immediately. </connor>
<connor> And he got humiliated. </connor>
<connor> And what did he do? </connor>
<connor> He just went over to the N64 </connor>
<connor> and just took the cartridge out. </connor>
<connor> No turning off the console, no nothing, </connor>
<connor> just took the cartridge out.
- That's a big no-no. </connor>
<connor> You can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> you know the debates of
whether people can be born evil </garnt>
<joey> or whether they learn it?
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, clearly kids are born evil. </joey>
<garnt> Like I'm clearly just witnessing
Johan Liebert right here. </garnt>
<garnt> - There are some kids that
you're like, "You, you, ooh, </garnt>
<garnt> you must've been born with it. </garnt>
<joey> There's something wrong." </joey>
<joey> - You came out the womb a bastard. </joey>
<joey> - I thought there was
fucking music playing </joey>
<connor> when you came out the fucking womb. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Like "Final Fantasy"
boss music. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I bet Zeromus' theme
played when you came out. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> As a kid, and I'm sure you
can understand as well, </connor>
<connor> like as a gaming kid, right, </connor>
<connor> you could punch me, you could
spit on me, you could stab me, </connor>
<connor> but you don't touch the game console. </connor>
<connor> That's a big no-no. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't matter how heated shit gets, </garnt>
<garnt> you stay away from the PS1. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's sacrilegious. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like stuff that... </connor>
<connor> I was a calm kid at times, </connor>
<garnt> but the one thing that would set me off </garnt>
<connor> is like, "You touch the
game console while it's on, </connor>
<connor> I'ma lose it. I don't care who you are." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, one of my biggest
pet peeves as a kid </connor>
<connor> whenever I played with a mate or something </connor>
<connor> or whenever I have mates over </connor>
<connor> is for some reason everyone
had fucking greasy hands </connor>
<connor> and their hands would
grease up my controllers. </connor>
<connor> - No respect for the Dual
Shock PS2 Controller. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like my biggest pet
peeve was when, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when we're having food or
something and we had pizza, </garnt>
<connor> and they would be eating the
pizza while playing the game. </connor>
<connor> - Get a wet wipe. </connor>
<connor> Get a wet wipe, please. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) And I could
see their greasy hands </connor>
<joey> going on the controller. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "You know what? </joey>
<joey> maybe friendship's overrated."
(Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> This is why I play single player games. </garnt>
<joey> - And it forms a line of grease </joey>
<garnt> in between the button and the controller. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, yeah, and like physically see it, ugh. </connor>
<joey> - That's why, you know, </joey>
<connor> when people grab pizza and
there is kitchen roll available, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You absolute animal. </connor>
<connor> There was a perfectly good
kitchen roll on the table. </connor>
<connor> Why did you not take a slice? </connor>
<connor> You know, for the crumbs, or
just to wipe your hands on? </connor>
<connor> You know, this is pizza. </connor>
<connor> It's greasy, come on." (sighs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, never again. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, please, please,
learn some manners. </garnt>
<connor> Especially as adults. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like, even as adults, </connor>
<connor> there's some people who
don't do that as well. </connor>
<connor> And, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> greasy controllers is just
one of my biggest pet peeves. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That's pretty disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's kinda hard to
clean a greasy controller. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta get that grease
out and it goes in the folds. </connor>
<connor> Fuck.
- Ugh, gross. </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say
something, I totally forgot. </connor>
<connor> (Joey burps) </connor>
<connor> You know what was my most
hated genre of video online? </connor>
<connor> - Video?
- Yeah, yeah, genre of video. </connor>
<connor> It is the people who turn
people's gaming consoles off </connor>
<connor> of like 10-year-old kids
while they're playing </connor>
<joey> and they're like, "Look,
he's getting angry." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, no shit he's getting angry, </joey>
<joey> you just turned that shit off. </joey>
<joey> - I've never heard of that genre of video. </joey>
<joey> - You must've seen them. </joey>
<joey> There's tons of videos out there </joey>
<joey> where people just go up
to their little brother, </joey>
<joey> turn the game console off or PC off </joey>
<joey> while they're playing
"Minecraft" or something. </joey>
<connor> - What a cunt. </connor>
<connor> - And then they're like, "Haha,
look, he's getting angry." </connor>
<connor> Yeah, no shit he's getting angry. </connor>
<connor> He's probably building his fucking world. </connor>
<joey> - The adulting version of that is like, </joey>
<connor> if your friend was driving </connor>
<connor> and then you just pulled
the fucking keys out. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Haha, look, he's angry." </connor>
<joey> It's like, yeah, no shit
he's angry. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Dude, he didn't deserve it.
- That's life threatening. </connor>
<connor> - That's just like, "I'm
about to die." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's an endgame. </connor>
<joey> - Haha, well, let's die together. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, to a ten-year-old, </garnt>
<connor> it might as well be fucking
life and death, right? </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather you pulled the keys out. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true.
- Right? It's life and death. </connor>
<joey> So it was a good analogy, fuck you. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's one of those things
where it's like, okay, (laughs) </connor>
<connor> doing something to, like... </connor>
<connor> If that kid accidentally turned
off his own PC, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> If he gets angry, yeah, that's his fault. </connor>
<joey> He did it. </joey>
<connor> But when you do it to someone, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's like, okay, </connor>
<connor> just 'cause you don't understand the hobby </connor>
<connor> and you don't understand
how invested someone is, </connor>
<connor> fuck you, thinking that it's just funny </connor>
<connor> 'cause, oh, you turned it
off, you got a reaction. </connor>
<joey> Do something else. </joey>
<joey> What's wrong with you? </joey>
<connor> How sad is your life? </connor>
<joey> - Especially when it's unwarranted, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, how sad is your life </connor>
<joey> that you have to do this to someone, </joey>
<joey> that you have to just turn
their game console off </joey>
<joey> to get some views on
Instagram or something? </joey>
<garnt> Like, fuck off, you're a dickhead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where have you started
seeing these videos? </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, these videos have been
around for decades online. </connor>
<joey> - I think I'm just like,
avoided watching them. </joey>
<connor> - Some of most popular
clips back in the day </connor>
<connor> were brothers turning off
each other's game consoles </connor>
<joey> while they were playing </joey>
<joey> and watching their kid rage. </joey>
<joey> This is a big thing.
- I mean the only one I know </joey>
<joey> is the kid who got his WoW
account deleted by his mum, </joey>
<garnt> and the boy's freaking out in his bedroom. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's staged though.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's staged, but. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I've seen some
videos where that's been true. </joey>
<connor> - You've seen it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen some of those videos </connor>
<garnt> where just accounts get deleted. </garnt>
<connor> - But like, because obviously now, </connor>
<connor> 'cause TikTok is rising, right? </connor>
<connor> So I feel like TikTok
has been going through </connor>
<connor> a lot of the old trends that
happened back in the day. </connor>
<connor> And I've been seeing it a lot on TikTok. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "This shit isn't funny. </connor>
<joey> You're just a dickhead." </joey>
<joey> Like, how are you getting likes for this? </joey>
<connor> - Was it funny back in the day though, </connor>
<connor> when you're watching it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's 'cause
the kids would stage it </connor>
<connor> and they would make
these insane reactions- </connor>
<connor> - It's funny back in the day </connor>
<garnt> when I was younger. (laughs)
- Yeah, when I was 10- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm older now, and now it
was just a dickhead move. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I was 10, I thought it was funny </garnt>
<garnt> because I was like, "Oh, this
is great, this is so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> The kid's shouting and screaming." </garnt>
<connor> And that now I'm an adult, I'm like... </connor>
<connor> But then seeing another adult do it, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What's wrong with you?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> If I'm 10, and my 12-year-old
brother did it to me, </connor>
<connor> that's probably funny to
another 12-year-old me. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, one video genre
that's very similar to that </garnt>
<garnt> that I've just never gotten or found funny </garnt>
<joey> is just like people being dickheads </joey>
<joey> in big stores or something.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember I used to see it all the time </joey>
<joey> in Vine and TikTok or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - There's so many TikTok's like that. </joey>
<joey> - How are they are being dicks in stores? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, just like fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Just being public nuisances. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just being public nuisances. </joey>
<garnt> And it's always something
like a Walmart or a Costco. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, what were they? </connor>
<connor> Like the milk challenge </connor>
<garnt> where they'd throw the milk in the air? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the throw the milk in the air </connor>
<garnt> or fucking just, like,
get all the footballs </garnt>
<garnt> and just start throwing them everywhere </garnt>
<garnt> or just breaking shit. </garnt>
<joey> And it was always be captioned
with the fucking laugh emoji </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Who's funny? </joey>
<joey> Someone's got to clean up this mess." </joey>
<connor> 'Cause there's always someone
making a mess or something. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, dude, </joey>
<joey> like the fucking employees
are getting paid shit </joey>
<garnt> and they gotta clean up your mess? </garnt>
<garnt> - I wish that genre of
videos would just die. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But people are just always
desperate to get likes. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, I feel that a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> those guys just get away with it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - Like if there was like repercussions </connor>
<connor> for every single person
who was doing that, </connor>
<connor> I think it would stop,
you know, obviously. </connor>
<connor> But they just think like, "Haha,
teehee, I just made a mess. </connor>
<joey> Funny, right?" </joey>
<joey> - There was a video
trend that went around, </joey>
<joey> I have no idea why this is a trend at all, </joey>
<garnt> where people used to open
the ice cream containers </garnt>
<garnt> and lick it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that. </garnt>
<joey> - And somebody did get convicted actually. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, good, </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's fucking vile. </joey>
<garnt> That's just so gross. </garnt>
<garnt> And I have to sit there and
think what kind of sick fuck </garnt>
<garnt> thought of this idea and
thought it was funny. </garnt>
<garnt> And then also the person who watched it </garnt>
<garnt> and thought, "That's hilarious,
I'm gonna go to that." </garnt>
<garnt> What's wrong? </garnt>
<connor> How have we failed every
single parent on this earth? </connor>
<joey> How have they failed? </joey>
<joey> There's two people who have the same idea </joey>
<joey> and thought this was funny. </joey>
<joey> And then again, after that, </joey>
<joey> more people find it funny. </joey>
<joey> How are these people being bred? </joey>
<joey> - That's just how I feel about </joey>
<joey> most YouTube or just internet trends. </joey>
<connor> - There should be like a, </connor>
<connor> you know when you go to the
doctor to give childbirth, </connor>
<joey> they should play a series of videos </joey>
<joey> and ask you, "Is this funny?" </joey>
<joey> - If you laugh at any of them,
they just deny you. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) We're taking the kid. </joey>
<joey> You clearly don't have
the right to raise it. </joey>
<joey> - Then child services just standing there, </joey>
<joey> waiting for you to laugh. </joey>
<joey> It's like, do it, I dare you. </joey>
<connor> - Next up, we have the
screaming in public challenge. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, here you go. </connor>
<connor> - And then if they laugh a little, ooh. </connor>
<connor> - Show the Tide Pod challenge, </connor>
<connor> did you think that was a good idea? </connor>
<connor> Just making sure.
- How does it make you feel? </connor>
<connor> - How does it make you feel? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's so tragic, fuck, man. </connor>
<joey> - We're a shit person
raw shag test. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - That's terrible, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you ever find shit
like "Jackass" or something </garnt>
<garnt> funny back in the day though? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's
'cause I think it was new </connor>
<connor> and it was unheard of. </connor>
<connor> And, you know, as well, </connor>
<connor> when it was on TV, there
was a lot of disconnect. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like
that disconnect from TV </connor>
<connor> is just gone because there
was always like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> it might not have been true, but as a kid, </connor>
<connor> if it was on TV, </connor>
<garnt> then there was always that disconnect </garnt>
<garnt> of like, "Oh, this is maybe staged" </garnt>
<garnt> or "They sorted something out" </garnt>
<garnt> or "People in that video got
compensation of some form." </garnt>
<connor> - Well, because, you know, </connor>
<connor> when Jackass did those
stunts in public, you know, </connor>
<connor> even back then the rules were the same. </connor>
<connor> You can't just upload any
footage of any person's face. </connor>
<connor> You have to get a release form. </connor>
<garnt> And so that means that
the person they pranked </garnt>
<connor> clearly signed off on it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you have to get the
release form or they're blurred. </connor>
<connor> And in that case it's like, alright, well- </connor>
<joey> - I liked "Jackass" back in the day. </joey>
<joey> But the ones where they
would do shit in public </joey>
<garnt> with just random people in the streets, </garnt>
<garnt> I did not like watching those </garnt>
<connor> just because I felt bad for the people </connor>
<connor> who got involved, right? </connor>
<connor> But I liked the ones </connor>
<connor> where they would just
do shit with each other </connor>
<connor> and just laugh at each other. </connor>
<joey> Like, those were fucking hilarious, but. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But, you know, also, </connor>
<connor> even with "Jackass," right, </connor>
<garnt> a network is signing off on this, </garnt>
<garnt> they are following rules, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The problem is when people
are doing this in public </garnt>
<garnt> and they're doing it on their own- </garnt>
<garnt> - They don't know shit.
- There's no rules, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no release forms. </garnt>
<garnt> there's no procedure around this. </garnt>
<garnt> And even if you are gonna prank someone, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't just show their face, </garnt>
<connor> you have to get a release
form. Like, it's a mess. </connor>
<connor> And I think the problem is is that, </connor>
<connor> because we've seen this on TV, </connor>
<connor> the younger generation
think that, "Oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> well, I can just do that." </connor>
<joey> It's like, no, no, no, not quite, no. </joey>
<joey> - There's lots of adulting things though- </joey>
<joey> - There's a reason why
all the big prank channels </joey>
<joey> fake their pranks, </joey>
<joey> because it gets to the point where- </joey>
<joey> - It's almost they can't get away with it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can't. </joey>
<joey> Like, getting release
forms is a nightmare. </joey>
<joey> And also, you know, </joey>
<connor> even getting the reactions
you want is a pain in the ass, </connor>
<garnt> and then you forget </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to get
them to sign a release. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And so lot of prank channels
just are dickheads, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, like a lot of them ran into trouble. </connor>
<joey> Like, I mean Vitaly when he was in prison, </joey>
<joey> he went to prison in Egypt. </joey>
<joey> - What did he do? </joey>
<joey> - He climbed the fucking pyramids. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, that's right. </joey>
<connor> I remember that. </connor>
<connor> - (chuckles) Oh, did he do that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and then when he got let out, </connor>
<connor> it was like the worst thing
ever. And then he got out </connor>
<connor> and then went and beat up some old woman. </connor>
<connor> He jumped an old woman in
Santa Monica or something. </connor>
<joey> - He actually went insane, bro. </joey>
<connor> - Like he nearly killed this woman. </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck, I think- </garnt>
<connor> - Don't do pranks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I think
the ones that I remember </connor>
<connor> was two kids-
- Oh, that was horrible. </connor>
<connor> - The two brothers who faked a burglary </connor>
<connor> or something like that, </connor>
<connor> or faked like a bank robbery?
- Oh, and they got the Uber? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Then they got the Uber, </joey>
<joey> and the Uber refused to drive them. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "Ha,
what an asshole Uber driver. </joey>
<garnt> He wouldn't drive us." </garnt>
<garnt> Nah, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> what is going on in this world right now? </garnt>
<garnt> - And they thought it was hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and millions of
people found that hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - It's just tragic, you know? </connor>
<connor> And, you know, that prank where that, </connor>
<connor> or not prank, </connor>
<connor> or that challenge where that guy tried </connor>
<garnt> to see if a book could stop
a desert eagle or something, </garnt>
<garnt> which, you know, you can't help but laugh </garnt>
<joey> at how stupid that sounds. </joey>
<joey> - And girlfriend literally
shot the boyfriend. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and she killed him. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, this is tragic. </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, you know, </joey>
<joey> people are obviously getting these ideas </joey>
<joey> from watching this shit online. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking terrible. </joey>
<connor> I think pranks are a genre that
should just die on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Any prank that isn't a
very, just chill prank </connor>
<joey> on someone you know, </joey>
<connor> you know, those pranks
are hilarious, right? </connor>
<connor> - The ones that always end </connor>
<connor> with the person getting pranked laughing </connor>
<connor> is, you know, the ones
that are fine because- </connor>
<connor> - You spray your housemate with water, </connor>
<joey> you put a pie on their face, whatever, </joey>
<joey> that's all good fun, you know? </joey>
<joey> But like, I just think when
you're doing it to strangers </joey>
<joey> and they have no say, </joey>
<garnt> and it's something that could hurt them </garnt>
<garnt> or it's something that
could genuinely scare them, </garnt>
<garnt> you could be traumatized
with some of these pranks. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, absolutely.
- So fuck that, no. </connor>
<connor> - Just like, don't be
an asshole, basically. </connor>
<connor> It's such a fine line because, you know, </connor>
<connor> the line between asshole- </connor>
<connor> - A lot of these people are psychopaths. </connor>
<connor> They don't know what that doing- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, a lot of
people are psychopaths. </connor>
<connor> - They have no fucking idea. </connor>
<connor> - And, you know, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately we live in a
climate where a lot of times </connor>
<connor> being an asshole gives you good- </connor>
<connor> - You're rewarded, yeah.
- You get rewarded for it. </connor>
<connor> It's unfortunate. </connor>
<garnt> - Man, we're just growing
into old bitchy old men, </garnt>
<garnt> aren't we?
(Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus.
- Wow, man, </connor>
<connor> I don't know </connor>
<connor> if it's because I've just
been on YouTube so long, man. </connor>
<connor> Some genres, I don't like to be elitist </connor>
<connor> and look down on genres of YouTube, </connor>
<connor> but pranks is one of the
genres that need to die. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but then I do. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - But then I suddenly will towards pranks. </joey>
<connor> Pranks are a genre that
should have died long ago. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, and luckily they
have, I feel, in a lot of ways. </connor>
<connor> I mean, they've died on
YouTube, but now they've just- </connor>
<garnt> - I think they've just migrated to TikTok. </garnt>
<joey> - TikTok is gonna redo it.
- They migrated to TikTok. </joey>
<joey> - They started on YouTube
and then Vine was also, </joey>
<garnt> there was so many prank Vines as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And then now I think
they've just both migrated </garnt>
<garnt> to TikTok as well and it's just- </garnt>
<connor> - I've been watching a
lot of YouTube Shorts </connor>
<joey> and I just lose my mind
watching the stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Why are you watching... </joey>
<joey> Of who? </joey>
<joey> - Dunno, it pops up and I watch them. </joey>
<joey> Some of them are funny, some
of them are pretty good, </joey>
<joey> but obviously they're just all re-posts. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But there's some genre
videos that I just think, </joey>
<joey> I absolutely despise to death. </joey>
<connor> And one of them is like, </connor>
<connor> there's this genre and I
don't understand it at all. </connor>
<connor> There's this video and
there's this guy, right? </connor>
<connor> Imagine that your phone
is vertical, whatever, </connor>
<connor> it's cut into two. </connor>
<garnt> There'll be one video of the guy </garnt>
<garnt> explaining the video that
is about to play before you. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is very self-explanatory. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's one where there was this video, </garnt>
<garnt> and this guy's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Here are the different types of Pokemon </garnt>
<connor> compared to each other in size." </connor>
<connor> And he goes like, "Pikachu, one meter. </connor>
<connor> Snorlax, one meter." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, I did not need
you to tell me what this is, </connor>
<connor> and I don't need you to sit
there for 10 seconds like this, </connor>
<connor> while the video is playing </connor>
<joey> after you've explained what it is. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Oh, he's still on screen? </joey>
<joey> - He's still on screen the whole time. </joey>
<joey> He's just sitting there. </joey>
<joey> And then he'll go like, "Whoa, that's big. </joey>
<connor> Whoa, I didn't expect
that Pokemon to be big." </connor>
<joey> And it's like, "What is this? </joey>
<connor> What is this?"
- That's infuriating. </connor>
<connor> - You stole someone else's
video, you re-posted it- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's not even his video?
- No. </joey>
<joey> No, of course it's not his video. </joey>
<joey> And they just re-post it. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, this is shit. </connor>
<connor> This is the worst type of content. </connor>
<connor> I hate this so much. </connor>
<joey> - It's literally just stealing. </joey>
<connor> - I just hate it, man, </connor>
<connor> and, yeah, it's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - Reaction 2.0, the evolution. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause, yeah, that's what it is. </connor>
<joey> Instead of like- </joey>
<joey> - It's reaction videos
with somehow less effort. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they've made reaction videos </connor>
<connor> that are somehow worse
than reaction videos </connor>
<joey> where they're like, not even reacting. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Hey, I'm gonna explain to you </joey>
<connor> what the video is gonna explain to you." </connor>
<joey> - They're literally just
a talking description box. </joey>
<joey> That's all it is. </joey>
<joey> - I immediately skipped them whenever, </joey>
<joey> or any financial advice
ones, I skip immediately. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles)
There's a lot of those. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of ones </joey>
<joey> that start off with inspirational music. </joey>
<joey> You'll be scrolling and you'll
hear the inspirational music. </joey>
<joey> - "Here's how I made my
first million dollars." </joey>
<joey> - They're like, "Sir, why are
you working for $10 an hour?" </joey>
<garnt> And it's like, I know where this is going. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, "I work for $1,000 an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know why? </garnt>
<garnt> I value my time." </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, oh my fucking God. </connor>
<connor> The sheer amount of guru stuff </connor>
<connor> on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, it's insane. </connor>
<joey> It's way out of control. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, I mean, it's going- </joey>
<joey> - Poor kids who are gonna think </joey>
<joey> that everyone should be
earning 10 grand a minute, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> They go back to their dad, you know, </joey>
<joey> and the kid's like, "What do
you wanna do for Christmas?" </joey>
<joey> Or "What do you want to do
for the rest of your life?" </joey>
<connor> Kid comes in with a
fucking Bluetooth headset, </connor>
<connor> "Dad, I've already started
making $10,000 an hour </connor>
<connor> from drop-shipping online. </connor>
<connor> You know, the fact that
you're working at your job </connor>
<connor> is actually kind of cringe, Dad." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like, we're gonna have
a whole generation of kids </connor>
<connor> raised like this. </connor>
<connor> This is tragic.
- Yeah, I know. </connor>
<connor> - Or in fucking kindergartens, </connor>
<connor> like putting down what they
wanna be when they grow up, </connor>
<connor> and everyone puts entrepreneur. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Entrepreneur. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dad's like, "What do you
want for Christmas, son?" </garnt>
<joey> "Dad, why haven't you invested in my 401k? </joey>
<joey> This is embarrassing." </joey>
<joey> - So when you grow up,
where would you like to go? </joey>
<connor> Silicon Valley. </connor>
<connor> It's the only destination. </connor>
<joey> - It's fucking absurd. </joey>
<joey> It's so stupid, man.
- Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - I can't stand it.
- Just do what you want, man. </joey>
<joey> Just do what you want. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of really
funny stuff though on there, </joey>
<connor> but you have to siphon and
shovel through so much shit </connor>
<connor> to find some good TikToks and Shorts. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I just wait for them </joey>
<connor> to eventually get onto Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, if they make their
way on YouTube compilations </garnt>
<joey> or Twitter, </joey>
<garnt> which is how I consume most of my TikTok, </garnt>
<garnt> because I did actually try
downloading TikTok the other day </garnt>
<garnt> and I gave it a go. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, "Oh, it's just..." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have enough
patience for the algorithm </garnt>
<garnt> to find what I really like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there's so much
shit you go through. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's so weird </garnt>
<garnt> seeing some of the TikToks that are there. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember going
through anime TikTok, right, </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I am an anime YouTuber by trade. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder what anime TikTok is up to. </garnt>
<connor> - That was your first mistake. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Asking that question. </garnt>
<joey> - So there was this like
really, really weird trend </joey>
<joey> that was going on, </joey>
<joey> which is the silhouette
trend or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck.
- I remember that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay, </joey>
<connor> so you know what I'm talking about? </connor>
<connor> - I know what you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> - Well, where these girls or
guys would basically pretend </connor>
<garnt> that they were making out </garnt>
<garnt> with a silhouette of a
character or something, right? </garnt>
<connor> And one of the-
- That shit's funny. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just like, it's 100% serious. </connor>
<connor> - It's ironic.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - It's ironically funny.
- Oh, I thought it was a joke. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no.
- No, no, it's 100%. </garnt>
<connor> - It would be funny if it was a joke. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was a joke.
- It's 100% serious </connor>
<connor> where you just pretend </connor>
<connor> you're making out with someone, right? </connor>
<garnt> And it's like, there's no irony to it. </garnt>
<garnt> It is just that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember I was browsing anime TikTok </garnt>
<garnt> I saw a clip which had
millions and millions of views </garnt>
<garnt> on this clip, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's this girl who's
pretending to make out </garnt>
<garnt> with a silhouette of Bakugo. </garnt>
<garnt> And they literally put
in sound clips of the dub </garnt>
<joey> to make it seem like he's
in a dominating fashion </joey>
<joey> for this TikTok.
- Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like, "I
must be getting old," </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember if you did this </joey>
<joey> when I was an anime fan growing up, </joey>
<joey> you'd get bullied for this shit. </joey>
<joey> - You would get crucified. </joey>
<garnt> - Like this is the type of shit </garnt>
<garnt> people got internet bullied for, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I like the JoJo pose one,
where it's like, "JoJo." </connor>
<garnt> - JoJo pose, that one was cool. </garnt>
<connor> - That one was cool.
- That's cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Some of them are insane.
- Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> because there was either people </garnt>
<connor> who were just really good at JoJo posing, </connor>
<connor> but then there were other
people who took that </connor>
<connor> and put a spin on it </connor>
<connor> with all sorts of different
anime and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> That's fine. </connor>
<connor> But that shit is the
same as like, you know, </connor>
<connor> like laughing at those </connor>
<connor> is the same as laughing
at, back in the day, </connor>
<connor> of watching people proposing at anime cons </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, that trend of video, </connor>
<connor> it's just like kind of coming back, </connor>
<joey> but now it's just on TikTok now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just so weird </joey>
<garnt> seeing these things
trending and being popular </garnt>
<garnt> because I just remember thinking, wow, </garnt>
<garnt> this is so much different
to being an anime fan </garnt>
<connor> when I was fucking growing up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they re-post anime
scenes and play different music, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "What is this? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna watch this shit." </connor>
<connor> I've seen this re-post
of this one anime scene </connor>
<connor> a million times, </connor>
<connor> and it's some samurai versus a lumberjack. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - And they're fighting each other. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And I've seen this scene re-posted </connor>
<connor> on YouTube and TikTok and
stuff a million times. </connor>
<connor> I still don't know what it's from, </connor>
<connor> but I've seen this fight,
like a million times. </connor>
<connor> And it's always on TikTok, I don't get it. </connor>
<joey> - Is it good at all? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Okay, well, that's fine. </connor>
<joey> - But that's it, they
just keep re-posting it. </joey>
<connor> I don't get it. </connor>
<joey> - At least it's not the samurai
and lumberjack making out, </joey>
<connor> right, in the silhouette
challenge. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, it could be.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Next TikTok idea. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, maybe we should do it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's free real estate, take it. </connor>
<connor> - We'll do the silhouette challenge. </connor>
<connor> - It gave me the same reaction as, </connor>
<connor> you know that animation of
Sonic and Mario making out? </connor>
<connor> - I love that one.
- (laughs) I love that one. </connor>
<connor> - That's a great fucking clip, bro. </connor>
<connor> - It's so funny. </connor>
<garnt> - That one has so many
layers to it though, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean?
- It's the fiery passion </connor>
<connor> at which Mario and Sonic are making out, </connor>
<joey> and Sonic rips off Mario's shirt </joey>
<joey> in such a passionate way </joey>
<joey> that makes me feel like they are in love. </joey>
<joey> - It's so funny.
- It's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - God, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, man, like I
tried dallying in TikTok </joey>
<joey> because Aki uses TikTok quite a bit. </joey>
<joey> - We sound like Boomers here. </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to get an
understanding of these kids here, </joey>
<connor> but I just can't do it.
- I tried it, I tried it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I saw it was getting so big, </connor>
<connor> so I was like, "Alright,
well, then, you know." </connor>
<connor> Because it is getting so big, </connor>
<connor> there might be a chance one of these days </connor>
<connor> where I might have to
start using it, right? </connor>
<connor> - I scrolled through it </connor>
<joey> and I just feel like I'm losing my mind. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - I feel like my mind is going
numb, watching this stuff, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's so fast-paced. </joey>
<connor> You don't get a chance to do anything. </connor>
<connor> You don't get a chance to think. </connor>
<connor> You're just, "Alright, next, next, next. </connor>
<joey> - It's like literally </joey>
<joey> just constantly just
watching Instagram stories. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I can't do it. </connor>
<joey> It's too much information.
- I never felt like </joey>
<joey> I was in like a "Black Mirror" thing </joey>
<joey> until I was watching
YouTube Shorts and TikTok, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're not even
watching the videos, </joey>
<connor> you're just consuming the videos. </connor>
<connor> And you scroll to the next
one, scroll to the next one. </connor>
<connor> You don't even think, you
just scroll, keep scrolling. </connor>
<joey> And on YouTube, at least
you have that thing of like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, I'm gonna look what I wanna watch. </joey>
<joey> Oh, doesn't look good. </joey>
<joey> Okay, refresh the homepage. </joey>
<joey> Alright, refresh the homepage." </joey>
<joey> You know, you have to actually think </joey>
<connor> what you're about to watch. </connor>
<connor> But on TikTok and Shorts,
they just feed it to you </connor>
<connor> and you don't think. </connor>
<connor> It's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Like I feel like we're
getting to the point </connor>
<garnt> where content is being
forced down your throat. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not where you're choosing
to watch what you want. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right, right.
- It's very strange. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's some content on TikTok </connor>
<connor> which was just so weird </connor>
<joey> 'cause it was almost like hypnotic. </joey>
<joey> Because there's some content </joey>
<joey> that has just had obviously
millions of millions of views </joey>
<joey> and it's just some very
oddly satisfying thing </joey>
<connor> or something, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's so hard to describe why I was like, </connor>
<connor> not invested, but just
like, intrigued by it. </connor>
<joey> But I wouldn't call it
interesting content, </joey>
<connor> it was just like, "Ooh, that's a- </connor>
<connor> - Entranced, couldn't take your eyes away. </connor>
<joey> - That's a bit interesting. </joey>
<joey> Alright, and next. </joey>
<connor> Oh, okay, that's pretty good.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I was never emotionally
invested in any of this content, </connor>
<garnt> which is why it kind of felt
like almost hypnotic in a way. </garnt>
<joey> - Because it doesn't give you the time </joey>
<garnt> to get emotionally invested, right, </garnt>
<joey> because it's over in six seconds. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> The only funny TikToks I've seen </joey>
<garnt> have been TikToks that
have just made its way </garnt>
<garnt> into Twitter or YouTube compilations. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the thing, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, on TikTok, I don't
know what I'm doing wrong. </garnt>
<joey> How do I make-
- How do you TikTok? </joey>
<joey> - How do I make TikTok good? </joey>
<joey> I wanna know. </joey>
<garnt> I wanna know where to find a good content. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you can't search for anything. </garnt>
<joey> Like, you can, but you'd have
to sift through just like... </joey>
<connor> If you look up like a hashtag, right, </connor>
<connor> if you happen to find one, </connor>
<connor> or an audio file or something </connor>
<connor> that you thought was kind of
funny that's being used, right, </connor>
<connor> you can search for that. </connor>
<joey> But in order to find the actual good shit, </joey>
<joey> you just have to sift through
so much unrelated shit. </joey>
<connor> - I had a few audios
of mine get pretty big </connor>
<connor> from my YouTube videos. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like,
"What the fuck is this?" </connor>
<connor> Because it was like really bizarre things. </connor>
<connor> Like there was one where it was about me, </connor>
<connor> like sucking dick or
something, and cosplaying. </connor>
<garnt> And there were so many people
who used it to make TikToks, </garnt>
<garnt> I was so confused. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was like these
13-year-old kids being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "There's no time to talk. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to wear cosplay and
suck dick or something." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Is this okay? </garnt>
<garnt> What is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so confused." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Okay, uh, </garnt>
<joey> hopefully people don't watch my videos </joey>
<joey> 'cause some of these
kids are really young." </joey>
<joey> What the fuck?
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's funny though. It was cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've had a couple of TikToks </connor>
<connor> where they've used my audio. </connor>
<connor> - I like it though. I
think it's interesting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, it's really cool </connor>
<connor> because it's like, "Oh, you know, </connor>
<connor> that's kind of flattering that
they thought it was funny," </connor>
<connor> I think I said. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like a
dodo when I look at it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What's going on?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but at the same time,
I'm like, "That's cool." </connor>
<connor> But at the same time I
look at it, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Why are you doing this?" (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was thinking, </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Surely I've
said other things in audio </connor>
<connor> that are more entertaining
and more useful than this." </connor>
<joey> - Of all the things I've said, </joey>
<connor> you thought this was
the funniest? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's how
the internet is, right? </connor>
<connor> It just takes things off, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it weird. </connor>
<joey> - We don't know how to TikTok.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, have you ever legitimately
thought of being like, </joey>
<joey> "I need to start a TikTok"?
- Yeah, no. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's lots
of YouTubers right now </joey>
<garnt> who are starting TikToks now </garnt>
<joey> and kind of getting into it, right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I'm not convinced the TikTok audience is, </connor>
<garnt> well, the demographic I want. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I like the
demographic I have right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I like just chilling, doing
my own thing, streaming games. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I think we've grown up, </garnt>
<connor> we've made an audience
that like us for us, </connor>
<connor> luckily enough, and like
the content we make. </connor>
<connor> I don't feel like I need to move myself </connor>
<joey> on a different platform </joey>
<garnt> just because that platform
is getting popular, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's kinda like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we've definitely grown with... </joey>
<joey> Our audience has grown with us, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's kinda like why </garnt>
<garnt> I get so many messages about this, </garnt>
<garnt> about, "Garnt, why
don't you use Instagram? </garnt>
<garnt> Why don't you post more on Instagram?" </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Why don't you?
- Yeah, why don't you? </connor>
<connor> - It's the simple answer of </connor>
<connor> I'm shit at taking photos, okay? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I just forget to document my life. </connor>
<joey> I'm sorry, okay?
- I feel that, I feel that. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I get my
girlfriend to take photos of me </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm so shit at taking
photos of myself. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And it's just like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> you get brands coming
to you, being like, "Oh, </garnt>
<garnt> Instagram got the most
viewers and the most audience </garnt>
<connor> and the biggest numbers." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, well,
is that really valuable? </connor>
<joey> Just going on a platform </joey>
<joey> just because it's got big
numbers and a big audience? </joey>
<joey> As a content creator, </joey>
<joey> I find it's way more valuable, </joey>
<garnt> even if you're promoting
to a smaller audience, </garnt>
<garnt> that it's an audience
that is more suitable </garnt>
<garnt> for the stuff that you're making, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm not gonna make a TikTok
just because it's popular, </garnt>
<garnt> unless I think I actually like TikTok, </garnt>
<connor> or I think I can make good TikToks, </connor>
<connor> because otherwise I'm gonna
get a bunch of audience </connor>
<connor> that I don't understand.
- Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<connor> Why are you here? </connor>
<connor> - And then I will literally
be the Boomer then. </connor>
<connor> You know, and just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, let's connect with the kids. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's having a TikTok nowadays." </garnt>
<joey> - Here's my TikTok of me
making out with Bakugo. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Maybe I would take off that. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I could do it. </connor>
<joey> - Garnt making out with Bakugo. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> But you know who else has a TikTok </joey>
<joey> or who doesn't have a TikTok? </joey>
<connor> Our Patreons. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I tried to fucking use TikTok.
- That was a terrible outro. </connor>
<joey> Shout out to the Patreons that
are on the screen right now </joey>
<connor> who don't do terrible outros. </connor>
<joey> - I tried to somehow segue it from TikTok, </joey>
<joey> it just didn't work. </joey>
<joey> - That was the worst segue. </joey>
<joey> - That was probably the worst one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was like, you know
that group of audience members </joey>
<joey> that do this thing but
also don't this thing? </joey>
<joey> These guys. </joey>
<garnt> - Pretty sure you rode the segue </garnt>
<connor> and just fucking crashed
it into a train, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Crashed into the fucking wall. </garnt>
<connor> - Right off a cliff, I went. </connor>
<connor> But, hey, if you like to join the Patreon </connor>

pretty much the Boomer episode </garnt>
<garnt> of "Trash Taste."
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> We are getting old. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck, bro, I'm 25, man. </connor>
<garnt> Quarter of a century
old, I prefer to say it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow.
- Look at this baby. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at this baby. </garnt>
<joey> - I've probably aged mentally the most. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> you are the closest to death, man. </joey>
<joey> - I've been considering
getting a lawnmower </joey>
<connor> that I can sit on.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, </joey>
<connor> there are times where I'm like,
"That looks lit." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you know if I'm getting a lawn, </connor>
<joey> I'm getting a lawnmower I can sit on. </joey>
<joey> - Hell yeah, dude. </joey>
<connor> - With a slot for my TikTok phone enabled. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) So I can watch all the people </connor>
<connor> making out with Bakugo (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> as I'm mowing my lawn. </garnt>
<garnt> - On my OLED 4K phone. </garnt>
<connor> - You know the first time I felt old? </connor>
<connor> The first time I- </connor>
<connor> - It's like a bonus "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> - A bonus "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> We're over, but I just
need to say this, man. </connor>
<connor> The first time I got excited
about buying furniture, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Yep, it's over for me." </connor>
<connor> But now that I'm moving, </connor>
<garnt> goddamn, I'm so excited to
refurnish my place, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got a couch, oh. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, when that new
washing machine came in, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Dude, fuck the
hype I felt for all these games. </joey>
<joey> This is where the real
hype is that, dude." </joey>
<connor> Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm excited to cable manage. </connor>
<garnt> I can't wait to do it properly. </garnt>
<garnt> I've done it wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway- </garnt>
<connor> - Are you keeping up with us, kids? </connor>
<garnt> - Anyway, we'll continue this
on the next "Trash Taste" </garnt>
<joey> when we are moved in. </joey>
<garnt> - Thanks for watching, guys,
and we'll see you next time. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Everyone] Bye. </garnt>
<connor> (gentle music) </connor>
