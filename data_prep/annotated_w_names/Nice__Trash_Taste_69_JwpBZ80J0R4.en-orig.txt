<connor> collection item </connor>
<garnt> it needs to live why'd you have a mug </garnt>

<garnt> you asking for why are you asking for a </garnt>
<garnt> lid if you're not gonna drink coffee </garnt>
<joey> I do actually but also you know I think </joey>
<joey> of this mug as a collector's pieces </joey>
<garnt> should the viewers who bought it and it </garnt>
<garnt> should always have the lid on it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah you don't have like Santa Claus </garnt>

<garnt> mean like you don't have a trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> mug without the lid yeah but well you </garnt>

<garnt> cup right there and you have like a </garnt>
<connor> monster that's unused so get this out of </connor>

<joey> it half the coffee's on the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> mouth have you seen this man drink yeah </joey>
<joey> he's like he's like he doesn't know </joey>
<connor> where his mouth is it's gone is like a </connor>
<connor> like somebody like a person who used to </connor>
<connor> be a dog in like another life but just </connor>
<connor> never forgot how to like him he drinks </connor>
<garnt> like his mouth are you kidding me I </garnt>
<garnt> would love to be a dog in my next life </garnt>
<garnt> or this current life dogs have like the </garnt>
<garnt> easiest [ __ ] lives in existence dogs </garnt>
<garnt> and cats you just you just do nothing </garnt>
<joey> all day they piss [ __ ] and </joey>
<joey> Unconditionally Love that's all they do </joey>
<connor> right that's what a dog is I watched I </connor>
<joey> watched uh have we got it have we done </joey>
<garnt> our intro yet oh no yeah </garnt>
<joey> um hi this is the intro Joey's the host </joey>
<joey> yes hello Sonic fans I'm Joey welcome to </joey>
<connor> trash test I'm with gun Connor yeah it's </connor>
<connor> 69 this deserves hey </connor>
<joey> I texted Felix uh earlier when we found </joey>
<joey> out that this was episode 69 because uh </joey>
<garnt> little backstory so uh you know Felix </garnt>
<garnt> would be PewDiePie who we've been trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get on the show but I can't come to </garnt>
<garnt> Japan because you know obviously because </garnt>
<garnt> of the world situation so but we hoped </garnt>
<joey> that oh yeah you know by episode 69 </joey>
<joey> hopefully you know he would have been </joey>
<joey> able to come yeah obviously he couldn't </joey>
<joey> so uh I uh I texted him and said I'm </joey>
<garnt> sorry man like we didn't didn't he </garnt>
<garnt> didn't he like specifically say reserved </garnt>
<joey> episode 69. he was like Joey if I'm not </joey>
<garnt> on episode 69 I'm just not coming on </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember you telling me that </garnt>
<joey> in like episode two or three or </joey>
<joey> something just when trash day started </joey>
<joey> yeah and I'm just like are we even gonna </joey>
<garnt> be around 69 like oh we even can have an </garnt>
<garnt> audience by then I was like well I feel </garnt>
<joey> like she's very very like positive </joey>
<garnt> thinker so we're like thinking 65 </garnt>
<garnt> episodes ahead I was just like I </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't even like Envision episode 69 </garnt>
<garnt> because I was just like I'll be happy if </garnt>
<garnt> we can last a year yeah honestly </garnt>
<connor> honestly podcast it's weird to think </connor>
<joey> that we're probably gonna reach 100 </joey>
<joey> episodes </joey>
<joey> that's scary there's gonna be like which </joey>
<joey> episode of trash tasted this in oh it's </joey>
<joey> 179 actually yeah right that's weird to </joey>
<joey> think that that could be a thing scary </joey>
<connor> because when I see Joe Rogan it's like </connor>
<joey> episode 800 or something like yeah [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> but he doesn't he like record three </garnt>
<joey> episodes a week or something it's like </joey>
<connor> once every two days holy yeah like four </connor>
<joey> hours long yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I think I thought I run out of </connor>
<joey> topics to talk about yeah right oh my </joey>
<joey> God I like you know just sitting through </joey>
<joey> one episode of Joe Rogan really makes me </joey>
<joey> appreciate just how much [ __ ] A he knows </joey>
<joey> and B like how good he is at like </joey>
<joey> stretching out a single topic because </joey>
<joey> like no but seriously because like after </joey>
<joey> like 800 something episodes four hours </joey>
<connor> at a time right like you have to like I </connor>
<connor> feel like when you're very you do talk </connor>
<connor> about current topics and you very much </connor>
<joey> yeah but as well like even if it's not </joey>
<joey> current topics he's very good at like </joey>
<joey> kind of like really extensively like </joey>
<joey> going into a topic to the point where </joey>
<garnt> like you know a topic that can last </garnt>
<joey> maybe what 10 minutes on trash days can </joey>
<garnt> last up to an hour on the Joe Rogan show </garnt>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<joey> he's really cleaning out his content </joey>
<joey> we fit in here </joey>
<joey> no I mean you know when you're when </joey>
<joey> you're talking about politics you know </joey>
<joey> they suddenly turn what could be </joey>
<joey> two-minute conversations into 10 hours </joey>
<joey> that is true </joey>
<joey> are you [ __ ] kidding me are you </joey>
<joey> kidding me like I think the reason </joey>
<connor> people come to watch first East is to </connor>
<garnt> escape political knowledge I come to </garnt>
<garnt> trash day to escape </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like I just want to talk with </connor>
<connor> the boys everyone who talks about it I </connor>
<connor> feel like is not I feel like no one is </connor>
<connor> educated enough about it and no yeah and </connor>
<connor> so when everyone talks about it I'm like </connor>
<connor> I don't know which level of Education </connor>
<connor> you need in this topic but I feel that </connor>
<connor> no one has enough because everyone seems </connor>
<connor> to always have some [ __ ] argument </connor>
<connor> that I'm like what yeah what the [ __ ] is </connor>
<garnt> going on right like the problem the </garnt>
<connor> problem with like a lot of political </connor>
<connor> topics is that the trash Taste of marks </connor>
<garnt> oh are you gonna drink water no drink or </garnt>
<joey> coffee out of it sorry I bet you're </joey>
<joey> asking yeah I'll take the leads as well </joey>
<joey> give me the list no because I completely </joey>
<joey> agree because a lot of the times there </joey>
<joey> are some topics where you know you just </joey>
<garnt> genuinely don't know you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> which side to listen to because both </garnt>
<garnt> sides are just at each other's throats </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like I don't feel like </joey>
<joey> every time someone brings up some kind </joey>
<joey> of political like conversation because I </joey>
<joey> a just don't really care about politics </joey>
<joey> in general and B I'm again not </joey>
<connor> knowledgeable anymore you don't care </connor>
<garnt> about politics in general that's taking </garnt>
<connor> a stance in itself Joe yeah wow yeah </connor>
<connor> that's that's privileged </connor>
<joey> but like everything like it doesn't </joey>
<joey> matter what it is it could be like the </joey>
<joey> most far left thing you could be the </joey>
<joey> most far right thing and my only two </joey>
<joey> like answers is just oh that sucks or oh </joey>
<connor> that's good I guess I keep up with it </connor>
<connor> but I do also really despise the era </connor>
<joey> we're in where like it's like all like </joey>
<joey> everything is political yeah no no it's </joey>
<joey> not that everything's political it's </joey>
<garnt> like everyone has to be involved yeah it </garnt>
<joey> has to be educated in it right and </joey>
<joey> everyone needs an opinion I feel like </joey>
<joey> the main players are all just like </joey>
<connor> YouTubers and I'm like I don't trust </connor>
<garnt> YouTubers I'm a YouTuber I don't trust </garnt>
<garnt> other YouTubers I don't trust myself </garnt>
<garnt> across yourself I know what we're like </garnt>
<garnt> and I know for a fact that these people </garnt>
<garnt> cannot be that doing that good of a job </garnt>
<garnt> and when I listen to them I'm like okay </garnt>
<garnt> this is fine </garnt>
<garnt> you know to me it's like it's also been </garnt>
<connor> highly monetized now yeah like money has </connor>
<joey> become such a big player in it that I </joey>
<garnt> don't want to watch any of these people </garnt>
<garnt> on YouTube tell me about it that's true </garnt>
<joey> why they believe X person has no rights </joey>
<joey> or whatever because it's like you've got </joey>
<joey> a horse in in this race to talk about it </joey>
<joey> yeah you know you gotta if you've got to </joey>
<joey> get people angry and upset about it so </joey>
<joey> you can get dollars there's something in </joey>
<joey> it for you yeah yeah you know you know </joey>
<joey> which is why I also hate it a lot and I </joey>
<connor> also just don't really like talking </connor>
<connor> about it online because it's it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> show and also it is everyone has their </garnt>
<garnt> own opinions it is a [ __ ] show and like </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel like some some things are </garnt>
<joey> just better discussed in private with </joey>
<joey> the person because there's only there's </joey>
<joey> only so much you can say in 140 </joey>
<joey> characters on Twitter and that's </joey>
<joey> unfortunately where a lot of these </joey>
<joey> opinions are being spread and like that </joey>
<joey> it's easy to one misrepresent your own </joey>
<joey> ideas and two other people to </joey>
<joey> misrepresent ideas yeah it's just it </joey>
<joey> just seems like a lose-lose situation </joey>
<joey> for me too I like I don't know why it's </joey>
<connor> just so bad or why don't more people </connor>
<connor> just don't just agree that sometimes you </connor>
<connor> just aren't educated enough or you just </connor>
<garnt> don't know enough about a topic to just </garnt>
<connor> have an opinion yeah and you say that </connor>
<connor> and like you know it's very I feel like </connor>
<joey> there's so many things now where we just </joey>
<joey> have so much information on topics where </joey>
<joey> yeah okay maybe someone can some two </joey>
<joey> parties can present the same uh the </joey>
<joey> complete opposite uh argument but </joey>
<joey> there's enough information where they </joey>
<joey> can kind of both make their point </joey>
<garnt> because they have enough points that </garnt>
<garnt> work with one person and enough points </garnt>
<garnt> that work with the other it's like okay </garnt>
<garnt> well I can get educated on all of it and </garnt>
<garnt> then when you do try and educate </garnt>
<joey> yourself on everything in a certain </joey>
<joey> situation you just you just realize I </joey>
<joey> just hate all of this yeah that </joey>
<joey> everything is just [ __ ] and nothing </joey>
<garnt> works pretty much there's like the right </garnt>
<garnt> answer yeah yeah I I I've gotten to that </garnt>
<connor> point A lot of times where it's just </connor>
<garnt> like how do I fix this problem I have </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely no [ __ ] clue I don't even </garnt>
<garnt> know where to start the more I read the </garnt>
<joey> more depressed life and the rest of the </joey>
<joey> world is like first time </joey>
<garnt> no one knows the answer and that's why </garnt>
<garnt> we're arguing yeah yeah it's like the </garnt>
<joey> whole thing with like the uh you should </joey>
<joey> reduce your uh energy uh usage to help </joey>
<joey> combat global warming and then it's just </joey>
<joey> the whole thing of but then also like BP </joey>
<joey> is like spilling the entire oil supply </joey>
<joey> into like the the ocean and it's like </joey>
<joey> well I feel like I'm like not really the </joey>
<joey> problem I feel like it's not really me </joey>
<joey> yeah then you say that and people get </joey>
<joey> angry and then it's like what and then </joey>
<joey> you're like well change it we should we </joey>
<joey> should we should vote against these </joey>
<joey> companies but that's been proven that </joey>
<joey> that doesn't doesn't really [ __ ] work </joey>
<joey> half the time because clearly someone </joey>
<connor> makes a new rule with it that they can </connor>
<joey> go in the the whole game is busted so no </joey>
<joey> matter how many times you change the </joey>
<joey> rules it's just not gonna turn out to be </joey>
<connor> the game that they want to play it sucks </connor>
<connor> it sucks it all [ __ ] sucks it does </connor>
<joey> and that's why we don't talk about it it </joey>
<connor> always goes to the negative for me which </connor>
<garnt> is why I'm just like I'm on trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> with the boys I just wanna I just want </garnt>
<garnt> to shut off the internet for a while I </garnt>
<joey> want to talk about how I want to be </joey>
<connor> reincarnated as a dog yeah it's okay to </connor>
<garnt> stop caring you know this is too much </garnt>
<garnt> yeah too much because right now we're </garnt>
<garnt> just so overloaded with informations and </garnt>
<connor> things to care about right I literally </connor>
<connor> got to like [ __ ] myself if somebody </connor>
<connor> sneezed within two feet of me and now I </connor>
<connor> gotta worry about what's going on you </connor>
<connor> know in like multiple countries now I'm </connor>
<garnt> a UK I live in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> that's the biggest thing that's changed </garnt>
<joey> right because before everyone could </joey>
<joey> everyone only needed to care about what </joey>
<joey> was around them right and now being </joey>
<joey> people on the internet I have to care </joey>
<joey> about every thing going on globally and </joey>
<connor> it gets to the point where there are so </connor>
<connor> many different cultures so many </connor>
<connor> different so many different points of </connor>
<connor> view so many different like experiences </connor>
<connor> that each individual has had that </connor>
<joey> sometimes it's impossible for a lot of </joey>
<joey> people to get the same same like </joey>
<joey> viewpoint on things because even for us </joey>
<joey> who've lived in like multiple countries </joey>
<joey> and have had like experience with </joey>
<joey> multiple cultures like you can say we're </joey>
<joey> cultured ourselves that's like like well </joey>
<joey> like like saying saying this in like the </joey>
<joey> pure unironic sense because you get this </joey>
<joey> sense whenever I go home or whenever I </joey>
<joey> hear about any of us going home and you </joey>
<joey> see people who have stayed in their </joey>
<joey> hometowns and you see people who have </joey>
<joey> not left their hometowns and they have </joey>
<joey> the exact same Viewpoint that they got </joey>
<joey> raised on right and you know and coming </joey>
<joey> from the place you kind of you kind of </joey>
<joey> you you kind of understand how they got </joey>
<joey> that Viewpoint even though you don't </joey>
<joey> agree with it you know what I mean but </joey>
<joey> you can also understand that they don't </joey>
<garnt> have anything to really change their </garnt>
<garnt> Viewpoint in there because they've never </garnt>
<joey> experienced it there's nothing there's </joey>
<joey> no like new information that comes in to </joey>
<joey> like stimulate that change and thought </joey>
<joey> process so forever they just think well </joey>
<joey> this is correct because this is what was </joey>
<joey> what it was like around me I don't know </joey>
<joey> about anything else that's happening in </joey>
<joey> the world so this is just how I'm going </joey>
<joey> to see the world but then you know like </joey>
<garnt> for instance like I remember like when I </garnt>
<garnt> when I first came back to Australia </garnt>
<garnt> after I was living here and you know I </garnt>
<garnt> would go see like my friends and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like that who have been there like the </garnt>
<garnt> entire time like yeah I don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> things that I remember I used to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to like very heavily relate with and </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of almost agree upon I found </garnt>
<joey> myself to be like oh is this is this how </joey>
<joey> I is this how I felt like is this is </joey>
<joey> this really what my thought process was </joey>
<joey> like and it's like and it's so weird </joey>
<garnt> because like that didn't even happen in </garnt>
<garnt> that much of a large space of time like </garnt>
<garnt> that only maybe happened like two years </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm just living here and and I </garnt>
<connor> think you know like definitely like </connor>
<connor> doing YouTube and stuff like that has </connor>
<garnt> got me to interact with so many more </garnt>
<garnt> different nationalities and you know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know doing this job like you're </garnt>
<garnt> almost forced to be up to date with </garnt>
<garnt> everything that's happening in the world </garnt>
<joey> because you have people all over the </joey>
<joey> world who are viewing you right so yeah </joey>
<joey> I have this weird pressure of being like </joey>
<joey> you know I don't want this like one </joey>
<joey> person from this one country coming into </joey>
<joey> like my streams or whatever and being </joey>
<joey> like do you know what's happening in my </joey>
<joey> country right now and me going no I </joey>
<connor> don't yeah yeah you get that like what </connor>
<connor> do you think about the current </connor>
<connor> gentrification of uh Southeast uh Macau </connor>
<joey> and you're like what the [ __ ] it's like </joey>
<joey> I don't know but I know that what is </joey>
<connor> Macaulay yeah you get that a lot you're </connor>
<joey> like you're like you surely can't expect </joey>
<connor> me to have a horse in this race please </connor>
<connor> come on I'm just kidding people from </connor>
<garnt> okay I know I know </garnt>
<connor> but like that's the thing where it's </connor>
<joey> like you know you're almost like </joey>
<joey> pressured to be up to date on that kind </joey>
<garnt> of stuff because you don't want to leave </garnt>
<garnt> any of your viewers out and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that and so that causes you to just like </garnt>
<garnt> you know it absorbs so much information </garnt>
<garnt> about the world that when I go back to </garnt>
<joey> my hometown and I meet people who aren't </joey>
<joey> up to date on that kind of stuff who </joey>
<joey> have completely different viewpoints of </joey>
<joey> the world because the amount of </joey>
<joey> information that they've absorbed about </joey>
<joey> the world is on a different level it's </joey>
<connor> it's I don't know it's like it's it's a </connor>
<joey> bit of a whiplash yeah a couple of I </joey>
<connor> used to think like that that's kind of </connor>
<joey> weird I don't even know my own blood </joey>
<joey> type so I don't even expect people to </joey>
<joey> like learn about like the outside you </joey>
<joey> know how do people expect me to keep up </joey>
<connor> with like weird news in some country </connor>
<joey> I've never heard of I think you should </joey>
<connor> be the one to know your own blood type I </connor>
<connor> should I have a blood disease as well I </connor>
<joey> have a blood disease I don't know how </joey>
<joey> applied as well I don't know he's pretty </joey>
<joey> uh irresponsive yeah I think you also </joey>
<joey> had to do like a blood test here yeah </joey>
<joey> and you got show in your blood type yeah </joey>
<joey> having said that I don't know my blood </joey>
<joey> type either even though we're the same </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<garnt> I'm just as monkey brain as him </garnt>
<connor> apparently yeah I know it's in the </connor>
<joey> alphabet like it's one of them it's in </joey>
<joey> the out one of them it's one of the four </joey>
<garnt> one is your blood type Sigma </garnt>
<connor> Alpha Sigma Alpha decaf I don't know </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> I don't know you know and I I do you </connor>
<connor> know like you said you do try and </connor>
<connor> educate yourself on some things but </connor>
<connor> there's just like so many you know you </connor>
<garnt> can't be expected to keep up with </garnt>
<garnt> certain things like here's a question </garnt>
<garnt> then like do you feel like there's a big </garnt>
<garnt> difference between explaining to someone </garnt>
<garnt> that you know what kind of your </garnt>
<garnt> perspective and actually like having the </garnt>
<garnt> person really experience it and </garnt>
<garnt> empathize with you because I feel like </garnt>
<connor> those are two different things yeah you </connor>
<connor> know I I can I can sit here I could go </connor>
<joey> back to Wales and explain Japanese </joey>
<joey> culture all day and they just won't </joey>
<garnt> understand it exactly why would you why </garnt>
<garnt> would you do that why would you bow at </garnt>
<connor> every single every every word why would </connor>
<garnt> you say excuse me every September yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah to me it's kind of like very </garnt>
<garnt> similar to let's say learning a language </garnt>
<garnt> where you can explain a language you can </garnt>
<garnt> explain grammar structures and you can </garnt>
<garnt> explain you know how how the writing </garnt>
<joey> system stuff works but there's there's a </joey>
<joey> difference between understanding how a </joey>
<joey> language works and actually just </joey>
<joey> absorbing it and really getting a feel </joey>
<joey> for the language yourself yeah uh I </joey>
<joey> don't I know there's a word for it um </joey>
<joey> acquisition language acquisition right </joey>
<joey> this is just you know it was just like </joey>
<joey> learning how it works on a logical sense </joey>
<joey> and I feel like I feel the exact same </joey>
<joey> way when it comes to cultures and </joey>
<joey> perspective where there's been so many </joey>
<joey> times where someone has told me about a </joey>
<joey> perspective right and again you </joey>
<joey> logically like yeah I agree with that </joey>
<joey> you know you you know they could be </joey>
<joey> making the most sense but then you kind </joey>
<joey> of maybe move to the country that </joey>
<garnt> they're living in or you go travel there </garnt>
<garnt> or you meet more people from that same </garnt>
<garnt> culture and you're like I think I </garnt>
<garnt> actually get what you're talking about </garnt>
<connor> you know like yeah I think it's like you </connor>
<connor> know how you know when you're growing up </connor>
<garnt> and you hear about other countries and </garnt>
<garnt> you think oh it's that funny little </garnt>
<garnt> thing that country does you know like I </garnt>
<garnt> never I know like they would probably do </garnt>
<garnt> this about Japan a lot they would just </garnt>
<joey> show things like Superman they're like </joey>
<joey> oh isn't that isn't that so strange </joey>
<joey> there's big men in diapers </joey>
<joey> it's one of those things isn't it but I </joey>
<garnt> I think that when you get to experience </garnt>
<garnt> more cultures your mindset on on when </garnt>
<joey> you see stuff like that changes a lot </joey>
<joey> like you go from thinking oh that funny </joey>
<connor> thing that weird strange thing to think </connor>
<joey> I'm sure there's a story behind it I'm </joey>
<joey> sure there's a history I definitely felt </joey>
<joey> that especially after I started dating </joey>
<joey> Aki and you know through YouTube meeting </joey>
<connor> a lot of like Americans because like in </connor>
<connor> Australia the image of America is not </connor>
<joey> that glamorous or like positive in any </joey>
<joey> way like I'm just saying it's straight </joey>
<joey> up like you know like I don't think the </joey>
<connor> image of Americans with America is a lot </connor>
<joey> of Americans are often like the first </joey>
<connor> people to bash them right exactly I love </connor>
<garnt> you man yeah but like you know it all </garnt>
<garnt> depends on where they're from yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> depends yeah but like after you know </garnt>
<garnt> actually going to America and talking to </garnt>
<garnt> Americans and stuff like that that </garnt>
<garnt> completely flipped open and I realized </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's the problem was just kind of my </garnt>
<garnt> environment that was pushing that agenda </garnt>
<garnt> and the media that I consumed that was </garnt>
<joey> kind of pushing this sort of negative </joey>
<joey> agenda about American culture and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that but then when you actually go </joey>
<joey> and you live it out you see it firsthand </joey>
<joey> and you see everything else that they </joey>
<joey> don't show and you're like oh actually </joey>
<joey> it's not as like insane or wacky as like </joey>
<joey> the TV shows or the the [ __ ] my friends </joey>
<garnt> were talking about make it out to be you </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah but like I remember when I </garnt>
<garnt> first started dating Sydney right I </garnt>
<garnt> remember we uh like when we first when </garnt>
<garnt> we first met and first started dating I </garnt>
<garnt> remember early on because you mentioned </garnt>
<joey> this to me to me the other day I asked </joey>
<joey> her so would you like out of curiosity </joey>
<joey> what do you actually think about America </joey>
<joey> right and she was like greatest country </joey>
<joey> in the world and I I remember was she </joey>
<joey> dead asleep no no she was dead she came </joey>
<joey> from like imagine it she came from like </joey>
<joey> a small town in the midwest where yeah </joey>
<joey> when you first started yeah when I first </joey>
<joey> started dating five six years ago right </joey>
<joey> right seven years ago now actually </joey>
<garnt> well it was a long time ago I remember </garnt>
<garnt> that was the first time she had </garnt>
<garnt> basically like traveled out of America </garnt>
<garnt> and she came from a very small town in </garnt>
<garnt> the midwest who you know got got raised </garnt>
<garnt> with the values that you would expect a </garnt>
<garnt> small town to get raised in and I </garnt>
<garnt> remember she said oh yeah America is the </garnt>
<garnt> greatest country in the world obviously </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember apparently she said I was </garnt>
<garnt> just like like that </garnt>
<garnt> and she </garnt>
<joey> and she said uh she said to me at the </joey>
<joey> time she got like genuinely offended </joey>
<joey> right she like she she straight up she </joey>
<connor> she got like genuinely angry at me at </connor>
<joey> the time for doing that she was like </joey>
<connor> what do you mean why and why why did you </connor>
<connor> make that sound she said to me and I was </connor>
<connor> like so what constitutes the greatest </connor>
<joey> country yeah and why is America the </joey>
<joey> greatest country and she was like Oh </joey>
<garnt> Land of the Free isn't it we got freedom </garnt>
<joey> seconds I'm like you know because I was </joey>
<joey> about to say I was like if she's about </joey>
<joey> to drop the freedom bomb like I I don't </joey>
<garnt> know what I can say to that no because </garnt>
<garnt> it's to me at the time it was just like </garnt>
<joey> living up to the stereotypical patriotic </joey>
<joey> America because like yeah like you know </joey>
<joey> America is is a good country you know </joey>
<joey> but like my my issue is the more I </joey>
<joey> travel with more I'm just like is there </joey>
<joey> a greatest country in the world and </joey>
<joey> there's no way you can Define the </joey>
<joey> greatest country in the world otherwise </joey>
<joey> everyone will be living there yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly and to me patriotism as a </joey>
<joey> British person is just so weird like you </joey>
<joey> see it you I see like American </joey>
<connor> patriotism where </connor>
<connor> um you know not saying every American </connor>
<connor> like this but like especially some of </connor>
<connor> the some of the Americans I met who have </connor>
<connor> who were raised in small towns </connor>
<joey> especially when I go when I go back to </joey>
<joey> Sydney's Hometown it's just you you see </joey>
<joey> you see kind of like this culture and </joey>
<joey> this culture that's been uh and this </joey>
<joey> idea that's just been </joey>
<joey> propagated through the small town and </joey>
<joey> there's not not really been any other </joey>
<joey> perspective to really change that </joey>
<joey> perspective so by there by by their uh </joey>
<joey> by their like they properly Believe by </joey>
<joey> their belief they probably believe that </joey>
<joey> America is the greatest country in the </joey>
<joey> world uh and there is no other thing </joey>
<joey> that can challenge that and it's it's </joey>
<joey> just I like I can't blame them for that </joey>
<joey> you know I'm not even saying America </joey>
<joey> isn't the greatest country in the world </joey>
<joey> I'm just saying that because their </joey>
<joey> belief has been permeated so deeply that </joey>
<joey> there's been nothing to really break </joey>
<joey> that mold for them and it took years for </joey>
<joey> Sydney to really kind of change her </joey>
<joey> perspective it didn't take like just one </joey>
<joey> trip to England it took years for </joey>
<joey> traveling to uh to you know living with </joey>
<joey> me in England and leaving me with me in </joey>
<joey> Thailand and living with me in Japan for </joey>
<joey> her to like really open up her </joey>
<joey> perspective to be like you know what </joey>
<joey> maybe there are some other good places </joey>
<joey> in the world as well you know you know </joey>
<joey> maybe some other places do things yeah </joey>
<joey> that's good yeah and </joey>
<joey> um and now she has recently just gone </joey>
<joey> back to America to visit her family yeah </joey>
<joey> and she's like wow I uh I really don't </joey>
<joey> fit here there anymore really yeah </joey>
<joey> that's uh it felt weird because she told </joey>
<joey> me that she just didn't feel like as </joey>
<joey> settled as she used to be just because </joey>
<garnt> she she had like she feels like an </garnt>
<connor> outsider almost yeah yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> definitely got that when I was uh back </connor>
<connor> in Wales last time I don't know it's you </connor>
<connor> know I I love my hometown and I love my </connor>
<connor> friends but you definitely feel like </connor>
<garnt> because you've been doing so many things </garnt>
<garnt> and exploring so many different cultures </garnt>
<garnt> you definitely feel like God I must </garnt>
<garnt> sound like that weird [ __ ] Gap </garnt>
<connor> student who come back like yeah I've </connor>
<joey> traveled the world now I'm better than </joey>
<garnt> all of you because I really don't want </garnt>
<connor> to sound like that yeah I know but you </connor>
<connor> it does it does open your perspective a </connor>
<joey> lot and you do think like oh [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> it really does make you look at stuff in </joey>
<connor> your Tiny Town a lot different and uh </connor>
<connor> you know how how homogeneous it is the </connor>
<joey> Tiny Town just feels so much more tinier </joey>
<connor> yeah weirdly and and it's like and you </connor>
<connor> know again like I don't blame like </connor>
<connor> Sydney or anyone from like the small </connor>
<connor> town to think think that way because </connor>
<connor> again like I feel especially in America </connor>
<connor> it really is just like kind of enclosed </connor>
<connor> when it comes to the information that </connor>
<connor> you can get about the rest of the world </connor>
<connor> like it still blows my mind that like </connor>
<connor> like in America for example like 24-hour </connor>
<joey> news channels are a thing yeah but it's </joey>
<joey> not world news it's American News yeah </joey>
<joey> for 24 hours and I'm like what it's just </joey>
<joey> insane to think like this for one </joey>
<joey> there's so much news happening in </joey>
<joey> America that you can just constantly run </joey>
<joey> news stories but also like there's just </joey>
<joey> so little access or ease of access to </joey>
<connor> information outside of America same in </connor>
<joey> the UK though really we get like we get </joey>
<garnt> trickle downs from America we don't </garnt>
<garnt> really see a lot of inside America like </garnt>
<garnt> we you know a lot of British people </garnt>
<joey> don't really know many of the states </joey>
<joey> outside of the very famous ones oh well </joey>
<joey> I'm sure it's the same in Australia </joey>
<joey> that's all the stuff like that and we </joey>
<connor> have very rudimentary knowledge of uh </connor>
<joey> outside of Europe really do you guys </joey>
<joey> have like world news on your TV yeah we </joey>
<connor> do we do yeah but like world news is </connor>
<connor> just mostly </connor>
<connor> but it's mostly the Middle East conflict </connor>
<connor> that yeah </connor>
<connor> stuff that we had a hand in </connor>
<connor> it's rare that we hear anything about </connor>
<connor> Japan or Asia in general that's like </connor>
<connor> something massive welcome to the </connor>
<connor> Olympics normally yeah yeah yeah because </connor>
<joey> BBC scarcely reports on Japan like I </joey>
<joey> have the BBC app and I said like the </joey>
<joey> Japan section they don't do like an </joey>
<joey> article every like three days on Japan </joey>
<joey> oh really it would be very it'd probably </joey>
<joey> be quite high profile stuff in Japan </joey>
<joey> yeah very wacky wow if they open up a </joey>
<joey> new store with M M's whoa whoa yeah but </joey>
<joey> uh also I do think as well the fact that </joey>
<joey> a lot of people think one of the reasons </joey>
<joey> why people really think America is </joey>
<joey> terrible is uh you know in the UK and </joey>
<joey> also in Japan I feel this as well a lot </joey>
<joey> of this like </joey>
<joey> bad stuff and injustices if you will in </joey>
<joey> the UK and I I think Japan as well </joey>
<joey> probably don't get as much </joey>
<joey> Spotlight as they do in America and also </joey>
<joey> everything is [ __ ] filmed in America </joey>
<joey> sure literally everything is on camera </joey>
<joey> in America so like I feel like it's way </joey>
<joey> easier to catch the stuff that makes </joey>
<garnt> your country look [ __ ] insane yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah when when you know there's cameras </garnt>
<joey> all the [ __ ] time capturing </joey>
<joey> everything and I feel like one of the </joey>
<joey> main reasons why we see so many insane </joey>
<joey> stuff for America looks good you hear </joey>
<connor> about all these horrible injustices that </connor>
<connor> have been done is because there's just </connor>
<connor> so much video and there's so much uh </connor>
<joey> attention brought to it by the media I </joey>
<joey> mean it's also as well the fact that </joey>
<connor> like you know just simply the population </connor>
<connor> differences one thing as well but it's </connor>
<connor> also again it's just like that whole </connor>
<connor> cultural mentality or I guess like group </connor>
<joey> mentality of like it's me versus the </joey>
<joey> world you know not so much because like </joey>
<joey> you know it's very much an </joey>
<joey> individualistic Society where it's like </joey>
<garnt> I'm the center we have that in the UK as </garnt>
<connor> well I think the UK way more I think </connor>
<joey> it's definitely like that's definitely </joey>
<garnt> one of the biggest difference between </garnt>
<joey> East and West that I felt living in both </joey>
<joey> different places yeah yeah and like you </joey>
<joey> know whereas in Japan it's like oh I </joey>
<joey> don't I don't want to stick out too much </joey>
<joey> because otherwise the camera might get </joey>
<connor> stuck on but it's hard right because on </connor>
<connor> one hand you get you get a society where </connor>
<garnt> you know everyone's comfortable nobody </garnt>
<garnt> nobody ever accepts their boundaries but </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's [ __ ] miserable so exactly </garnt>
<garnt> so it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you know you can't have the this utopian </garnt>
<connor> ideal Japan without also being very </connor>
<joey> having a depressed society and I feel </joey>
<joey> that's like the problem right now is </joey>
<joey> that like yeah regardless of if you're </joey>
<joey> an individualistic Society versus a </joey>
<joey> collective Society there's still [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> that happens like the stuff I love about </connor>
<connor> the UK is also I'm near certain the </connor>
<garnt> stuff that I love what is also the </garnt>
<garnt> reason why we have a lot of the stuff I </garnt>
<garnt> don't like about this yeah yeah exactly </garnt>
<joey> uh you know I mean same thing with Japan </joey>
<connor> right yeah yeah so it's you don't you </connor>
<joey> don't get the good things not bad things </joey>
<garnt> there's no there's no perfect country I </garnt>
<connor> think there's no perfect country and I </connor>
<connor> don't think there's a place Denmark's </connor>
<garnt> just like hello </garnt>
<joey> but also I love that I saw I read an </joey>
<joey> article that was like people who live in </joey>
<joey> Denmark that are unhappy are extremely </joey>
<joey> unhappy because they're supposed to be </joey>
<joey> the happiest country on earth right yeah </joey>
<joey> so the people who get sad there or their </joey>
<joey> life isn't going the way they want they </joey>
<joey> feel more depressed because they're </joey>
<joey> supposed to be in because everyone </joey>
<joey> around them is happy especially in the </joey>
<joey> happiest place on Earth you can't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] win like no matter what goes </joey>
<joey> wrong you can't win but I think </joey>
<joey> obviously if you know that that also </joey>
<joey> depends on you know if you can afford to </joey>
<joey> be healthy and all that stuff so that </joey>
<joey> all changes yeah and being healthy is </joey>
<connor> pretty good huh this is sponsored by </connor>

<garnt> are you guys patriotic </garnt>
<joey> only in like sport I guess yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> well like pretty much the most patriotic </garnt>
<connor> I get is towards sports but like you </connor>
<connor> have to like okay so I think well </connor>
<connor> whale's patriotic and and being in the </connor>
<garnt> UK is a very different uh but how many </garnt>
<garnt> times how often does you get to be </garnt>
<joey> patriotic about Wells anytime England </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up that's basically right </joey>
<joey> basically yeah honestly that's what I'm </joey>
<garnt> saying it's not a it's not patriotism in </garnt>
<garnt> Wales is not like the rest of the world </garnt>
<garnt> patriotism </garnt>
<connor> it's just [ __ ] England yeah I feel like </connor>
<connor> that's just literally that's just the </connor>
<garnt> way or Scotland and Irish like uh </garnt>
<connor> Northern Irish yeah patriotism that's </connor>
<garnt> that's why I feel like UK patriotism is </garnt>
<garnt> a completely different brand to other </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because because it's you know we </garnt>
<garnt> get very proud of Welsh people obviously </garnt>
<garnt> but we get the most proud when it when </garnt>
<joey> it is to the detriment of England yeah </joey>
<garnt> so you know and people like oh you're </garnt>
<garnt> like English though right it's like no </garnt>
<joey> I'm not even I don't know there's </joey>
<garnt> actually nothing about me that is </garnt>
<garnt> English </garnt>
<garnt> I'm British and Welsh but not English </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so a lot of people always like yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's English right that's it no no no </joey>
<joey> no I despise but but I only I despise in </joey>
<garnt> a very fun way you know yeah it's very </garnt>
<joey> much like uh yeah yeah there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> fun stories yeah banter right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> if you watched Archer the TV show uh </joey>
<joey> little bits of yeah yeah there's a </joey>
<connor> really weird thing that just completely </connor>
<connor> could be caught me off guard so </connor>
<joey> um they did an episode about like a very </joey>
<joey> very famous Welsh event that happened </joey>
<joey> and it was very weird that Archer an </joey>
<joey> American Comedy TV show did this yeah so </joey>
<joey> there's a thing called uh true Adam in </joey>
<joey> Wales right and uh it's a small town </joey>
<joey> that no longer exists okay because uh </joey>
<joey> Liverpool which is a city in England </joey>
<joey> yeah uh wanted a reservoir so their </joey>
<garnt> solution to getting a reservoir was to </garnt>
<garnt> just flood this town </garnt>
<joey> so they could get water holy [ __ ] I [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you not so they had to evacuate they </joey>
<joey> literally just made people just move wow </joey>
<joey> okay and whilst people weren't allowed </joey>
<joey> to vote on whether this was yeah so they </joey>
<joey> had no say they'd know say right so they </joey>
<joey> just flooded this town called true Adam </joey>
<garnt> and turned it into reservoir turned out </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't even need it in the end </garnt>
<garnt> and they they killed like four people as </garnt>
<garnt> well because some people refused to </garnt>
<garnt> leave holy [ __ ] so they they flooded it </garnt>
<garnt> you can go there it's depressing as [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> because they're just like buildings </joey>
<joey> underneath this Reservoir and there's a </joey>
<joey> bunch around the areas a ton of like </joey>
<joey> remember remember try out and stuff like </joey>
<joey> that and it's just it's seen as one of </joey>
<joey> the most like injustices that were done </joey>
<joey> to Wales yeah that's pretty it's fairly </joey>
<garnt> pretty shitty fairly recent as well how </garnt>
<garnt> recently talking I think 60s can you </garnt>
<connor> Google it it's like 60s 80s around that </connor>
<garnt> time I think just throw out in tried for </garnt>
<joey> sure that's just the plot to hear us yes </joey>
<garnt> didn't you higarashi they're like gonna </garnt>
<joey> build a dam and then they'll like </joey>
<connor> protests so English people could drink </connor>
<joey> water and then they didn't even use it </joey>
<joey> like it's it's like what the [ __ ] and </joey>
<garnt> then also Archer just did an episode </garnt>
<joey> about it that's so weird they did a </joey>
<connor> whole thing of like they were like yeah </connor>
<garnt> wow that's something everyone needs to </garnt>
<garnt> care about that is something yeah you're </garnt>
<garnt> all educated on the true Adam I mean </garnt>
<connor> that's the very basic story there's a </connor>
<garnt> lot more yeah other people can tell I </garnt>
<garnt> feel like when you're from a small </garnt>
<garnt> nation that just doesn't get a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> attention from the world media in </garnt>
<connor> general because that's that's me </connor>
<connor> whenever like Thailand gets mentioned </connor>
<connor> anywhere right like like I I I'm just </connor>
<connor> happy if like Thailand is just brought </connor>
<garnt> up in any kind of capacity everyone </garnt>
<connor> everyone knows my country now that's uh </connor>
<connor> I love it though they get like insanely </connor>
<connor> excited and like anything happens like </connor>
<joey> they're just insane it's great I I </joey>
<connor> remember passionate about anything yeah </connor>
<connor> right I remember when I went to a con in </connor>
<connor> Singapore uh they're like shouting at </connor>
<connor> you in public yeah no no no no yeah that </connor>
<connor> one but like I remember I did a I did a </connor>
<joey> panel there and I literally all I </joey>
<joey> literally said was hello Singapore and </joey>
<joey> I've never heard a crowd of people like </joey>
<joey> crying and screaming </joey>
<joey> it was as if like [ __ ] Elvis Presley </joey>
<joey> came on stage and like said their </joey>
<joey> country's name and it's like he said </joey>
<joey> honestly the singable convention was </joey>
<joey> like crazy </joey>
<connor> I mean I wasn't invited I was just there </connor>
<connor> for them </connor>
<connor> we weren't tired at this point well I </connor>
<garnt> wasn't you know we we knew each other </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> he's like I'm gonna pop down to </joey>
<joey> Singapore yeah no the guy literally </joey>
<joey> texted me and was like oh you're in </joey>
<joey> Singapore finna popped down for a quick </joey>
<garnt> second yeah it's it's so weird sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> where what we are as Southeast Asians </garnt>
<garnt> are proud of sometimes because like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I swear to God every time I meet a </garnt>
<garnt> fellow Southeast Asian from a different </garnt>
<garnt> country yeah we get competitive over </garnt>
<garnt> like the weirdest things right because </garnt>
<garnt> the first thing we compare is </garnt>
<garnt> um how [ __ ] it is driving our roads yeah </garnt>
<connor> like I don't know why we do that it's </connor>
<connor> like yo you're still alive why is just </connor>
<garnt> like oh this one time in Bangkok I was </garnt>
<garnt> in traffic for one hour oh when I oh you </garnt>
<garnt> think one hour's bad when I was in </garnt>
<joey> Jakarta it was a three-hour traffic jam </joey>
<joey> once I'm just like thinking about this </joey>
<joey> I'm just like why are we comparing why </joey>
<joey> would this is like the weirdest dick </joey>
<garnt> size comparison I can think of oh you </garnt>
<joey> survived two car crashes yeah I survived </joey>
<joey> four </joey>
<joey> it's like that's not something to be </joey>
<garnt> proud because I was just like I caused </garnt>
<garnt> all of them because after living in two </garnt>
<garnt> years Sydney just went around to other </garnt>
<garnt> people being like you know Thailand has </garnt>

<joey> amazing is the fact that [ __ ] that </joey>

<connor> I liked uh </connor>
<joey> Midwest is pretty chill where have you </joey>
<joey> been in the midwest I really like </joey>
<joey> Minnesota Minnesota really probably my </joey>
<joey> favorite state I've been to in the US I </joey>

<connor> were really really nice though when they </connor>
<joey> were deporting you though no they were </joey>
<joey> nice because they weren't nice about it </joey>
<joey> at least they were like hey it's not </joey>
<joey> your fault man it happens all the time </joey>
<joey> kind of thing but you also have to uh </joey>
<joey> fly immediately to Amsterdam and then </joey>
<connor> from Amsterdam you're allowed to see why </connor>
<connor> you got deported is that like something </connor>
<joey> you want to talk about oh just Visa </joey>
<connor> Mix-Ups basically I mean like for the </connor>
<connor> wrong Visa right yeah basically I had </connor>
<joey> the wrong Visa apparently I asked the uh </joey>
<joey> the immigration officer in Minnesota he </joey>
<connor> was like yeah this this happens all the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] time so it's like it's like you </joey>
<connor> are definitely not in the wrong for not </connor>
<connor> knowing this [ __ ] like it is really </connor>
<joey> confusing </joey>
<joey> um but he's like just go home get this </joey>
<joey> particular visa and then you'll be good </joey>
<connor> for like the next 10 years </connor>
<joey> cool thing you're deported yeah until </joey>
<garnt> you get deported yeah yeah I'm sure </garnt>
<joey> getting deported wasn't cool you know </joey>
<joey> getting the portal wasn't cool but the </joey>
<garnt> fact that I literally Flew Around the </garnt>
<joey> World in 48 hours yeah you just did a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] Speed Run I did basically speed </joey>
<joey> ran like around the world yeah what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] what the [ __ ] took them 80 Days the </connor>
<connor> first time you know what I mean that's </connor>
<connor> what you did too </connor>
<joey> around the world deportation hack </joey>
<joey> I used the deported skip right here </joey>
<joey> the first time I went to the US I didn't </joey>
<joey> know you needed the Visa right I was </joey>
<garnt> like what </garnt>
<connor> so so what happened we didn't need a </connor>
<garnt> visa before no we did we needed the </garnt>
<garnt> Esther that was introduced pretty </garnt>
<joey> recently yeah the yesterday before the </joey>
<garnt> yesterday you didn't need it yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> first time went to America you didn't </garnt>
<joey> need an Esther how long ago was it </joey>
<joey> Esther was like 10 15 years ago or </joey>
<garnt> something like that it was within my </garnt>
<garnt> lifetime that the uh that the the </garnt>
<connor> legislation changed well because you </connor>
<connor> know you've been traveling through </connor>
<joey> Europe all my life and I just assumed </joey>
<joey> you just turned out where you want to go </joey>
<joey> with oh yeah I mean yeah so I didn't </joey>
<joey> know that and so I booked my flight to </joey>
<joey> the US this is when the Esther was a </joey>
<joey> thing yeah uh which is [ __ ] because </joey>
<joey> America can come to the UK no no no </joey>
<joey> documentation needed just a passport oh </joey>
<joey> really when we when we have to go to </joey>
<joey> America we have to get this esta </joey>
<joey> nonsense right yeah so I'm I'm getting </joey>
<joey> all my stuff ready this is my first </joey>
<joey> flight ever to America I'm on my own oh </joey>
<joey> my God and then it's like midnight and </joey>
<joey> then my flight's at like 9 A.M my dad my </joey>
<joey> dad came in my room he's like did you </joey>
<joey> get the visa I'm like what </joey>
<joey> what do you mean yeah you're gonna get a </joey>
<joey> Visa who no one told me this how do I </joey>
<joey> get the visa about I'm like 19 as well </joey>
<garnt> because I'm like I've never heard of </garnt>
<joey> this yeah when do I have to get a Visa </joey>
<garnt> yeah and luckily uh apparently switch to </garnt>
<garnt> get it three days before yeah three days </garnt>
<garnt> uh but yeah like more than three days </garnt>
<joey> before yeah but luckily it came in 15 </joey>
<connor> minutes yeah yeah I was very lucky I </connor>
<connor> also did that in Japan as well that was </connor>
<joey> very yeah Aki had to do that at the </joey>
<joey> airport once because like she realized </joey>
<garnt> her Esther had run out because you just </garnt>
<joey> have a really [ __ ] track record at uh </joey>
<connor> getting into country so yeah I just I'm </connor>
<joey> losing your passport before we go to </joey>
<connor> Japan oh yeah I remember that I totally </connor>
<connor> forgot because it only lasts for two </connor>
<joey> years when you go to the US you have to </joey>
<joey> get uh from most countries and also </joey>
<joey> Canada if you get one too yeah if you </joey>
<joey> just apply for a thing called Nesta cost </joey>
<joey> fifteen dollars you do it online if your </joey>
<joey> passport is like normal yeah like no </joey>
<joey> criminal record or anything you should </joey>
<joey> get it in like 15 minutes yeah like </joey>
<joey> immediately but do it three days just in </joey>
<joey> case that's why I suggest you </joey>
<joey> um yeah and it lasts two years and when </joey>
<joey> I moved to Japan I was going to go to </joey>
<joey> San Francisco and I totally forgot it </joey>
<joey> expired until I was on the way to the </joey>
<joey> airport when I was realized it had </joey>
<joey> expired so I was applying for it on my </joey>
<joey> phone yeah on the way and luckily right </joey>
<connor> before I was about to check in I just </connor>
<joey> got it and so nice I was like nice </joey>
<joey> that's gold split right there yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> I told my company I'm like uh hey uh I </connor>
<connor> forgot to uh get the esta they were like </connor>
<joey> what what and I was like yeah so uh I </joey>
<joey> applied for it it should be fine we'll </joey>
<joey> see we'll see we'll see </joey>
<joey> luckily it all worked out at least yeah </joey>
<joey> at least you weren't like on the plane </joey>
<connor> when you realized that yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's weird though because they don't ask </connor>
<connor> me for it and they don't ask me for the </connor>
<connor> they don't ask you for the Esther at any </connor>
<connor> point so I wonder is it just on like a </connor>
<joey> system they only ask you for it when </joey>
<joey> you're immigrating into the country that </joey>
<garnt> you just landed no they they asked they </garnt>
<connor> they should what what uh airline did you </connor>
<connor> fly with I'm British Airways they never </connor>
<connor> they've never asked me for it because </connor>
<connor> because I normally get asked when I'm </connor>
<garnt> queuing up to check in if if I have a </garnt>
<garnt> Visa yeah they never ask me that because </garnt>
<connor> maybe I'm just so Charming they're like </connor>
<garnt> no no go in go ahead </garnt>
<connor> excuse me sir do you have a visa to get </connor>
<connor> into our country this is really my </connor>
<joey> privilege right now [ __ ] no but like I </joey>
<joey> like especially coming from uh having </joey>
<joey> having dual citizenship in a UK and </joey>
<joey> Thailand yeah it's just like it just </joey>
<garnt> makes me realize man we are very </garnt>
<garnt> privileged to have certain passports </garnt>
<garnt> because it is literally just some </garnt>
<connor> passports are completely useless and you </connor>
<connor> need yeah Japan is like the most OP </connor>
<joey> passport it's the most powerful possible </joey>
<joey> in the world yeah but no but only like </joey>
<connor> 20 people have them here can you believe </connor>
<joey> that yeah they're [ __ ] audacity and </joey>
<joey> also yeah it's there's there's so many </joey>
<joey> like weird other rules that come with it </joey>
<joey> and also and again it's like yeah as you </joey>
<joey> were saying it's the most powerful </joey>
<joey> possible in the world and yet barely any </joey>
<joey> Japanese people fly out of Japan because </joey>
<joey> the tourism industry here is just so </joey>
<connor> powerful yeah </connor>
<garnt> I completely forgot I was just gonna say </garnt>
<connor> that some some possibles are like pretty </connor>
<connor> op and uh like that's that's that makes </connor>
<garnt> me jealous of your Japanese passport </garnt>
<garnt> because you can get in like what what </garnt>
<garnt> can Japan get in without a Visa that the </garnt>
<joey> UK can't I'm sure there's something </joey>
<joey> wrong place </joey>
<connor> I don't think about this but I think </connor>
<joey> like in the UK it's something like 70 to </joey>
<connor> 80 people have a passport in America </connor>
<garnt> it's like yeah it was so weird for me </garnt>
<garnt> going to a country and just like meeting </garnt>
<garnt> people without a passport yeah everyone </garnt>
<connor> just has one in the UK yeah everyone I </connor>
<joey> know has one yeah in Australia as well </joey>
<joey> like almost everyone has one yeah yeah I </joey>
<connor> guess I guess it's just like a </connor>
<garnt> difference in culture right yeah like I </garnt>
<connor> couldn't imagine not having a passport </connor>
<connor> what are you going to go and do in the </connor>
<connor> UK just go to like a field and be like </connor>
<garnt> sick this is great vacation or I could </garnt>
<garnt> and also get a passport go to another </garnt>
<connor> country and go to that field yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly but like you know there's in our </garnt>
<garnt> beaches sure as someone who's born up in </garnt>
<connor> Brighton so we have amazing beaches you </connor>
<garnt> want sand beaches no we got we've got </garnt>
<connor> Stone Stones because you can't even walk </connor>
<connor> in it UK tourism is the most depressing </connor>
<connor> thing on earth like it's just [ __ ] what </connor>
<joey> would you recommend to someone who's </joey>
<joey> never been to the UK I when people come </joey>
<joey> to the UK </joey>
<joey> no no no go to London it doesn't think </joey>
<joey> you're right is that the reason why I </joey>
<joey> think the UK works is a tourist </joey>
<joey> destination is because you don't know </joey>
<connor> anything about it yeah you know about </connor>
<joey> the UK it's it's terrible place I think </joey>
<joey> most people's imaginations of the UK is </joey>
<joey> the queen Harry Potter and the three </joey>
<connor> things if you go to London you get a </connor>
<joey> very sanitized view of London of the UK </joey>
<joey> and you can have a great time because </joey>
<joey> you only see London and London is like </joey>
<joey> very well kept the Charming part yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's very well you know I love them all </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] money's in London I'd say </garnt>
<garnt> some some of the country sides are </garnt>
<connor> pretty good as well yeah I really </connor>
<garnt> appreciate it when I meet people who </garnt>
<connor> like love castles and love going around </connor>
<garnt> whales and stuff like that I'm like nice </garnt>
<garnt> honestly if you want to go to the </garnt>
<garnt> countryside though I'd say Ireland is </garnt>
<joey> better Ireland's [ __ ] beautiful I've </joey>
<joey> been to the country </joey>
<garnt> Wales is good patriotism showing there </garnt>
<connor> yeah I remember when I I first found out </connor>
<joey> that people just didn't live near </joey>
<joey> castles I thought that was weird when I </joey>
<joey> first found that out yeah I lived near </joey>
<connor> three castles growing up and I was like </connor>
<joey> so you're like out of context that </joey>
<joey> sounds so [ __ ] privileged why what </joey>
<connor> what are you gonna do with it well it's </connor>
<connor> not my castle </connor>
<joey> but that's the thing like it's like it's </joey>
<connor> like that if you said that to a Japanese </connor>
<joey> person they'd be like what are you like </joey>
<connor> the Prince of Wales no it's because you </connor>
<connor> know you there's so many [ __ ] castles </connor>
<connor> in the UK one of them was very dangerous </connor>
<connor> and run down and like climbing it was </connor>
<connor> just like a safety hazard I don't know </connor>
<connor> how it's still allowed you're allowed to </connor>
<connor> go right dude but you know there's </connor>
<connor> there's one really cool castle near me </connor>
<joey> it's like called I feel whales to </joey>
<joey> castles is very much Japan to Temples </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah maybe you know because like I </joey>
<joey> think if you said to someone who has </joey>
<joey> like no idea of like Asian culture or </joey>
<joey> anything like that and said like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> there's like three temples around my </joey>
<joey> house they'd be like whoa you [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> bougie Japan did have a lot of castles </connor>
<joey> they were just burnt down well yeah most </joey>
<joey> of them are gone uh there is one in </joey>
<connor> there's a really big one in what Kochi </connor>
<connor> there's a massive one yeah a lot of them </connor>
<connor> though are Recreations yeah yeah they </connor>
<connor> were like built much much later I think </connor>
<connor> there's only like a handful of castles </connor>
<joey> like from that time that are still </joey>
<connor> standing a lot of the ones in the UK are </connor>
<connor> run down as well like the the out of the </connor>
<joey> three near me one of them is well kept </joey>
<joey> and that's mainly for tourist reasons </joey>
<joey> right and the other two are completely </joey>
<connor> run down and just like but it's cool </connor>
<joey> that it's a bunch of rubble but you can </joey>
<joey> buy that right like you can purchase </joey>
<connor> that as property </connor>
<garnt> normally the big ones you can't they're </garnt>
<connor> normally Heritage sites so you can't buy </connor>
<garnt> them they're like public and at that </garnt>
<garnt> point people who buy just buy four Flex </garnt>
<garnt> because who actually lives in the castle </garnt>
<connor> nowadays I believe I read something </connor>
<connor> about France or something as the most </connor>
<connor> abandoned castles and the most castles </connor>
<connor> for sale out of it like any country oh </connor>
<connor> really apparently you can just buy </connor>
<connor> chateaus and castles oh all nonsense </connor>
<connor> that's pretty bougie all right you say </connor>
<garnt> you say UK is good for travel or I've </garnt>
<connor> never said that well what did you say </connor>
<joey> you say come to the UK then just go to </joey>
<connor> London go to London okay well okay </connor>
<connor> genuine question someone someone's </connor>
<garnt> coming to travel to the UK you want to </garnt>
<garnt> show them you want to show them British </garnt>
<connor> culture what did you take them to first </connor>
<connor> of all the one question you have to ask </connor>
<garnt> someone who comes to the UK do you drink </garnt>
<garnt> do you drink yeah of course and if you </garnt>
<garnt> don't you're gonna have a bag because </garnt>
<garnt> you have you have you either have you </garnt>
<joey> can have it if you love a beer and you </joey>
<joey> love drinking with people you can have a </joey>
<joey> two-week trip and you have a great time </joey>
<joey> yeah if you don't drink alcohol it's a </joey>
<joey> three-day criteria you're not doing </joey>
<joey> alcohol I hope you like castles I might </joey>
<connor> you know I genuinely think because you </connor>
<connor> can do nearly everything in London </connor>
<garnt> that's worth seeing in one day like one </garnt>
<garnt> or two days one or two two two shows </garnt>
<connor> right but but you know like all the </connor>
<connor> major things are within walking distance </connor>
<garnt> each other do you take them to like the </garnt>
<garnt> tourist tourist sites and everything </garnt>
<connor> like that yeah very fast and like his </connor>
<joey> booking in Palace have a look all right </joey>
<joey> here's the Big Ben have a look at [ __ ] </joey>

<joey> but you know normally it's like you want </joey>
<joey> to see Big Ben we can go and drink in </joey>
<joey> the park in front of Big Ben yeah and do </joey>
<joey> that yeah that's cool you know there's </joey>
<connor> the arcade that's now closing it's </connor>

<garnt> only part of like British food that I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like yep afternoon tea [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> slaps </joey>

<connor> the fact that we have some of the best </connor>
<connor> beaches in the world like because </connor>

<connor> like you want to see it's like Sydney </connor>
<connor> Opera house </connor>
<connor> I'm not an alcoholic but it's just the </connor>
<garnt> culture </garnt>
<connor> that's kind of why I wanted to move out </connor>
<connor> of England because it just felt like if </connor>
<connor> you didn't drink then there was nothing </connor>
<garnt> else to do to have fun or like just just </garnt>
<connor> like it's a big thing no one no one does </connor>
<joey> anything on weekdays in the UK like </joey>
<joey> weekdays are strictly for working and </joey>
<joey> then going home and being pressed that's </joey>
<connor> all you do now I feel that's no one goes </connor>
<joey> out in the UK it's always the weekend </joey>
<joey> oh really even like even after work no </joey>
<connor> no one really goes out really yeah I I </connor>
<connor> it's normally older people they normally </connor>
<connor> will go after the pub after work when </connor>
<connor> they're like 40s because they because </connor>
<garnt> they're there well I would have you know </garnt>
<garnt> some people go to the pub after work oh </garnt>
<joey> I know I I if I've worked an office I </joey>
<joey> would love to go but I was a YouTuber no </joey>
<joey> one wanted to go out in the weekdays </joey>
<joey> right right it was an absolute uphill </joey>
<joey> battle trying to get people to do </joey>
<joey> anything in the UK you have to wait till </joey>
<joey> the weekend yeah so I never did anything </joey>
<joey> during the weekend I just worked on </joey>
<joey> videos I think and played video games I </joey>
<joey> don't really know what I did I don't </joey>
<joey> know what I did in London what did I do </joey>
<joey> what did I do in London I don't know I </joey>
<connor> went to Coffee we have really good cafes </connor>

<connor> compared to Europe we aren't we were in </connor>
<joey> Europe you guys are Europe we were </joey>
<joey> Europe well we're not we're not in </joey>
<garnt> Europe anymore because it's easy to get </garnt>
<garnt> stuff from like Italy and whatever </garnt>
<garnt> that's true that's true it's just that's </garnt>
<garnt> one thing I miss about that sucks about </garnt>
<joey> Japan is that importing anything from </joey>
<joey> Europe is like 20 times the price well </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like a block of cheese that I </joey>
<connor> would pay 10 pounds for on the UK </connor>
<connor> imported from France isn't that which is </connor>
<joey> seen as like a luxury expensive it's the </joey>
<connor> first time I was in Australia it's like </connor>
<connor> literally other side of the planet it's </connor>
<joey> depressing I I bought a wine bottle and </joey>
<joey> I looked at it and it was like 30 pounds </joey>
<joey> in the UK yeah and it was like 90 pounds </joey>
<garnt> here in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah [ __ ] which is which is like such a </garnt>
<joey> like flip to whenever well when </joey>
<joey> someone's going to come visit us in </joey>
<joey> Japan because like you like I like when </joey>
<joey> a friend comes to visit in Japan you're </joey>
<garnt> just like what kind of experience do you </garnt>

<connor> a [ __ ] mate from school or whatever </connor>
<connor> yeah then I used to do this thing where </connor>
<joey> I would take them to all these places </joey>
<joey> but then pretend I couldn't speak a word </joey>
<joey> of Japanese just to piss them off </joey>
<joey> because I was like I don't want to be </joey>
<joey> the translator this week so you know </joey>

<connor> missed one I thought Akihabara was like </connor>
<garnt> super fun and amazing as well well </garnt>
<connor> because all the figures you know that </connor>
<joey> the prices are always cheaper elsewhere </joey>
<joey> I've just found that the more the the </joey>
<joey> more times I've gone to alkabra the more </joey>
<connor> I realize that there's just so much cool </connor>
<connor> hidden [ __ ] there that really if you're </connor>
<connor> not there with someone who knows the </connor>
<joey> area really well it really just does </joey>
<joey> seem like here's the place to buy anime </joey>
<joey> figurines he's the buy here's the place </joey>
<garnt> to buy Wings yeah I just don't have the </garnt>
<connor> time to explore it anymore yeah that's </connor>
<connor> true also nearly all the restaurants </connor>
<connor> I've been to in Akihabara are like </connor>
<garnt> severely disappointed awesome I mean </garnt>
<garnt> it's awful awful </garnt>
<garnt> I've had probably the worst meals in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan consistently yeah yeah same I </garnt>
<connor> don't know why I think because it's just </connor>
<connor> on the front and then you know </connor>
<joey> everyone's like come and ask all well </joey>
<joey> that's the thing it's like no one really </joey>
<joey> like no one really thinks to themselves </joey>
<joey> all I want a really nice meal let's go </joey>
<connor> to Arkansas I hate the maids who are </connor>
<joey> like come on please please please yeah </joey>
<connor> that is really annoying and they're like </connor>
<connor> eagle dies your beer and I'm like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> off </joey>
<joey> then get this </joey>
<garnt> I'm British I say to my head I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> please leave me alone human interaction </garnt>
<joey> get get out of here get out get out of </joey>
<joey> here let's be gone fast </joey>
<joey> trouble </joey>
<connor> one time we walked past and there was a </connor>
<connor> maid that was like Joey remember that no </connor>
<connor> you're there she started like screaming </connor>
<joey> look at one of the mates what the mate </joey>
<joey> well who recognized me yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> how do you remember this </joey>
<joey> actually what happened was I was with </joey>
<joey> you we were walking and I saw the girl </joey>
<joey> looking at you yeah and we kept on </joey>
<joey> walking and then I just heard her go </joey>
<joey> Joey oh yes and you I feel like you </joey>
<connor> didn't pay any attention you like </connor>
<connor> whatever and just kept walking and then </connor>
<joey> I was like I do remember that actually </joey>
<joey> because it's like yeah I heard her say </joey>
<joey> my name but I thought like I didn't hear </joey>
<connor> it as my name until I walked past her </connor>
<connor> and then a process I was like I think </connor>
<connor> she was calling my name but then at that </connor>
<connor> point it was too late to like turn </connor>
<garnt> around and be like me I don't want to be </garnt>
<joey> that guy right yeah it's like I'll just </joey>
<garnt> be the cool guy just keep walking I just </garnt>
<joey> I I feel so unguarded whenever I get </joey>
<joey> recognized in Japan yeah right what what </joey>
<joey> there's uh it really changes me off yeah </joey>
<joey> it's really scary because I don't know </joey>
<joey> like one it's surprising to hear someone </joey>
<joey> speak English as well here and just or </joey>
<joey> just on the streets and to like someone </joey>
<joey> who speaks English and also recognizes </joey>
<joey> you and especially I think since trash </joey>

<garnt> be like 70 million people calling me </garnt>
<garnt> Grant and I'm just like I'm not gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> able to tell the difference like if </garnt>

<garnt> think my name is Grant people at the </garnt>

<joey> this the place where you were talking </joey>

<joey> cashiers recognize me it's not very </joey>
<connor> exciting huh </connor>

<connor> appreciates the you know the 800th </connor>
<joey> Century I'm not a messenger I'm not like </joey>
<joey> here to convey messages for you right I </joey>
<joey> got recognized one time at a midnight on </joey>

<joey> outside my house to the gym right it was </joey>
<joey> perfect it was 24 hours as well so it's </joey>

<joey> hoodie in the back just like oh [ __ ] and </joey>

<connor> used to get recognize a lot obviously </connor>
<connor> yeah every time I should go with you </connor>
<joey> there it was like I always thought </joey>
<joey> that's where my people are I feel like </joey>
<connor> Aki Harbor is like a cheat code right </connor>
<connor> because that's like saying you got </connor>
<connor> recognized at an anime convention yeah </connor>
<connor> because also I can have a surprisingly </connor>
<connor> what has like the most uh like </connor>
<joey> foreigners yeah it does and obviously I </joey>
<garnt> mean it's it's one of the most like you </garnt>
<garnt> know sensationalized like whack people </garnt>
<garnt> look at places around Tokyo but uh I was </garnt>
<garnt> recognized I get recognized pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> every time I go to our car bro but the </garnt>
<garnt> one time I uh went to you know I was </garnt>
<garnt> like running a little running a little </garnt>
<connor> short on my on my hentai but uh hold </connor>
<connor> might pop into a melon books which is a </connor>
<connor> store where you can buy hentai and uh </connor>
<connor> and uh you know peruse the the goods oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] are you the anime man yeah and as I </connor>
<connor> was perusing through some stuff I got a </connor>
<joey> tap on the shoulder and it's like are </joey>
<connor> you Joey I'm like I thought it's gonna </connor>
<connor> be like the longest sections </connor>
<joey> the wrong thing placement and he's like </joey>
<joey> yeah well I'm like yeah I am high and I </joey>
<joey> was like oh no dude like although like </joey>
<joey> and I was like holding a Dodge and I was </joey>
<joey> about to buy as well and I'm like worst </joey>
<connor> timing and and you know he had like a </connor>
<connor> bag as well so he obviously just like </connor>
<connor> finished at the cash register and the </connor>
<connor> guy was like what are you doing here I'm </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] do you think I'm </connor>
<connor> doing here I jack off like really are </connor>
<connor> you are you sure you're a fan of me </connor>
<connor> because if you are you would know </connor>
<connor> exactly what I am doing here I am </connor>
<garnt> holding the thing I am about to buy you </garnt>
<garnt> can see that so I'm like so all I said </garnt>
<garnt> was just </garnt>
<garnt> just buying some hentai </garnt>
<joey> and it's like oh so sick dude all right </joey>
<garnt> bye I just walked out it's just like </garnt>
<joey> what kind of interaction can you have in </joey>
<joey> that place because I I have exactly the </joey>
<garnt> same experience because the place I </garnt>
<joey> can't recognize the most is that yeah </joey>
<joey> I'd be recognized like three times in a </joey>
<joey> melon books and I'm like why what is it </joey>
<connor> just like a dojin store yeah </connor>
<joey> basically when Sydney is just like </joey>
<connor> running out of ideas for Content she </connor>
<connor> just goes there yeah and she's like oh </connor>
<connor> just this and then the cash was like </connor>
<garnt> it's gone with you </garnt>
<joey> yeah melon books and Toronto are like </joey>
<joey> the two like big big hints I still is </joey>
<connor> now bro I always get recognized and I </connor>
<connor> have I haven't been recognized often but </connor>
<joey> when I do it's always when I look like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it's never it's never when I've </joey>
<joey> made an effort to look good it's never </joey>
<joey> in the JoJo suit you know it's never </joey>
<joey> when I've got my drip game on yeah it's </joey>
<joey> when I'm on the [ __ ] sweating </joey>
<garnt> how often are you interested </garnt>
<garnt> Sainsbury's near me which is just a </garnt>
<garnt> normal Supermarket yeah yeah and I was </garnt>
<joey> wearing sweatpants flip-flops you know </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] which I actually don't even </joey>
<joey> normally do that I would normally I </joey>
<joey> would normally put the effort into our </joey>
<joey> jeans yeah yeah actually no I lie no </joey>
<joey> it's just back when I thought that </joey>
<garnt> wearing jeans was a luxury </garnt>
<garnt> if I was working why is it a luxury it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't work so I okay actually I scored </garnt>
<garnt> a detour because it was a [ __ ] story </garnt>
<connor> anyway I basically recognizes sweatpants </connor>
<garnt> it's not funny is this why you uh had to </garnt>
<joey> be refused to wear wash jeans because </joey>
<connor> it's the luxury no no no no no that's </connor>
<joey> not a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> so I had this thing for a very long time </joey>
<joey> well this isn't this isn't a meeting </joey>
<joey> this is a general thing I used to just </joey>
<joey> only wear like sweatpants when I was at </joey>
<joey> home if I wasn't leaving the house I </joey>
<joey> wouldn't wear jeans I would just wear </joey>
<connor> sweatpants I still do that but now I </connor>
<connor> changed my mind and now I only wear </connor>
<joey> jeans in the house what how do you how </joey>
<joey> do you bring yourself to do that I do </joey>
<connor> that what because what happened was is </connor>
<garnt> that I started just feeling like [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like not working right so I was </joey>
<connor> like me maybe if I like dress like I'm </connor>
<garnt> not a slob I might work a little better </garnt>
<garnt> oh you laugh but it's it's a real </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] thing it actually works like I I </garnt>
<garnt> always I wear jeans not because I want </garnt>
<joey> to but because it's the only way I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna look so when you wearing when </connor>
<connor> you're wearing a pair of jeans nicely </connor>
<connor> they feel like better than anything I I </connor>
<garnt> feel like my day hasn't started until </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I try to work like an American </garnt>
<connor> fighting for freedom I just haven't </connor>
<garnt> started my day until I put on my denim </garnt>
<garnt> jeans honestly like so sometimes I try </garnt>
<joey> to work and I'm in like sweat pounds or </joey>
<joey> sometimes just in my [ __ ] boxes </joey>
<joey> because I just I sleep in my boxes and I </joey>
<joey> just don't get anything done right </joey>
<joey> because I put on my jeans the day I </joey>
<joey> started I am ready to work I don't know </joey>
<joey> man I just wake up and go time to work </joey>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> if you go mine doesn't matter man yeah </connor>
<joey> but if you go to jeans just work harder </joey>
<joey> yeah it just get worse you know in like </joey>
<joey> one time I even went so far as to start </joey>
<joey> wearing like nice shirts like like a </joey>
<joey> suit shirt but yeah but suit shirts when </joey>
<joey> I was making videos because I was like I </joey>
<joey> was convinced that this is the next step </joey>
<joey> to increasing my productivity yeah it </joey>
<joey> turned that didn't work and I hated it </joey>
<joey> yeah right but I I I found the happy </joey>
<connor> medium but jeans and a shirt I felt like </connor>
<connor> if I can dress enough are we talking </connor>
<joey> like a t-shirt or like a college shirt </joey>
<connor> not like this okay yeah but like I think </connor>
<connor> the sweatpants were the the big big </connor>
<garnt> player because I basically got to the </garnt>
<garnt> mindset of I want to wear outfits that I </garnt>
<joey> could just go out to any social </joey>
<joey> Gathering or I can wear this to anywhere </joey>
<joey> you know right right and so I felt like </joey>
<joey> it helped my productivity so if you work </joey>
<connor> at home a lot and you've you've gone </connor>
<connor> into hell out of sweatpantsing all the </connor>
<garnt> time you know maybe just try wearing </garnt>
<connor> what you would wear to work but what </connor>
<connor> what okay well what would you do during </connor>
<connor> the summer then </connor>
<connor> like full on jeans </connor>
<joey> AC blasting I mean I I wear whatever I I </joey>
<joey> would wear to the trash days office okay </joey>
<joey> that's basically like my dress code at </joey>
<joey> home but like I would never wear </joey>
<connor> anything too comfy I guess because if </connor>
<connor> Comfort is the enemy of productivity </connor>
<garnt> well you can see if I'm in sweatpants I </garnt>
<garnt> just like I feel like I should be in my </garnt>
<joey> bedroom or yeah no I get that watching </joey>
<joey> TV one thing I do one one thing I do do </joey>
<joey> in the morning to like get me into like </joey>
<connor> the work mode if I'm at home all day is </connor>
<connor> that I don't wear like my pajama shirt I </connor>
<connor> like change to a different shirt you're </connor>
<connor> a pajama shoot yeah just like old shirts </connor>
<connor> that I don't wear shirts to bed why do </connor>
<garnt> you do that </garnt>
<connor> why people do this because I don't want </connor>
<connor> to be naked because I just it just feels </connor>
<connor> like boxes just boxes I don't know it </connor>
<connor> just doesn't feel comfortable yeah it </connor>
<joey> feels like a it feels like unless I'm in </joey>
<garnt> a sleeping bag I don't have enough cover </garnt>
<joey> over me yeah I feel really bare yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and unprotected like like boxes I </garnt>
<joey> love I love using the body parts it's </joey>
<connor> temperature control so I put some out I </connor>
<connor> put some in you know depending on the </connor>
<garnt> how much how cold the high needs to be </garnt>
<garnt> okay but do you okay do you wear boxes </garnt>
<connor> to bed yeah sometimes naked sometimes </connor>
<garnt> boxes see I like I need to wear boxes to </garnt>
<garnt> bed sleeping like completely naked just </garnt>
<connor> feels weird it's nothing used to thing </connor>
<connor> you know because the nut sack is a very </connor>
<joey> delicate thing to kind of like </joey>
<connor> your nuts go everywhere and sometimes </connor>
<connor> they're more elastic than other times so </connor>
<garnt> it's a way sometimes you just don't want </garnt>
<garnt> you're not sack rubbing against your leg </garnt>
<garnt> you know like I don't know like for me </garnt>
<joey> you're not so huge that they're like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sack of potatoes </joey>
<connor> when when I'm not wearing a shirt to </connor>
<garnt> sleep it just feels weird to feel my own </garnt>
<garnt> skin on my skin no I get that like like </garnt>
<garnt> you know you know it's it's exactly the </garnt>
<connor> same like the only time I will you've </connor>
<connor> been like brainwashed the other time the </connor>
<joey> only time where I will go to bed without </joey>
<joey> a shirt on is if it's like </joey>
<joey> excruciatingly hot to the point where </joey>
<joey> like even the AC on blast isn't gonna do </joey>
<garnt> it for me yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like I need some fabric on me to </garnt>
<joey> stop myself </joey>
<joey> it's an Embrace </joey>
<garnt> you're like lightly embraced by the </garnt>
<garnt> shirt it's like it's like an extra layer </garnt>
<garnt> of skin that uh you're not uh that </garnt>
<connor> sounded really like epitome </connor>
<connor> I feel like you're just like making me a </connor>
<joey> very shitty reason as to why you weren't </joey>
<joey> sure to bed it's comfortable end of </joey>
<connor> story I just I don't understand why </connor>
<garnt> you'd feel uncomfortable okay another </garnt>
<garnt> thing sometimes sometimes if I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> wearing a shirt my body gets even hotter </garnt>
<garnt> right because you have like a natural </garnt>
<garnt> body temperature and if it's like skin </garnt>
<garnt> on skin sometimes it like it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a loop system where it like </garnt>
<garnt> warms itself up a bit more I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if that's </garnt>
<connor> surely the shirt keeps in the skin uh </connor>
<garnt> the heat more no no I mean like </garnt>
<garnt> insulation works both ways right like if </garnt>
<garnt> you put if you put a if you put a jacket </garnt>
<garnt> on a snowman right and it's it's it </garnt>
<garnt> insulates the heat in it it's nice like </garnt>
<joey> they actually they actually say to </joey>
<joey> preserve body heat like in like super </joey>
<joey> cold temperatures when you sleep it's </joey>
<joey> actually better to sleep naked than to </joey>
<joey> wear something </joey>
<joey> she seems like a lot more effort to be </joey>
<joey> wearing close to bed like why are you </joey>
<joey> complicating it effort yeah just but </joey>
<joey> just go naked how hard is it to put a </joey>
<connor> shirt on for you I just think why are </connor>
<connor> you adding shirts into an equation that </connor>
<connor> doesn't need it you know </connor>
<joey> so then when you start you know you </joey>
<joey> start doing the business you know you </joey>
<joey> just throw the shirt off yeah yeah oh </joey>
<garnt> that just seems like a lot of work I'm </garnt>
<connor> always I'm always ready it's two seconds </connor>
<connor> when you jack off do you wear a shirt </connor>
<joey> depends where I am </joey>
<garnt> I I it's never really a part of the </garnt>
<garnt> equation of jacking off I'm just like do </garnt>
<connor> I have my shirt on what I feel like I'm </connor>
<joey> like the Michelin Man when I'm jacking </joey>
<joey> off wearing a shirt I feel like I'm like </joey>
<joey> constricted I'm like [ __ ] hell like </joey>
<joey> get the [ __ ] off </joey>
<garnt> are you [ __ ] bulk up when you've I </garnt>
<garnt> mean have you never done the business </garnt>
<connor> with a shirt on I have I don't like it </connor>
<garnt> it feels like I'm I'm like um in some </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like constriction </garnt>
<connor> I don't like it at all you don't like it </connor>
<joey> no it feels stretchful I don't mind it </joey>
<garnt> no sometimes you need to like you know </garnt>
<connor> sometimes it's not the reason why you </connor>
<connor> know in porn they don't take this they </connor>
<connor> take the shirt off you know it's because </connor>
<joey> you want to get like that's because </joey>
<joey> they're on [ __ ] camera mate yeah but </joey>
<joey> are you on camera it might be yeah I </joey>
<joey> don't know what I'm Into You </joey>
<joey> Next sponsor </joey>
<joey> but also it's like you know when you're </joey>
<connor> pooping sometimes you have to take your </connor>
<joey> shirt off yeah yeah but that's more of </joey>
<joey> just like if same kind of energy well </joey>
<joey> that's the thing because it's intense </joey>
<garnt> okay no no not every poop needs to say </garnt>
<garnt> you need to take a shot I prefer if </garnt>
<joey> possible yourself you know when you wake </joey>
<joey> up I'm you know when you wake up right </joey>
<connor> and you're the first poop do you take </connor>
<connor> the shirt off when you do are you just </connor>
<garnt> right no I keep it on the poop like the </garnt>
<connor> shirt taking off poops are for the poops </connor>
<joey> that like fight back yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's when like you need to like like you </garnt>
<garnt> you need that extra push those are the </garnt>
<joey> poops that are like no I'm staying here </joey>
<connor> the ones in the morning are kind of just </connor>
<joey> like all right I generally you prefer to </joey>
<joey> just take it off while I poop anyway why </joey>
<joey> not not like during the day if I'm like </joey>
<joey> out in like a public restaurant </joey>
<joey> Connor goes for a proof and just like </joey>
<joey> you'd like to takes off like the JoJo </joey>
<connor> soon </connor>
<connor> takes off the tie takes off the shirt </connor>
<connor> and I'd still poop faster than gone </connor>
<joey> I don't know it's just like a placebo </joey>
<joey> right it's like I just feel more </joey>
<joey> comfortable wearing a shirt to bed I </joey>
<connor> don't know what it is I think you've </connor>
<connor> known after yourself in what way have we </connor>
<garnt> nerfed ourselves how I feel like you've </garnt>
<connor> nerfed cure yourself because I can I can </connor>
<connor> poop without any requirements you know </connor>
<connor> what it also is it doesn't sound like </connor>
<connor> that because it sounds like the </connor>
<connor> requirement is that you need to take a </connor>
<connor> shirt off </connor>
<garnt> that's that's literally a requirement we </garnt>
<connor> we I can sleep naked I just prefer to </connor>
<connor> have a shirt if you're stranded without </connor>
<garnt> a shirt then I'll sleep with my show </garnt>
<connor> he's here before planning the whole time </connor>
<garnt> here's the reason as well though because </garnt>
<garnt> like I've actually experienced this </garnt>
<garnt> where like I in the middle of the night </garnt>
<garnt> we're in Japan right earthquakes right </garnt>
<garnt> they happen all the [ __ ] time right </garnt>
<connor> if there's a massive earthquake in the </connor>
<connor> middle of the night I don't want to be </connor>
<connor> that weirdo running out of my house butt </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] naked </connor>
<connor> I'm not Jason Bourne I don't need to be </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ready for combat situations </connor>
<connor> every [ __ ] night I haven't got a </connor>
<connor> drawer full of passports ready to go in </connor>
<connor> because I need to be deported you know I </connor>
<connor> I this t-shirt is on the floor this one </connor>
<connor> extra second of putting on the t-shirt </connor>
<connor> which I can do on the way to the </connor>
<joey> elevator or some [ __ ] you know I don't </joey>
<joey> need to on the way to an element in an </joey>
<connor> earthquake well I nothing is I'm not </connor>
<garnt> walking downstairs I just have this like </garnt>
<garnt> mental image of just like if if an </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake happens when Conor is either </garnt>
<joey> sleeping or on the toilet it's just </joey>
<joey> gonna be that scene from Borat all over </joey>
<joey> again </joey>
<joey> if I'm [ __ ] in the middle of an </joey>
<joey> earthquake I'm Taking My Chances I'm </joey>
<joey> gonna carry on doing what I'm doing I'm </joey>
<joey> not why would I run out I'm I feel like </joey>
<joey> running out is just a stupid idea just </joey>
<connor> stay in your house maybe yeah if you die </connor>
<joey> you die </joey>
<garnt> foreign </garnt>
<connor> specific situation no of course like uh </connor>
<joey> I mean because when I when I was you </joey>
<joey> know when we uh evacuated in uh La I </joey>
<connor> felt like we did not need to evacuate I </connor>
<connor> felt like we should have just stayed in </connor>
<connor> our room I don't know what they were the </connor>
<connor> recommended guideline is but I'm pretty </connor>
<joey> sure running down to the bottom floor is </joey>
<joey> not the right idea yeah </joey>
<garnt> in the elevator during an earthquake is </garnt>
<garnt> probably like at the top of like yeah I </garnt>
<connor> just had [ __ ] to do after it so I really </connor>
<joey> wanted to get down fast so I was this </joey>
<joey> Chick-fil-A nuggets weren't gonna eat </joey>
<connor> themselves that as well and also I the </connor>
<connor> moment that I was immediately put off </connor>
<connor> going down the stairs was when we ran </connor>
<connor> past the American family and that guy </connor>
<joey> was acting like we were in like a </joey>
<joey> Hollywood movie and we had like he had </joey>
<joey> like three kids and he was like </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> and I was like I'm like I'm not I'm not </joey>
<joey> big in this guy's movie I'm gonna do my </joey>
<connor> own thing I don't want to be part of </connor>
<joey> this that's that's when I decided yeah </joey>
<joey> that did like it was a pretty tense </joey>
<connor> situation but the moment </connor>
<connor> I was just like the earthquake had ended </connor>
<joey> you know it was like whatever I was not </joey>
<joey> really scared anymore the building was </joey>
<joey> still shaking but I was like whatever </joey>
<joey> it's not a big deal the building's built </joey>
<joey> for it yeah the building's built </joey>
<joey> different yeah </joey>
<joey> so I was pretty confident that we were </joey>
<connor> going to be fine yeah so I was like </connor>
<connor> whatever I think I I'll take the </connor>
<connor> elevator </connor>
<connor> I didn't I realized that don't take </connor>
<connor> emergency advice I'm not I'm not </connor>
<joey> recommending it I I just I'm lazy he </joey>
<joey> just does it anyway I was just you know </joey>
<joey> I was I felt confident enough that I was </joey>
<joey> going to be fine same and if I died you </joey>
<connor> know sure I can have my Darwin Award in </connor>
<joey> peace um because I'm dead so </joey>
<garnt> I don't know I can kind of relate to </garnt>
<connor> that in like a tangential sense where </connor>
<connor> you just like willingly put your life in </connor>
<connor> danger just for a bit of control I don't </connor>
<connor> feel like it was in danger because I </connor>
<connor> didn't feel that way because like living </connor>
<connor> living in Thailand this is going a </connor>
<joey> complete tangent but every time you get </joey>
<joey> in the car and no no no no </joey>
<joey> that's not risking your life okay </joey>
<joey> Bangkok is the only place I've lived in </joey>
<connor> where people willingly lift uh risk </connor>
<connor> their lives on the daily by taking a </connor>
<joey> motorcycle type uh motor motorcycle taxi </joey>
<joey> like daily in like some of the most </joey>
<joey> dangerous roads in the world just to </joey>
<joey> save yourself 30 minutes of traffic </joey>
<joey> right right and we do that on the daily </joey>
<garnt> and I do that on a daily I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> that's weird when you think about it </garnt>
<connor> yeah I I can't really describe why I </connor>
<connor> just wanted to take the elevator but I </connor>
<connor> think I just realized I was like I could </connor>
<connor> either walk down 70 floors of stairs or </connor>
<connor> I could just risk it and take the </connor>
<connor> elevator and I think at that point in </connor>
<connor> time to me taking 70 flight of stairs </connor>
<joey> was not worth my life well I mean I </joey>
<joey> can't I can't argue against that because </joey>
<joey> I also win a new position </joey>
<connor> I think it was one of those things it </connor>
<joey> was like Conor's going in the elevator </joey>
<joey> or if he's stupid enough to risk his </joey>
<garnt> life I guess I feel confident enough </garnt>
<joey> where yeah oh I'll go in with it if I </joey>
<connor> die yeah I don't know I know that I </connor>
<joey> shouldn't do it but I did so I mean we </joey>
<joey> ended up not going down anyway yeah so I </joey>
<connor> ended up happening was Cosmic Justice is </connor>
<connor> that the elevator to get down you had to </connor>
<connor> go up to the 70th floor to the lobby to </connor>
<connor> then get down and when we got to the </connor>
<connor> 70th floor uh they stopped all the </connor>
<joey> elevators Yeah so basically we went down </joey>
<garnt> about 35 stairs for nothing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> basically just Instant Karma yeah </garnt>
<joey> right there and then we waited 10 </joey>
<joey> minutes and the elevator started working </joey>
<joey> and then there was no problems and I was </joey>
<joey> very glad that I did yeah I literally </joey>
<joey> looked like </joey>
<joey> Bobby was like went down 75 the stairs </joey>
<connor> turned around was like but you know I </connor>
<connor> you know when when stuff like that </connor>
<connor> happened I feel like I don't want to be </connor>
<joey> that guy who's panicking and running </joey>
<joey> around like all these people you know </joey>
<joey> that's the last thing to do I just feel </joey>
<joey> like this is a b sheep </joey>
<joey> wake up sheeple this is how you're </joey>
<joey> inviting a shitty situation to happen </joey>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> um you know and I also don't want to try </garnt>
<garnt> my chances on on the road uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> because when you leave the hotel you're </garnt>
<garnt> just facing the road yeah I don't want </garnt>
<garnt> to try my chances with stuff falling or </garnt>
<joey> well that's the thing it's like in some </joey>
<joey> situations it's actually more dangerous </joey>
<joey> to go on the road because in the case </joey>
<garnt> with Japan we have so much like </garnt>
<joey> electrical wiring yeah on the roads that </joey>
<garnt> if those fall and snap they can easily </garnt>
<joey> electrocute you [ __ ] you know uh </joey>
<joey> traffic signs can come down hurt you </joey>
<garnt> yeah I feel like the safest place is </garnt>
<garnt> just to probably be on the ground floor </garnt>
<connor> yes of a building I don't know you get </connor>
<joey> way more uh like earthquake vibrations </joey>
<joey> on the first floor yeah yeah the best </joey>
<joey> thing to hire up the building the less </joey>
<joey> you get like you just get swaying if </joey>
<connor> you're up tall yeah when you're down </connor>
<joey> below you get the [ __ ] violent </joey>
<joey> shaking yeah the best thing to do is to </joey>
<garnt> just go out into like a really really </garnt>
<garnt> hard I I feel like this is a point in my </garnt>
<garnt> life where I'm just like I don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> I should uh listen to this advice well </garnt>
<connor> because the really the really the really </connor>
<joey> uh the really tall buildings are built </joey>
<joey> on like rolling mechanics yeah uh so </joey>
<joey> when the building you [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> experienced it what do you mean the </garnt>
<garnt> hotel where you stayed in yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's built on rollers </connor>
<garnt> quick happens it starts rolling yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> on like the ground floor sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> literally don't even feel the earthquake </garnt>
<connor> no because there's no there's no swaying </connor>
<connor> or anything like that no because you're </connor>
<connor> getting like the actual [ __ ] Earth </connor>
<garnt> shaking well that's that's that's not </garnt>
<garnt> what it feels like on the ground floor </garnt>
<connor> yeah it does </connor>
<connor> an earthquake on the ground floor right </connor>
<joey> yeah it feels very violently shaking </joey>
<joey> yeah but it's kind of the same as being </joey>
<connor> on the building I I when I experienced </connor>
<connor> both in Japan I definitely preferred in </connor>
<connor> in La when it was the building was just </connor>
<garnt> swaying I I was literally on the street </garnt>
<joey> and sometimes I didn't even notice that </joey>
<joey> there was an earthquake when people yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah because like there was there's </joey>
<joey> no there's nothing to like how can I put </joey>
<joey> this there's nothing to put your </joey>
<garnt> perspective in that you're in an </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake you just feel like the floor </garnt>
<garnt> is amazing wobbly the floor doesn't the </garnt>
<joey> floor doesn't move it shakes it does </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it shakes but a lot of the times </joey>
<joey> you can't actually see it moving until </joey>
<garnt> you look at something yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's nothing to like round your </garnt>
<joey> perspective whereas if you're in a </joey>
<joey> building you can see other buildings </joey>
<garnt> doing this yeah yeah exactly like I </garnt>
<garnt> don't really most of the times I don't </garnt>
<garnt> even realize I'm in an earthquake until </garnt>
<garnt> I have something to like ground that </garnt>
<garnt> perspective right sometimes sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> like living in Japan sometimes I just </garnt>
<garnt> get up get a head rush I'm like oh was </garnt>
<garnt> that enough </garnt>
<joey> so many like earthquakes but like you </joey>
<connor> know when you're getting an earthquake </connor>
<connor> because you should be like just [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> I'm like my mom has the story of when </joey>
<joey> she was in school she was like running </joey>
<connor> along the tracks at school and like you </connor>
<connor> know when you're running like your </connor>
<connor> entire world is doing this yeah so she </connor>
<connor> was running and she was looking at the </connor>
<connor> school building and then she stopped and </connor>
<connor> the building just kept doing this and </connor>
<connor> she realized she was in an earthquake </connor>
<connor> and she didn't realize until she stopped </connor>
<connor> because to her perspective it's already </connor>
<joey> going up and down right yeah but then </joey>
<joey> it's it's I think it again it's that </joey>
<joey> like perspective of being like that's </joey>
<joey> not moving the way it's intended to but </joey>
<connor> also I don't you know the shake the </connor>
<joey> swaying and all that stuff I don't </joey>
<joey> really give a [ __ ] as long as like you </joey>
<joey> know the building isn't falling down no </joey>
<joey> yeah and if I stopped my stuff to break </joey>
<joey> well yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like [ __ ] falling down isn't it </joey>
<joey> yeah that's why whatever that was an </joey>
<connor> earthquake I would just rush to my like </connor>
<connor> camera gear I'm like hold my children </connor>
<connor> figures please </connor>
<garnt> those are the real casualties and </garnt>
<connor> earthquakes I had those like 400 500 </connor>
<joey> JoJo figures that were like very finely </joey>
<joey> balanced yeah that were like balanced </joey>
<joey> the weight was like like this so the </joey>
<joey> center of gravity was very worrying yeah </joey>
<joey> and during earthquakes I immediately had </joey>
<joey> to just like go to them if I was there </joey>
<joey> and during that we had we had one pretty </joey>
<joey> big earthquake and I was surprised </joey>
<joey> because my figures just stayed up I mean </joey>
<joey> same way into the studio as well yours </joey>
<joey> didn't yeah it's weird because the </joey>
<joey> figures the figures that we had uh </joey>
<connor> Fallen looked like pretty normal figures </connor>
<joey> but the one that I really expect to </joey>
<garnt> break and didn't move at all well I mean </garnt>
<joey> it's the same here as well like at the </joey>
<garnt> old tracks I expected like Rohan to just </garnt>
<joey> be over all of these like knocked over </joey>
<joey> but the only casualty we had was [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> Mike [ __ ] Mike every time I'm not at </connor>
<joey> my house there's an earthquake in Japan </joey>
<connor> I just assume my house was going to be </connor>
<connor> demolished when I'm back I'm like </connor>
<connor> everything's [ __ ] I have to rebuild my </connor>
<joey> whole life it's all ruined do you guys </joey>
<joey> have like the anti-earthquake proof </joey>
<joey> stuff in like your cabinets you probably </joey>
<joey> should do that no it really does make a </joey>
<joey> difference does it yeah what is it so </joey>
<joey> basically like oh I mean there's lots of </joey>
<connor> different variations of it but I need it </connor>
<connor> for most stuff though I feel like it's </connor>
<joey> for very specific things </joey>
<joey> um I I we put it on most stuff like most </joey>
<joey> of the big stuff will sound like if you </joey>
<joey> have like figurine cabinets or like </joey>
<connor> bookshelves this is like little kind of </connor>
<connor> like they look like little rubber </connor>
<connor> doorstops yeah I know you put them </connor>
<joey> underneath and it completely stops the </joey>
<connor> shaking from happening yeah I wanted to </connor>
<connor> get the figures to stop shaking yeah so </connor>
<joey> I have I have them under like all of my </joey>
<joey> bookshelves and fearing cabinets and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that and you know I've seen </joey>
<joey> them move in an earthquake that that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] doesn't budge so that's really good </joey>
<connor> and also like there's also these like </connor>
<connor> little like sticky pads kind of thing </connor>
<connor> that you can put on like some like </connor>
<joey> figurines and stuff like that that's </joey>
<connor> just weird that you have to like live in </connor>
<joey> a country and you just worry about like </joey>
<garnt> just like like insta death just </garnt>
<joey> happening in the UK like nothing kills I </joey>
<joey> mean it's not exactly insta death or </joey>
<joey> just worry well I mean it might be if </joey>
<joey> you're in the wrong situation yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I mean I suppose like I've we've </garnt>
<garnt> been lucky enough to never have been in </garnt>
<garnt> a bad earthquake I don't like like I I </garnt>
<connor> feel like we've never [ __ ] say it </connor>
<garnt> well they've been predicting the mega </garnt>
<garnt> Quake for like a few years now in Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah where there's about to be some </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like eight or nine yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] earthquake </joey>
<joey> I hope to God it happens in the next </joey>
<connor> three weeks I'm not here </connor>
<garnt> Jesus Christ I bet you'll wish you were </garnt>
<connor> on the ground floor then Connor yeah </connor>
<connor> well I felt like the shaking was very </connor>
<connor> violent I used to live on the like a </connor>
<connor> fourth or fifth floor and it used to </connor>
<connor> shake really weirdly I didn't like it I </connor>
<connor> felt like it was just high enough up </connor>
<connor> where I got really [ __ ] violent </connor>
<garnt> chicks yeah yeah I got I was on the </garnt>
<connor> eighth floor and I think with the the </connor>
<connor> biggest earthquake we were in which uh </connor>
<connor> was the one where earthquake earthquake </connor>
<joey> earthquake the biggest earthquake we're </joey>
<joey> in which was the one where the fake my </joey>
<joey> figures fell over uh I wasn't in the </joey>
<garnt> toilet at the time but like that's the </garnt>
<connor> safest room to be in yeah I was in the </connor>
<connor> bath one time as well but that </connor>
<garnt> earthquake just lasted for so [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> long it felt like it lasted like two </connor>
<joey> minutes or something at least yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> because it just it just started and like </connor>
<connor> at which point because you have to make </connor>
<connor> this mental Judgment of at which point </connor>
<connor> do I start giving a [ __ ] yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because because most of the time it's a </connor>
<connor> little because it happened so often it </connor>
<connor> happens so often so I'm just like oh is </connor>
<garnt> this the one I should start carrying </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's not stopping should I start </connor>
<connor> caring now but also what are you gonna </connor>
<connor> do if you give a [ __ ] like what am I </connor>
<joey> gonna do just be like oh [ __ ] I'm </joey>
<joey> worried well you have to like evacuate </joey>
<joey> to your nearest education point which </joey>
<joey> everyone should know when you move no no </joey>
<garnt> where is this </garnt>
<garnt> we've got you got to get under the door </garnt>
<joey> frame right if it's door frame but also </joey>
<joey> like if it gets really bad then there's </joey>
<joey> like in your local town There's usually </joey>
<connor> like evacuation points that's normally </connor>
<connor> if like your water and [ __ ] turns off </connor>
<joey> and all that is right um no in a lot of </joey>
<joey> situations it's like earthquakes and </joey>
<connor> floods and stuff like that yeah but why </connor>
<connor> why would you leave your house in an </connor>
<garnt> earthquake if it's like that's true if </garnt>
<connor> it's like unstable no well I mean what </connor>
<joey> if the buildings well it's usually in </joey>
<garnt> the case of like you know if the </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake is really powerful that your </garnt>
<joey> water stops or your electricity stops </joey>
<connor> your gas that's what I thought right was </connor>
<joey> to get like supplies and shelter yeah </joey>
<joey> because if the winter if it's really </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] cold and you know your </connor>
<joey> electricity turns off </joey>
<garnt> I'm kind of [ __ ] because like I am not </garnt>
<garnt> stocked up on any kind of emergency or </garnt>
<joey> disaster yeah we recently like restocked </joey>
<connor> our shoes yeah </connor>
<garnt> two years now everything is good oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> I'll get around to it </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> no because I remember like uh for </joey>
<connor> journey across Japan we went to like </connor>
<connor> sakurajima which is that like Island uh </connor>
<connor> or volcano yeah in kagoshima and I </connor>
<joey> remember like two weeks after we left </joey>
<joey> there it [ __ ] erupted </joey>
<joey> there's like and that entitled it was </joey>
<joey> like pretty b as well and it made me </joey>
<joey> realize I was like oh yeah earthquakes </joey>
<joey> are like the least of my worries because </joey>
<joey> Japan is like [ __ ] volcanic area </joey>
<garnt> there's like so many actors like </garnt>
<garnt> malfuji's [ __ ] active volcano is it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is it is it's a it's an active </garnt>
<garnt> volcano and it last erupted I think </garnt>
<garnt> about 250 years ago and they're </garnt>
<garnt> expecting it 250 years ago yeah in like </garnt>
<garnt> the other period it last erupted oh and </garnt>
<joey> it then they're expecting it to erupt </joey>
<joey> like soon thick so I'm like sick they </joey>
<joey> actually did a simulation if it erupts </joey>
<connor> completely it actually reaches all the </connor>
<garnt> way to uh </garnt>
<garnt> oh sure it's still that far yeah wow </garnt>
<joey> it's kind of like a Yellowstone right in </joey>
<joey> America well that's like one of the </joey>
<joey> biggest active super volcanoes in the </joey>
<garnt> world yeah if that erupts then it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of like the end of </garnt>
<garnt> civilization for like a lot of people </garnt>
<connor> yeah exactly yeah yeah because a lot of </connor>
<garnt> The Waters at Yellowstone are like </garnt>
<garnt> boiling hot like the Lakes yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly yeah some horrifying stories </garnt>
<joey> people jumping in the water thinking </joey>
<joey> that they can swim in it oh and it's </joey>
<joey> boiling </joey>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know when it's so bad when do I </garnt>
<connor> leave my house I don't know that is is </connor>
<garnt> it like a hard guide on where I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I'm pretty sure you'll know when </garnt>
<garnt> you'll know yeah you know what I mean </garnt>
<joey> like when it gets to the point where </joey>
<joey> it's like oh I can't be here for a </joey>
<connor> multitude of reasons then it's time to </connor>
<connor> go yeah the ones that I don't really get </connor>
<joey> scared of the earthquakes in Japan but </joey>
<joey> the ones that do kind of make me </joey>
<joey> uncomfortable is when it starts small </joey>
<joey> and it just keeps getting bigger yeah </joey>
<joey> and then you're like when will it stop </joey>
<joey> will it keep escalating yeah because </joey>
<connor> when it starts off big and it doesn't </connor>
<joey> get any worse I'm like okay okay cool </joey>
<joey> it's the long ones for me though yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah right where it starts you like </connor>
<connor> shakes shakes shakes and you're like </connor>
<connor> please okay please please stop when is </connor>
<garnt> this going to Peak yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's not peeking yet I just feel like </garnt>
<connor> it's the British in me where you just </connor>
<connor> don't take any kind of like natural </connor>
<connor> disaster seriously I'm just like come on </connor>
<connor> sorry stop this now come on I've got </connor>
<garnt> enough of this natural also come on </garnt>
<joey> there's no natural disasters in the </joey>
<joey> world so you guys don't have like any </joey>
<connor> natural disaster there's some flooding </connor>
<joey> but very light it's not right right oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah we're flooding here like I I like I </garnt>
<garnt> I hear I hear like of like uh like uh </garnt>
<garnt> like a weather warning in Japan I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] the weather warning </garnt>
<connor> yeah how come weather my phone has been </connor>
<joey> on permanent weather warning since I've </joey>
<garnt> moved here yeah but I I'd love to </garnt>
<joey> imagine the first time like a British </joey>
<joey> person like went abroad right in like </joey>
<joey> 1600s and they're like there's an </joey>
<joey> earthquake like what the [ __ ] was that </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] was that yeah that happens </joey>
<joey> all the time what do you mean that </joey>
<joey> happens all the time if you Earth just </joey>
<joey> moved the Earth just moves and you're </joey>
<joey> all okay with this you haven't asked </joey>
<joey> management what's going on it's a living </joey>
<joey> and then like yeah yeah and sometimes </joey>
<connor> the the Mansion explodes the mountain </connor>
<joey> explodes and fire the mountain explodes </joey>
<joey> we get these things called typhoon yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like what do you mean lava </joey>
<connor> that's hell that's hell coming out </connor>
<joey> that's we've only seen that in the books </joey>
<connor> this doesn't happen this is nonsense </connor>
<joey> it's 20 000 and you accept this this is </joey>
<garnt> okay with you it's like what is a </garnt>
<garnt> typhoon it's just a bit of wind in it a </garnt>
<joey> bit of winds never hurt anyone just a </joey>
<joey> bit of rain we get that all the time </joey>
<connor> it's a bit of rain and wind what do you </connor>
<connor> mean nature destroyed your house and did </connor>
<joey> you get a refund what is all this what </joey>
<joey> is a tsunami it's just a wave isn't it </joey>
<joey> yeah when we think about it we Japan </joey>
<joey> really is like world number one when it </joey>
<joey> comes to like the variety of [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> things that can kill you in nature yeah </joey>
<garnt> we really do have everything because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember before like I moved out of </garnt>
<joey> England you'd hear about these disasters </joey>
<joey> that happened all the way on the other </joey>
<joey> side of the world right it's like like </joey>
<joey> the Japan tsunami which is like an awful </joey>
<connor> tragedy that happens and he just didn't </connor>
<connor> it didn't it never quite yeah like how </connor>
<connor> how bad it was like I remember just </connor>
<connor> before we moved to Japan where like you </connor>
<joey> guys are having like super bad Thai food </joey>
<joey> and typhoons and like the the videos </joey>
<joey> that came out just looked super bad and </joey>
<joey> they were just like I I it still doesn't </joey>
<joey> sink into me that it's just this bad </joey>
<joey> here in Japan yeah as a British person </joey>
<joey> because I've just never experienced it </joey>
<garnt> IRL in real life like it's never just </garnt>
<joey> happened right in front of me it really </joey>
<joey> it really is like completely different </joey>
<joey> like you could watch like hundreds of </joey>
<joey> videos on it and the one that you've </joey>
<joey> actually experienced in real life is </joey>
<joey> like unlike anything you would ever </joey>
<joey> imagine it is like it's like those </joey>
<joey> typhoons look back it's a hundred times </joey>
<connor> worse in real life watching like </connor>
<connor> earthquakes from like the 2011 </connor>
<joey> earthquake uh it's like really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah just seeing </joey>
<connor> like people just everything shaking </connor>
<joey> super violently I'm like oh gosh and </joey>
<garnt> just like the water level rising and </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] is like terrifying that happened 10 </joey>
<garnt> years ago man that's yeah that's weird </garnt>
<garnt> yeah time flies 2011. holy [ __ ] I was </garnt>
<connor> still in University yeah I would I would </connor>
<connor> gladly take off um volcanoes if we can </connor>
<connor> get onsen's sticker stick a volcano </connor>
<joey> somewhere in Wales I will have an Onsen </joey>
<joey> would Onsen culture work in the UK if we </joey>
<connor> had volcanoes yeah you sure yeah I think </connor>
<joey> so I wouldn't okay </joey>
<joey> you just want you just want it to work </joey>
<garnt> I'll make it work we'll serve beer not </garnt>
<joey> not if people have to get naked yeah in </joey>
<connor> front of each other I I think you you </connor>
<joey> underestimate how I think that culture </joey>
<joey> is like just wouldn't work in the UK If </joey>
<garnt> you teach them from a young age listen </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe okay but like getting naked is </garnt>
<joey> normal yeah you could teach a group of </joey>
<joey> people cannibalism from a young age and </joey>
<garnt> they'll think it's all right yeah we're </garnt>
<garnt> not talking about we're not talking </garnt>
<connor> about if like if the entire history of </connor>
<joey> the UK had changed to introduce this </joey>
<garnt> culture from the beginning because then </garnt>
<connor> they'd just be [ __ ] Japan that's like </connor>
<connor> if you gave them a free beer at the end </connor>
<connor> of it like you're going naked with your </connor>
<connor> boys you get a free beer they do it you </connor>
<joey> sure 100 I I doubt if I if I went up to </joey>
<joey> a guy from the UK like born and bred </joey>
<joey> never left the country and I said I'll </joey>
<joey> give you a beer if you get in this bath </joey>
<joey> with this other dude naked when you say </joey>
<joey> it like that that sounds way worse </joey>
<joey> because that's what a nonsense is </joey>
<joey> doing some type not traditional bath </joey>
<joey> where they're like dicks are touching </joey>
<joey> and they're like oh god oh oh I'm so </joey>
<joey> scared of people I mean there are </joey>
<joey> oncense white leather yeah but you don't </joey>
<joey> not really public ones though oh I mean </joey>
<joey> we've been in one have we yeah remember </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and we've been pretty close together at </garnt>
<joey> the end of the cycling yeah yeah we went </joey>
<garnt> in that really really tight Onsen </garnt>
<garnt> literally it was like me you Joey and </garnt>
<garnt> Chris and like our legs were definitely </garnt>
<joey> touching yeah I don't remember this that </joey>
<garnt> just shows how like used to you it used </garnt>
<joey> to wear it yeah it's just like nothing </joey>
<joey> to you yeah because I'm sure someone </joey>
<joey> who's not used to that type of culture </joey>
<garnt> would find that treasure someone </garnt>
<garnt> especially a lot of Brits you know </garnt>
<connor> imagine being scared of a penis there I </connor>
<garnt> just couldn't imagine it like I mean </garnt>
<garnt> you'd be surprised like like not not </garnt>
<joey> even like not even being scared of </joey>
<joey> penises but like just like the social </joey>
<joey> boundary of seeing your mate's penis </joey>
<joey> yeah or seeing you it's like seeing </joey>
<joey> someone close to you and just knowing </joey>
<joey> what they look like naked I mean I'm </joey>
<garnt> totally fine with it now yeah but that's </garnt>
<joey> that's because I've done it that's the </joey>
<joey> thing yeah it's it's like it's that one </joey>
<connor> thing of just like getting to that point </connor>
<connor> and once you're over it then you're over </connor>
<joey> it right but I think it's for a lot of </joey>
<connor> people it stops at getting to that point </connor>
<connor> yeah maybe maybe in the UK if it was in </connor>
<joey> the UK I would think it's weird which is </joey>
<joey> why for me it's like it's such a shame </joey>
<joey> because when people from overseas come </joey>
<joey> to Japan for the first time and they're </joey>
<joey> like I want to know everything about the </joey>
<joey> culture you know like what are some like </joey>
<joey> really unique Japanese things and of </joey>
<joey> course the first thing I think of is </joey>
<joey> onsense right yeah but immediately </joey>
<joey> really I always hesitate being like I </joey>
<joey> get this you're about to see my dick </joey>
<joey> but in like a cool way </joey>
<connor> and like a nice relaxing way like we're </connor>
<connor> in a ball together and yes we're naked </connor>
<joey> but it's not weird it's not weird trust </joey>
<joey> me and we're with other random people as </joey>
<garnt> well but it's not weird you know that's </garnt>
<garnt> the first thing I tell people now it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like you want to come to Japan you </garnt>
<garnt> want me to take you around we're going </garnt>
<connor> to a nonsense yeah right well I should </connor>
<connor> get that out the way yeah I think it you </connor>
<garnt> know if someone's willing to go to the </garnt>
<garnt> Onsen with you they're probably up for </garnt>
<garnt> anything right everything Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> culture yeah I feel like if you if you </garnt>
<joey> can't trial by fire you can't put your </joey>
<connor> own uh cultural differences aside to </connor>
<joey> participate in another culture and uh </joey>
<joey> yeah I think I agree and and I and and </joey>
<joey> yeah again like that's what I kind of </joey>
<joey> use as a gauge of like cultural </joey>
<joey> understanding for that person it's like </joey>
<joey> if they can get over this then you'll be </joey>
<connor> fine I'm very open to some things but </connor>
<connor> there are some things where I've seen in </connor>
<joey> like you know when they had like what </joey>
<joey> was it there's a TV show called like </joey>
<joey> tribes in the UK instead of dude who </joey>
<joey> went around tribes and like the Amazon </joey>
<joey> or something and there was one thing </joey>
<joey> that he did that I was like okay I don't </joey>
<joey> think I'd do that and it was like it's </joey>
<joey> like a penis inverting ceremony or </joey>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<joey> I've seen that have you seen the video </joey>
<joey> where the guy like faints yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and I was like yeah you know what I </joey>
<connor> thought I was up for a lot but I think </connor>
<connor> that's that's where I'm good yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> I've seen the one where they have to </garnt>
<joey> like wear that glove of just like </joey>
<garnt> bullets yeah oh yeah yeah yeah like why </garnt>
<connor> would anyone want to do this because if </connor>
<garnt> I was you know you gave me enough beers </garnt>
<joey> maybe I'd do the ants things but let's </joey>
<garnt> go </garnt>
<joey> it's the video of that guy with the guy </joey>
<joey> like the tribal Chief does it to him </joey>
<joey> he's a faints immediately yeah oh God it </joey>
<joey> sounded terrible yeah just just I think </joey>
<joey> there are many penises like going ah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> and yeah I'm pretty much up for anything </connor>
<joey> that doesn't involve like destroying my </joey>
<connor> body or pain or yeah stuff like that I'm </connor>
<joey> pretty much down for anything yeah I'm </joey>
<joey> usually down for anything when it comes </joey>
<joey> to like you know especially when it </joey>
<joey> comes to things like food enjoy which is </joey>
<connor> why I hate when people lie to me about </connor>
<connor> their like make a joke they're like yeah </connor>
<connor> our culture we do this and then they </connor>
<connor> just lied to me and I didn't have to put </connor>
<garnt> my penis out in public I'm kidding </garnt>
<garnt> but you know this is why I trust my </garnt>
<garnt> friends that when I go somewhere new and </garnt>
<garnt> they're like this is what we do here I'm </garnt>
<joey> like I trust you that sounds weird but I </joey>
<joey> trust you please don't [ __ ] me like God </joey>
<joey> could be like yeah so in Thailand we uh </joey>
<joey> get our dicks out in restaurants and </joey>
<joey> swing them around and be like all right </joey>
<joey> well okay all right </joey>
<garnt> I would trust God if God told me yeah </garnt>
<joey> right right I was like yeah you have to </joey>
<connor> spit on the food before you eat it oh </connor>
<garnt> God I'm just waiting for the perfect </garnt>
<connor> opportunity she's gonna do it he's gonna </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] do it I know he is as well </connor>
<garnt> that's the worst I'm just waiting for </garnt>
<connor> the perfect opportunity to I'm gonna I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do because I've only got one </connor>
<garnt> chance to do it too like do it exactly </garnt>
<connor> completely lose that trust Joe in </connor>
<connor> Australia he'll be like yeah you have to </connor>
<connor> snort all your alcohol be like oh okay </connor>
<joey> yeah you have to drink alcohol through </joey>
<joey> your eye </joey>
<joey> Australians do do yeah we do do that </joey>
<connor> it's called a suicide shot </connor>
<garnt> just to have like a lot of shows in the </garnt>
<garnt> UK that would like cover like binge </garnt>
<garnt> drinking and like clubbing I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> why we have TV shows about this okay </garnt>
<joey> yeah and there'll be this one show and </joey>
<joey> this is where I first discovered that </joey>
<joey> people did vodka shots through their </joey>
<joey> eyeball yeah yeah and it was weird and </joey>
<joey> they would do it and they'd be like </joey>
<joey> they'd ask them the interviewer would </joey>
<joey> ask them why'd you do he's like because </joey>
<joey> I just get drunk so fast and I'm like is </joey>
<joey> drinking like not fast enough it's </joey>
<joey> pretty fast it's pretty damaged it's </joey>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] and then it just </joey>
<joey> immediately cut to a doctor who was like </joey>
<joey> yeah well actually you know in certain </joey>
<joey> any kind of alcohol in your eyes </joey>
<joey> extremely dangerous and can remove the </joey>
<joey> lipid layer of uh yeah it can </joey>
<connor> permanently damage and possibly blind </connor>
<joey> you yeah of course I was like oh you </joey>
<joey> know I don't need a [ __ ] professional </joey>
<joey> doctor telling me that like it should be </joey>
<connor> common sense yeah it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> sticking a splinter in your butt it's </connor>
<connor> like I didn't need a doctor to tell me </connor>
<connor> that didn't need to go there </connor>
<connor> that's weird man I I it's so strange </connor>
<connor> because I feel like in the UK with </connor>
<garnt> partying and all that there's so many </garnt>
<joey> stuff that you just do it because </joey>
<joey> everyone else tells you you yeah we just </joey>
<connor> always stab there thinking like what the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] is going on yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely like you especially in </garnt>
<garnt> University where it's just gone just </garnt>
<garnt> like the the idea of doing a dirty shot </garnt>
<garnt> now just like makes me makes me feel </garnt>
<connor> what does it do you know I'll explain to </connor>
<connor> the viewers gone and makes I forgot yeah </connor>
<joey> I don't know what it is either or a </joey>
<garnt> dirty Pine you just like you play </garnt>
<joey> probably most of the time it's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> ring of fire right </joey>
<connor> the University game yeah yeah and then </connor>
<connor> you have this pint glass in the Middle </connor>
<connor> where whenever you draw a certain card </connor>
<connor> you have to fill up with whatever </connor>
<connor> alcohol I feel sorry whatever alcohol </connor>
<connor> that person is drinking and sometimes if </connor>
<joey> you're in like an Ultra Hardcore party </joey>
<joey> then you fill up with like other [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> that you would never put in a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> drink like [ __ ] like washing up liquid </joey>
<connor> or stuff like yeah they would do it or </connor>
<connor> like Tabasco sauce </connor>
<connor> Nando sauce we had a rule in ours where </connor>
<connor> whoever lost they had to leave the room </connor>
<connor> for 30 seconds anything in the kitchen </connor>
<connor> could be put in the drink yeah so people </connor>
<connor> people would put like pepper grains </connor>
<connor> washing up liquid and like they would </connor>
<garnt> drink it I understand pepper grains are </garnt>
<connor> like Tabasco but washing up Liquid you </connor>
<garnt> should immediately throw it up there's </garnt>
<garnt> no yeah I've actually done it before </garnt>
<garnt> when I was 17 you [ __ ] idiot yeah </garnt>
<connor> you're [ __ ] because I I went I'm </connor>
<connor> lucky for some reason during my whole </connor>
<connor> time at University when I played this </connor>
<connor> game I never got it yeah but I would </connor>
<joey> have refused I mean we played for that </joey>
<connor> game but we you know made it stuff that </connor>
<garnt> you could actually drink yeah that's uh </garnt>
<connor> that's the Civilized I also I had food </connor>
<connor> poisoning yesterday and I feel Dreadful </connor>
<joey> and hearing this makes me feel even more </joey>
<joey> Dreadful why did you get food poisoning </joey>
<joey> Connor I had a bad sausage you had a bad </joey>
<connor> sausage I ordered two sausages I caught </connor>
<joey> one app and uh it was very very pink on </joey>
<joey> the inside that's bad sign I thought no </joey>
<connor> I'm not eating that one but I cut the </connor>
<connor> other one and it looked okay anyway and </connor>
<garnt> it was a sausage was it was it like </garnt>
<joey> Italian sausage narrator and it was </joey>
<garnt> normal okay </garnt>
<garnt> honor and food poisoning yeah you are so </garnt>
<joey> susceptible to it I think since you've </joey>
<connor> been in Japan you've had food poisoning </connor>
<joey> like at least three or four times yeah </joey>
<garnt> from my family three times this is the </garnt>
<joey> worst food poisoning you've ever had </joey>
<joey> what like the the chest time I want just </joey>
<joey> one of them yeah that was the worst one </joey>
<joey> you had food poisoning for like a week I </joey>
<connor> was [ __ ] and vomiting for like a </connor>
<connor> week straight it was terrible </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] oh God I think I've only about </connor>
<joey> food poisoning once in Japan because </joey>
<connor> they serve so much raw [ __ ] yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like you know they serve raw chicken </connor>
<connor> here you know and they say like oh </connor>
<joey> there's no salmon there is salmonella </joey>
<joey> there's just way less of it right </joey>
<joey> there's you're less you're just less </joey>
<joey> likely to get it it doesn't mean you </joey>
<joey> can't get you know I'm not being funny </joey>
<joey> but you should not eat raw chicken like </joey>
<joey> I don't care if Japan is like yeah it's </joey>
<joey> safe no I've had I've had it before yeah </joey>
<joey> but it's it's not it's not even that </joey>
<connor> good it's not that good and you are </connor>
<connor> rolling a dice yeah you you can eat it </connor>
<joey> but you are rolling it up well I I had </joey>
<joey> raw chicken at uh an Izakaya that </joey>
<joey> specialized in raw chicken because </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> izakayas that just like give it it's a </joey>
<joey> cultural thing right where people are </joey>
<garnt> just like this is safe this is safe and </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like is it though yeah is it is </joey>
<joey> it safe it's like you you are eating it </joey>
<joey> and there is a risk there is of course </joey>
<joey> there's a risk but it's you know you are </joey>
<joey> unlikely to get food poisoning from </joey>
<joey> eating the raw chicken but there is </joey>
<connor> still a chance yeah you can still get it </connor>
<joey> especially way more than other Foods you </joey>
<garnt> know right yeah but I mean a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> things especially in I feel like in Asia </garnt>
<joey> which just has a lot of a lot less </joey>
<joey> standards when it comes to say the </joey>
<joey> health and safety of the food you </joey>
<joey> service I feel like I feel like even </joey>
<joey> like Japan compared to the rest of Asia </joey>
<joey> has really really good food standards </joey>
<garnt> yeah uh compared to [ __ ] southeast </garnt>
<connor> Asia oh yeah oh my God compared to the </connor>
<joey> UK it's like Japan doesn't bat an eye if </joey>
<connor> it's like pinkish and I'm like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> my chicken's pink in the middle I'm like </connor>
<joey> oh God yeah I mean yeah the only time I </joey>
<joey> got food poisoning was when I went to </joey>
<joey> the Philippines for the first time and </joey>
<joey> uh you know of all things I could have </joey>
<joey> got food poisoning from it wasn't the </joey>
<joey> duck fetus it wasn't even the water it </joey>
<joey> was a [ __ ] mango shake oh yeah I ate </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] mango straight off the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> like like street vendor and that's what </garnt>
<garnt> gave me food poisoning </garnt>
<garnt> yeah amazing it was a fantastic Shake </garnt>
<joey> but man I was [ __ ] like I was </joey>
<joey> pissing out my ass for about two days oh </joey>
<garnt> it was horrible yeah I think the worst </garnt>
<garnt> food poisoning I've ever got was uh from </garnt>
<garnt> China actually uh when I was still </garnt>
<joey> living there and you know when when you </joey>
<joey> when you live in in China like the food </joey>
<joey> the food there is [ __ ] great </joey>
<joey> especially like the street foods but </joey>
<joey> it's just like trying to pinpoint where </joey>
<connor> you've got food poisoning there is uh </connor>
<connor> like a noodle in a house it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like a needle and a haystack like you </connor>
<connor> just you're just like where did the </connor>
<joey> which one of these food stands did I get </joey>
<joey> food poisoning from it could be any one </joey>
<joey> of them it's gonna be like a culmination </joey>
<joey> of all of them together I remember it </joey>
<joey> was like so bad that I always had to go </joey>
<joey> to the hospital because I remember it </joey>
<joey> was it was like New Year's Eve for like </joey>
<garnt> one of the years I can't remember which </garnt>
<garnt> year exact year it was but I remember it </garnt>
<garnt> was I was sitting on the toilet and I </garnt>
<joey> needed to throw up at the same time that </joey>
<connor> I was [ __ ] and </connor>
<joey> those are the ones </joey>
<connor> you laughing like it was a traumatic </connor>
<joey> we're just alternating I I was I was I </joey>
<connor> was like you have to like I was trying </connor>
<joey> to like like I was trying to like keep </joey>
<joey> it in but that one time one time I </joey>
<connor> literally like I literally could not </connor>
<connor> like hold either one so I literally like </connor>
<connor> needed to like well </connor>
<connor> I don't want to get too graphic </connor>
<connor> um I've done that before but it's it's </connor>
<connor> like it was the most awful food </connor>
<connor> poisoning experience I've ever had you </connor>
<connor> know um it's kind of like I've seen our </connor>
<connor> South Park I know which one yeah </connor>
<joey> and then and then uh and then pukes up </joey>
<connor> and then has a nose lead at the same </connor>
<joey> time it was like that was that was my </joey>
<connor> experience that was yeah share what you </connor>
<connor> will about fast food chains I've never </connor>
<connor> gotten food poisoning from a fast food </connor>
<joey> chain I've never gotten food poisoning </joey>
<joey> from like you mean like like junk food </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that yeah like McDonald's </connor>
<connor> whatever yeah I've never gone food </connor>
<joey> poisoning from it personally but I have </joey>
<joey> gotten very sick yeah like like felt bad </joey>
<connor> just felt like I've never had to throw </connor>
<joey> up after eating like KFC a little </joey>
<joey> practice and something I don't know </joey>
<joey> about America I've seen some really </joey>
<connor> ghastly ones in America I I in the UK </connor>
<joey> and Japan I've had nothing but good </joey>
<joey> experience no Japan is really good with </joey>
<joey> fast food I think like the few times </joey>
<connor> that I've had McDonald's in America </connor>
<connor> yeah it's horrible I don't know how they </connor>
<joey> make burgers taste so bad at McDonald's </joey>
<connor> in America I don't know what they do </connor>
<joey> I don't know man because it's because </joey>
<joey> McDonald's just makes enough enough </joey>
<joey> money like worldwide yeah and in America </joey>
<joey> there's just so much better uh like so </joey>
<joey> much better Burgers right though it's </joey>
<connor> more higher end but yeah yeah there's </connor>
<joey> way more competition in America I feel </joey>

<joey> cool scar yeah you just come back and </joey>
<connor> you just like completely </connor>
<joey> like just go on my patch on or something </joey>
<joey> like that right </joey>
<joey> no it's been really weird for me for the </joey>
<joey> past few weeks uh because I've been </joey>
<joey> living alone I guess for like the past </joey>
<joey> two three weeks yeah because Sydney went </joey>
<joey> back to yeah see he's back in America </joey>
<joey> and I think this is like the longest </joey>
<joey> we've been apart for like that time </joey>
<connor> and it's so weird not having a partner </connor>
<connor> home and it's just one the home feels so </connor>
<connor> empty like my God like if if it wasn't </connor>
<joey> for Corona lockdown I would want to meet </joey>
<joey> so many people because I'm just like I I </joey>
<joey> need to uh do something </joey>
<joey> I need someone to talk to I need someone </joey>
<joey> to fill in the gap of like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> having no one in your house I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> I've forgotten what that felt like right </garnt>
<connor> I forgot when I feel that I feel it's </connor>
<connor> just like because you're used to it </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah to me it's like I don't </connor>
<garnt> feel that way yeah I I now see why you </garnt>
<garnt> try to meet up with as many people as </garnt>
<garnt> you go because if I was in the if I was </garnt>
<garnt> in your shoes I would do the same </garnt>
<garnt> because uh it's uh it's lonely without </garnt>
<garnt> having someone just there to talk to you </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> sometimes I really value being able to </connor>
<connor> just like do whatever I want no I like </connor>
<connor> my alone time too </connor>
<garnt> yeah a lot I like my loan time as well </garnt>
<joey> and I feel I feel like any healthy </joey>
<joey> relationship you have space to be uh </joey>
<joey> have your alone time but if you're </joey>
<joey> feeling lonely you just yours there's </joey>
<joey> just someone there also another thing is </joey>
<joey> that uh the chores are now like I have </joey>
<joey> I'm in charge of all the chores and I'm </joey>
<joey> just like what is this like this is </joey>
<joey> gonna sound a bit misogynistic right but </joey>
<joey> like in in my in my household I'm in </joey>
<joey> charge charge of the washing up okay and </joey>
<joey> Sydney is in charge of uh of the uh of </joey>
<joey> the laundry right right and so I was </joey>
<joey> just used to only do the washing up and </joey>
<joey> having the woman doing the laundry right </joey>
<joey> why did you have to say it like that I </joey>
<joey> just wanted to sound as misogynistic I </joey>
<joey> just wanted to sound as misogynistic as </joey>
<joey> I can because now I am there's no one to </joey>
<garnt> do the laundry and I'm just like woman </garnt>
<garnt> where is my laundry done and I just </garnt>
<garnt> realized I have to do it myself now so I </garnt>
<joey> just like to imagine like I just like </joey>
<joey> slowly enter God's house is it from </joey>
<joey> across the house I just hear woman </joey>
<joey> I need a fresh pair of underwear you </joey>
<connor> really got done dirty because laundry is </connor>
<joey> like the easiest of the house yeah I'm </joey>
<connor> the one that does laundry now yeah I </connor>
<connor> think washing up the dishes is far more </connor>
<garnt> painful I hate washing up the dishes why </garnt>
<connor> did you agree to that because I also </connor>
<joey> hate doing the laundry as well I just </joey>
<joey> need to know I like the laundry </joey>
<joey> I mean like now that we've bought like a </joey>
<joey> washing machine with a built-in dryer </joey>
<joey> all I have to do is just like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> take it out and fold it up but I like </joey>
<joey> the process of folding up washing I </joey>
<garnt> don't know why I hate that it's just </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's meditative it's so unoptimized </garnt>
<connor> I just I just like because the thing is </connor>
<connor> the thing about the laundry the thing </connor>
<connor> about a laundry is that like at least </connor>
<connor> with washing up it's just a one activity </connor>
<connor> thing you get it over with with laundry </connor>
<connor> you have to put it in and then you have </connor>
<connor> to remember that you put the laundry in </connor>
<joey> and sometimes I'm such a forgetful [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that like you forget hours after you </joey>
<joey> afterwards that you had laundry in the </joey>
<joey> laundry machine yeah and then you you </joey>
<joey> take it out and it's [ __ ] stinks yeah </joey>
<joey> because you've left it in there for so </joey>
<joey> long it's like wet so then you have to </joey>
<joey> re-la laundry your [ __ ] laundry well </joey>
<garnt> that just sounds like a usual that is a </garnt>
<connor> me problem God I hate the laundry </connor>
<connor> machines often have this very loud thing </connor>
<garnt> called a beeping yeah it goes when it's </garnt>
<joey> done yeah but sometimes you just do it </joey>
<joey> you might have heard it on your </joey>
<joey> microwave the same thing sometimes just </joey>
<joey> doing [ __ ] sometimes you're just like oh </joey>
<garnt> let me let me just finish up this piece </garnt>
<garnt> of work and then I'll do the laundry </garnt>
<garnt> country and then you just forget that </garnt>
<joey> you hear that again that sounds like a </joey>
<garnt> you problem I don't like because I have </garnt>
<connor> because if I'm doing work and then I </connor>
<connor> hear from my laundry machine going I'm </connor>
<connor> like all right time to do the [ __ ] it's </connor>
<connor> like I don't know how hard it is really </connor>
<connor> not that difficult yeah also I don't </connor>
<joey> have to worry about dishes anymore </joey>
<garnt> because we have a dishwasher so I wish I </garnt>
<connor> wish I wish I wish that was I feel like </connor>
<joey> I'm like a caveman just evolving I feel </joey>
<joey> like discovering civilization for the </joey>
<joey> first time yeah I mean like dishes </joey>
<joey> dishes I was used to doing but like with </joey>
<joey> laundry is is this how like is this how </joey>
<joey> like men felt in the 60s you know like </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> because in our house I have to do the </joey>
<joey> the laundry and the dishes because </joey>
<joey> that's the one chore that Aki hates </joey>
<joey> doing so she does like the vacuuming and </joey>
<joey> like the cleaning up and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> because I I [ __ ] hate vacuuming the </joey>
<joey> house but uh I also hate vacuum bro </joey>
<connor> imagine doing all of it yourself yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly wow well I had to do that when I </joey>
<joey> was living on my own </joey>
<joey> but like now it's like but now I feel </joey>
<joey> bad because my two chores which is the </joey>
<garnt> laundry and the dishes I just let the </garnt>
<garnt> machine do it so I literally just like </garnt>
<joey> press a button I'm like done </joey>
<garnt> and it's great I wish I wish that was me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I have to wash my dishes by hand </garnt>
<joey> and my laundry doesn't have a dryer as </joey>
<joey> well dude I'm telling you man like when </joey>
<garnt> you when you like the drives and laundry </garnt>
<connor> machines I feel like they ruined the </connor>
<garnt> clothes I don't like the dryer either </garnt>
<garnt> really I also hate having to put out the </garnt>
<joey> laundry yeah I hate having to put out </joey>
<garnt> the laundry because this isn't good an </garnt>
<connor> old-fashioned natural drive and just </connor>
<garnt> kind of gets to me it does it does but </garnt>
<garnt> the problem with that is that you are at </garnt>
<joey> the mercy of the weather yeah right </joey>
<garnt> because like what are you meant to do in </garnt>
<garnt> the winter time inside right the best </garnt>
<connor> the best well I just hanging outside </connor>
<connor> what in the rain the rain well it's not </connor>
<joey> permanently raining in the winter yeah </joey>
<joey> but what if you have laundry that just </joey>
<connor> finished and it starts raining yeah oh </connor>
<connor> it's unfortunate but you can just hang </connor>
<joey> it up somewhere else yeah inside Yeah so </joey>
<connor> basically what I just [ __ ] said like </connor>
<connor> you can do it outside it's not a big </connor>
<joey> deal you know no it is a big deal </joey>
<joey> because it's gonna go dirty again from </joey>
<connor> the rain that's right you can wash it </connor>
<connor> against even more clean see that's see </connor>
<garnt> that's what someone living on their own </garnt>
<connor> would say yeah I know right like I would </connor>
<garnt> I would have said the same thing if I </garnt>
<garnt> was living alone because it's like oh </garnt>
<joey> it's my clothes [ __ ] it who cares but </joey>
<joey> you know I have to take care of another </joey>
<connor> person's clothes and she doesn't quite </connor>
<connor> like that as Anki get like no you have </connor>
<joey> to do it this way well no it's more so </joey>
<joey> it's not so much Aki's preference it's </joey>
<joey> also just [ __ ] common sense don't </joey>
<joey> train don't try washing in the rain like </joey>
<connor> a bit out when it's raining sometimes </connor>
<connor> you put it out then it starts raining </connor>
<connor> you forget that it's raining she didn't </connor>
<connor> notice right away and it's a little </connor>
<connor> weight you're like I have to do it again </connor>
<garnt> yeah at that point that's just annoying </garnt>
<garnt> right because then you just if I feel </garnt>
<connor> like leaving out in the rain I have to </connor>
<garnt> re-wash it yeah because that washes out </garnt>
<connor> the good stuff about the uh launch right </connor>
<connor> I'm simply one man I cannot conquer </connor>
<joey> nature I've accepted that right so </joey>
<connor> that's why I bought a washing machine </connor>
<connor> that has a really good job you're trying </connor>
<garnt> to play God no no no no no because </garnt>
<garnt> here's the here's the thing right here's </garnt>
<connor> the thing because if if you dry your </connor>
<joey> clothes in the dryer then you're gonna </joey>
<connor> need to iron your shirts right yeah I I </connor>
<joey> feel I feel like if it's like naturally </joey>
<joey> dried sometimes if you get if you get </joey>
<joey> out just fresh out of the washing you </joey>
<joey> like you're like uh what's whip it whip </joey>
<joey> it yeah I was trying to think of the </joey>
<joey> English word because I just knew the </joey>
<joey> Thai word for it oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> whip the clothes whip it yeah and it </joey>
<joey> dries naturally you just get the creases </joey>
<connor> out and it's like it's like a nice </connor>
<joey> sometimes a lot of time unless you're </joey>
<joey> wearing like a really expensive shirt or </joey>
<joey> something that needs to be ironed yeah </joey>
<joey> like most of the time for like a natural </joey>
<joey> t-shirts </joey>

<connor> yeah like no I I do I remember when I go </connor>
<connor> to your house your trash for some reason </connor>
<connor> always smells Dreadful I don't know why </connor>
<connor> because my trash doesn't smell that bad </connor>
<connor> like the burnables sometimes yeah </connor>
<connor> because like we don't cook often right </connor>
<connor> so sometimes it's just we just we have </connor>
<joey> we have like a little Trash there but </joey>
<joey> especially in the summer sometimes it's </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] decomposes yeah yeah </joey>

<connor> you leaving this there yeah do you not </connor>
<connor> throw it out every week uh no there's </connor>
<connor> your problem </connor>

<connor> I get I get house full every week </connor>
<connor> sometimes have to go through like two </connor>
<garnt> bags we have to go through like two bags </garnt>
<garnt> of burnables a week like I don't know we </garnt>
<connor> finish off Foods we I can't finish my </connor>
<connor> food too what are you trying to say </connor>
<garnt> again how are you feeling what are you </garnt>
<connor> what is it sometimes sure Amazon comes </connor>
<garnt> in the Box it's burnable stuff you know </garnt>
<garnt> and whatever like that's cardboard no no </garnt>
<connor> no no like sometimes they keep material </connor>
<connor> that's like not the polystyrene and it's </connor>
<connor> not bubble wrap it's like the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that's burnable yeah and then like if </joey>
<connor> you you know for example like if you get </connor>
<garnt> ubereats for example right yeah and like </garnt>
<garnt> I get a lot of uber yeah like the boxes </garnt>
<joey> and stuff like that the food scraps </joey>
<garnt> that's all burnable oh I feel very you </garnt>
<connor> wash the boxes do you not washed wash </connor>
<joey> your depends on the box what type of </joey>
<garnt> material I did not wash the box I just </garnt>
<garnt> throw it all in the Box wow wow Joey </garnt>
<garnt> wait so what is what is your stinking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah what is your stick if you watch no </garnt>
<garnt> no because I don't push the box in the </garnt>
<connor> burnables the burnables is purely just </connor>
<connor> food waste well that's why it stinks </connor>
<connor> where are you putting the other burnable </connor>
<connor> yeah where are you putting all the </connor>
<joey> burnables are there you know some some </joey>
<joey> like a lot of the food like food and </joey>
<joey> also you know like if you have like um </joey>
<connor> certain materials if it gets oily or if </connor>
<joey> it gets stuck yeah it's it's </joey>
<joey> yeah wait wait so so when you order a </joey>
<garnt> pizza do you wash the pizza box when </garnt>
<garnt> it's done </garnt>
<garnt> um like I it goes on with the cardboard </garnt>
<joey> like I no no no no that's not you're </joey>
<connor> supposed to put in the burnables </connor>
<connor> the grease in it no because most of the </connor>
<connor> time if it comes in like a plastic tray </connor>
<garnt> or plastic whatever yeah uh you can just </garnt>
<joey> wash it and then put it in put it in the </joey>
<joey> Plastics yeah no no no plastic Chef yeah </joey>
<joey> Plastics yeah a lot of the food trays </joey>
<connor> aren't like they're not plastic anymore </connor>
<joey> they're like they're like cardboard like </joey>
<joey> yeah paper no no stuff most of it most </joey>
<connor> of it is plastic most like most of </connor>
<connor> everything I get is plastic most of this </connor>
<connor> if I could start so like what happens </connor>
<connor> right is uh is unfortunately most of my </connor>
<joey> burnables like pretty much 90 of my bone </joey>
<joey> balls is like pure food waste yeah and </joey>
<joey> that just we don't have a lot of food </joey>
<joey> waste right right so it just ends up </joey>
<joey> that a lot of food like just accumulates </joey>
<garnt> not a lot of food like a little bit of </garnt>
<garnt> food accumulates down because it's this </garnt>
<garnt> in the summer it just decomposes so cool </garnt>
<joey> that's all the more reason to take it </joey>
<connor> out every week even if it's not full I </connor>
<joey> have like a small bag that's attached to </joey>
<joey> like the kitchen counter yeah and </joey>
<joey> because I go through so much tea and tea </joey>
<joey> decomposes very fast yeah yeah that's </joey>
<joey> where all the tea and all the small bits </joey>
<joey> of food that I don't eat right right so </joey>
<garnt> that it's a tiny plastic bag that I can </garnt>
<connor> tie up and take out every week but it </connor>
<connor> doesn't smell yeah I think I think it's </connor>
<connor> not actually just the food it's just </connor>
<connor> because it's so humid as well that just </connor>
<connor> like you can definitely get that like </connor>
<connor> the humidity like condenses inside the </connor>
<garnt> bag so like it ends up that you have </garnt>
<garnt> like the garbage water in at the bottom </garnt>
<connor> as well yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> um you should definitely get through you </joey>
<joey> can throw out tiny bags you know that's </joey>
<joey> allowed huh you can it doesn't have to </joey>
<joey> be big bags of trash yeah you can throw </joey>
<joey> a little you can throw a little like </joey>
<joey> combini bag levels of trash sometimes </joey>
<garnt> just forget like yeah that sounds like a </garnt>
<connor> you problem this feels like Consulting </connor>
<garnt> people on they're recycling no I mean </garnt>
<connor> what I was going to say was so so </connor>
<connor> obviously the trash ended up smelling </connor>
<connor> like at least like sometimes they throw </connor>
<garnt> it up throw it out every week in the </garnt>
<garnt> summer but it's sometimes still just </garnt>
<connor> smelled right I really don't see it </connor>
<connor> smelly trash when I open the trash yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah so we had well in that in in my </joey>
<connor> case if it like if it you know I open up </connor>
<garnt> the trash and it like really stinks it </garnt>
<garnt> like that decomposing smell yeah I just </garnt>
<connor> double bag it so like I close up the </connor>
<garnt> first bag I get a second bag and I wrap </garnt>
<joey> that up again and then I don't even do </joey>
<garnt> that the snow's gone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because what we did was we there </garnt>
<garnt> was like this there was this device from </garnt>
<joey> uh Daiso right I think it's ISO or like </joey>
<joey> Amazon already red flags there was this </joey>
<joey> device be gone that uh was basically </joey>
<joey> like what like you know you know that </joey>
<joey> thing you put on the toilet to make it </joey>
<joey> smell nice when you whenever you fly </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it was like the equivalent of </joey>
<joey> that but you put it on the bottom of the </joey>
<joey> lid of the garbage yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and completely solve the issue our </joey>
<garnt> our our </garnt>
<garnt> bin smelled like grape it smells it </garnt>
<connor> smelled fresh Japan is the only country </connor>
<connor> on Earth that gives a [ __ ] what it's </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah [ __ ] smells like it smells </garnt>
<joey> fresh and I was like great this is this </joey>
<connor> is a [ __ ] amazing device oh my God </connor>
<joey> this is just saved me this has made my </joey>
<joey> kitchen like actually Pleasant to be in </joey>
<joey> yeah until until about like a month in </joey>
<joey> when we needed to uh take out the trash </joey>
<joey> and uh we noticed that what there were a </joey>
<joey> lot of flies like I don't know how the </joey>
<joey> Flies where the flies came from you </joey>

<connor> the lid and there's there's like a few </connor>
<connor> we can see like literally like a few </connor>
<connor> flags on the lid on the lid cover and I </connor>
<connor> was like what the [ __ ] how did this get </connor>
<connor> here and then and then I I had to wash </connor>
<connor> it right obviously because Sydney was </connor>
<connor> Sydney was scared of it so I had to wash </connor>
<connor> it and then I and then I was like okay I </connor>
<connor> got to take off the nice smelling thing </connor>
