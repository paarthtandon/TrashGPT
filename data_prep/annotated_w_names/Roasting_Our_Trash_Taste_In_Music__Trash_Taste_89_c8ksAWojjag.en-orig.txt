<garnt> a little bit and on with the episode </garnt>
<joey> why did you have to do that on the mic </joey>
<connor> why not pretty sure that's how down with </connor>
<connor> the sickness starts yeah </connor>
<joey> come on you can't right not for that was </joey>
<connor> too perfect in my impression I'm </connor>
<joey> disturbed </joey>
<connor> welcome to this episode of trash taste </connor>
<connor> and today we're gonna be comparing our </connor>
<garnt> musical tastes our trash taste in music </garnt>
<garnt> well good taste who knows maybe one of </garnt>
<joey> us says good taste in music I've said no </joey>
<garnt> one watching this unfortunately we can't </garnt>
<joey> plead the fifth in trash taste episodes </joey>
<connor> which I would love to do because I don't </connor>
<joey> really know how to describe music very </joey>
<garnt> well okay I will establish that very </garnt>
<joey> early on yeah see we've established that </joey>
<connor> with Connor but uh I also have been </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] myself with the thought of this </connor>
<connor> episode and especially when it came to </connor>
<connor> like picking my choices one it was super </connor>
<garnt> difficult because I didn't know like I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know how to describe why I liked </garnt>
<garnt> like the pics that I picked I just know </garnt>
<garnt> that they were important to me at a time </garnt>
<connor> in mind you gotta see why we like it </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] well I guess </garnt>
<connor> like on what basis did you pick it </connor>
<connor> because it's like I guess gone was </connor>
<joey> saying that like it was an important </joey>
<joey> like important artist in your life right </joey>
<joey> yeah mine is also kind of based on that </joey>
<joey> but in a sense yeah </joey>
<joey> okay actually first question how did you </joey>
<garnt> boys what what uh what what method did </garnt>
<connor> you use to like pick your artist I don't </connor>
<connor> know I don't know songs sound good I put </connor>
<joey> down yeah </joey>
<joey> do I remember the artist's name I'll put </joey>
<garnt> it down yeah yeah because because </garnt>
<garnt> actually like my biggest difficulty </garnt>
<garnt> right is that I like a lot of songs but </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I like a lot of artists </garnt>
<garnt> you know like I like like I like certain </garnt>
<garnt> songs from certain artists but like I I </garnt>
<garnt> feel like I'm more like I get into </garnt>
<garnt> genres of music or like I get into like </garnt>
<garnt> a certain genre then more than I get </garnt>
<garnt> into this one specific artist or this </garnt>
<garnt> one specific band and if I do it's like </garnt>
<connor> very very very rare I think I think </connor>
<connor> that's like pretty normal it's like food </connor>
<joey> you know it's like I like french food I </joey>
<connor> don't like all French food yeah so it's </connor>
<joey> like that's the way I see it but I do </joey>
<connor> like all Mexican food it's pretty </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good yeah so I guess we'll see </connor>
<joey> that's kind of how I view it for me it </joey>
<connor> was like for me it was like I'll you </connor>
<joey> know I couldn't just like reach into The </joey>
<joey> Nether and grab of a band because I </joey>
<joey> trolled if I did I if I did that I'm </joey>
<joey> sure there'd be like a million other </joey>
<joey> bands that I just completely forgot </joey>
<joey> about so I was like all right I'll split </joey>
<joey> it into genres so I was like all right I </joey>
<joey> like metal music </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that didn't make it any easier I'm </joey>
<connor> like I'm like SpongeBob riding the my </connor>
<connor> first my first four picks I'm like so </connor>
<connor> confident like oh this one oh that one </connor>
<connor> okay oh this one okay wait what else do </connor>
<garnt> I listen to yes yeah I I literally went </garnt>
<garnt> okay so uh you know we had our first </garnt>
<garnt> four or five picks that was you know </garnt>
<garnt> easy came to our head and then like I </garnt>
<garnt> went to my Spotify to try and see if I </garnt>
<garnt> could narrow down anything else that I </garnt>
<garnt> could like talk about or was important </garnt>
<garnt> to me and the more I scrolled the more </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like what the [ __ ] is my music </garnt>
<garnt> taste what what is actually this like </garnt>
<garnt> collection of songs that I've put </garnt>
<garnt> together that defines who I am I like </garnt>
<garnt> like I try to psychoanalyze this and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know what the [ __ ] what </garnt>
<joey> this [ __ ] that's what I love about doing </joey>
<joey> these three by three episodes is that </joey>
<joey> more so than our audience trying to </joey>
<joey> figure out what our tastes are we find </joey>
<connor> out what our own tastes are like sure </connor>
<connor> what do you want to change some of my </connor>
<garnt> picks but we'll go with it we'll go with </garnt>
<garnt> it well some of my picks were like I </garnt>
<garnt> chose one band but it was more of just </garnt>
<connor> like I wanted to pick one band just to </connor>
<connor> just just to talk about to talk about </connor>
<connor> several bands that I wanted to put in </connor>
<connor> this spot get those excuses out now </connor>
<connor> going yeah yeah set them up set them up </connor>
<connor> from that one time that I saved he loved </connor>
<garnt> this song I I also loved it yeah I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know I guess I guess it's been it's like </garnt>
<garnt> now that I think about it I have like </garnt>
<garnt> such a different relationship to music </garnt>
<garnt> than I do to like other forms of media </garnt>
<garnt> you know like I have like really games </garnt>
<garnt> that I could talk about forever about </garnt>
<garnt> like why I really [ __ ] like this game </garnt>
<garnt> same thing with movies same thing with </garnt>
<garnt> anime obviously but but like with </garnt>
<garnt> music's always been this one Enigma for </garnt>
<garnt> me because music's just been this one </garnt>
<garnt> thing where I like certain things I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why I like it I just like it </garnt>
<joey> it's because most people when they </joey>
<joey> listen to music yeah I just like it no </joey>
<joey> explanation </joey>
<joey> I think it's just because like most </joey>
<joey> people when they listen to music don't </joey>
<joey> think that deeply about what they're </joey>
<joey> listening to like there wasn't a guy </joey>
<joey> that like runs into the room and it's </joey>
<joey> like explain what you're listening to </joey>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> the drugs are good yeah yeah when </connor>
<connor> someone's like what's your tasting music </connor>
<connor> you can just like be like ah metal you </connor>
<joey> know yeah yeah and then it was like okay </joey>
<garnt> that's it right yeah like when people </garnt>
<connor> ask me what my taste in music is I'm </connor>
<connor> just like oh </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> yes I like salt I like everything like </joey>
<joey> like I like songs I hate I hate being </joey>
<connor> that guy who just goes I like about </connor>
<joey> everything </joey>
<connor> it's just like the generic answer but I </connor>
<garnt> really literally don't know how to </garnt>
<garnt> answer that question aside from you I </garnt>
<connor> like a bit of everything should I should </connor>
<connor> we stop giving excuses to ourselves this </connor>
<joey> is this is it oh we're gonna do trash </joey>
<joey> box again bringing back trash per </joey>
<joey> tradition yes all right so I guess I </joey>
<joey> don't want Joey to go first I don't want </joey>
<connor> to go first either because I don't want </connor>
<connor> I don't want to follow Joe </connor>
<joey> my goal for this uh episode is to not be </joey>
<joey> that pretentious music now we need you </joey>
<joey> to be that protective I don't want to be </joey>
<joey> that prediction because because you need </joey>
<joey> to like counter right so me and Connor </joey>
<joey> going oh but I'd like this I like the </joey>
<garnt> beeps and the boops and I'm being like </garnt>
<garnt> what the the voice sounded nice I like </garnt>
<garnt> the voice </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's it's called Corner first okay </garnt>
<garnt> perfect all right this is gonna be tough </garnt>
<connor> all right this is like my mom's gonna </connor>
<connor> walk in and there's just [ __ ] everywhere </connor>
<connor> and I'm like listen I can explain this </connor>
<connor> has a reason this is a weird three by </connor>
<connor> three I think yeah some of them you'll </connor>
<connor> expect some of them you won't also I </connor>
<connor> chose I try to choose a funny image for </connor>
<joey> some of them I can think of at least </joey>
<joey> three bands that's good that's good yeah </joey>
<joey> actually can you really yeah I thought </joey>
<garnt> only one no no there's at least I think </garnt>
<joey> of definitely one no I can I can think </joey>
<joey> of at least all right we'll find out </joey>
<joey> let's find out </joey>
<connor> I love the image I chose for the weekend </connor>
<connor> where did you get that image of the </connor>
<connor> weekend that's like a famous picture </connor>
<garnt> this is a weird one okay yeah I got I </garnt>
<garnt> got the three that I thought okay yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's good what was the three that you </garnt>
<joey> thought Punk weekend entertainment power </joey>
<connor> I knew he was going to put that on but </connor>
<connor> Joey knows I love Tame Impala yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it's very nice yeah yeah uh okay Bo </joey>
<garnt> Burnham on the left oh okay oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh that shouldn't surprise me do </garnt>
<joey> you know this is kind of like we'll get </joey>
<garnt> into this yeah right well this is more </garnt>
<joey> about silly pop in general okay okay I </joey>
<connor> don't know I don't think I know the rest </connor>
<connor> uh this is uh parcels </connor>
<connor> awesome yeah so they're kind of not well </connor>
<connor> known but it's very similar Vibes to </connor>
<joey> Daft Punk plus this is a breakbot over </joey>
<joey> there you know breakbot you don't know </joey>
<joey> you know breakbot yeah I know their song </joey>
<joey> though you know the the baby I'm Yours </joey>
<connor> the the ladies and gentlemen we got him </connor>
<connor> song oh that's that's breakbot that's </connor>
<garnt> break box okay the rest of their songs </garnt>
<garnt> are amazing okay I've listened to some </garnt>
<connor> of their music I like their songs </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] slap yeah I don't know if I know </connor>
<connor> them you know that you you've definitely </connor>
<garnt> heard them no you know the meme song </garnt>
<joey> probably </joey>
<joey> oh okay yeah </joey>
<garnt> now have you ever listened to that song </garnt>
<connor> without it being bass boosted I don't </connor>
<connor> really know that song okay so I mean </connor>
<connor> there's not much the band I listen to </connor>
<connor> the most it's definitely like these five </connor>
<joey> are the ones I listen to right now yeah </joey>
<joey> right I love the weekend yeah so you </joey>
<joey> also dropped the new album and I I </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] love that album that's a great </joey>
<joey> album I guess who do I want to talk </joey>
<garnt> about first who should I talk about who </garnt>
<joey> do you got me um that's I guess you've </joey>
<garnt> talked about who's the parcels yeah </garnt>
<joey> let's talk about Parcels because I don't </joey>
<connor> think so they're a band right now I </connor>
<connor> believe okay okay this is going to be </connor>
<connor> hard to talk about because I don't know </connor>
<connor> a lot about a lot of these people all I </connor>
<connor> know is that I play their music an awful </connor>
<connor> lot okay I think they're a band that is </connor>
<connor> based in Germany I don't think they are </connor>
<connor> German okay they live in Germany and </connor>
<connor> they do kind of like </connor>
<connor> it's very like Funk but also oh how do I </connor>
<connor> describe music to people I only know </connor>
<connor> peeps because like the guy the guy in </connor>
<garnt> that can I can literally see Connor's </garnt>
<joey> like brain cells committing suicide as </joey>
<joey> he's like trying to process because I'm </joey>
<joey> not gonna lie like I looked at this </joey>
<joey> picture of parcels and the guy at the </joey>
<joey> back in the middle looks like George </joey>
<joey> Harrison yeah he's weird right yeah they </joey>
<joey> look like beetles if they were around </joey>
<connor> today I don't know how to explain it </connor>
<connor> it's like they don't I don't know uh </connor>
<connor> Apostles are an Australian electoral pop </connor>
<joey> oh they're awesome Aussies oh okay okay </joey>
<connor> a lot of the things you can see like the </connor>
<connor> influence of like if you look Daft Punk </connor>
<connor> in the middle and you kind of like </connor>
<connor> little parts of death punk they've </connor>
<connor> experimented in yeah that's probably </connor>
<connor> what I like because it's like I think my </connor>
<joey> favorite uh Daft Punk album is like </joey>
<connor> discovery which I've put there yeah but </connor>
<connor> I don't think there's many songs in that </connor>
<connor> point I don't like right even the first </connor>
<connor> album is probably the one I don't like </connor>
<connor> the most because it's very like more </connor>
<connor> experimental as opposed to the other </connor>
<joey> stuff they did yeah it's almost like </joey>
<connor> rudimentary for sure and a lot of some </connor>
<connor> of the songs in the first album I cannot </connor>
<connor> remember the name of the first album the </connor>
<connor> one with the am on the front of it </connor>
<connor> literally I think it might just be </connor>
<garnt> called yeah I mean I feel like I only </garnt>
<connor> started listening to Daft Punk after </connor>
<connor> like was it the homework album yeah </connor>
<connor> homework was the first one where I </connor>
<joey> properly got into Daft Punk as well and </joey>
<joey> I think that's why most people got into </joey>
<joey> Darth Park like yeah the homework or </joey>
<joey> Discovery Well I think it was like was I </joey>
<connor> think the first big hit was around the </connor>
<connor> world wasn't it yeah yeah that was that </connor>
<joey> was like what put them on the map which </joey>
<connor> is the most repetitive song in existence </connor>
<connor> because a lot of these are artists that </connor>
<connor> I find that I have no idea who they are </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like YouTube recommends me </joey>
<joey> yeah you know who I'm surprised is not </joey>
<connor> on your 3x3 joji Josie I don't listen to </connor>
<joey> joji that much every time I go to your </joey>
<joey> house you're playing joji that is true </joey>
<connor> that is true I've played a lot of I </connor>
<connor> think I had phases of joji like I like </connor>
<connor> joji a lot you know like I like joji a </connor>
<joey> lot but that just sounds like a man face </joey>
<joey> I love joji's music but there's only </joey>
<connor> like four songs that I actually listen </connor>
<connor> to the rest of the album I don't really </connor>
<connor> like I think at least for the first five </connor>
<connor> I've listened to like everything from </connor>
<connor> Tame Impala weekend Daft Punk breakbot </connor>
<connor> yeah uh Parcels I've listened to like </connor>
<connor> everything and like so the parcels deaf </connor>
<connor> pumpkin brake ball I can just put on </connor>
<connor> their albums yeah yeah any any song and </connor>
<garnt> I'll have a good time and I'm like this </garnt>
<garnt> is great like if I'm in a car those are </garnt>
<garnt> the three I'm playing so this is all </garnt>
<garnt> like recent tastes then or as within the </garnt>
<connor> past five years unfortunately my my </connor>
<connor> tastes haven't really changed much in </connor>
<connor> the past six years it's kind of like I </connor>
<connor> have phases where I go into something </connor>
<connor> else but it always comes back to that </connor>
<joey> type of music what did you listen to </joey>
<joey> when you were a kid yeah this is a good </joey>
<connor> question well right in the bottom uh </connor>
<garnt> bottom right is Biffy clutter Jeffy </garnt>
<garnt> Clara no idea no idea I don't know but </garnt>
<connor> that album cover is cool right yeah </connor>
<connor> is a Scottish Rock Band yeah okay um and </connor>
<joey> uh they've done they've done </joey>
<connor> usually </connor>
<connor> supported for Foo Fighters a few times </connor>
<connor> oh okay so like if you like Foo Fighters </connor>
<connor> yeah and you want a more Scottish </connor>
<connor> version of Foo Fighters I might be </connor>
<connor> butchering and doing an absolute </connor>
<connor> disservice to Biffy Clara but I like Foo </connor>
<connor> Fighters a lot and the way I found them </connor>
<connor> is that a lot of my friends in school </connor>
<connor> really liked Foo Fighters and were when </connor>
<connor> we were growing up let's see some stuff </connor>
<connor> they like and then I got into Biffy </connor>
<joey> Clara from that and I went to watch them </joey>
<joey> live that was the first concert I ever </joey>
<connor> went to a beefy Clara concert yeah it </connor>
<joey> was amazing I loved it so much and uh I </joey>
<joey> don't know I would say uh this is a good </joey>
<joey> album to listen to they had the really </joey>
<connor> famous one that came out before this I </connor>
<connor> can't remember the name of it it's got </connor>
<joey> like two big colors on the front of it </joey>
<joey> got the name of it today's do they </joey>
<joey> singing like a Scottish accent as well </joey>
<connor> yeah so that's what I love about them </connor>
<joey> you know how sometimes a lot of bands </joey>
<connor> where they're like from Scotland but </connor>
<connor> they just sound American somehow yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but it's like actually like that </connor>
<connor> looking for is only Revolution that's it </connor>
<connor> only Evolution first album was homework </connor>
<connor> yeah homework was homework oh [ __ ] I </connor>
<connor> thought am came forward so it was that </connor>
<joey> first album </joey>
<connor> no no no no Random Access it's probably </connor>
<connor> like an EP or something yeah it might </connor>
<connor> have been yeah yeah oh my bad then yeah </connor>
<connor> that's that's what that's what I want </connor>
<connor> more bands to do though because like the </connor>
<connor> one thing I like seeing in the accent of </connor>
<connor> the country that they're from you should </connor>
<connor> yeah I think you'd quite like because </connor>
<connor> that's what I love about life that's </connor>
<connor> what I love about like Proclaimers right </connor>
<connor> because like when they've seen the 500 </connor>
<joey> Mile song they couldn't sound any more </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] Scottish than that song right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I find it so weird when I like hear </garnt>
<garnt> an artist right and you hear you hear </garnt>
<garnt> them sing right and then you hear them </garnt>
<connor> speak and there is like such a </connor>
<connor> dissonance between how they sing and how </connor>
<connor> they speak I remember one of the first </connor>
<connor> time I heard Adele speak right and it's </connor>
<connor> like the most northern accent </connor>
<garnt> you're British because like she doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> sound like anything like that when she </garnt>
<joey> sings you know it's only for good reason </joey>
<joey> could you imagine an Adele song in the </joey>
<garnt> accent that she speaks in like like </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way she would have blown up </garnt>
<joey> because no one would have been able to </joey>
<joey> understand through the rain </joey>
<joey> the Deep </joey>
<garnt> because like because like I had I had no </garnt>
<garnt> idea she was uh she was British until </garnt>
<joey> until I heard her speak and she was and </joey>
<joey> then I was like oh this is the most </joey>
<joey> northern person I've ever heard speak in </joey>
<joey> my life and I feel a lot of Australian </joey>
<joey> artists are like that too like Sia for </joey>
<garnt> example is like the most Australian </garnt>
<joey> sandwich </joey>
<joey> but when she sings everyone thinks </joey>
<joey> damn we like lose our accents for </joey>
<garnt> Summers I don't know why yeah like we </garnt>
<joey> can't like I I find it hard to I guess </joey>
<garnt> do an accent but it's not hard for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason it's less hard to sing an accent </garnt>
<joey> I don't know it's yeah it's weird right </joey>
<joey> that's I find it easier to sing in an </joey>
<joey> American accent than I do speak in an </joey>
<connor> American accent I don't understand at </connor>
<garnt> all how it works I know how accents were </garnt>
<connor> I don't know how it works when you sing </connor>
<garnt> though it's a different register I think </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's why when I hear an accent </garnt>
<garnt> in a song I it immediately like just </garnt>
<garnt> sticks out to me I guess because you </garnt>
<garnt> always hear like the neutral American </garnt>
<garnt> accent with like a lot of songs so when </garnt>
<garnt> you hear an accent that is just anything </garnt>
<garnt> that's not like the stereotypical </garnt>
<garnt> neutral American accent it immediately </garnt>
<garnt> just sticks out my mind so yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's what that's what I want more </garnt>
<garnt> artists to do though because like </garnt>
<connor> otherwise like everyone's just going to </connor>
<connor> sound the [ __ ] same right and it's </connor>
<connor> like if if there's the best way to make </connor>
<connor> you as an artist Stand Out is to just </connor>
<joey> sound different like just just sing in a </joey>
<joey> different accent because then </joey>
<joey> immediately you'll be like you'll listen </joey>
<joey> to a Biffy Clara song you'll be like oh </joey>
<joey> they sound Scottish must be a beefy </joey>
<connor> clarison yeah I mean they're very very </connor>
<connor> Scottish when you hear them right it's </connor>
<joey> fun could you imagine if Biffy Clyro </joey>
<joey> like obviously I don't know if tomorrow </joey>
<joey> right but you said they kind of sound </joey>
<joey> similar to Foo Fighters oh well I'd say </joey>
<connor> it's kind of in the same vein it's uh </connor>
<joey> like kind of feeling of the way they say </joey>
<joey> so would you say that if perchance the </joey>
<connor> beefy Clara lead singer </connor>
<connor> like Dave Grohl then it would sound like </connor>
<connor> Foo Fighters or no no I don't know it's </connor>
<connor> weird because the songs are so Scottish </connor>
<connor> if you listen to them you'll I think you </connor>
<connor> might like them they kind of seem like </connor>
<joey> your kind of band actually do you like </joey>
<joey> you love Foo Fighters right yeah I love </joey>
<joey> food Fighters yeah I think you'll </joey>
<joey> probably like that I like Foo Fighters </joey>
<joey> as well then you'll probably like them </joey>
<joey> as well if you like Scottish kind of </joey>
<joey> take on it again I I must be offending </joey>
<joey> like big massive massive fans is the </joey>
<connor> only way that I know because I don't </connor>
<connor> understand how to talk about music like </connor>
<connor> a normal human being yeah so there's any </connor>
<connor> way I can imagine explaining it uh but </connor>
<connor> also it was like the only the first </connor>
<connor> album like I ever bought out of like </connor>
<connor> like physical I think I only ever bought </connor>
<connor> like three albums in my life right right </connor>
<garnt> and I think this was the first one oh I </garnt>
<garnt> don't think now I think about I don't </garnt>
<connor> think I've ever bought an album I love </connor>
<connor> this so much I remember I loaded it onto </connor>
<connor> my PC oh no I put it on my Xbox yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and you could play the albums on </connor>
<connor> Xbox while playing another game I would </connor>
<joey> open up that [ __ ] menu the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> big one </joey>
<connor> the volume was just dreadfully like not </connor>
<connor> managed correctly so I was playing </connor>
<connor> Modern Warfare 2 and just don't know </connor>
<connor> what you're feeling like that it was </connor>
<joey> like it's great it was awesome no I had </joey>
<connor> I had a I had a CD player like the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like chunky no I had one of </connor>
<connor> those two yeah yeah you know what's the </connor>
<joey> first album I bought on what [ __ ] </joey>

<joey> but yeah I have a team Impala as well I </joey>
<joey> love Tame Impala my favorite album is </joey>
<joey> the slow Rush not the other one that </joey>
<joey> everyone uh that you see everywhere and </joey>
<connor> everyone oh currents yeah everyone so </connor>
<connor> this is a good album I love slow Rush </connor>
<connor> breathe deeper is like my favorite song </connor>
<connor> Tame Impala I love that [ __ ] song I </connor>
<connor> don't know driving to Tame Impala is </connor>
<connor> like another level of enjoying it I </connor>
<joey> don't know why Have you listened to his </joey>
<connor> side project Pond no uh if you liked him </connor>
<joey> and Paul you're like that it's probably </joey>
<connor> pretty well it's just Tame Impala but </connor>
<connor> harder will YouTube recommend it to me </connor>
<connor> I'll find out probably not basically </connor>
<connor> that's how my music is decided I'll have </connor>
<connor> the algorithm Gods decided if so yes and </connor>
<connor> listen but unfortunately sometimes they </connor>
<connor> recommends me uh artists there's like </connor>
<connor> one song I really like and I check out </connor>
<connor> the other stuff and I'm like yeah </connor>
<joey> there's lots of honestly yeah that who </joey>
<connor> is the one on the left above Bo Burnham </connor>
<garnt> oh this is uh you know them uh snail's </garnt>
<joey> house oh snap oh is that snail's house </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> no lyrics let's go yeah I didn't </joey>
<joey> recognize the art yeah I love snail's </joey>
<joey> house uh it's probably like if I can </joey>
<connor> encapsulate all my I guess I don't even </connor>
<garnt> if it's a disservice to call it weebie </garnt>
<connor> music it's kind of like it is </connor>
<garnt> it's it's a subculture of like we be </garnt>
<joey> he's half Japanese yeah like we be nerdy </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> I like how this one makes me feel I like </connor>
<connor> this one yeah I I there was a phase </connor>
<connor> there was a phase in my life where I </connor>
<garnt> feel like I listen how does it make you </garnt>
<garnt> feel happy I want to say happy emotional </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so there was like before I moved to </garnt>
<connor> Japan I want to say I listened to this </connor>
<connor> for like God like a whole year straight </connor>
<joey> were you prepping your Japan visit with </joey>
<connor> somebody before I even decided the movie </connor>
<connor> Japan and then weirdly it was like yeah </connor>
<connor> I just love this album a lot none of </connor>
<connor> this album Sorry I love all of his songs </connor>
<connor> yeah absolute all bangers all kind of </connor>
<connor> different moods even though like it's </connor>
<connor> the same style yeah I like how it </connor>
<connor> doesn't always feel the same there's a </connor>
<connor> bunch of variations shout out snail's </connor>
<connor> house banging if you like anime music or </connor>
<connor> anything like that or like electronic </connor>
<joey> you're probably like this it's really </joey>
<joey> good yeah I call I call this genre weeb </joey>
<joey> call weeb Core </joey>
<connor> it's weeb Daft Punk Yeah question mark I </connor>
<connor> don't know there's no there's no lyrics </connor>
<connor> it is </connor>
<connor> it feels like </connor>
<connor> a roller coaster you're on that you you </connor>
<connor> do not on it you're not on it but you're </connor>
<connor> wrong </connor>
<connor> how the [ __ ] do I describe music how do </connor>
<joey> you do this how does Anthony fantano do </joey>
<joey> this what the [ __ ] is he doing to say a </joey>
<garnt> lot of adjectives what this is like how </garnt>
<garnt> I describe this music it's like it's </garnt>
<joey> like if you go to an artist uh if you go </joey>
<joey> to an artist alley in any convention and </joey>
<joey> put that and take that experience put </joey>
<garnt> that in the genre of music that is like </garnt>
<connor> that's we pull basically right it's not </connor>
<connor> anime get that feeling before you go to </connor>
<connor> a convention but obviously not now </connor>
<connor> because you're miserable adults but yeah </connor>
<connor> you know a few earlier a few years </connor>
<joey> earlier when you're like kind of excited </joey>
<joey> you're like bubbly you're like oh yeah </joey>
<connor> so exciting that's the feeling like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] shoved it into a job that I can </connor>
<connor> just like anytime I want I can just take </connor>
<joey> it oh snails out snail's house to me is </joey>
<joey> like what it must sound like to live in </joey>
<joey> the Kirby Universe yes that's what it </joey>
<connor> sounds like to me it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> can your enemies come up yeah everything </connor>
<joey> is like everything everything is a good </joey>
<joey> suck on everything done it's like </joey>
<joey> everything is like round and like bubbly </joey>
<joey> and pastel colored and like overly happy </joey>
<connor> I could fall over but Flores made of </connor>
<connor> marshmallow exactly </connor>
<joey> in a good way not in like a no not like </joey>
<joey> a contest anyway it's just like it's </joey>
<connor> pillowy yeah dude it's great if you </connor>
<connor> wanna if you want to be you know feel </connor>
<connor> happy and have a good time and you you </connor>
<connor> want to feel Vibes try Snell's house and </connor>
<connor> you don't want lyrics because I honestly </connor>
<connor> sometimes Luke just get in the way </connor>
<garnt> nah no I do sometimes I just sometimes </garnt>
<connor> someone who doesn't even listen to </connor>
<connor> lyrics I feel something missing without </connor>
<connor> vocal traffic </connor>
<connor> other picks that we can talk by the way </connor>
<connor> uh the other one I want to talk about I </connor>
<connor> love the weekend and this is a weird one </connor>
<connor> because I for very long very very long </connor>
<connor> time just kind of felt indifferent </connor>
<connor> towards the weekend I felt like it was </connor>
<connor> that artist that just always got like </connor>
<connor> number ones but like yeah you know it's </connor>
<connor> kind of like whatever but then like the </connor>
<connor> last album came out and I was like okay </connor>
<connor> no no this is all fire this is all like </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] good okay I think he's </connor>
<connor> actually like insane and then I went </connor>
<connor> back and listened to the other stuff I </connor>
<joey> appreciated it way more now yeah seeing </joey>
<connor> how far he's grown and how much his </connor>
<joey> albums have like just improved yeah no </joey>
<joey> I'm deaf I was definitely I was like oh </joey>
<connor> this is just like another generic pop </connor>
<connor> guy yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly exactly and because like when I </connor>
<connor> listen to House of balloons which is his </connor>
<connor> first album I was like oh this is like </connor>
<connor> it's good but it's like nothing special </connor>
<connor> and then after hours came out with like </connor>
<joey> blinding lights Like That album I was </joey>
<joey> like okay okay I see you I see it and </joey>
<connor> then the new album was like all right </connor>
<connor> solidified you're pretty good dude this </connor>
<connor> this album it's been like out for like I </connor>
<connor> don't know like two months at this point </connor>
<connor> and I've literally just listened to that </connor>
<joey> album non-stop I think it's so good I </joey>
<joey> think the weekend actually is right now </joey>
<joey> the most streamed artist on Spotify it </joey>
<connor> wouldn't be number one right now like </connor>
<connor> this album has so many bangers that like </connor>
<joey> it's it's so fun talking about this </joey>
<joey> album to people because everyone I've </joey>
<joey> spoke to has a different favorite song </joey>
<joey> yeah it's not like other albums where </joey>
<joey> it's like okay Everyone likes uh X song </joey>
<joey> the most and it's very predictable it's </joey>
<joey> like everyone is just telling me other </joey>
<connor> songs they like the most I'm like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah that one is a banger that's that's </connor>
<joey> the best kind of artist though right </joey>
<connor> where it's like it's like you can't pick </connor>
<connor> like a top like I would think it's </connor>
<connor> really difficult for someone like the </connor>
<connor> weekend to make like a greatest hits </connor>
<connor> album yeah because it's like which songs </connor>
<connor> do we not put in that album right sure </connor>
<connor> it's because every song is great also I </connor>
<connor> love that like I wasn't paying attention </connor>
<connor> to lyrics but then I started actually </connor>
<connor> paying attention to the lyrics of this </connor>
<connor> current album I'm like [ __ ] man this is </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] sad yeah what's going on </connor>
<connor> with this man he's like yeah I've got to </connor>
<connor> see woman and she's [ __ ] another man </connor>
<joey> I'm so sad that she's [ __ ] another </joey>
<joey> man it's like what what he's like I </joey>
<joey> loved her and then she stepped on my </joey>
<joey> heart and I'm like whoa while in the 80s </joey>
<joey> like Funk basically placed in the </joey>
<connor> background but it's so good though it's </connor>
<connor> so good </connor>
<connor> oh my God it's like I want to marry a </connor>
<connor> bush we're best friends </connor>
<connor> how often do you listen to like Muse uh </connor>
<garnt> lyrics in never never literally so what </garnt>
<connor> made you listen to the lyrics in this </connor>
<garnt> song so many times after the point I </garnt>
<connor> started like just he would say stuff and </connor>
<connor> I was like hold up </connor>
<connor> rewind that rewind that hold up what </connor>
<connor> what I'm like Jesus Christ </connor>
<connor> oh my God </connor>
<connor> his therapist you know we're just </connor>
<joey> hearing yeah exactly and Bo Burnham you </joey>
<connor> know Bo Burnham was one of those things </connor>
<connor> where you kind of have to listen to the </connor>
<connor> lyrics to enjoy the music and it really </connor>
<connor> made me see that like okay because to me </connor>
<connor> comedy music before was like just uh </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] Lonely Island yeah yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> weird uh the younger thing but not </garnt>
<garnt> really yeah yeah I mean it's it was like </garnt>
<joey> parody music yeah where they were kind </joey>
<connor> of for me it would like they would take </connor>
<connor> a song or like an established like genre </connor>
<connor> of music and just kind of like parody </connor>
<garnt> that yeah </garnt>
<connor> um on like a surface level if that makes </connor>
<garnt> sense and Tim mentioned is obviously </garnt>
<garnt> very everyone always loved it yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but like even that the music I wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> like super into but I don't know when I </garnt>
<garnt> what I said I've watched Bo Burnham </garnt>
<garnt> specials like uh all of them like at </garnt>
<garnt> least four plus times now and I just </garnt>
<garnt> love it to death yeah and I really like </garnt>
<connor> the songs they're really funny but also </connor>
<connor> really good some of them are like </connor>
<connor> absolute bangers yeah yeah um I love the </connor>
<connor> one at the end of uh make happy you've </connor>
<connor> got the one where it is but it's when </connor>
<connor> he's talking talking about burritos and </connor>
<connor> put in the hand of the Pringle can I </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> but it's so good though because it's </connor>
<connor> like it starts off as a joke and then it </connor>
<connor> turns into this whole you know the </connor>
<connor> struggle of being a Creator and what </connor>
<connor> people expect things from you how do you </connor>
<connor> struggle with that you know and as uh as </connor>
<connor> somebody who creates stuff it was like </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] whoa this is [ __ ] wow this is </connor>
<joey> a weird yeah did you ever like get into </joey>
<joey> Lonely Island though back in there I </joey>
<connor> loved Lonely Island yeah I was when I </connor>
<connor> was like 14 I thought this [ __ ] was like </connor>
<connor> Peak comedy and music I was like I was </connor>
<connor> like oh my God he threw it on the ground </connor>
<garnt> oh my dude oh my God he put a dick in a </garnt>
<connor> box like what the [ __ ] this song he's </connor>
<connor> talking about it yeah yeah damn man this </connor>
<connor> one's about three sons </connor>
<garnt> you know because I was a kid and I </garnt>
<connor> thought she was hilarious like yeah I </connor>
<connor> just had sex I thought that was like the </connor>
<garnt> peak comedy for me it was like I'm on a </garnt>
<connor> bus and he just had T-Pain in there for </connor>
<connor> no [ __ ] reason it was that and like a </connor>
<joey> boss yeah I like a boss those were like </joey>
<connor> the most viewed [ __ ] videos on </connor>
<connor> YouTube yeah yeah yeah and they were </connor>
<connor> like I I literally I remember because I </connor>
<connor> have this weird memory of me playing </connor>
<connor> Black Ops one and just playing Lonely </connor>
<joey> Island songs on repeat while I'm playing </joey>
<joey> and I literally did nothing but listen </joey>
<joey> to the Lord I think everyone was like </joey>
<joey> that but to me it was like Bo Burnham is </joey>
<joey> like it kind of took the best of like </joey>
<joey> comedy and then added it with like </joey>
<connor> amazing funny uh stand up with amazing </connor>
<connor> lyrics and great and I love the song </connor>
<connor> it's like one minute long it's the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] Jeff Bezos song from inside I </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] love that one you've got to </garnt>
<garnt> listen to it because I've only seen </garnt>
<garnt> inside but like obviously it's one of </garnt>
<garnt> the few artists where I did listen to </garnt>
<garnt> the songs because he is like I guess I </garnt>
<joey> don't know how you'd categorize or put </joey>
<joey> like how do you categorize these kind of </joey>
<joey> songs but it's like it's like comedy </joey>
<joey> songs but it also like it he's his songs </joey>
<joey> also make you think yeah like the </joey>
<joey> message kind of like sticks with you </joey>
<joey> it's funny and deep </joey>
<connor> is it is it too deep for you I don't </connor>
<connor> know but uh it's the Evangelion of </connor>
<connor> Comedy music </connor>
<garnt> shut the [ __ ] up </garnt>
<connor> I'm kidding I'm kidding yeah I know I </connor>
<connor> want to put it on because I wanted to </connor>
<connor> talk about it and I thought that it was </connor>
<connor> really interesting </connor>
<connor> you know there's a lot of artists I </connor>
<connor> could have put on um like I could have </connor>
<garnt> put a I love pendulum uh I almost put </garnt>
<garnt> pendulum I went to watch pendulum live </garnt>
<joey> and it was probably like the greatest </joey>
<joey> subject experience ever I nearly died </joey>
<connor> like four times being stamped on to </connor>
<garnt> death but I must must have been like </garnt>
<connor> audio crack man dude it was insane so I </connor>
<connor> went to go and watch Penny time it was </connor>
<connor> in like a warehouse like this concrete </connor>
<connor> Warehouse yeah yeah and it was just like </connor>
<connor> some kind of like Satanic ritual and not </connor>
<connor> like because there was just this thing </connor>
<connor> was so tall yeah yeah so you just see </connor>
<connor> this massive like hunk of concrete and </connor>
<joey> then just depends on just going hard on </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah holy [ __ ] when I remember </joey>
<connor> when tarantula came on that was insane </connor>
<connor> everyone went insane it was just like </connor>
<connor> I've never been in such a like </connor>
<connor> intense atmosphere it was so funny I </connor>
<connor> don't normally like going to concerts </connor>
<connor> but that one was really fun because I </connor>
<connor> knew the lyrics as well </connor>
<connor> memory because listen I've heard that </connor>
<garnt> many lyrics to pendulum songs I mean </garnt>
<connor> every color uh it was very easy everyone </connor>
<connor> remembers the opening to Witchcraft yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah that's the one song everyone would </connor>
<connor> just start singing </connor>
<connor> I've been I've been listening to the </connor>
<connor> pendulum since I was like [ __ ] 12. </connor>
<joey> and I would listen to them they were </joey>
<connor> pretty inescapable back when yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> blood sugar yeah yeah I remember </garnt>
<connor> nightmares as well </connor>
<garnt> Prodigy what am I talking about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was like pendulum and Prodigy </garnt>
<connor> that's a [ __ ] massive yeah like they </connor>
<connor> were inescapable at a point where like I </connor>
<connor> remember like they came out as like the </connor>
<garnt> in the age where I just started going </garnt>
<garnt> clubbing and like you'd hear a pendulum </garnt>
<garnt> song and a prodigy song at least once in </garnt>
<connor> every [ __ ] so good man that's so good </connor>
<connor> but I I'd say like pendulum was </connor>
<connor> definitely like my early inspiration </connor>
<connor> before I found like I started really </connor>
<connor> getting into like Daft Punk right yeah </connor>
<connor> obviously Interstellar uh is amazing and </connor>
<joey> all the music videos just go so goddamn </joey>
<joey> well with the songs and not the movie </joey>
<connor> The Owl yeah not the soundtrack to the </connor>
<joey> movie but it's amazing and then you got </joey>
<joey> uh Andy yeah so this is just like City </joey>
<connor> pop this is the I can't stop loneliness </connor>
<joey> song have you heard that one yeah I </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] love that song I can't stop the </joey>
<joey> loneliness </joey>
<connor> I love I love silly pop um obviously I </connor>
<connor> don't know how to encapsulate all of </connor>
<connor> silly pop I could just put plastic love </connor>
<connor> and call it paper you know I feel like </connor>
<connor> City pop is definitely blown up in the </connor>
<connor> past what four or five years it's gone </connor>
<connor> crazy even the weekend on his new album </connor>
<connor> samples a lot of City Pops oh yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's so goddamn good it's like silly pop </connor>
<connor> with like the vocals of a god </connor>
<connor> um it's just amazing it's so good and </connor>
<connor> yeah I mean I absolutely adore City pop </connor>
<connor> it makes me nostalgic for that time that </connor>
<joey> I lived in Japan in the 80s and yeah </joey>
<joey> straight out the window yeah definitely </joey>
<connor> and was in the bubble period it's a good </connor>
<garnt> time good time wasn't literally plastic </garnt>
<connor> love that literally like kind of </connor>
<garnt> reinvigorated this city pop Trend that's </garnt>
<connor> like I think so because you want to hear </connor>
<connor> silly pop occasionally but I don't think </connor>
<connor> anyone the movement hadn't really taken </connor>
<connor> off I think plastic love is what really </connor>
<connor> got people into thinking about listening </connor>
<connor> to other songs it's like because I </connor>
<connor> definitely heard City pop songs before </connor>
<connor> this right but never enough to make me </connor>
<connor> be like is this a genre yeah yeah I </connor>
<joey> don't know what this is </joey>
<joey> just like such a mystery as to why it </joey>
<joey> was that song that bought like this I've </joey>
<joey> seen like documentaries on YouTube about </joey>
<joey> like why did plastic love blow up and </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and it's like because oh and I'm </joey>
<joey> just like because it's a good song yeah </joey>
<garnt> I mean like nothing more also like the </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube algorithm just works in [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> mysterious ways exactly yeah I mean </connor>
<garnt> there's two ways I get recommended songs </garnt>
<connor> it's memes or YouTube algorithm yeah </connor>
<garnt> honestly memes is like a really </garnt>
<connor> underrated way to discover new music </connor>
<connor> because a lot of memes is so good a lot </connor>
<connor> of meme songs are actually like good </connor>
<connor> songs yeah you don't you forget that </connor>
<connor> they're good songs because you've just </connor>
<connor> heard it bass boosted so many times </connor>
<connor> maybe I'm yours is ironically like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing song and it's so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stupid that I can't listen to the song </connor>
<connor> without thinking of ladies and gentlemen </connor>
<connor> we got it </connor>
<connor> done it's awful ruined my life no </connor>
<garnt> because I remember when I heard first </garnt>
<garnt> heard that song again he got recommended </garnt>
<garnt> to me on YouTube and I was just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> it's the meme song and I was away for </garnt>
<joey> like the bass boost to come in and then </joey>
<joey> it just it like it was just the a song </joey>
<joey> and I remember thinking damn why did </joey>

<connor> well that's my uh initial trash tasting </connor>
<garnt> music thank God that up before we move </garnt>
<garnt> on obviously uh obviously you talked </garnt>
<garnt> about a lot of your music that you're </garnt>
<garnt> into now but like what I'm curious what </garnt>
<garnt> you listen to as a kid like do you </garnt>
<joey> remember or did you just not watch any </joey>
<joey> of them like as early as you can </joey>
<connor> remember yeah Foo Fighters uh uh that </connor>
<connor> was a big one Buffy Clyro </connor>
<connor> uh pendulum Prodigy then I had that </connor>
<connor> weird phase where I was like yeah Calvin </connor>
<connor> Harris is really good I was actually </connor>
<connor> like this close enough Calvin Harris </connor>
<garnt> but like I would be lying if I'd like </garnt>
<garnt> didn't go through a phase where I </garnt>
<connor> listened to a [ __ ] ton of Calvin Harris </connor>
<connor> I'm not immune to [ __ ] taste right there </connor>
<connor> was a point where I listened to a lot a </connor>
<joey> lot of Calvin Harris did you listen a </joey>
<joey> lot of David Guetta as well oh God yeah </joey>
<connor> I did you know you know when you listen </connor>
<connor> to that uh Swedish House airplanes in </connor>
<connor> the night sky song yeah like how about I </connor>
<garnt> just want all music that sounds exactly </garnt>
<garnt> like this yeah like IPS you know </garnt>
<garnt> when I have like no no [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> personality of my own I would just </garnt>
<garnt> listen to what the charts told me </garnt>
<connor> like this song I love that new Calvin </connor>
<connor> Harris song you know I I felt like I </connor>
<connor> almost like listen to that music just so </connor>
<connor> I could have I could keep up with all </connor>
<connor> people who are talking to keep up with </connor>
<garnt> because I didn't want to get bullied for </garnt>
<connor> liking like [ __ ] Scottish bands that </connor>
<garnt> no one talking about what's wrong with </garnt>
<connor> that well you know it was a lot of </connor>
<garnt> social pressure yeah like me listening </garnt>
<garnt> to Calvin Harris was the equivalent of </garnt>
<garnt> me watching football matches so like I </garnt>
<garnt> could have something to talk about he's </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yeah you see her that's true </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah you see the latest football </garnt>
<garnt> match oh yeah the new captain have a </garnt>
<garnt> song came out that was pretty good </garnt>
<connor> wasn't it but like I feel like I never </connor>
<connor> really had a defined music taste because </connor>
<connor> I was kind of you know as well back then </connor>
<connor> I had to uh find a means to get a hold </connor>
<connor> of it yeah and that often was a big </connor>
<joey> limiting factor in what I could discover </joey>
<joey> I did the opposite I was like oh I </joey>
<connor> listened to that recent Calvin Harris </connor>
<joey> song [ __ ] [ __ ] in it </joey>
<garnt> I've never had it well you have good </garnt>
<joey> taste music you have good taste as well </joey>
<connor> I didn't even like think that I was like </connor>
<connor> I didn't even listen to it I'm just </connor>
<joey> giving you a hard time </joey>
<connor> all right what should we get on with the </connor>
<connor> next pick all right you want to pick it </connor>
<joey> or should I you can go for a man a meal </joey>
<garnt> gone it doesn't really matter </garnt>
<garnt> it matters to me </garnt>
<connor> it's </connor>
<joey> I see a t oh it's me there you go you're </joey>
<joey> saved I guess okay thank you thank God </joey>
<joey> Joey can carry the podcast </joey>
<joey> I finished talking about it okay so </joey>
<joey> um so how I tried to pick this I tried </joey>
<garnt> to pick this I tried to pick music and </garnt>
<garnt> artists and songs that really defined </garnt>
<garnt> every stage of my life so this might be </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit random we're gonna see </garnt>
<garnt> Peppa Pig the full album </garnt>
<connor> music </connor>
<connor> spider so </connor>
<connor> that's on it </connor>
<garnt> all right Ashley put it up Ashley put it </garnt>
<connor> up go on </connor>
<connor> I I this this [ __ ] will not </connor>
<connor> leave my record yes yes </connor>
<garnt> okay okay so </garnt>
<garnt> um so I guess I'll go through it from </garnt>
<joey> right from left to right sorry you know </joey>
<joey> all these I don't know the one I don't </joey>
<garnt> know this one you don't know that one </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's the uh that's one of the </garnt>
<garnt> two Japanese ones on their job I know </garnt>
<connor> three Japanese ones so uh top left is </connor>
<connor> Muse </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah we got music we've </connor>
<connor> got muser and then we have bradio and </connor>
<connor> then we have the Kooks or is it no it's </connor>
<connor> just Kooks right </connor>
<garnt> um we have the killers we have Michael </garnt>
<garnt> Jackson MJ we have MJ come on uh we have </garnt>
<garnt> Zuta Mayo uh we have Daft Punk Arctic </garnt>
<garnt> Monkeys and obviously the uh I don't </garnt>
<joey> know why I thought that was Ben </joey>
<connor> Stiller's not it's not like that bad </connor>
<joey> I was like damn Ben still God all right </joey>
<connor> all right so where do you want to start </connor>
<connor> off </connor>
<connor> you like them that much okay so the okay </connor>
<joey> so the reason I put the Kooks there </joey>
<joey> right all Kooks like is that the Kooks </joey>
<connor> or is it just Cooks I'm obviously a bad </connor>
<connor> fact is it okay that's that's what I </connor>
<connor> thought this is specifically inside in </connor>
<connor> the Inside Out the album because it's </connor>
<connor> one of the few albums I actually have </connor>
<joey> listened to all of the way </joey>
<joey> um and the reason I put the goose in </joey>
<joey> there is because they are originally a </joey>
<connor> band from Brighton right and you've got </connor>
<joey> to represent that home no no no exactly </joey>
<connor> but like I did not know this yeah I did </connor>
<connor> not know this for the longest time right </connor>
<connor> but listening to their music and </connor>
<connor> listening to this album especially </connor>
<connor> before I found out they were from </connor>
<connor> Brighton I was just like [ __ ] this </connor>
<connor> literally epitomizes the Brighton Vibe </connor>
<connor> and like what it is like being a </connor>
<connor> teenager growing up in Brighton right it </connor>
<connor> literally like epitomizes the vibe of </connor>
<connor> like going to like this random [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> beach party or just going to a random </connor>
<connor> house party in England sometimes </connor>
<connor> you know trying to pick up chicks or </connor>
<connor> just you know just heavily been drinking </connor>
<connor> or whatever right right like if I had to </connor>
<connor> pick a show for example a TV show that </connor>
<connor> epitomized British Teenage life it is </connor>
<connor> the in-betweeners right if you've seen </connor>
<connor> the in-betweeners I've not seen a more </connor>
<connor> accurate representation of what it is to </connor>
<connor> be like growing up uh growing up at </connor>
<connor> about like college age which college age </connor>
<connor> is kind of like high school age yeah and </connor>
<connor> to me the Kooks is if you listen to this </connor>
<connor> album it is growing up in Brighton </connor>
<connor> College age so about 16 to about 16 to </connor>
<garnt> 18 years old </garnt>
<garnt> um and that's why it's on there uh I </garnt>
<garnt> feel like I only know one song I think </garnt>
<connor> there are like two big songs on there </connor>
<connor> there's like naive and like yeah so nice </connor>
<connor> it's really like perfect I'm just like </connor>
<connor> really like drawn out yeah like every </connor>
<joey> every word I think and I think it's like </joey>
<joey> she moves in her own way </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> that one is like burned into my hair it </connor>
<garnt> is all the time in the UK that was that </garnt>
<garnt> was the song that like introduced me to </garnt>
<garnt> the Kooks but like I feel like those are </garnt>
<garnt> like the two most like naive and she </garnt>
<connor> moves in her own way because like I like </connor>
<connor> the two most poppy songs in their album </connor>
<connor> because definitely their later albums </connor>
<connor> they got like what they like way go way </connor>
<connor> like way on the poppy side of things </connor>
<connor> like they were kind of like kind of like </connor>
<connor> uh Maroon 5 in that sense like you know </connor>
<connor> you compare like early Maroon 5 albums </connor>
<joey> uh to like the latest Maroon 5 albums </joey>
<joey> and it's just like okay this is night </joey>
<joey> and day yeah this is night in there this </joey>
<joey> is like okay there was a point where I </joey>
<garnt> like Maroon 5 and then there's this like </garnt>
<garnt> Billboard 100 maroon 5. </garnt>
<connor> you don't like sugar </connor>
<garnt> no no sugar but I will stick up for like </garnt>
<garnt> not even Maroon 5 I I think Adam Maroon </garnt>
<garnt> 5 was actually pretty damn good </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah I mean like I don't really </garnt>
<garnt> know what else to say about the Kooks </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's why the Kooks is on there </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to have a good band there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's it's a good man it's a good </garnt>
<garnt> Indie band okay so a lot of these uh so </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these a lot of bands I wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to put on were of course Indie bands </garnt>
<garnt> especially a lot of Indie bands from </garnt>
<joey> England I guess because I did I did go </joey>
<joey> through I think the the period of life </joey>
<joey> in my life where I went where I listened </joey>
<joey> to the most music is probably in like </joey>
<joey> between high school and University where </joey>
<joey> I listen to a lot of [ __ ] Indie bands </joey>
<joey> um and a lot of that was because I was </joey>
<joey> actually in a band myself I don't I </joey>
<joey> don't know if were you yeah I don't know </joey>
<joey> if I've ever talked about this no you've </joey>
<connor> never we've never talked about it I've </connor>
<joey> never mentioned </joey>
<joey> you've mentioned that you used to play </joey>
<garnt> guitar like a little bit this feels like </garnt>
<connor> something you should mention more yeah </connor>
<joey> this feels like a personality trait I </joey>
<garnt> feel betrayed that you haven't mentioned </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah I mean um I guess like okay so </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I gotta get into this story then </garnt>
<garnt> okay let's okay let's let's let's start </garnt>
<joey> right in the beginning next you're gonna </joey>
<garnt> say that you were a member of the Kooks </garnt>
<garnt> there's a platinum selling artist yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so I guess the reason I wanted to </garnt>
<connor> learn how to play a guitar in the first </connor>
<connor> place is my first choice on that it's </connor>
<connor> Muse </connor>
<connor> um I remember the first time hearing </connor>
<connor> plug-in baby and just hearing that riff </connor>
<connor> and like just don't like something just </connor>
<connor> clicked in my mind and I was just like I </connor>
<connor> need to be able to play this </connor>
<connor> I need to be able to play This and like </connor>
<connor> I remember before like my um my mom had </connor>
<connor> always tried to get me to learn guitar </connor>
<connor> because she's just like you know people </connor>
<connor> play guitar I look cool you know my mom </connor>
<connor> thinks it's cool and I'm just like she </connor>
<connor> she set me for like guitar lessons as a </connor>
<connor> kid and I never really took them </connor>
<connor> seriously right I was just like I'm </connor>
<connor> doing this because my mom wants me to do </connor>
<garnt> it right I I can play [ __ ] Oasis </garnt>
<garnt> Wonderwall whatever the [ __ ] you know </garnt>
<joey> which I would argue is the only song you </joey>
<garnt> need to know yeah the only song you need </garnt>
<connor> to know okay I was just like whatever </connor>
<connor> and I only we only owned a acoustic </connor>
<joey> guitar at the time yeah and then I went </joey>
<connor> I remember I went into Secondary School </connor>
<joey> which is like just I guess just before </joey>
<connor> high school age in in the UK or is it </connor>
<connor> high school age I don't know Secondary </connor>
<connor> School yeah </connor>
<connor> um and I remember the first time hearing </connor>
<connor> plug-in baby and I was just like why did </connor>
<connor> they never teach us how to play this in </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] guitar lessons what the [ __ ] I I </connor>
<connor> know how to play a barcode uh a bar </connor>
<connor> chord sorry yeah </connor>
<connor> um I'd like like what do I need to do to </connor>
<connor> learn how to play this and so the first </connor>
<connor> thing I did was I uh did your acoustic </connor>
<connor> yeah I ditched my acoustic I signed up </connor>
<connor> for guitar lessons uh in my in my </connor>
<connor> secondary school and I was like mother I </connor>
<connor> would like an electric guitar </connor>
<connor> did she get you on huh did she get you </connor>
<connor> one uh she I remember we we got like a </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] cheap ass electric guitar </connor>
<connor> that was like Basics no not even Amazon </connor>
<connor> Basics I got one lap that was like on </connor>
<connor> like a car boot sale or something like </connor>
<connor> that which which was what which was a </connor>
<connor> trick yeah yeah that did a trick so </connor>
<joey> um so I can't remember what my first </joey>
<joey> guitar was it was it was it was a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> guitar it was one where I had to like </joey>
<joey> replace all of the [ __ ] strings on </joey>
<joey> the guitar because all of the strings </joey>
<joey> were like rusted already uh didn't like </joey>
<joey> at that point I didn't even know how to </joey>
<joey> like properly tune or uh or like change </joey>
<joey> the strings of a guitar so like my </joey>
<joey> teacher at the time had to uh teach me </joey>
<joey> how to do it but uh yeah I mean um </joey>
<connor> that's when I that's like that's when I </connor>
<connor> first properly got into learning how to </connor>
<connor> play the guitar </connor>
<connor> um and uh and at that point as the point </connor>
<connor> where I was building up my skill level </connor>
<connor> to uh you know be able to play plug-in </connor>
<connor> baby which eventually I did yeah and uh </connor>
<connor> and then actually now that I think about </connor>
<garnt> it once I learn how to play plug-in baby </garnt>
<garnt> I that my drive to like improve my skill </garnt>
<connor> level just kind of just stopped so </connor>
<joey> average people I I I I'm like never need </joey>
<garnt> to play it again you know when I like </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you've reached the goal </garnt>
<garnt> you set for yourself and I just never </garnt>
<garnt> found a next goal to set for myself so </garnt>
<connor> like for me it was just like play guitar </connor>
<connor> to play plug-in baby I can do it now </connor>
<garnt> mother and I can stop playing the guitar </garnt>
<connor> now dispose of this I always wanted to </connor>
<garnt> play Guitar Hero more than one of the </garnt>
<garnt> play guitar yeah so uh yeah and then and </garnt>
<garnt> then so then in that time uh one of my </garnt>
<garnt> friends he he wanted to start a band and </garnt>
<garnt> I was like you know why not I've got </garnt>
<garnt> nothing better to do at this time you </garnt>
<garnt> know I'm uh I can play the guitar I </garnt>
<joey> might as well use it for some first day </joey>
<joey> lessons do you know plugging me </joey>
<joey> um and so yeah I mean I joined because I </joey>
<joey> wasn't doing really doing anything with </joey>
<joey> the guitar aside from trying to learn </joey>
<joey> how to play plug plug-in baby so I'm </joey>
<joey> just like man maybe I'll just join the </joey>
<joey> guitar maybe I'll just join a band for </joey>
<connor> fun yeah </connor>
<connor> um and I mean I don't think we were the </connor>
<connor> greatest band but yeah did you ever play </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah we played like a bunch of gigs </connor>
<connor> actually I got like what yeah yeah I've </connor>
<connor> like I think the biggest crowd we played </connor>
<connor> in from in was kind of like 500 to a </connor>
<joey> thousand people what what okay okay what </joey>
<garnt> oh my God how have you never told the </garnt>
<garnt> story Okay so </garnt>
<garnt> okay so I remember when we were trying </garnt>
<joey> to think of a band name I I think we </joey>
<joey> have like a [ __ ] stupid Bad Name </joey>
<joey> they're always stupid okay our band name </joey>
<joey> we we like </joey>
<joey> we like try to like brainstorm a bunch </joey>
<connor> of [ __ ] band names and like nothing </connor>
<connor> just seemed to click because nothing </connor>
<connor> everything sounded either like too metal </connor>
<connor> or you know too campy or whatever uh and </connor>
<connor> then we just went on we just went with </connor>
<connor> the name nine and a half pounds </connor>
<connor> because uh because the month before my </connor>
<connor> mate uh one of the lead singer went on a </connor>
<connor> diet and he lost nine and a half pounds </connor>
<connor> and that was like we we were just like </connor>
<connor> you know what we don't know what we're </connor>
<connor> gonna call our bands let's just use this </connor>
<connor> as just the name until we think of the </connor>
<connor> actual name yeah the band and then that </connor>
<joey> just and then that was just like that's </joey>
<joey> amazing as with a lot of names you know </joey>
<garnt> uh you you just sticks right you pick a </garnt>
<garnt> filler name and you just like can't be </garnt>
<connor> asked to change it now </connor>
<connor> so you would just like play any song </connor>
<connor> what kind of songs did you play um so </connor>
<connor> I'm used that just means no I mean uh we </connor>
<connor> write our own songs </connor>
<connor> um so we'd go uh so my mate had uh we uh </connor>
<joey> we went to the drummer's house because </joey>
<joey> uh my the our drum you always gather at </joey>
<joey> the drama you always gather at the </joey>
<joey> drama's house because you can bring your </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] guitar you can bring your you </joey>
<connor> know you can bring your you can bring </connor>
<connor> your bass or whatever to someone's house </connor>
<connor> you can't you can't transport a drum kit </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you know what I mean so </connor>
<connor> um at first we went to the drama's house </connor>
<connor> to practice and then and write songs and </connor>
<joey> eventually we had like this really like </joey>
<joey> this really like [ __ ] old music </joey>
<connor> studio that that a friend of a friend of </connor>
<connor> a friends yeah Dad owned you know you </connor>
<connor> know that kind of new kind of thing and </connor>
<connor> you walk in it's like a back alley and </connor>
<connor> like the [ __ ] door hinges like like </connor>
<connor> broken in like 10 million times or </connor>
<connor> something and you're like I might get </connor>
<connor> stabbed here but they have a drum kit </connor>
<connor> and a recording studio yeah so whatever </connor>
<connor> let's just it's amazing and I remember </connor>
<joey> the biggest uh the biggest gig we played </joey>
<connor> was like we signed up to what was the </connor>
<joey> equivalent of like a battle of the bands </joey>
<connor> you had an anime Arc yeah so so okay so </connor>
<garnt> like this is just this is just back no </garnt>
<garnt> no part of the reason why I got so into </garnt>
<garnt> Beck and why beg was one of my like my </garnt>
<connor> favorite you say this when you're </connor>
<garnt> talking about Ben yeah I think I did </garnt>
<joey> mention it I must have mentioned I would </joey>
<joey> remember if you were like yeah by the </joey>
<joey> way I was in a battle of the bands and </joey>
<joey> performance I think I would remember the </joey>
<joey> name nine and a half pounds okay okay so </joey>
<garnt> we were just a band for fun we weren't </garnt>
<garnt> taking this seriously </garnt>
<garnt> um but like we we met we met like a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of bands who were like [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> that came out of our school because like </garnt>
<garnt> I guess part of the other reason why we </garnt>
<garnt> formed the band was because we are I the </garnt>
<garnt> school I went to was a performing art </garnt>
<garnt> school so a lot of people there were </garnt>
<garnt> doing were doing Performing Arts whether </garnt>
<garnt> it was theater or music or something so </garnt>
<garnt> there were like some people in my school </garnt>
<garnt> in like my classmates who were taking </garnt>
<connor> like music really really seriously right </connor>
<connor> we were just like whatever I'm learning </connor>
<connor> to so I I'll just play I'll just play in </connor>
<connor> the band because whatever that seems </connor>
<connor> like a cool way to spend my time </connor>
<connor> um and so I remember for this battle of </connor>
<connor> the bands we literally had to like </connor>
<connor> audition to get into this battle of mans </connor>
<connor> right and it was like it was a pretty </connor>
<connor> big deal at the time because this gig </connor>
<connor> was pretty famous for like a lot of </connor>
<connor> students and there was like there was </connor>
<connor> sometimes there would even be people </connor>
<connor> from music labels who would attend like </connor>
<connor> events like this yeah so we weren't like </connor>
<connor> we weren't expecting anything to come </connor>
<connor> out of this we were just like you know </connor>
<connor> what they're holding auditions at our </connor>
<connor> school and we could sign up so we're </connor>
<connor> just like what have we got to lose we </connor>
<connor> didn't really we we didn't really expect </connor>
<connor> anything because we didn't really think </connor>
<connor> that we were that good of bands right uh </connor>
<connor> so we obviously we obviously auditioned </connor>
<garnt> um and it was literally like the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> X Factor kind of thing kind of deal </joey>
<joey> right because the big Golden Buzzer in </joey>
<garnt> the middle yeah yeah because literally </garnt>
<garnt> we uh because because our school was a </garnt>
<garnt> performing art so we had like a theater </garnt>
<connor> set up right and the theater we had like </connor>
<connor> a drum kit in the middle and we had </connor>
<connor> there were judges on there oh wow and we </connor>
<connor> had to uh we had to play two songs right </connor>
<connor> I read to play two songs in front of the </connor>
<connor> judges and I remember God plays plugin </connor>
<joey> baby yeah and the Crowd Goes </joey>
<connor> outside </connor>
<garnt> everyone gets up on that okay yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then uh I remember we were like we were </garnt>
<connor> hearing some of our [ __ ] some of the </connor>
<connor> other bands that were playing before us </connor>
<connor> yeah and we were just like [ __ ] my life </connor>
<connor> we have to follow these guys </connor>
<connor> follow these guys what the [ __ ] yeah and </connor>
<connor> so and so I remember thinking we're not </connor>
<connor> going to get on because there were a lot </connor>
<connor> of other bands that were [ __ ] better </connor>
<connor> than us I'm gonna say that yeah but so </connor>
<connor> we went on uh we just we just played our </connor>
<connor> songs you know the the judges you know </connor>
<connor> wave us off whatever we didn't expect </connor>
<connor> much and so we didn't get into the </connor>
<connor> Battle of the Bands we actually became </connor>
<connor> like a backup choice just in case just </connor>
<connor> just in case </connor>
<connor> uh and so we went on with our lives and </connor>
<connor> then we get a call like a week before </connor>
<connor> the event </connor>
<connor> and they were just like uh so one of the </connor>
<connor> one of the bands has dropped out and we </connor>
<garnt> got an extra space in this battle of the </garnt>
<garnt> bands concerts </garnt>
<garnt> um do you wanna do you want to come on </garnt>
<joey> and we're like what the [ __ ] this this </joey>
<joey> is literally Carol on Tuesday like </joey>
<garnt> that's exactly what happened in Carolina </garnt>
<garnt> and so we were just like I mean yes but </garnt>
<garnt> how the [ __ ] can we prepare in a week </garnt>
<garnt> yeah for this battle of the bands which </garnt>
<garnt> is which is like other bands have </garnt>
<garnt> prepared for for like a good month or </garnt>
<garnt> two yeah you know like like </garnt>
<garnt> playing with a band is [ __ ] more much </garnt>
<garnt> more difficult than you imagined it if </garnt>
<garnt> you've never played in the band before </garnt>
<connor> uh because you're in a live setting </connor>
<connor> right and a lot of things can go wrong </connor>
<connor> and you need to be on the same </connor>
<connor> wavelength as your other band members </connor>
<connor> we've had I've played plenty of gigs and </connor>
<connor> some gigs are better than others </connor>
<connor> sometimes you make mistakes and </connor>
<connor> sometimes you know you you're not in </connor>
<connor> sync with the rest of the band and you </connor>
<connor> need you know you need to be tight you </connor>
<connor> need like the performance needs to be </connor>
<connor> tight so you need a lot of practice so </connor>
<connor> uh we said yes but we didn't really we </connor>
<connor> didn't really have time to practice the </connor>
<connor> songs that we wanted to practice </connor>
<connor> um but there was like well there was </connor>
<connor> like one joke song that we had practiced </connor>
<connor> uh we had practice before because we </connor>
<connor> didn't really have any gigs coming up </connor>
<connor> and it was I just had sex while no no </connor>
<connor> it's it was an indie rock version of Hit </connor>
<connor> Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears </connor>
<connor> awesome it was it was it was Hit Me Baby </connor>
<connor> One More Time by Britney Spears oh yeah </connor>
<connor> and and we were just like well we don't </connor>
<connor> really have time to practice some of our </connor>
<connor> more complicated song so let's just put </connor>
<connor> that in the set whatever whatever right </connor>
<connor> um and I remember we had the </connor>
<connor> conversation before of um we always </connor>
<joey> wanted the experience of like having the </joey>
<joey> audience you know I having the audience </joey>
<joey> sing part of the song yeah like like a </joey>
<joey> lot of bands together yeah of course and </joey>
<joey> uh and I remember we were having this </joey>
<joey> discussion of you know the perfect point </joey>
<garnt> of this song would be uh what's what's </garnt>
<garnt> the line </garnt>
<garnt> um how does it take me baby one time go </garnt>
<garnt> again </garnt>
<joey> I think he's thinking about the chorus </joey>
<connor> right yeah yeah uh Me Baby One More Time </connor>
<garnt> no no here it is is when the the line </garnt>
<joey> goes my loneliness is killing me yeah </joey>
<connor> and uh yeah and we're all saying that </connor>
<joey> would be an awesome point for like the </joey>
<connor> audience like chime in but like we were </connor>
<joey> just to do the end to do the and die </joey>
<connor> because that would be that would be like </connor>
<connor> an awesome feeling yeah of course but we </connor>
<connor> were just like no we're not gonna do it </connor>
<connor> because like what's more embarrassing </connor>
<connor> than like stuff because then stopping a </connor>
<connor> song letting the audience sing and and </connor>
<connor> no one sings like we did not have the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ball stuff right </connor>
<joey> um and so I remember </joey>
<joey> I remember we we go to the battle of the </joey>
<joey> bands and it's like the biggest audience </joey>
<joey> so far normally we're used to performing </joey>
<joey> for like 50 to 100 people so this was </joey>
<joey> like which is which is still </joey>
<joey> up but like this was like about 500 </joey>
<joey> people it was that like Punk was it was </joey>
<joey> that like Concord 2 which uh if you know </joey>
<connor> in uh if if you know brights and Congo </connor>
<connor> too it's actually one like one of the </connor>
<connor> biggest venues that's not like the </connor>
<connor> Brighton that's like that's not the </connor>
<connor> bright the main Brighton venue it's like </connor>
<connor> a lot of big Indie bands go there that's </connor>
<connor> cool </connor>
<connor> um and so uh we go on stage and we're </connor>
<connor> just like guys we're not going to take </connor>
<connor> them seriously a lot of these bands are </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing we're just gonna have </connor>
<connor> fun we're just so anime we're just we're </connor>
<connor> just going to have fun right </connor>
<connor> um and I remember so we go on stage we </connor>
<connor> play the set and this is this is me like </connor>
<connor> playing on pure adrenaline so we're so </connor>
<connor> we're not practiced at all we're not as </connor>
<connor> tight as we want to be in terms of our </connor>
<connor> performance but I seeing like for some </connor>
<connor> reason just like playing in front of </connor>
<connor> like the biggest crowd kind of like </connor>
<connor> hyped us up and I can't really explain </connor>
<connor> the feeling but it just like something </connor>
<connor> that day just clicked you know you know </connor>
<connor> you know some days where you're just </connor>
<connor> like in the zone like that day for some </connor>
<connor> reason all of us were just in the zone </connor>
<connor> we were like our Peak Performance right </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I I remember we uh we </connor>
<connor> decided because because we're gonna meme </connor>
<connor> it up we decided we were going to end it </connor>
<connor> on hit me uh on Hit Me Baby One More </connor>
<connor> Time yeah uh the rest of it was just </connor>
<connor> going to be our original songs and we're </connor>
<connor> going to end it on that because we're </connor>
<connor> just like we don't care whatever yeah </connor>
<connor> the audience is probably not gonna like </connor>
<connor> it because it's [ __ ] Britney Spears </connor>
<connor> but we're just gonna have fun with it </connor>
<connor> um and then I remember when we start </connor>
<connor> playing the song </connor>
<connor> somehow the audience just like erupts </connor>
<connor> right the audience because like this is </connor>
<connor> not the type of audience that would </connor>
<connor> listen to [ __ ] Britney Spears yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah they're here for like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Arctic Monkeys they're here for [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> block party you know like the Clarkson's </connor>
<connor> or some [ __ ] like that and and I </connor>
<connor> remember playing this song right and </connor>
<connor> obviously we had agreed that we weren't </connor>
<connor> going to stop the music with the and die </connor>
<connor> yeah right but you saw we saw the energy </connor>
<connor> in the crowd right we had no choice and </connor>
<connor> and we were like it was it was such a it </connor>
<connor> was one of the most surreal moments in </connor>
<connor> my life right where we had this we had </connor>
<connor> this performance where we were just all </connor>
<connor> like in this we were in flow you know we </connor>
<connor> were just in in like we were like Kuroko </connor>
<connor> Basket in the zone and I remember I </connor>
<connor> remember the moment was coming up right </connor>
<connor> I looked over I looked over to the drama </connor>
<connor> that's so out of it </connor>
<connor> because I remember I was just I was like </connor>
<connor> I want to do this but we have we we </connor>
<connor> agreed that we wouldn't and I remember I </connor>
<garnt> remember thinking I want to do this and </garnt>
<garnt> I remember looking at the drummer and he </garnt>
<garnt> had like the same look as I did I looked </garnt>
<connor> over the basis and the bass is just like </connor>
<garnt> oh my God and then and then and he </garnt>
<connor> nodded at me and then uh and then I I </connor>
<garnt> looked over to the singer and in the </garnt>
<garnt> corner he sees me on the corner of my </garnt>
<garnt> eye uh at the corner of his eye and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> and then he nods back and I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay it's going to happen and so and so </garnt>
<garnt> he goes my loneliness is killing me </garnt>
<garnt> silence </garnt>
<joey> and uh and like the [ __ ] entire like </joey>
<joey> Concert Hall just like [ __ ] they </joey>
<joey> complete the line and it's just like I </joey>
<joey> can't explain that [ __ ] feeling it it </joey>
<garnt> is it's better than sex it is like it is </garnt>
<joey> like the biggest orgasm I've had in my </joey>
<connor> life like </connor>
<garnt> poor Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> because because it was I I don't know it </garnt>
<garnt> was it was kind of like a Disney moment </garnt>
<garnt> for me because like somehow everything </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] came together and then we </garnt>
<garnt> just we continued the song and it was </garnt>
<connor> the best like the best reaction that </connor>
<connor> we've ever got from a crowd </connor>
<connor> um so the battle of the bands was done </connor>
<connor> by votes and There Were Ten bands there </connor>
<connor> we came in third oh [ __ ] did you get </connor>
<joey> anything any fries we didn't get any </joey>
<joey> fries but that one we didn't get the </joey>
<connor> biggest orgasm of his life yeah that was </connor>
<garnt> that was the peak of my of music career </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was the peak of my music </garnt>
<garnt> career it all went down I mean that's </garnt>
<connor> pretty ridiculous considering this what </connor>
<garnt> how many [ __ ] hundreds of bands that </garnt>
<connor> have probably never experienced that </connor>
<connor> true and that from that downward he uh </connor>
<connor> relinquished the name Grant and became </connor>
<connor> gaunt </connor>
<connor> Ed right to use the name </connor>
<connor> yeah I can't use the name anymore yeah </connor>
<connor> that's great how the [ __ ] have you never </connor>
<garnt> brought this I've never brought this up </garnt>
<garnt> I don't I just I swear I've said I've </garnt>
<connor> been in a band before and no one's ever </connor>
<connor> just everyone's been in the band before </connor>
<connor> oh yeah I've been in a band for like 10 </connor>
<connor> seconds until I realized it's a horrible </connor>
<garnt> idea </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I don't know that I mean yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I really liked back because I </garnt>
<connor> looked at back and I'm just like [ __ ] I </connor>
<connor> get that that's my life so you were like </connor>
<connor> actually good at guitar </connor>
<connor> I was like competent at Guitar I mean </connor>
<garnt> you played in front of people that's </garnt>
<joey> pretty good yeah I mean I played in </joey>
<connor> front of people but I mean that's right </connor>
<joey> my mind work that's pretty good so we're </joey>
<joey> starting a band called Ten and a half </joey>
<joey> pounds soon </joey>
<connor> guys like unlocked memories in me like I </connor>
<connor> heard the [ __ ] Zelda thing when you </connor>
<connor> were like I I remember I tried to learn </connor>
<connor> guitar well I've tried but I think my </connor>
<connor> parents nudged me towards it right I </connor>
<connor> just remember being in in someone's </connor>
<joey> house playing guitar trying to do </joey>
<connor> Twinkle Twinkle Little Star right and I </connor>
<joey> just was like no I don't get this and </joey>
<connor> then he was like he gave me this device </connor>
<connor> that was a tuner but I didn't know what </connor>
<connor> it did be like you got to do it until it </connor>
<connor> goes green the light yeah I was like why </connor>
<connor> it all sounds the same it all sounds </connor>
<garnt> very similar it's just one beep to one </garnt>
<connor> another and my parents bought this tuna </connor>
<connor> for me and I'm just even at that time </connor>
<connor> and I was like Hey I was like oh my </connor>
<connor> parents just wasted their money I'm </connor>
<connor> never gonna get good at this </connor>
<connor> so I'd never never learn guitar and then </connor>
<connor> I remember I went to learn drums which </connor>
<joey> seemed pretty fitting for me because I'm </joey>
<joey> you know you just need a sense of Rhythm </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> which is great I have a great hand-eye </connor>
<joey> coordination unfortunately no rhythm so </joey>
<connor> that that was the Crux of that one and </connor>
<connor> that was over with and I never really </connor>
<connor> learned drums I went for like a year and </connor>
<connor> I never really learned anything really </connor>
<connor> they're trying to meet they try to teach </connor>
<connor> me how to read the sheet music oh that's </connor>
<joey> where I was like no yeah I don't want to </joey>
<garnt> do this it's like jazz drumming methods </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah I I think I I stopped learning </connor>
<connor> at the point when sheet music started to </connor>
<connor> become like a thing of my lessons I'm </connor>
<connor> just like I don't like this anymore </connor>
<connor> it used to be fun when we were just </connor>
<connor> talking about beeps and boobs now you </connor>
<garnt> brought reading into this yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> where I draw the line yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> I like like I think we said this last </garnt>
<joey> time where I go by I go by feeling like </joey>
<joey> and that's what I went when I wrote like </joey>
<joey> protagonist because I don't understand a </joey>
<joey> single thing about [ __ ] music theory </joey>
<joey> you know I know which chords sound nice </joey>
<garnt> in my head and sometimes I have like a </garnt>
<garnt> nice like like beat or rhythm in my head </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like let's try to play this </garnt>
<joey> out of guitar I I do not know what [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you literally you even K on like 100 </joey>
<connor> I can't read [ __ ] I just feel and I can </connor>
<connor> play I Remember at one point I uh for </connor>
<connor> some reason one of my friends is like </connor>
<connor> yeah we need a singer I was like oh all </connor>
<connor> right I'll do it then I'll do it really </connor>
<connor> I'll do it yeah I couldn't sing at all </connor>
<connor> right I didn't have any confidence in it </connor>
<joey> but the first song I'm not even kidding </joey>
<joey> the first song that we had to learn is </joey>
<joey> the only one I ever bothered learning </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah we never did anything this </joey>
<joey> this died by this song guess what song </joey>
<connor> you had to sing </connor>
<connor> new song no it's [ __ ] Smash Mouth </connor>
<connor> I remember like why did you do it I </connor>
<connor> don't know I have like very Vivid </connor>
<connor> memories of me actually seriously trying </connor>
<connor> to learn how to sing yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> All-Star before it was a meme right </connor>
<connor> right when this came when this became a </connor>
<connor> huge meme I was like this is like I had </connor>
<connor> like Nam flashbacks like just like oh my </connor>
<connor> God oh my God this is the sound </connor>
<joey> every time we go to karaoke of course </joey>
<joey> All-Star comes up yeah like at least </joey>
<joey> four or five times throughout the night </joey>
<joey> and every time it's just kind of singing </joey>
<joey> like a dumb voice I want you to actually </joey>
<joey> like be </joey>
<connor> seriously if I seriously try and sing </connor>
<connor> yeah I feel vulnerable </connor>
<joey> thank you very much now that you've said </joey>
<garnt> that you have to do that </garnt>
<garnt> was my first book oh my God it's been </garnt>
<garnt> like four hours yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um so I mean like news is one of the </garnt>
<joey> only bands I've also seen live radio </joey>
<connor> they had such amazing hair yeah </connor>
<joey> Michael Michael Jackson is running for </joey>
<garnt> his money on his [ __ ] afro like this </garnt>
<garnt> this is like the early days of Brady as </garnt>
<connor> well bradio like his afro like like now </connor>
<joey> is like [ __ ] massive [ __ ] it's huge </joey>
<connor> so yeah I mean I've also seen Brady </connor>
<connor> alive as well I mean like the reason I </connor>
<connor> put bradio up there is because uh I </connor>
<connor> discovered bradio with Sydney during </connor>
<connor> like a really tough and time time in </connor>
<connor> like our lives when like I was living in </connor>
<connor> London working for the BBC and like </connor>
<connor> every every day was like every day was </connor>
<connor> like depressing [ __ ] of course you know </connor>
<connor> especially with like the computer I had </connor>
<connor> but for some reason for some reason no </connor>
<connor> matter how down my day was I put on a </connor>
<connor> bradio song and and I am instantly happy </connor>
<connor> like for just like that five minutes or </connor>
<garnt> three minutes whatever I could just feel </garnt>
<garnt> glad and happy for a second is it bad I </garnt>
<joey> can't remember which songs they've done </joey>
<garnt> which anime they did Desperado they </garnt>
<connor> liked it that's still like they thought </connor>
<connor> it was down yeah I didn't want to say </connor>
<connor> because I didn't want to look an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> put your hands up but that song does go </connor>
<garnt> hard yeah I mean like it was so hard it </garnt>
<connor> was it was not only that song but I </connor>
<connor> remember what really saw me on bradio </connor>
<connor> was first time I heard that song of </connor>
<connor> course it was a banger everyone heard </connor>
<connor> the death parade for opening and they </connor>
<connor> knew it was a banger but it was actually </connor>
<connor> their music video right because if if </connor>
<connor> you see their music video it's just like </connor>
<connor> four Dudes having fun with the green </connor>
<connor> screen and it's just it's like got such </connor>
<connor> this it's got such a charm to it right </connor>
<connor> because they do a lot they do this a lot </connor>
<connor> with some of their music videos where </connor>
<connor> they're just like taking the piss and </connor>
<connor> like trying to like try and try trying </connor>
<connor> to like either replicate this anime </connor>
<connor> opening because what they did in this </connor>
<garnt> music video was they've tried to </garnt>
<garnt> replicate the anime opening of death </garnt>
<garnt> parade just with a shitty green screen </garnt>
<garnt> and four of them and it's and it was </garnt>
<garnt> just like using like you know very basic </garnt>
<garnt> cosplay and a green screen and makeup </garnt>
<garnt> and all this stuff and it's just it's </garnt>
<garnt> got such a charm to them because it just </garnt>
<garnt> shows that it just feels like it's four </garnt>
<garnt> Dudes having fun having a [ __ ] blast </garnt>
<garnt> they're not really giving a [ __ ] about </garnt>
<garnt> what the world thinks about them you </garnt>
<joey> know my other favorite music video by </joey>
<joey> them is a golden liar oh my weather </joey>
<garnt> where they're just like it's just it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally just like them on stage yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and they're just [ __ ] having the </garnt>
<garnt> time of their life yeah it's such a good </garnt>
<joey> song and it's such a good music video </joey>
<joey> it's so fun such such a good bass line </joey>
<joey> as well of course like the funk in that </joey>
<garnt> bass line oh </garnt>
<garnt> so good it's so funny listen to them </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you should I I feel I feel like you </garnt>
<joey> like them because honestly like the rest </joey>
<garnt> of their like discography is like </garnt>
<garnt> nothing but bangers all right I haven't </garnt>
<garnt> heard a bad radio song yeah uh before we </garnt>
<garnt> move on from Muse though I like I'm I </garnt>
<connor> have like I have a funny story or not a </connor>
<connor> funny story because like I remember when </connor>
<connor> I saw them live uh it was in Thailand </connor>
<connor> right and like I I went to Thailand no </connor>
<connor> that's that's the thing right that's so </connor>
<connor> it was when I was living in Thailand </connor>
<connor> right and it was so [ __ ] random </connor>
<connor> because I'd gone my entire life being a </connor>
<connor> massive Muse fan living in England you </connor>
<connor> know and just never getting the chance </connor>
<connor> to [ __ ] see them at all because they </connor>
<connor> they never performed uh when I was in </connor>
<connor> England and so like the first time in my </connor>
<connor> life that I actually got to see them </connor>
<joey> perform was it in Bangkok Thailand like </joey>
<connor> what what the [ __ ] right so I remember </connor>
<joey> like I remember thinking this is this is </joey>
<joey> this real this is so surreal that I'm </joey>
<joey> going to be able to see Muse in Thailand </joey>
<joey> yeah out of all the places in the world </joey>
<connor> I could see Muse so I remember going to </connor>
<connor> this concert where um dragging Sydney </connor>
<connor> along because because of course even </connor>
<connor> though she wasn't as big of a muse fan </connor>
<connor> as I was I needed someone to go with me </connor>
<connor> yeah and so I remember like this was </connor>
<connor> like the highlight of my month because </connor>
<connor> I'm like [ __ ] me man I get I get to see </connor>
<connor> Muse I get to [ __ ] see Muse and I </connor>
<connor> remember I remember going to go to the </connor>
<joey> concert and I remember going to um </joey>
<joey> go to the stage and just like eagerly </joey>
<joey> excited for them to come on and I </joey>
<joey> remember the first band that came on was </joey>
<joey> a band called The ruse the ruse okay </joey>
<joey> okay so that's that's r-u-s-e right </joey>
<joey> right so I forgot that they needed a </joey>
<joey> supporting band yeah right of course </joey>
<joey> like it's so my first thought was </joey>
<joey> have we just gone to the wrong [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> concert was was it is this a Muse </joey>
<joey> concert </joey>
<joey> like like what is this like the Thai </joey>
<joey> knockoff of the Muse what's going on and </joey>
<joey> then there's </joey>
<joey> and I'm like okay maybe they're just </joey>
<connor> gonna play one song and then they play </connor>
<connor> the second song I'm like okay maybe </connor>
<connor> maybe they're gonna play two songs and </connor>
<connor> then Muse is gonna come on they play </connor>
<connor> five songs </connor>
<connor> I'm off to the fourth song I'm just like </connor>
<connor> have I made a terrible mistake and we've </connor>
<connor> just come and we've just come to come to </connor>
<joey> Bangkok Thailand to see the ruse </joey>
<connor> did they end up coming on but they did </connor>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> but like like I was just like I just </joey>
<joey> remember thinking uh I at first I was </joey>
<joey> like you know maybe it's a sporting band </joey>
<joey> and then like four songs later I really </joey>
<joey> hope I didn't just spend all this money </joey>
<garnt> to see a [ __ ] knockoff News man Your </garnt>
<joey> Juice by the rules they do that on </joey>
<connor> purpose they have the ruse supporting </connor>
<connor> the Muse </connor>
<garnt> they must have chosen them on purpose </garnt>
<garnt> right there's no there's no [ __ ] way </garnt>
<connor> yeah you could be a supporting honest </connor>
<joey> Ginger name yeah </joey>
<connor> no reason why just do it yeah don't copy </connor>
<joey> my homework too hard </joey>
<connor> I would be bricking it if I got there </connor>
<connor> they're like welcome the ruse might </connor>
<connor> check the chicken right now </connor>
<garnt> literally like because like I literally </garnt>
<garnt> when I literally had to go outside just </garnt>
<garnt> to check that uh the main poster said </garnt>
<garnt> Muse like I was coming in to see Muse </garnt>
<connor> before I go outside and it's like yes it </connor>
<connor> is Muse go back in still the ruse I was </connor>
<connor> like maybe they made a mistake out front </connor>
<connor> on the maybe they got the letters wrong </connor>
<connor> I don't know </connor>
<joey> I mean I've seen enough knockoff things </joey>
<joey> in Southeast Asia to be like maybe they </joey>
<garnt> just pretended to be Muse this entire </garnt>
<garnt> time the Thai version </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah I saw them live and they </garnt>
<garnt> were absolutely absolutely incredible I </garnt>
<connor> I'm shocked you put the killers on here </connor>
<garnt> do you like more than the one song Do </garnt>
<garnt> you like more than Mr Brightside yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> I I I like Ruby Ruby Ruby Chiefs oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah That's how little I know about the </connor>
<joey> killers yeah oh this sounds so simple </joey>
<joey> yeah to be honest I only know Mr </joey>
<garnt> Brightside do they have any other songs </garnt>
<garnt> yeah they have Mr Brightside uh </garnt>
<joey> apparently their latest album's really </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<garnt> last year I think </garnt>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> um because I think like The Killers was </connor>
<connor> my university life right my University </connor>
<connor> yeah I I was actually like already into </connor>
<connor> the killers before like Mr Brightside </connor>
<joey> came to like take over the UK scene you </joey>
<joey> were fans before they were popular well </joey>
<joey> kind of but like they also really just </joey>
<joey> exploded onto the UK scene uh with </joey>
<joey> somebody told me </joey>
<joey> um that was like that was like the first </joey>
<joey> song that really exploded like I was </joey>
<garnt> already into indie rock at the time and </garnt>
<garnt> for the longest time I thought they were </garnt>
<garnt> a British rock band everyone does yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah because they're like a </connor>
<garnt> Mormon Americans though yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like for the longest time I </garnt>
<garnt> thought that they were a British rock </garnt>
<garnt> band the same way as like Arctic Monkeys </garnt>
<garnt> were </garnt>
<garnt> um and you know and a lot of other </garnt>
<garnt> British Indie bands yeah because they </garnt>
<garnt> came out in that time but uh yeah they I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know they were from America but </garnt>
<garnt> uh they were like the one Indie band </garnt>
<connor> that I listened to still throughout </connor>
<connor> University because the reason I stopped </connor>
<connor> listening listening to a lot of Indie </connor>
<connor> music is because my band broke up </connor>
<connor> because we all went to University right </connor>
<connor> um but I mean I listened to the killers </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> I don't know which album is which songs </connor>
<connor> but I know I listened to a lot of see </connor>
<connor> I'm I'm drawing a [ __ ] blank right </connor>
<connor> now yeah </connor>
<connor> um I just know I've listened to a lot of </connor>
<connor> killers uh and the reason it's on here </connor>
<connor> is not only because I listen to them a </connor>
<connor> lot uh in University but it's also the </connor>
<connor> first band that uh me and City bonded </connor>
<connor> over oh so so okay so uh uh so Sydney </connor>
<connor> likes to quote a lot of songs to like a </connor>
<connor> lot of people that she hung out with </connor>
<connor> right and apparently she told me that </connor>
<connor> the only time someone had completed a </connor>
<connor> song lyric that she had quoted instead </connor>
<connor> of just being like Cindy what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you talking about was uh when she quoted </connor>
<connor> The Killers to me via text and she was </connor>
<connor> she just randomly said ah </connor>
<connor> somebody told me no somebody told me I </connor>
<connor> got soul and I'd reply back </connor>
<connor> um [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> oh man </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] she was like oh my God you're </connor>
<joey> the one God's like what the absolute </joey>
<joey> irony [ __ ] me on this side this is this </joey>
<joey> is I'm drawing a [ __ ] black right now </joey>
<connor> I'm not a soldier is that the line is </connor>
<connor> that this is like this is like me trying </connor>
<connor> to Remember lyrics right because I'm </connor>
<connor> just like I'm just like I'm not a </connor>
<connor> soldier or something like that this is </connor>
<joey> okay okay like I said I don't listen to </joey>
<garnt> lyrics like I just I just know I just </garnt>
<joey> managed to quote back that on yeah </joey>
<joey> that's that's the one line he managed to </joey>
<garnt> call about yeah that's that's the one </garnt>
<garnt> line I managed to quote back and uh and </garnt>
<connor> she was like well you're a Killer's fan </connor>
<connor> you're the one you are the one you you </connor>
<connor> are the first person took a very big </connor>
<connor> gamble replying with that you're gonna </connor>
<connor> look like a [ __ ] idiot yeah like </connor>
<connor> what's wrong with God he said he's not a </connor>
<garnt> soldier or something bizarre yeah but uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so The Killers holds a very you </garnt>
<garnt> know a very very deep place in my heart </garnt>
<garnt> not not only because I listen to The </garnt>
<garnt> Killers and I am reminded of you </garnt>
<garnt> University life but also because it's </garnt>
<garnt> part of the reason that I met and bonded </garnt>
<garnt> with my partner that I'm with now so and </garnt>
<garnt> I also saw them live in Bangkok Thailand </garnt>
<connor> as well it's </connor>
<connor> so weird </connor>
<joey> this is the construction supporting act </joey>
<garnt> the fillers we saw the Drillers uh yeah </garnt>
<connor> I mean I remember like the first I </connor>
<connor> remember seeing them live and the first </connor>
<connor> song that they played was Mr Brightside </connor>
<connor> and obviously Mr Brightside even started </connor>
<connor> strong is the song that everyone </connor>
<connor> everyone knows right </connor>
<connor> um and I remember it was such a surreal </connor>
<connor> experience just hearing a song that I'd </connor>
<connor> listened to so much in my childhood </connor>
<connor> right and I it was almost like it was </connor>
<connor> all it was almost like a weird out of </connor>
<connor> out of [ __ ] body experience right </connor>
<connor> where I I had had this song that would </connor>
<connor> that meant so much to me when at one </connor>
<connor> point in my life and I saw them now at </connor>
<connor> the age of like 25 26 or something like </connor>
<connor> that like way later </connor>
<connor> um and it just like a wave of just like </connor>
<connor> it was so surreal because at what it was </connor>
<connor> like a wave of like memories and </connor>
<connor> Nostalgia but also like me living in the </connor>
<connor> moment like it's it's so weird to </connor>
<connor> describe because just hearing them live </connor>
<connor> and hearing like it was like my life had </connor>
<connor> like built up to this one moment you </connor>
<connor> know I I don't know because yeah because </connor>
<connor> because I'd never seen a band that I </connor>
<connor> loved so much as a kid </connor>
<connor> um later in life until that one moment </connor>
<connor> so it was just it was just such an </connor>
<joey> incredible moment for me I will never </joey>
<garnt> forget hearing Mr Brightside For the </garnt>
<joey> First Time Life </joey>
<joey> um and then we have uh Michael Jackson </joey>
<garnt> okay so I mean I also like vanilla so </garnt>
<garnt> okay so the reason that Michael Jackson </garnt>
<garnt> is on there </garnt>
<garnt> um is because so as a kid I went through </garnt>
<garnt> a phase where I was you spoke about this </garnt>
<connor> right yeah I think you have really I </connor>
<connor> feel like I've this is weirdly familiar </connor>
<garnt> God talking about on the podcast yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah so I don't know if I have talked </connor>
<connor> about it on the podcast but as a kid I </connor>
<connor> went through this massive phase where I </connor>
<connor> was obsessed with Michael Jackson like </connor>
<connor> like I I was I was awake I don't know if </connor>
<connor> I've said it in private to you guys or </connor>
<garnt> on the podcast but like yeah I went </garnt>
<garnt> through a phase when I was like just an </garnt>
<garnt> obsessive Michael Jackson kid like uh </garnt>
<connor> I think everyone's going through their </connor>
<connor> faces now the target audience yeah </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> or that phase but you know </connor>
<connor> regardless of what his image was you </connor>
<connor> know or what happens later in life there </connor>
<connor> were you know his music [ __ ] slaps </connor>
<connor> and of course it's like yes it's vanilla </connor>
<connor> but it's it's a classic for a reason I </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] love the song uh pretty young </connor>
<connor> thing but it's so hard it's so hard to </connor>
<joey> listen to that song </joey>
<connor> because of the lyrical content you know </connor>
<connor> yeah you know how when like they're like </connor>
<connor> separate the art from the artist I do </connor>
<connor> but sometimes it's really [ __ ] hard </connor>
<connor> too yeah that that song definitely </connor>
<joey> didn't mean that's one of those songs </joey>
<joey> I'm like why why this song is so good </joey>
<joey> but why do they have to be ruined I </joey>
<joey> literally cannot listen to that song </joey>
<joey> without being like it's just great oh </joey>
<joey> yeah oh and then you remember what it </joey>
<connor> was about oh oh MJ I feel like but like </connor>
<joey> so many songs are amazing yeah yeah MJ's </joey>
<joey> just one of those like artists that I </joey>
<garnt> feel you could be at any party or like </garnt>
<joey> any convention like with with any amount </joey>
<garnt> of people that can have completely </garnt>
<connor> different personalities on everything </connor>
<connor> the moment a Michael Jackson song comes </connor>
<joey> on everyone is unanimously like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah it sounds amazing yeah I mean like </connor>
<garnt> I I think we talked about this before </garnt>
<connor> but like I don't think we'll ever see </connor>
<connor> someone that had the reach or was like </connor>
<joey> as famous as Michael Jackson was by </joey>
<connor> standing yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> he's not going to Michael Jackson was </connor>
<connor> because my dad actually introduced me to </connor>
<connor> Michael Jackson I remember he bought </connor>
<garnt> like a VHS of like the top 25 hits of I </garnt>
<connor> think it was like holy [ __ ] anniversary </connor>
<connor> I wish I had like a deep story of every </connor>
<garnt> single pick I don't know this is the </garnt>
<connor> reason I had the pigs because I was like </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how to talk about the music </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just going to talk about something </garnt>
<garnt> like Slumdog Millionaires yeah every </garnt>
<connor> single answer has like a goddamn 10 part </connor>
<garnt> back like flashback this is insane yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so like so like it's it's one of the </garnt>
<garnt> weirdest experiences where like you go </garnt>
<garnt> to like the countryside and [ __ ] [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> bum Thailand or something like they they </garnt>
<garnt> don't they like they've never </garnt>
<garnt> experienced internet there they barely </garnt>
<connor> have electricity there you know you go </connor>
<connor> to the [ __ ] Chinese side and like </connor>
<connor> even going in the middle of nowhere </connor>
<connor> somehow there will be this one farmer </connor>
<connor> who will have this like old beaten up </connor>
<connor> cassette tape of like Michael Jackson </connor>
<connor> Thrills yeah and and like they wouldn't </connor>
<connor> they will not know a single word of </connor>
<connor> English right and they're like oh you </connor>
<connor> you grew up in England you're not </connor>
<connor> Michael Jackson you know you know you </connor>
<connor> might </connor>
<connor> how has Michael Jackson have how does </connor>
<connor> Michael Jackson have this reach oh he's </connor>
<connor> the king of Pop right yeah yeah yeah so </connor>
<joey> so like it's like it's still like </joey>
<garnt> thinking about it it still blows my mind </garnt>
<garnt> just how famous one person is I think </garnt>
<joey> Thriller even to this day is the most </joey>
<connor> sold album ever I think so yeah like I </connor>
<connor> have any idea yeah which is like stupid </connor>
<connor> it sounds right it's like it's like by </connor>
<connor> stupid I mean like the difference </connor>
<connor> between Thriller and everything else is </connor>
<connor> like stupid like it's insane yeah </connor>
<connor> because like you know you could go to </connor>
<connor> the bomb [ __ ] middle of nowhere in Japan </connor>
<connor> yeah and there'll be some like decrepit </connor>
<garnt> 70 year old 80 year old lady you know </garnt>
<joey> putting rice in the rice fields and </joey>
<garnt> being like Oh might get adjustable yeah </garnt>
<connor> useless </connor>
<connor> poor old lady I want to give you some </connor>
<joey> rice which Jerry will say will taste the </joey>
<joey> same anyway </joey>
<joey> yeah who just like knows Michael Jackson </joey>
<connor> it's like it's just everyone knows it's </connor>
<garnt> ridiculous like yeah yeah it's it's like </garnt>
<joey> we're it's like weird to think how </joey>
<joey> someone one person got this famous to </joey>
<joey> like so many cultures and so many </joey>
<joey> countries that obviously had nothing to </joey>
<joey> do with the us or just like even listen </joey>
<joey> to that kind of music in the first place </joey>
<joey> and uh and and I mean yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> Thriller is like I know putting like </joey>
<joey> Thriller on there is kind of like </joey>
<joey> putting like you know [ __ ] Zelda or </joey>
<joey> something as your favorite video game of </joey>
<joey> all time but I mean I mean it's it's one </joey>
<joey> of it's one of the most legendary albums </joey>
<joey> and he's one of the most legendary </joey>
<joey> artists for a reason yeah and uh </joey>
<joey> absolutely yeah and I was a weird </joey>
<joey> Michael Jackson kid I actually uh did </joey>
<joey> you learn how to moonwalk huh did you </joey>
<connor> learn how to moonwalk I attempted to </connor>
<joey> learn how to move or I think I think I </joey>
<connor> could moonwalk at one point at one point </connor>
<garnt> too yeah could you actually yeah </garnt>
<joey> genuinely generally yeah did you figure </joey>
<joey> out by yourself or no no I watch YouTube </joey>
<garnt> videos I think I watched YouTube videos </garnt>
<joey> okay okay because I remember trying to </joey>
<joey> figure it out as a kid right trying to </joey>
<joey> figure out how the moonwalk works right </joey>
<joey> because you're like frame by frame on </joey>
<joey> the video just like analyzing them yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because and as as like as like a </joey>
<joey> five six year old kid or whatever I was </joey>
<joey> like I got this okay this looks exactly </joey>
<joey> my like Michael Jackson yeah and it was </joey>
<joey> only until like years later when YouTube </joey>
<joey> existed and YouTube videos existed then </joey>
<joey> I realized that's this is not I this is </joey>
<joey> not how you do the moon boy I was doing </joey>
<joey> it wrong with this walking backwards </joey>
<garnt> yeah walking backwards the entire time </garnt>
<joey> so I'm thinking I look cool as [ __ ] no </joey>
<joey> no I tried to do like the you know the </joey>
<joey> leg like pop thing that he does oh yeah </joey>
<joey> oh I tried to do that I tried to do that </joey>
<connor> I'm almost dislocated my knees I was </connor>
<connor> like how so Jerry became a pensioner I </connor>
<joey> was like oh is that why he shouts ow </joey>
<garnt> because it just [ __ ] hurts all right </garnt>
<connor> yeah and uh this Japanese artist yeah so </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] me hold on just frothing over my </joey>
<garnt> Michael Jackson Just slurping off so </garnt>
<garnt> that you can add that to the uh </garnt>
<garnt> compilation of gank tries to drink like </garnt>
<garnt> a human being </garnt>
<connor> so I guess uh this this is with demaio </connor>
<connor> but uh this is more of like where I put </connor>
<connor> her in just because I feel like she's a </connor>
<connor> genre of music that I have just recently </connor>
<connor> gotten into yeah </connor>
<connor> um and as with everything in my life </connor>
<garnt> somehow everything always comes back to </garnt>
<garnt> uh domestic girlfriend oh for [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> I was born at this moment </connor>
<connor> as it always does right so how I so I'm </connor>
<connor> not sure what this genre of music is </connor>
<joey> because it's not really just J-pop it </joey>
<joey> it's like it's more of like okay so how </joey>
<joey> I would describe it you know do you know </joey>
<joey> do you guys know what utaities are yeah </joey>
<joey> of course yeah so your Titans are like I </joey>
<joey> believe uh singers or musicians who </joey>
<joey> mostly originated from nikonico starting </joey>
<joey> who started off doing a lot of like </joey>
<joey> Hatsune Miku songs and stuff like covers </joey>
<connor> yeah stuff like that so a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of these musicians Who Came From </connor>
<connor> The Scene ended up just like I guess </connor>
<connor> graduating and just made you know start </connor>
<connor> started making their own songs with </connor>
<connor> their own original artists </connor>
<connor> um and there's this I I don't know what </connor>
<garnt> the genre is but there's a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> artists in this genre that I got </garnt>
<garnt> introduced to by the domestic girlfriend </garnt>
<garnt> opening because if okay </garnt>
<garnt> a friend is a very divisive show I know </garnt>
<garnt> that I know that </garnt>
<garnt> um the opening [ __ ] slap yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> opening is amazing the opening is </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> I I'm not gonna even be able to attempt </garnt>
<joey> to say it's hard it's not it's not even </joey>
<connor> a catchy song it is just a banger </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and uh so I that's how I </connor>
<connor> discovered that artist Minami </connor>
<connor> um and you know Spotify recommendations </connor>
<connor> usually recommendations so I I I got </connor>
<joey> really really into Minami and her songs </joey>
<joey> from the domestic girlfriend opening and </joey>
<joey> that kind of introduced me to this world </joey>
<joey> of artists like Zuta Mayo Eve </joey>
<joey> um who else is [ __ ] uh yoroshika I </joey>
<joey> think yeah yeah yeah yeah so how I </joey>
<joey> describe them is like they they are </joey>
<garnt> anime music that don't have an anime </garnt>
<garnt> that they play to you know what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah again like I've listened to </garnt>
<garnt> this I don't didn't know their name yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but like if you go to my YouTube you can </garnt>
<connor> see that I've listened to this person a </connor>
<connor> lot yeah it's just like that genre of </connor>
<garnt> like I'm making the anime in my head </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah so like like a lot of </garnt>
<connor> these artists that I listen to now have </connor>
<connor> now been picked up for like anime </connor>
<connor> openings right yes so I remember like I </connor>
<connor> got into I got into Zita Maya and then I </connor>
<connor> got into Eve </connor>
<connor> um and then I remember listening to the </connor>
<connor> Jujutsu Christ Alone </connor>
<connor> opening when that came out and I for the </connor>
<connor> first time in my life I'm just like oh </connor>
<connor> my God I know this band because I've </connor>
<connor> never heard this song before but like </connor>
<connor> they have such a distinct style that </connor>
<connor> I've had that I had that moment where </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like I've been following them </garnt>
<connor> since they were underground [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> absolutely I read the Manga yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> I know this song yeah it is the </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent of the I've read this when </garnt>
<garnt> the manga wasn't big right because you </garnt>
<garnt> know because there are so many artists </garnt>
<garnt> in this field that have now been picked </garnt>
<garnt> up for an anime opening or ending and </garnt>
<garnt> and like there is this there's this </garnt>
<garnt> feeling of like yes you have music slaps </garnt>
<garnt> I'm [ __ ] proud of you I'm validated </garnt>
<joey> for being a fan I was like that </joey>
<joey> like before they became the psycho </joey>
<joey> parcel opening the Tokyo Ghoul opening I </joey>
<connor> was like I knew them before us oh really </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> also I'm a little sad because now </garnt>
<connor> everyone knows Eve as oh it's the </connor>
<connor> jujuices </connor>
<connor> there's so much more than that listen to </connor>
<connor> the rest of their [ __ ] songs </connor>
<connor> um so yeah I mean like this is I guess </connor>
<garnt> that's the kind of music I listen to the </garnt>
<garnt> most now that's like really that's like </garnt>
<joey> my weeb kind of it's really big in Japan </joey>
<joey> right now especially </joey>
<joey> they're like yeah </joey>
<joey> I didn't know you're a big Daft Punk fan </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um I was a big Daft Punk fan </garnt>
<garnt> um during like the discovery album </garnt>
<garnt> actually and like I'm think I'm thinking </garnt>
<garnt> back and a lot of my favorite songs or a </garnt>
<joey> lot of my favorite music have visuals to </joey>
<joey> accompany them like do you guys do you </joey>
<joey> guys okay when you guys listen to a song </joey>
<joey> do you guys like do you guys imagine </joey>
<joey> like a music video in your head or </joey>
<joey> anything like that sometimes yeah it </joey>
<joey> depends on the song for me yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> okay that's like what I'm doing yeah </joey>
<joey> like for me like if if I can't I can't </joey>
<joey> connect to a song unless I can imagine </joey>
<joey> some kind of story or some kind of </joey>
<joey> visuals to accompany that song and I </joey>
<connor> feel like I have such a random song I </connor>
<connor> have such a random music taste because </connor>
<connor> to me like I don't really listen to </connor>
<connor> lyrics but if a song emotes an emotion </connor>
<connor> or a visual image in my head then that's </connor>
<connor> when I get really emotionally connected </connor>
<connor> to a song right and to me that how I </connor>
<connor> discovered Daft Punk was I discovered it </connor>
<connor> through Interstellar 5555 right which </connor>
<connor> was a [ __ ] amazing movie and it's </connor>
<connor> also one of it's also one of the albums </connor>
<connor> I have listened to all the way through </connor>
<connor> based purely from that movie yeah and </connor>
<connor> from then on from watching that movie </connor>
<connor> and seeing the story that they crafted </connor>
<connor> from that movie every Daft Punk song I </connor>
<garnt> listen to I have such cool visuals in my </garnt>
<garnt> head that that's why I became like such </garnt>
<connor> a massive Daft Punk fan how did that </connor>
<connor> even happen that anime </connor>
<connor> uh was it literally just the guy </connor>
<connor> listened to it and was like holy [ __ ] I </connor>
<joey> gotta make it I gotta make an anime to </joey>
<joey> go with this I think </joey>
<connor> exactly but I think matsumotodeiji was </connor>
<connor> like a fan of Daft Punk yeah and then </connor>
<connor> they just like worked something out and </connor>
<joey> then because it's it's so good I guess I </joey>
<connor> would like to know I would like to know </connor>
<garnt> like uh what kind of what kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] what do I have to do to get </garnt>
<joey> Matsumoto deji to make a music yeah how </joey>
<garnt> did that connection happen you know I </garnt>
<connor> don't know because this was before Anime </connor>
<garnt> was even close to Big you know this is </garnt>
<connor> this was like underground as [ __ ] so </connor>
<connor> yeah do you have a do you have a </connor>
<connor> favorite song from the album </connor>
<connor> mine always changes quite often from </connor>
<garnt> it's still hard uh from Daft Punk it's </garnt>
<garnt> probably harder better faster stronger </garnt>
<connor> that's good um yeah that's good I mean </connor>
<connor> for me for me it's like I know it's the </connor>
<joey> vanilla Pig but like one more time will </joey>
<joey> always be one more time's amazing one </joey>
<garnt> more time one more time will Digital </garnt>
<joey> Love Digital Love is [ __ ] incredible </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> um and like I think the reason I picked </joey>
<joey> harder better faster stronger was </joey>
<connor> because I remember when I first started </connor>
<connor> getting to amvs and everyone everyone </connor>
<connor> tried to make Linkin Park amvs I did </connor>
<connor> nothing but just make the phone KMPS </connor>
<connor> that was that was me man that was like </connor>
<connor> if the person the rest of YouTube went </connor>
<connor> through the rest of [ __ ] YouTube went </connor>
<connor> through a Linkin Park phase I was here </connor>
<garnt> just like it was like the entire </garnt>
<garnt> Discovery Channel in anime form aside </garnt>
<garnt> from like not even the movie but just </garnt>
<joey> like in Naruto clips and then when you </joey>
<joey> heard the the Kanye West remix yeah you </joey>
<joey> know just like oh my God I think that's </joey>
<connor> that I heard that before I heard the </connor>
<joey> original Daft Punk well I discovered </joey>
<joey> Kanye through that song huh I was like </joey>
<joey> what who's that song who's this guy </joey>
<garnt> rapping over a Daft Punk song and then </garnt>
<garnt> it's so good like At first I hated that </garnt>
<connor> song because I'm just like why would you </connor>
<connor> ruin holiday </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> he's gonna get big </joey>
<connor> this guy's gonna do stuff yeah I think </connor>
<garnt> he's gonna be quite normal and Arctic </garnt>
<garnt> Monkeys obviously British State </garnt>
<garnt> obviously I mean I again I mean I've </garnt>
<garnt> already talked about my Indie phase I've </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just it wasn't just arced </garnt>
<connor> monkeys it was like everyone born around </connor>
<connor> our generation-ish British loves article </connor>
<garnt> okay because if I would have to say if I </garnt>
<garnt> would have to say what my what </garnt>
<garnt> influences I took when uh when I was in </garnt>
<connor> my band right it was bands like Arctic </connor>
<connor> Monkeys uh The klaxons Strokes uh who </connor>
<connor> else was like big at the time razor </connor>
<connor> lights </connor>
<garnt> um also like Red Hot Chili Peppers and </garnt>
<garnt> Foo Fighters as well just like just like </garnt>
<joey> any any in Australia around that time </joey>
<joey> White Stripes was massive oh White </joey>
<garnt> Stripes as well yes I love the White </garnt>
<garnt> Stripes so yeah I mean that that that </garnt>
<connor> slot is just there for just for just mid </connor>
<connor> 2000s </connor>
<connor> and then I got the pillows well I I put </connor>
<connor> the pillows there because I did go </connor>
<connor> through a phase where there was a lot of </connor>
<connor> anime music on my playlist dude we've </connor>
<connor> all been there come on yeah and I I feel </connor>
<joey> like it was the anime man at one point </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah and good old times </joey>
<joey> but like back then I didn't like I </joey>
<garnt> didn't look up the bands behind the </garnt>
<garnt> anime music it was it was just Anime </garnt>
<connor> music you know what I mean my Apple </connor>
<connor> thing was TV size bracket </connor>
<garnt> a lot of one minute 30 songs yeah and I </garnt>
<garnt> remember fuliculi was like the first </garnt>
<connor> entire OST that I've like I took I took </connor>
<connor> this entire OST because every song in </connor>
<connor> the fulicury OST because it was </connor>
<connor> basically just the pillows album right </connor>
<connor> yeah it was just an album of the pillows </connor>
<connor> it was the first time where I took an </connor>
<joey> entire anime OST and put it on my MP3 </joey>
<joey> player which wasn't even an iPod uh it </joey>
<joey> was like this like an actual like MP3 </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah this it was it was like a </joey>
<joey> knockoff cheap ass like Chinese MP3 </joey>
<connor> player that I can't even remember the </connor>
<connor> brands uh because it doesn't exist yeah </connor>
<connor> it probably doesn't exist anymore uh </connor>
<garnt> because I couldn't afford a proper iPod </garnt>
<garnt> or proper like branded MP3 player I I </garnt>
<joey> had one that was like kind of like </joey>
<joey> shaped like a like a long pill it was </joey>
<connor> like a blue pill yes and then you could </connor>
<connor> put like an orc sport on it it was like </connor>
<connor> a tiny tiny screen and the name of the </connor>
<joey> song would like scroll across yeah good </joey>
<connor> times yeah kids will never understand </connor>
<garnt> and and I mean like the pillow is kind </garnt>
<garnt> of it is again kind of just like </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese but also has had like I was </garnt>
<joey> this close to putting the pillows on </joey>
<garnt> mine but I didn't yeah and and like I I </garnt>
<garnt> again like the reason I really loved uh </garnt>
<garnt> that soundtrack is because flcl is kind </garnt>
<connor> of just like an AMV but yeah just just </connor>
<connor> just in just six episodes six season </connor>
<joey> Goods </joey>
<connor> it's good but nowhere near us it's not </connor>
<connor> as good as I've never watched it has it </connor>
<connor> has its moments you've got to watch the </connor>
<connor> first one what's it like to me like 90 </connor>
<joey> of why I love furikuli so much was </joey>
<joey> because of the pillows oh yeah um and </joey>
<garnt> the visuals were kind of it was kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like watching Interstellar 5555 again </garnt>
<joey> well so if you like the music you'll </joey>
<connor> like the anime oh yeah what if you're </connor>
<joey> not into the music and you're like oh </joey>
<joey> it's going to be hard to not be into the </joey>
<garnt> music yeah yeah I mean it kind of It </garnt>
<garnt> kind of sets the tone yeah of the entire </garnt>
<joey> show that makes sense there's a reason </joey>
<joey> why it's like one of the most like </joey>
<connor> famous anime yeah people never shut up </connor>
<joey> about fully cooly yeah why it's so </joey>
<garnt> amazing yeah but like it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's like moments like this </garnt>
<connor> where I was afraid whenever people were </connor>
<connor> just like yo well let's pass your score </connor>
<connor> let's see what your music taste is and </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like [ __ ] man what how am I </garnt>
<garnt> going to explain yeah like TV size </garnt>
<joey> narrow to opening like what is that what </joey>
<joey> is that yeah but at least it was like </joey>
<joey> you know like hard you know custom Trail </joey>
<connor> like J-Rock right like I was listening </connor>
<joey> to like Lucky Star opening people I was </joey>
<joey> like that's even harder to explain it's </joey>
<joey> like yeah past the Orcs I'm like I don't </joey>
<connor> think you want the Orcs man like I </connor>
<connor> definitely Listen to Too Much Hannah </connor>
<garnt> Montana at one point </garnt>
<garnt> more than I care to admit yeah </garnt>
<connor> I don't know she's not obsessed with </connor>
<garnt> Hannah Montana that's good when I was </garnt>
<joey> like 13 I was like obsessed with Hannah </joey>
<joey> Montana I don't know why so much so that </joey>
<joey> one of the first books I ever read was </joey>
<joey> Miley Cyrus's autobiography are you </joey>
<joey> serious I'm not kidding I'm not kidding </joey>
<joey> I wish that was a joke I wish that's no </joey>
<joey> strings for a hardcore Miley Cyrus fan </joey>
<joey> for some reason I was obsessed with the </joey>
<joey> Disney Channel when I was like 12 or 13. </joey>
<joey> that makes sense I think I was sold on </joey>
<joey> the dream that you can do whatever you </joey>
<connor> wanted to do yeah yeah I realized that </connor>
<joey> no it's not how it works and they still </joey>
<joey> have Miley turned out right uh yeah </joey>
<connor> I don't know why I just liked it and </connor>
<joey> also I like the music for some reason I </joey>
<joey> think weird it's weird how when you're </joey>
<joey> 12 and 13 you just [ __ ] idiot I was I </joey>
<joey> was more obsessed with Hilary Duff </joey>
<joey> yeah like more than I don't know isn't </joey>
<joey> it weird how you just have those phases </joey>
<joey> yeah Miley didn't really click for me </joey>
<joey> Hillary I was like yeah I can get behind </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<connor> I don't know why I feel like everyone </connor>
<connor> has that one thing that they've they've </connor>
<connor> like they've shoved down in their </connor>
<connor> subconsciously depression they're like </connor>
<connor> I'd never like this if you say if you </connor>
<joey> say I did I did not it's so </joey>
<joey> inexplainable now that I think about it </joey>
<joey> I was like why why I don't like Hillary </joey>
<connor> I cannot explain to you why was she like </connor>
<joey> hot to me I don't know I think I like </joey>
<joey> the escapism that it offered yeah </joey>
<joey> copium something </joey>
<joey> what's wrong with me and now I'm this </joey>
<connor> jaded British man who likes beans on </connor>
<connor> toast but back then I had dreams and </connor>
<connor> stuff </connor>
<connor> Disney Channel yeah what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> happened to you </garnt>
<joey> that anime does that no he does that too </joey>
<garnt> man it destroys Dreams yeah I mean so </garnt>
<garnt> that is that is my three by three I </garnt>
<joey> don't know if that's like random as [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> um it makes sense I mean like I I feel </garnt>
<garnt> like I've talked more behind the stories </garnt>
<joey> of the stories of uh I just want to hear </joey>
<joey> more about you being in a band now like </joey>
<connor> how am I supposed to live obstacles </connor>

<joey> obsessed with like Led Zeppelin really </joey>
<connor> yeah I was obsessed with that he loves </connor>
<joey> all of those that era band oh yeah </joey>
<joey> really well I mean I could have put like </joey>
<joey> nine just 70s hard rock bands as well if </joey>
<garnt> I wanted to because I I love a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> their music but a lot at the same time I </garnt>
<garnt> have no idea what any of the Bands look </garnt>
<joey> like like you know that's what they look </joey>
<joey> like they all look like like Black </joey>
<connor> Sabbath I know what Ozzy Osbourne looks </connor>
<connor> like now yeah I don't know what he </connor>
<connor> looked like he can't he looks so </connor>
<garnt> different back then yeah Ozzy Osborne </garnt>
<connor> actually look like a human yeah </connor>
<connor> it's 80 year old Japanese </connor>
<joey> is uh aged strangely yeah when I saw him </joey>
<joey> live it was uh it was weird Aussie is </joey>
<connor> like you know those those time lapses of </connor>
<connor> like this chicken nugget has been in the </connor>
<connor> closet for 70 years and hasn't aged but </connor>
<connor> it has and it that's how I feel I don't </connor>
<connor> know why is that a fat comparison </connor>
<joey> that's how I feel it's like it shouldn't </joey>
<joey> be alive but it looks worryingly well it </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like Aussie now kind of looks </joey>
<joey> like if someone took Ozzy Osbourne </joey>
<joey> deflated him and then re-inflated him </joey>
<joey> again he's the one who's done like it </joey>
<connor> looks like someone took Ozzy Osbourne </connor>
<connor> and just like he left him in water for </connor>
<connor> too long </connor>
<connor> yeah like isn't he done like an inord </connor>
<connor> like an insane amount of drugs or </connor>
<joey> something oh yeah I mean I mean the most </joey>
<joey> he should have died ages ago normally </joey>
<joey> but uh he's some I mean that's why he </joey>
<connor> can barely talk now it's like when I </connor>
<joey> went to go see Black Sabbath live it was </joey>
<connor> like the the like you know the the </connor>
<connor> original lineup I'm actually still </connor>
<connor> performing yeah I mean this was like </connor>
<joey> maybe five six years ago and it was </joey>
<joey> labeled their last tour all right so I </joey>
<connor> was like oh of course I have to go </connor>
<connor> that's impressive that he he's still </connor>
<joey> able to perform yeah well that's the </joey>
<joey> thing it's like he came like from like </joey>
<joey> when they all came onto stage and like </joey>
<joey> the music starts playing and you just </joey>
<joey> see this guy just like hobbling across </joey>
<joey> the stage right and I'm like oh that's </joey>
<joey> him there he is and he just goes up to </joey>
<joey> the mic and he's like </joey>
<connor> normal for Birmingham </connor>
<joey> yeah I don't know what you said man but </joey>
<joey> God you you sounded good and he's like </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> I think you'll know it General's </joey>
<joey> gathered and he's just started singing </joey>
<joey> normally I was like why can you not why </joey>
<connor> can you sing this is completely fine but </connor>
<connor> you can't talk you haven't lived in the </connor>
<joey> UK test I can understand him like </joey>
<joey> perfectly I'm not I'm not even joking I </joey>
<joey> could understand what he was saying I </joey>
<garnt> don't know what it is man yeah the UK is </garnt>
<joey> weird it sucks it gives you like uh like </joey>
<connor> it's it's like the hard mode of English </connor>
<connor> like once once you're trained in it then </connor>
<garnt> you could you could like distinguish any </garnt>
<connor> accident no difficulties understanding </connor>
<connor> English accents yeah yeah because I just </connor>
<joey> grew up around really strange ones but I </joey>
<joey> guess like Black Sabbath like so Led </joey>
<connor> Zeppelin for me is like kind of just all </connor>
<connor> of like the British like 70s like hard </connor>
<connor> rock man so like Black Sabbath can fit </connor>
<connor> in there like deep purple can fit in </connor>
<connor> there because like that's just like the </connor>
<connor> music my dad just grew up with and he </connor>
<connor> was like here do you know Rolling Stones </connor>
<connor> and I was like and I was two years old </connor>
<joey> and I was like what is a music and then </joey>
<joey> he just played Rolling Stones and I was </joey>
<connor> like okay okay I can get behind this and </connor>
<connor> then I think the first band I like </connor>
<connor> really connected to was Led Zeppelin </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um yeah like I [ __ ] love okay I'm </connor>
<garnt> getting I'm not like an idiot and </garnt>
<joey> they're gonna do Stairway to him yes </joey>
<garnt> they are the ones </garnt>
<garnt> Stairway to Heaven rock and roll Black </garnt>
<joey> Dog uh Immigrant Song Immigrant Song </joey>
<connor> um you know that song </connor>
<connor> yeah the Viking song yeah that's them I </connor>
<connor> often living in Japan you'll meet like </connor>
<connor> say you're just me talking to Japanese </connor>
<connor> people whatever and they'll be like oh I </connor>
<connor> love I love British music I'll be like </connor>
<connor> oh okay I'm thinking like [ __ ] watch </connor>
<connor> area they're gonna talk to because I </connor>
<garnt> don't know any of them yeah it's always </garnt>
<connor> like Black Sabbath Led Zeppelin and </connor>
<garnt> they'll be like they'll ask me what's </garnt>
<garnt> your favorite song I'll be like </garnt>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<joey> basically uh like Jimmy Page who's the </joey>
<connor> guitarist for Led Zeppelin he's the one </connor>
<connor> who basically influenced me to start </connor>
<connor> guitar right yeah so like I watched one </connor>
<connor> concert from Led Zeppelin and I was like </connor>
<joey> that is the coolest [ __ ] human alive </joey>
<joey> like just like him just shredding on </joey>
<joey> guitar I was like I want what he has I </joey>
<connor> want that can I do that is it a </connor>
<joey> coincidence they're all posing very </joey>
<joey> similarly and like they just happen to </joey>
<joey> all have the same looking posts I just I </joey>
<connor> yeah I mean that's just like we are a </connor>
<connor> band we are a band we're doing pretty </connor>
<joey> well yeah we are a band </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> um yeah so I guess like yeah so Led </joey>
<joey> Zeppelin's just like like just my love </joey>
<joey> for like 70s rock so like Black Sabbath </joey>
<joey> Deep Purple Rolling Stones because it's </joey>
<connor> been really hard for you to decide it's </connor>
<joey> really hard because you're you're music </joey>
<joey> knowledge is vast yeah yeah and I feel </joey>
<connor> like you have an appreciation of music </connor>
<garnt> yeah Way Beyond anything me and can't </garnt>
<joey> have yeah like me and Connor's like a </joey>
<garnt> music puddle yours is like a music ocean </garnt>
<joey> you know basically </joey>
<joey> um and then I guess like kind of in the </joey>
<connor> same vein but I had to like put it uh </connor>
<connor> differently as Pink Floyd in the middle </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like I think I went to a </connor>
<connor> concert of Pink Floyd's well technically </connor>
<connor> just Roger Waters um and he and he </connor>
<connor> performed that uh Pink Floyd has this </connor>
<connor> album called the wall yeah which is like </connor>
<joey> considered like one of the greatest like </joey>
<connor> concept albums Jerry has explained the </connor>
<garnt> wall to me in great details yeah I like </garnt>
<joey> how you said they made this album called </joey>
<garnt> the wall like it's not like one of the </garnt>
<joey> most favorite I don't know because like </joey>
<joey> because people always think like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> they made Dark Side of the Moon it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> so Roger Waters was the guy who like </garnt>
<garnt> mostly wrote the wall but like the </garnt>
<garnt> entire band like did it as well but like </garnt>
<garnt> he went on like a tour all around the </garnt>
<garnt> world to perform the wall </garnt>
<garnt> um and so I got tickets to it like </garnt>
<garnt> miraculously from a friend of mine and I </garnt>
<connor> was like oh my God my dream's gonna </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] come true like I get to see one </garnt>
<connor> of my favorite bands but like it wasn't </connor>
<connor> a concert it was a [ __ ] stage show </connor>
<connor> right so like again the whole concept of </connor>
<connor> the wall is like guy creates a wall </connor>
<connor> that's like not physical and then he </connor>
<connor> like breaks it down while I get over his </connor>
<connor> musical uh and uh emotional bearers </connor>
<connor> right super oversimplifying the element </connor>
<connor> right thank you that's what I mean </connor>
<connor> speedrun but what's amazing what was </connor>
<connor> amazing about that concert is that as </connor>
<joey> they are playing the songs throughout </joey>
<joey> the album they're literally physically </joey>
<connor> building a wall on stage oh that's cool </connor>
<joey> with like it like not obviously not made </joey>
<connor> out of Breeze like like </connor>
<connor> big like Styrofoam so like off to every </connor>
<connor> song the band members actually like go </connor>
<joey> off the stage and like Place bricks on </joey>
<joey> the wall that's cool and then in the in </joey>
<garnt> the second heart and then in the first </garnt>
<garnt> half of the album he finishes building </garnt>
<garnt> the wall and then it just goes into like </garnt>
<garnt> uh an Intel is funded by Donald Trump </garnt>
<joey> yeah definitely he was like I want it </joey>
<joey> taller </joey>
<joey> half </joey>
<joey> wall is built right but they build it in </joey>
<connor> front of the band so as the concert is </connor>
<garnt> going on you can see less and less </garnt>
<connor> that's so cool and then the second half </connor>
<connor> of the album starts the entire stage </connor>
<connor> spins around that's how we're looking </connor>
<connor> and so now you're looking from inside </connor>
<joey> the wall and then because that's the </joey>
<joey> theme of the second half of the album </joey>
<connor> and then at one point and at the end </connor>
<connor> they spin the stage round it was it was </connor>
<joey> all just on this like giant like lazy </joey>
<joey> susan-esque like just rotating the whole </joey>
<connor> thing right um and then like second the </connor>
<connor> second to last song on the album the </connor>
<connor> main protagonist of the album he breaks </connor>
<connor> down the wall and they literally like </connor>
<connor> blow this [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> and just the pieces just go flying into </connor>
<garnt> the crowd and then the album just ends </garnt>
<garnt> and like I've never like cried during a </garnt>
<connor> concert but that was the first time I </connor>
<connor> was like CR like it was one of those </connor>
<connor> Concepts where it's like you know </connor>
<connor> normally like say if you go see Muse or </connor>
<connor> like pendulum right yeah you're [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like standing up you're like grooving </connor>
<connor> your singing along you're like [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> you know like that kind of thing that </connor>
<connor> was the first ever concert I went to </connor>
<connor> where I was just like </connor>
<connor> my ass firmly planted on the seat and </connor>
<connor> just staring right and just like </connor>
<joey> listening and like taking it in because </joey>
<connor> it's like I wish I could have that </connor>
<connor> because I wish I could know it was crazy </connor>
<connor> it was like one of the like I've been a </connor>
<joey> lot of concerts in my life but that was </joey>
<garnt> like one of the most like </garnt>
<joey> I like ethereal is like the only way I </joey>
<garnt> can describe it it's just so like oh my </garnt>
<garnt> God it's so much as someone who doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> understand a lot of like the deeper </garnt>
<garnt> appeal of music like what it what makes </garnt>
<joey> the wall such an amazing album because </joey>
<joey> like to me the war was just like the </joey>
<joey> album you say if you want to impress a </joey>
<joey> dad you know like like you you </joey>
<joey> male friend's dad or something and </joey>
<joey> you're like </joey>
<connor> easy [ __ ] brownies I love ipas </connor>
<connor> um okay so I did like a whole </connor>
<connor> dissertation on the wall I did like a </connor>
<connor> fork so I took like music as like a a </connor>
<connor> major right in high school because I </connor>
<connor> wanted to like pursue it in uni </connor>
<connor> obviously I didn't end up pursuing it </connor>
<connor> your dads were like no no you're Asian </connor>
<joey> Jerry yeah </joey>
<joey> right now and uh like one of like I I </joey>
<garnt> did I studied like musicology which is </garnt>
<joey> Just Like Music analysis basically yeah </joey>
<garnt> and they were like and like the </garnt>
<connor> year-long dissertation was take an album </connor>
<connor> and just like write a dissertation about </connor>
<connor> like write an album like write an album </connor>
<connor> review basically I wrote like this like </connor>
<connor> 40 page like dissertation on the wall </connor>
<connor> and like what's like the most insane </connor>
<connor> thing about the wall is like not just </connor>
<connor> the fact that like the story is cohesive </connor>
<connor> and like all the songs flow together </connor>
<connor> like there was no pauses between any of </connor>
<connor> the songs as it follows from one song to </connor>
<connor> another like the entire album is </connor>
<connor> connected to just one big song but the </connor>
<connor> most amazing like mind-blowing thing is </connor>
<connor> the fact that the album literally </connor>
<connor> repeats and that's cool right right so </connor>
<connor> the end the ending of The Last Song </connor>
<connor> Fades into the the beginning of the </connor>
<connor> first song that's pretty cool and like </connor>
<connor> that just like completely like and and </connor>
<connor> that's not just like a stylistic thing </connor>
<connor> like they did that on purpose to show </connor>
<connor> that like what this main character is </connor>
<connor> going through is it never ending cycle </connor>
<joey> right right and it's just no it's just </joey>
<connor> constantly repeating over and over as </connor>
<joey> well with uh with The Eagle right yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so like uh the </joey>
<connor> wall was I I'd say it was like the first </connor>
<connor> album to like incorporate that style and </connor>
<connor> like a lot of obviously like Tyler and </connor>
<connor> like a lot of artists took that yeah </connor>
<connor> um but yeah I mean like you know I've </connor>
<connor> always said that like you can make like </connor>
<joey> a concept heavy album right and like try </joey>
<joey> and tell a story but if the music sucks </joey>
<joey> then the music's new song </joey>
<joey> right it's like you could you could have </joey>
<joey> the most like deep ass like message </joey>
<joey> about like you know whatever the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you're trying to sing about but if the </joey>
<connor> song doesn't stick with you then it's </connor>
<connor> like there's no point yeah the wall </connor>
<connor> though is like every song's a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Banger so even if you listen to it </connor>
<connor> individually it's like oh it's a great </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] song yeah it's still [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> slaps and then on top of that it's like </connor>
<connor> oh it's deep as well and profound and </connor>
<connor> it's lyrics it's like what more right </connor>
<connor> um you know and like what the one thing </connor>
<connor> though that annoys the [ __ ] out of me is </connor>
<connor> the fact that Another Brick in the Wall </connor>
<connor> is from this album and it's like Pink </connor>
<connor> Floyd's most well-known song yeah right </connor>
<connor> just because and then like it's a bulb </connor>
<connor> but so many people just listen to it out </connor>
<joey> of context they don't know what it means </joey>
<joey> because they don't know what it means </joey>
<joey> because like if you actually yeah </joey>
<joey> because in the context of the album it's </joey>
<joey> a really [ __ ] depressing song yeah </joey>
<joey> but it's just like played in an upbeat </joey>
<connor> and it's like it's like a great song </connor>
<connor> right it's like I'm not gonna fault them </connor>
<connor> for that but um yeah I don't know and </connor>
<connor> like all their albums just like that </connor>
<connor> they've never had a bad album it might </connor>
<connor> be </connor>
<connor> um so there's that I know you love </connor>
<connor> Radiohead In awful lot I love Radiohead </connor>
<joey> uh as as does God yeah I do as well it </joey>
<garnt> was Bond over radio yeah I mean like I </garnt>
<connor> had to like pick between Muse and </connor>
<garnt> Radiohead and I was just like uh Muse </garnt>
<garnt> just slightly edges it out there's any </garnt>
<connor> Radiohead songs that I've heard that </connor>
<garnt> I've been like I love this song do you </garnt>
<joey> have you listened to creep I don't like </joey>
<joey> creeper the best song you guys always </joey>
<connor> sing it well I mean this is like this </connor>
<joey> it's it's like the song because it's the </joey>
<connor> least depressing radio yeah I don't </connor>
<connor> really like the depressing song yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's the weekend see because at least </garnt>
<connor> it's gonna not be right here </connor>
<connor> yeah that's because I started listening </connor>
<connor> to the lyrics I'm not gonna do that </connor>
<joey> again </joey>
<joey> um I don't know like I think for me </joey>
<joey> Radiohead I what I appreciate the most </joey>
<joey> about Radiohead is that they started off </joey>
<joey> as just like another 90s like </joey>
<joey> alternative rock band and then the one </joey>
<joey> day they were just like no I don't think </joey>
<joey> I will I don't think I'll be another a </joey>
<joey> 90s alternative rock band I'm gonna try </joey>
<connor> something else and then Okay computer </connor>
<connor> came out and it was like one of the most </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] like revolutionary 90s like </connor>
<connor> rock bands ever and then like bands like </connor>
<connor> Muse </connor>
<connor> listen to that and was like we can do </connor>
<garnt> that too yeah yeah exactly and like </garnt>
<connor> Coldplay as well was like heavily </connor>
<joey> influenced by Radiohead and like all </joey>
<joey> these like big old alternative rock </joey>
<garnt> bands that went a little experimental </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean I mean I feel like Radiohead </garnt>
<connor> All the OG in that sense and yeah you </connor>
<connor> know they are they are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> incredible and the only reason I put </connor>
<connor> Muse above them was because like I think </connor>
<connor> I discovered them both at around the </connor>
<connor> same time yeah yeah yeah and I like but </connor>
<connor> like there's so many nights where I just </connor>
<connor> like conquer and just listen to </connor>
<connor> Radiohead yeah and I don't know it's to </connor>
<connor> me if if I'm like having an existential </connor>
<connor> crisis I put on Radiohead man because </connor>
<joey> there's nothing that just like </joey>
<garnt> encapsulates that mood rather than just </garnt>
<joey> like a Radiohead song like sometimes I'm </joey>
<joey> just like you know what I just want to </joey>
<joey> stay home and just like feel depressed </joey>
<connor> I wish I could feel this strongly about </connor>
<connor> music I do I remember I was at a place </connor>
<connor> that was like classical music being </connor>
<connor> played and uh there's this guy uh I was </connor>
<connor> I was enjoying it I thought it was </connor>
<connor> amazing I was like these guys are so </connor>
<connor> talented yeah and there's a guy who's uh </connor>
<connor> in the front and uh I could see him </connor>
<connor> because it was kind of like you know </connor>
<connor> circle like semicircle you can see him </connor>
<connor> uh he was like tearing up how good this </connor>
<connor> was yeah I remember thinking like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> how did he do that </connor>
<connor> how did he do that how does this mean so </connor>
<connor> much to him or how did it make him feel </connor>
<connor> this way because I don't understand I </connor>
<connor> like this sound a lot and I really </connor>
<connor> appreciated the Artistry and everything </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like [ __ ] man I wish I was </garnt>
<garnt> just able to get what that guy had like </garnt>
<garnt> emotional about from the from the music </garnt>
<garnt> it like really made him emotional I can </garnt>
<joey> I can easily yeah I can't get that I </joey>
<joey> think there's only I think this is true </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] up I think there's only two </garnt>
<joey> artists in my three by three that </joey>
<connor> haven't made me cry yeah yeah I don't </connor>
<connor> know is that weird that I can't I I </connor>
<garnt> don't think it's starting to think it's </garnt>
<garnt> weird I wish I could get that like so to </garnt>
<joey> me to me I have a different problem </joey>
<joey> because I like I said I never know like </joey>
<joey> the deeper meaning behind the music but </joey>
<joey> like I've I've cried to so many songs I </joey>
<connor> have no idea what they're about because </connor>
<connor> they just make me feel things </connor>
<garnt> these things like I don't listen I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what the lyrics mean I'm just like </garnt>
<joey> damn man this I think like have you ever </joey>
<joey> just like sat down and just listened to </joey>
<joey> music yeah </joey>
<connor> and likes but but I guess but I guess </connor>
<joey> you're listening to like dolphin [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah it's not like Digital Love isn't </connor>
<joey> necessarily going to make you cry no </joey>
<connor> yeah you're right I don't know right I </connor>
<connor> guess just maybe the music I listen to </connor>
<joey> the way I consume it yeah maybe I don't </joey>
<joey> know but I don't think it's weird I </joey>
<connor> think there's a lot of people because I </connor>
<connor> don't struggle to I you know when I </connor>
<connor> watch TV or anything it's like super </connor>
<joey> easy you cry all the time but there are </joey>
<joey> people who like struggle to cry watching </joey>
<connor> movies that's true right so I guess it's </connor>
<joey> the same thing so it's not like I'm </joey>
<joey> sitting there like dude come on tears </joey>
<connor> I'm not bad doing that it's just like I </connor>
<connor> don't I don't get what this guy's </connor>
<connor> getting I don't understand why I you </connor>
<connor> know maybe it's I don't know maybe maybe </connor>
<garnt> maybe as I'm mature I might yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> like to me like music is it's gonna </garnt>
<joey> sound so philosophical now it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like a language you know they're like </joey>
<joey> they're absolutely I don't speak it is </joey>
<connor> like I feel like there is something </connor>
<connor> being communicated through the language </connor>
<connor> of music and like I don't even </connor>
<connor> understand the words behind the music </connor>
<connor> but I feel you know there are times when </connor>
<garnt> I think I feel or the language behind it </garnt>
<garnt> and like the emotion that is being </garnt>
<connor> portrayed with the music that's true I </connor>
<connor> mean if animals are anything to go by </connor>
<connor> you know dancing is a language singing </connor>
<connor> is a language somehow they don't </connor>
<joey> understand I imagine what they're saying </joey>
<connor> but it does something and it that's how </connor>
<joey> they decided they yeah it's just like </joey>
<joey> pulls out like just some kind of like </joey>
<connor> Primal yeah I think so I think we have </connor>
<connor> an inclination to feeling towards it </connor>
<connor> like I don't know what makes like I </connor>
<garnt> don't know what makes good music like I </garnt>
<joey> I I don't know what makes good music </joey>
<joey> like literally I think what makes good </joey>
<joey> music is just if it makes you feel a </joey>
<connor> certain way I watched like musical memes </connor>
<connor> like memes that only people who like or </connor>
<connor> are really into music would get and I'm </connor>
<connor> like I feel like this is funny I just </connor>
<connor> didn't I just couldn't understand why it </connor>
<connor> was fun right but like when somebody </connor>
<joey> plays like C minor or something like </joey>
<joey> that I'll be like what but yeah that was </joey>
<joey> kind of funny that's a bit of a deep cut </joey>
<joey> something along those lines </joey>
<joey> um and then I guess like tool is like </joey>
<joey> probably the one band that made me love </joey>
<connor> metal again right um because like do I </connor>
<connor> know any of the songs </connor>
<connor> the name sounds extremely familiar I </connor>
<garnt> mean there yeah because Joey just talked </garnt>
<connor> about it </connor>
<connor> can I talk about them all the time but </connor>
<connor> like I think like I think what like </connor>
<connor> speaking of like Primal Instinct I think </connor>
<joey> like tall does the best job of like </joey>
<joey> pulling out like that Primal Instinct in </joey>
<joey> people Oh I thought you're talking about </joey>
<garnt> bam there </garnt>
<joey> I was like Primal this thing that's what </joey>
<joey> I'm not that bad there's a vehicle </joey>
<joey> Primal scream which is good but no </joey>
<joey> problem </joey>
<joey> um yeah I don't know like tool is like I </joey>
<joey> don't think they necessarily have like a </joey>
<joey> hit song or anything they kind of like </joey>
<joey> one of those just like cult bands I </joey>
<garnt> guess maybe like the pot yeah sober the </garnt>
<garnt> part Prison Sex there's a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> good songs but like I think what makes </garnt>
<garnt> it like I think what makes tool amazing </garnt>
<garnt> and what I fell in love with tall is </garnt>
<garnt> that like especially like this is a band </garnt>
<garnt> that like you need to listen to the </garnt>
<joey> lyrics okay because it's like like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but but what I love about tool is that </garnt>
<connor> their music just in general is so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good that you'll still enjoy </connor>
<connor> yourself without listening to the lyrics </connor>
<connor> at all okay so like um Manny James </connor>
<connor> Keenan who's this guy in the middle he's </connor>
<connor> the lead singer </connor>
<connor> um in his in like tall stage shows and </connor>
<connor> like concerts normally the lead singer </connor>
<connor> is in the front right but me and it for </connor>
<connor> some reason is behind a curtain in the </connor>
<connor> back like you can't even see him half </connor>
<connor> the time in concerts and that's because </connor>
<connor> he treats his voice as just another </connor>
<connor> instrument and if you want to listen in </connor>
<connor> closely on what he's saying then you can </connor>
<connor> if you don't want to you don't have to </connor>
<connor> there's the rest of the band to listen </connor>
<connor> to and I think that's like so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cool because it's like again it goes </connor>
<connor> back to that whole thing of like you </connor>
<connor> might have like some deep ass message </connor>
<connor> behind your music but if your music </connor>
<connor> sucks then No One's Gonna [ __ ] listen </connor>
<connor> to it right sure and like tall is like </connor>
<connor> we can make Banger songs and we can make </connor>
<connor> profound lyrics that makes sense and </connor>
<connor> it's like that's and like I don't know </connor>
<connor> it's just like musicians it's like I I </connor>
<connor> Inspire to be that </connor>
<connor> um and yeah like I don't know like like </connor>
<connor> tool is one of those metal bands that </connor>
<connor> like even non-metal fans love like I </connor>
<connor> think every person I've shown tall who </connor>
<connor> is like not necessarily in the middle </connor>
<connor> music is like yeah this [ __ ] slot oh </connor>
<connor> so like I'd recommend if you don't like </connor>
<connor> metal listen at all </connor>
<connor> um and then oh God I guess we'll go to </connor>
<connor> doctor Dooms </connor>
<connor> I knew that I knew that </connor>
<joey> um so MF Doom yeah uh as as Connor said </joey>
<joey> is your favorite rapper's favorite </joey>
<garnt> rapper I've seen that YouTube video yeah </garnt>
<connor> I've </connor>
<connor> I've heard so much about this person but </connor>
<joey> I've never listened to the music yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so basically like uh Tyler the </joey>
<joey> Creator and like you know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> literally every like rapper everyone </joey>
<connor> loves and has gotten big has been </connor>
<connor> somehow inspired by mf2 just because </connor>
<connor> he's like and he's like the hip-hop fans </connor>
<connor> hip-hop if that makes sense yeah like </connor>
<connor> because like I I feel like before MF </connor>
<connor> Doom the only like hip-hop I ever really </connor>
<connor> listened to Growing Up was like Eminem </connor>
<connor> but that's because Eminem back then was </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] inescapable like yeah </connor>
<connor> during like Eminem Show era Eminem like </connor>
<connor> Eminem was everywhere right like </connor>
<connor> um so like I feel back then I didn't </connor>
<connor> really like Take hip-hop seriously or </connor>
<connor> like rapping seriously other than Eminem </connor>
<connor> um but then I listen to MF Doom and I </connor>
<connor> was like okay hold on this might </connor>
<connor> actually this might this might actually </connor>
<connor> be good this might be some good music </connor>
<joey> um again another artist you need to like </joey>
<joey> listen to the lyrics uh so yeah I </joey>
<connor> remember I remember that I don't know </connor>
<connor> who broke it down Vox did a video </connor>
<connor> and I was like this is amazing I just </connor>
<connor> don't I don't know yeah yeah I don't </connor>
<connor> know I don't think I could ever Garner </connor>
<garnt> this by myself yeah yeah if you come </garnt>
<connor> close to garnering this by myself it's </connor>
<connor> like when they tell you like why the </connor>
<connor> piano is a this specific piano is </connor>
<connor> amazing I'm like I'm sure it is it </connor>
<connor> certainly looks the part but I don't </connor>
<joey> yeah I don't know yeah no it makes sense </joey>
<joey> it makes sense I mean it's just like </joey>
<joey> good music in general </joey>
<joey> um again I'm having a hard time </joey>
<joey> explaining why this is good to people </joey>
<connor> who aren't on the same way any any </connor>
<connor> hardcore music fans here can appreciate </connor>
<garnt> your your take </garnt>
<joey> yes if uh if we were more hardcore into </joey>
<garnt> music how would you explain it then I </garnt>
<joey> because I am curious </joey>
<joey> um okay so break it down for me </joey>
<connor> focusing on 100 break it down okay so </connor>
<joey> tool for example </joey>
<joey> um is like like just this this sound and </joey>
<joey> like their singing style and the way </joey>
<garnt> they structure songs is like it just has </garnt>
<garnt> like a flow to it like one song could </garnt>
<garnt> have like seven or rate different parts </garnt>
<garnt> that sound like seven or eight different </garnt>
<garnt> songs but somehow they can stitch that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up together and make it sound so </garnt>
<joey> cohesive and like together to the point </joey>
<joey> where like you can listen through a 15 </joey>
<joey> minute tour song and it'll sound like </joey>
<garnt> two minutes yeah I was gonna ask how </garnt>
<garnt> long is a typical Tool song they're not </garnt>
<joey> actually two like I mean they obviously </joey>
<joey> have like long songs as well but I think </joey>
<joey> like average tall songs maybe like five </joey>
<joey> six minutes it's quite long which I </joey>
<connor> guess it's long but I mean like if you </connor>
<connor> compare it to like say I don't know a </connor>
<connor> tangerine dream song like like it's like </connor>
<connor> a standard Tangerine Dream song is like </connor>
<connor> 20 minutes that's a good name yeah so </connor>
<connor> I've never heard of them but that's a </connor>
<connor> good name so Tangerine Dream is this </connor>
<connor> German group uh yeah yeah it's good it's </connor>
<connor> a great [ __ ] band name uh so they're </connor>
<joey> a German group uh that like does like </joey>
<joey> Electronica and like ambient music right </joey>
<joey> and uh I put them there because this is </joey>
<joey> the one group I used to listen to all </joey>
<connor> the time in school while I was studying </connor>
<connor> how did you find out about this band oh </connor>
<connor> my God my dad showed me oh okay so </connor>
<connor> basically every I reckon everyone except </connor>
<garnt> maybe the bottom three here I found out </garnt>
<garnt> through my dad all right </garnt>
<garnt> um so like he yeah he raised you well </garnt>
<garnt> man yeah but he's proud of you yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um so Tangerine Dream have been around </garnt>
<connor> there's still around actually they've </connor>
<connor> been around for like 60 years almost </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah I think they've been around </connor>
<connor> since like the early 60s and the story </connor>
<connor> yeah 1968 yeah [ __ ] hell and they're </connor>
<garnt> still they're still going um they have </garnt>
<garnt> like I think they have like 400 Studio </garnt>
<connor> albums or something </connor>
<connor> they have a big big big catalog like </connor>
<connor> it's stupid amount of albums I've made </connor>
<connor> um but like basically they like </connor>
<connor> revolutionize like chill Electronica </connor>
<connor> like meditation music ambient music that </connor>
<connor> kind of stuff and so it's like perfect </connor>
<connor> study material like because it's like </connor>
<connor> there's no lyrics better than Lo-Fi </connor>
<connor> better than Lo-Fi hip-hop girls yeah </connor>
<joey> Wi-Fi hip-hop girl wishes they were </joey>
<joey> tangible </joey>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> um but yeah uh I don't know it's just </connor>
<connor> like really good like Tangerine Dream I </connor>
<connor> would say is like perfect background </connor>
<connor> music of just like if you're at like you </connor>
<connor> know and like if you have like friends </connor>
<connor> over and you're just like you just want </connor>
<connor> to like hang out or you're like you know </connor>
<connor> you have your [ __ ] like I don't know </connor>
<connor> fiance's parents over right and you </connor>
<joey> don't want to sound you don't want to </joey>
<joey> look weird by like putting on like tall </joey>
<connor> in the background you know Tangerine </connor>
<connor> Dream is like the music to go right </connor>
<connor> because it's just like it's just </connor>
<connor> relaxing it's inoffensive it's just I'll </connor>
<connor> check it out yeah and like they've got a </connor>
<connor> like a lot of good stuff they did a lot </connor>
<connor> of like uh movie soundtracks oh really </connor>
<connor> yeah there was this uh what was the Tom </connor>
<connor> Cruise movie that they did the </connor>
<connor> soundtrack to </connor>
<connor> um they did a lot of soundtracks though </connor>
<garnt> um and like game soundtracks as well </garnt>
<garnt> that they're done yeah yeah so uh what </garnt>
<garnt> kind of games </garnt>
<garnt> I I wish I could do they've done they've </garnt>
<garnt> done 400 albums I don't [ __ ] remember </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> Risky Business yeah they did the Risky </garnt>
<joey> Business soundtrack oh wow which is like </joey>
<joey> probably one of their best albums </joey>
<joey> um yeah they just they're literally just </joey>
<connor> three German dudes who uh play a lot of </connor>
<connor> like relaxing music </connor>
<connor> um and then I guess Nick Drake is this </connor>
<connor> guy </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> so Nick Drake is like he so he's like </joey>
<connor> kind of he plays folk music okay as if </connor>
<joey> you couldn't tell from this picture uh </joey>
<connor> but he uh he basically it's really hard </connor>
<joey> to describe him so he he basically he </joey>
<connor> killed himself very early in his career </connor>
<connor> okay um I think he was like 23 24. </connor>
<connor> um but he made this one album called </connor>
<connor> pink moon yeah and it's like it's </connor>
<connor> literally just him and a guitar yeah </connor>
<connor> that's it and it's like super low-fi </connor>
<connor> it's just it's just him just like </connor>
<connor> singing Just One Guitar occasionally </connor>
<connor> maybe like a piano right but like it's </connor>
<connor> so like it's one of like </connor>
<connor> look like when it comes to like </connor>
<connor> depression like as a theme in music yeah </connor>
<connor> a lot of artists have done it yeah from </connor>
<connor> like all sorts of different angles in my </connor>
<connor> opinion pink moon is probably the most </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hard-hitting and like real album </connor>
<connor> when it comes to like depression and </connor>
<connor> exploring what makes you say that </connor>
<connor> it's because like it's not only just </connor>
<connor> like the tone of his singing and just </connor>
<connor> the fact that it's just him and a guitar </connor>
<connor> yeah but it's again it's like lyrics </connor>
<connor> obviously yeah </connor>
<connor> um he has this one song called </connor>
<connor> um uh I think it's called Black Dog </connor>
<connor> um and it inspired a book called black </connor>
<connor> dog or it's like depression is like a </connor>
<joey> black dog it just like keeps coming back </joey>
<joey> and like that's from the song that he </joey>
<joey> wrote </joey>
<joey> um but it's like I don't know it's like </joey>
<joey> it's beautiful but it's like haunting </joey>
<joey> it's like really really [ __ ] haunting </joey>
<joey> and like every time I play this album </joey>
<joey> like there's just like a couple of songs </joey>
<joey> that I just hit where I'm just like </joey>
<connor> break down crying I guess because you </connor>
<connor> know the you know what how yeah real the </connor>
<garnt> stuff when someone's in that state of </garnt>
<joey> mind you know sometimes it's like you </joey>
<joey> sometimes you can't always express </joey>
<joey> yourself or communicate that emotion </joey>
<joey> without having a medium like music or </joey>
<joey> some something like that like what I can </joey>
<joey> say is that like Nick Drake is music but </joey>
<garnt> what it's certainly not is entertainment </garnt>
<garnt> right it is oh yes </garnt>
<connor> it is just like it is music in its </connor>
<connor> purest artistic form yeah where it's </connor>
<connor> like you don't put on a Nick Drake album </connor>
<connor> to [ __ ] jam out you put on a Nick </connor>
<connor> Drake album to like self-reflect and </connor>
<connor> like you know just kind of take it in </connor>
<connor> yeah and like you know kind of learn </connor>
<garnt> from it right because like he was like </garnt>
<garnt> he was super depressed like I'm talking </garnt>
<garnt> like mega mega mega depressed from a </garnt>
<garnt> child yeah and like I mean I believe </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah and uh you know and like it </garnt>
<garnt> led him to take his own life even though </garnt>
<connor> he was like extremely [ __ ] talented </connor>
<connor> he probably had a bright future ahead of </connor>
<connor> him if he kept going but yeah depression </connor>
<connor> very hard to deal with yeah so then he </connor>
<connor> just kind of like gained a cult status </connor>
<connor> because of that and my sister actually </connor>
<connor> like put me on to Nick Drake </connor>
<connor> um because I guess she was in like a </connor>
<connor> stage in her life where she kind of was </connor>
<connor> like yeah and I was like I I feel like I </connor>
<garnt> found him in like the perfect time and </garnt>
<joey> again like this is not an honest I would </joey>
<garnt> recommend to people who want bangers </garnt>
<garnt> well I like I feel like that type of </garnt>
<garnt> music or that type of media definitely </garnt>
<joey> has a place because especially like when </joey>
<joey> you are in a dark place sometimes you're </joey>
<joey> not looking for like happy music or like </joey>
<joey> things to cheer you up but like </joey>
<joey> listening to I guess someone who has </joey>
<connor> been in that same emotional status or </connor>
<connor> maybe finding someone who you feel is in </connor>
<connor> that same emotional state as you yes </connor>
<connor> there's like a comfort knowing that at </connor>
<garnt> least you're not like the only one who's </garnt>
<garnt> feeling like this now and and when I was </garnt>
<joey> in that like moment in my life as well </joey>
<garnt> and listening to Nick Drake I think this </garnt>
<joey> album cheered me up more than any [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> album yeah it's weird because when I'm </garnt>
<garnt> really depressed and really sad </garnt>
<joey> listening to depressing music cheers me </joey>
<joey> up yeah like it's it's it's like </joey>
<joey> listening to happy music just makes me </joey>
<joey> more depressed yeah because I'm just </joey>
<joey> like how does how like why are they </joey>
<joey> happy and I'm not how dare this beat </joey>
<joey> like be this like upbeat like happy how </joey>
<connor> dare these people be happy yeah you </connor>
<joey> listen to depressing songs and I'm just </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] man I'm not I'm not alone I'm </garnt>
<joey> not the only one I'm not exactly yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly yeah like that's the thing </joey>
<connor> it's like I feel listening to happy </connor>
<connor> music while depressed just does the </connor>
<connor> opposite effect because it makes you go </connor>
<connor> how come they're happy but I'm not yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you know I can't relate to this </connor>
<joey> happy mood right now because that's not </joey>
<connor> where I am right now I'm in this [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> dark depressing like somber moment and I </garnt>
<connor> need something that can like you know </connor>
<garnt> complement that feeling yeah </garnt>
<connor> um so that's why I love Nick Drake </connor>
<connor> um and then yeah I talked about him </connor>
<connor> after him American football uh so </connor>
<joey> they're pretty much I think they're a </joey>
<joey> recent like addition to like my favorite </joey>
<joey> bands but uh they made me fall in love </joey>
<joey> with this genre of music called Midwest </joey>
<joey> emo </joey>
<joey> what what there is a genre of music </joey>
<joey> called Midwest emo you know people say </joey>
<garnt> genres out loud and I just think you're </garnt>
<garnt> just lying </garnt>
<connor> like I just like like you know like at </connor>
<garnt> this point like I feel like music most </garnt>
<joey> of all like people just make up genres </joey>
<joey> oh yeah of course it's like it's it's </joey>
<joey> music most of all yeah of course of </joey>
<joey> course they do they're just like it's </joey>
<joey> not Punk it's it's just some derivative </joey>
<joey> of punk we don't want to be the same as </joey>
<connor> those punk bands so so what's so good </connor>
<joey> about them man okay so it's emo country </joey>
<garnt> no Midwest Midwest emo Midwest emo how </garnt>
<joey> did you define Midwest Midwest uh it is </joey>
<joey> emo made by bands who have lived in the </joey>
<garnt> midwest America so what is the </garnt>
<connor> difference between Midwest emo and emo </connor>
<joey> okay so in terms of sounds </joey>
<connor> I'm sure there is but I wouldn't be </connor>
<connor> aware of it uh so Midwest emo is like so </connor>
<connor> basically these guys founded the genre </connor>
<connor> um and like the Indie scene for the past </connor>
<connor> like 20 years has been just filled with </connor>
<connor> Midwest emo bands </connor>
<connor> um yeah yeah they're like they're like </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of bands who have gotten </connor>
<connor> big off like band camp and like </connor>
<connor> SoundCloud and like Spotify and stuff </connor>
<connor> right that are in this genre </connor>
<connor> um and it's like </connor>
<joey> how do I explain Midwest it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like indie rock and math rock with </joey>
<joey> folk music </joey>
<connor> oh my God that's why I don't understand </connor>
<connor> this is problem because like every time </connor>
<connor> I I excuse people who really know music </connor>
<connor> you start saying things to me I'm like </connor>
<connor> you're just lying you're just lying like </connor>
<joey> why isn't that on on iTunes that thing </joey>
<joey> am I stupid like it is on iTunes it </joey>
<connor> probably is now but like to me it's like </connor>
<connor> are we categorizing music too much I </connor>
<joey> mean I guess but that's because I feel </joey>
<garnt> music just in general has expanded to </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so far that like it's just </garnt>
<joey> like it's kind of a shame to just throw </joey>
<joey> it all away it's just rock oh that's </joey>
<connor> true I guess maybe this is just my own </connor>
<connor> inability to understand it and so I'm </connor>
<joey> just like why yeah well I mean you know </joey>
<joey> it's the same thing with like electronic </joey>
<connor> music right like we have Electronica you </connor>
<garnt> have house you have trance you have yeah </garnt>
<connor> I guess so where whereas like someone </connor>
<garnt> who doesn't like music will be like it's </garnt>
<garnt> just all electronica </garnt>
<garnt> the beeps and the boots it's just the </garnt>
<garnt> beeps and the boobs all right so thank </garnt>
<garnt> you so Midwest Nemo is like it's as the </garnt>
<connor> name suggests a lot of the lyrical </connor>
<connor> themes are very depressing </connor>
<connor> um but it's not like folk music like </connor>
<connor> strictly it's not like a Nick Drake it's </connor>
<connor> like there's there's a band behind it </connor>
<joey> usually a lot of songs can be upbeat but </joey>
<joey> usually the lyrical contents are very </joey>
<connor> depressing hence the emo so that makes </connor>
<connor> the emo when it's depressing yeah okay </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like it's kind of like emo </connor>
<joey> this is going to sound really bad it </joey>
<joey> Midwest emo is like is like Nick Drake </joey>
<connor> if you are privileged </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> so many layers right now it's like </garnt>
<joey> Midwest demo is like it's coming from </joey>
<joey> bands who like have lived in like the </joey>
<joey> Midwest in small towns where like it's </joey>
<connor> not like they're born into like poverty </connor>
<connor> or like just kind of [ __ ] yeah it's just </connor>
<connor> like they kind of just like lived in a </connor>
<garnt> town that's in the middle of nowhere in </garnt>
<garnt> the midwest not a whole lot to do except </garnt>
<garnt> get sad about [ __ ] okay because they </garnt>
<garnt> don't you know because they have like </garnt>
<garnt> usual from like Minnesota yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> it is like Suburban emo that's the only </joey>
<joey> way I just made that up it is </joey>
<connor> is it is I just made a new genre of </connor>
<joey> music it is emo rock yeah with mixes of </joey>
<joey> folk music for people who live in </joey>
<joey> Suburban Midwest areas I think I </joey>
<joey> understand yeah yeah apparently yes </joey>
<joey> apparent Parable Paramore kind of took </joey>
<connor> Midwest emo sound and put a little bit </connor>
<connor> more of like a punk Twist on it yeah </connor>
<connor> right so they're a little more like </connor>
<connor> upbeat right but they're still like you </connor>
<connor> know the lyrical contexts are like </connor>
<connor> Paramore songs are still very much like </connor>
<connor> you know like I'm feeling depressed </connor>
<joey> because this girl doesn't like me and </joey>
<connor> she left me and you know it's like my my </connor>
<joey> town has nothing my friends have all </joey>
<joey> moved away that kind of stuff yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like so American football is that </joey>
<joey> um through American football I found </joey>
<connor> like I like so you know how Spotify has </connor>
<connor> that like Spotify yeah Midwest email was </connor>
<connor> number two for me last year </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> and like American Football was like a </connor>
<connor> big reason for that wow because I just </connor>
<connor> listened to a lot of American football </connor>
<connor> like not just American football there's </connor>
<connor> like a lot of other like Midwest emo and </connor>
<connor> I basically just found this like large </connor>
<joey> pool of Midwest emo bands and they're </joey>
<joey> all [ __ ] amazing what appeals to you </joey>
<garnt> about Midwest emo yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's such a random like it is right </garnt>
<connor> such a random genre of music it's um I </connor>
<connor> don't know for one like the music is </connor>
<connor> just good like it sounds good </connor>
<connor> um it's like performed well like uh </connor>
<connor> because it's like got blends of math </connor>
<connor> Rock which is like very like technical </connor>
<connor> Rock and like technical guitar okay okay </connor>
<connor> I just love that sound in general like </connor>
<connor> Japan does a lot of really good math </connor>
<connor> Rock like Japan Japan has its own like </connor>
<connor> branch of matter called Japanese math </connor>
<connor> Rock and like Japan is like really </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] good at just like you know like </joey>
<connor> like okay okay like Dean does for </connor>
<connor> instance right like the you know like </connor>
<connor> the opening to Psychopaths the first one </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah that's math oh where it's like </connor>
<connor> very technical guitar and it's just like </connor>
<connor> very like Whaley fair enough um but </connor>
<connor> Midwest emo kind of takes a lot of that </connor>
<joey> style of just like technical guitar </joey>
<joey> which just as a guitarist I can </joey>
<garnt> appreciate for one Batman like like one </garnt>
<garnt> thing I always want to know is like how </garnt>
<joey> much do you appreciate music in like a </joey>
<joey> technical sense or like a theory sense </joey>
<joey> where oh obviously you're like way more </joey>
<joey> musical training musically trained then </joey>
<joey> say I am </joey>
<garnt> um so like how much does that play into </garnt>
<garnt> your taste in music or your appreciation </garnt>
<joey> of Music in general I mean you know if I </joey>
<connor> hear something I'm just like oh </connor>
<connor> what did you just do there then </connor>
<joey> obviously I'm gonna like poke my ears up </joey>
<connor> right but like I'm not gonna fall in </connor>
<connor> love with a band just because they're </connor>
<connor> technical right because again at the end </connor>
<connor> of the day if your music isn't good then </connor>
<connor> it's not good right and you know I've </connor>
<connor> listened to a lot of like Midwest emo </connor>
<connor> and like even like metal like technical </connor>
<joey> metal bands and stuff like that where </joey>
<connor> I'm like yeah you're technical you are </connor>
<joey> skilled yeah but the music isn't really </joey>
<connor> for me right right right </connor>
<connor> um yeah and then I guess finally is the </connor>
<connor> only Japanese guy is Maya de June uh he </connor>
<connor> basically that name sounds familiar yeah </connor>
<connor> he wrote music for like Clan Adkins </connor>
<joey> basically every key so basically what </joey>
<connor> makes might adjourn is this because you </connor>
<garnt> got into the gacha recently </garnt>
<joey> what makes my dig my talking idle is </joey>
<garnt> just again the fact that this man can </garnt>
<joey> single-handedly write a story write </joey>
<joey> characters and just write all the music </joey>
<joey> for it just single-handedly like it must </joey>
<connor> be an advantage there that you can like </connor>
<joey> you know the characters and the story </joey>
<connor> better than anyone right you can craft </connor>
<joey> the whole what but like I don't know </joey>
<joey> like of course I like you know I I look </joey>
<joey> up to this guy just for like his ability </joey>
<joey> to like tell a story because like Clan </joey>
<connor> ad and like Aaron Canon and Angel Beats </connor>
<connor> are like you know great stories right </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um but like I think the one thing that </connor>
<connor> makes my like I appreciate my attitude </connor>
<connor> is just how [ __ ] musically talented </connor>
<connor> he is yeah because not only can he write </connor>
<connor> like somber like piano tracks that have </connor>
<connor> no lyrics at all like the entirety of </connor>
<connor> the clan out soundtrack yeah make me cry </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] yeah I cried but he can </connor>
<joey> write [ __ ] bangers as well like you </joey>
<joey> know any of the angel Beats songs like </joey>
<joey> absolute [ __ ] like girls dead monster </joey>
<joey> that like that fictional band he created </joey>
<joey> in Angel Beats every song is a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Banger I'm like you can write bangers </joey>
<connor> and you can make me cry like impressive </connor>
<connor> I didn't know that like how do you do </connor>
<connor> that I didn't know that and so like you </connor>
<connor> were talking about the gotcha game I got </connor>
<connor> into it so key recently released a </connor>
<connor> gotcha game called Heaven Burns Red </connor>
<joey> which is the first fully miter June </joey>
<joey> produced game in 15 years </joey>
<garnt> um and so he wrote the story is it a </garnt>
<joey> visual novel uh it's a it's yeah it's </joey>
<connor> kind of like it's very dialogue </connor>
<garnt> intensive because okay yeah </garnt>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> but it's also like a it's like a </connor>
<connor> turn-based RPG kind of thing as well </connor>
<connor> okay of course it has gotcha so of </connor>
<connor> course music yeah so he wrote the story </connor>
<joey> he wrote the character designs he came </joey>
<joey> up with the character designs he came up </joey>
<joey> with a scenario and he wrote all the </joey>
<garnt> music forward [ __ ] yeah that's why he </garnt>
<garnt> hasn't been doing anime recently hasn't </garnt>
<joey> it exactly all this time you know I got </joey>
<connor> you I mean it's also because he's been </connor>
<connor> like extremely sick yeah as well oh man </connor>
<connor> like the whole like you know the whole </connor>
<connor> theme in like Angel Beats about like the </connor>
<connor> whole thing that's just based off his </connor>
<connor> own life oh Jesus yeah right because he </connor>
<connor> has like a chronic like heart uh like he </connor>
<connor> goes disease or something he's done so </connor>
<connor> much I mean he wrote I'm pretty sure I </connor>
<joey> don't know if this is true but I think </joey>
<garnt> he wrote Angel Beats in the hospital bed </garnt>
<joey> seriously yeah while he was admitted to </joey>
<garnt> hospital he wrote Angels what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> what a [ __ ] bam and it's just yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and he's just like he's a Banff like and </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that like </garnt>
<garnt> again like this man doesn't miss not </garnt>
<joey> like he don't miss like every even in </joey>
<joey> the new game like the story is great the </joey>
<joey> characters are great and the music </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] slaps so I guess I guess </connor>
<connor> everything else just lifts your </connor>
<joey> enjoyment of the music more right and </joey>
<joey> it's like and I feel like you know you </joey>
<joey> know we were saying earlier that like </joey>
<joey> fully cooly as well like pillows I was I </joey>
<connor> was very close to putting pillows </connor>
<connor> because that's just like pinches it out </connor>
<connor> for you yeah I think mightogen just </connor>
<connor> pinches it out for me because like as </connor>
<joey> much as I love the fully cooly </joey>
<joey> soundtrack the first soundtrack that </joey>
<joey> made me fall in love with anime </joey>
<joey> soundtracks was clana because like again </joey>
<connor> as a Pianist myself listening to like </connor>
<connor> piano music that makes me [ __ ] break </connor>
<connor> down crying like don't perform it and </connor>
<connor> it's like I can't even I can't even like </connor>
<connor> learn to play these songs without crying </connor>
<connor> right right and it's like that's that's </connor>
<connor> wholesome and that's like really hard to </connor>
<connor> do as someone who like you know because </connor>
<connor> there's someone who writes music I </connor>
<connor> strive to do that to people right and </connor>
<connor> the fact that this guy can do it over </connor>
<joey> and over and over again with like </joey>
<joey> everything he also writes is like how do </joey>
<connor> you do that why can women have all that </connor>
<joey> Talent okay it's not fair I'm just </joey>
<joey> saying man key would not be where they </joey>
<garnt> are without this guy sometimes you see </garnt>
<garnt> someone and you're like hey you're a bit </garnt>
<joey> too tired well this is unfair and it's </joey>
<joey> good looking like yeah yeah as if I </joey>
<joey> couldn't like like give me something to </joey>
<joey> hate like God obviously didn't love all </joey>
<connor> humans equally he made you he made my </connor>
<joey> energy rate on my origin it's not fair </joey>
<joey> it's not fair I I wish I had a sliver of </joey>
<garnt> the talent this guy has yeah damn but uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I guess that's my </garnt>
<joey> I don't know man I I feel a little bit </joey>
<joey> uh pushed back because I was like I need </joey>
<joey> a somehow top guard living an anime </joey>
<joey> backstory you can't you can't I couldn't </joey>
<connor> top it so I was like the Slumdog </connor>
<joey> Millionaire we're just we're just living </joey>
<joey> in God's life this is we're not we're </joey>
<joey> not I can't story is I will forever live </joey>
<garnt> in that shadow that's why I have </garnt>
<joey> mentioned before I've been in the band </joey>
<connor> just like the same way everyone's been </connor>
<joey> in the band yeah </joey>
<joey> getting like six bands but I never had a </joey>
<garnt> cool story like I just I just I thought </garnt>
<connor> when I said I was in a band everyone had </connor>
<connor> the similar experience I don't know no </connor>
<connor> you're wrong what happened what normally </connor>
<connor> happens when you're in a band then do </connor>
<joey> you not kind of like you pretend yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you go to the drummer's house you </joey>
<joey> play a couple of cover songs that's it </joey>
<joey> and then you're like all right cool </joey>
<connor> see you never again yeah that happens </connor>
<joey> all the time Smash Mouth once yeah </joey>
<connor> what's the point of forming a band if </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna play gigs how are you </connor>
<connor> gonna play a gig how are you gonna </connor>
<connor> arrange that yeah we're [ __ ] dumb as </connor>

<joey> didn't take that I can't even top you </joey>
<joey> when it comes to like band names either </joey>
<joey> because like that band name is just like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like the best band name I was in </joey>
<joey> was resting [ __ ] face </joey>
