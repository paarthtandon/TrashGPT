<joey> one let's cause it's finally here </joey>
<joey> we had some wait more than a year </joey>
<joey> because we had to wait until akihabara </joey>
<garnt> opened up people getting vaccinated and </garnt>
<garnt> um the country letting us finally do </garnt>
<connor> this not even a global pandemic can stop </connor>
<garnt> us from wasting our money on anime </garnt>

<garnt> today </garnt>
<garnt> honestly honestly i'm just i'm here for </garnt>
<garnt> the content i can't wait to show you </garnt>
<connor> some of the stuff that i bought </connor>
<connor> stop being a good sportsman for one </connor>
<joey> second and talk trash all right well no </joey>
<joey> that's how you lose haven't you learned </joey>
<connor> from the past special so if you don't </connor>
<connor> know there are three videos on our own </connor>
<connor> respective channels where we went to </connor>
<connor> akihabara and spent three thousand three </connor>
<connor> hundred and thirty three dollars each a </connor>
<connor> total of ten thousand dollars between </connor>
<connor> the trash table which is where budget </connor>
<garnt> which is where the clickbait comes from </garnt>
<connor> we're like we're like we can stretch </connor>
<garnt> this out to ten thousand dollars so we </garnt>
<connor> can put it on the video title </connor>
<connor> and we have various challenges at those </connor>
<connor> stores that we can we hopefully </connor>
<connor> completed and we'll talk about on this </connor>
<joey> episode of the podcast but we have no </joey>
<joey> idea what each other bought we don't </joey>
<joey> know how many challenges we've completed </joey>
<garnt> and uh yeah today is the day where we're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna find out we have an idea about </garnt>
<garnt> what the other boys did but if you want </garnt>
<garnt> to find out now before you watch this </garnt>
<connor> then please go watch all of our videos </connor>
<connor> or you can watch this first and then go </connor>
<connor> to watch the videos kind of like </connor>
<garnt> watching the avengers end game and then </garnt>
<connor> watching iron man either way either way </connor>
<connor> we'll either watch all of them </connor>
<connor> now or watch all of them after i would </connor>
<connor> say watch all of them before but that's </connor>
<joey> just fine yeah but they're all up right </joey>
<joey> now and they're all down in the </joey>
<joey> description so check them out yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> and also on our main channels not our </garnt>
<connor> second channel yeah </connor>
<connor> so basically we're gonna just kind of i </connor>
<connor> guess run through the products uh </connor>
<connor> there's also overarching challenges joey </connor>
<connor> do you have them all of the the </connor>
<connor> challenges that aren't for the store </connor>
<garnt> they're after they are they are on </garnt>
<joey> screen right now we're not going to read </joey>
<joey> them all out we've got 16 of them yeah </joey>
<joey> we have 16 of them but uh i think what </joey>
<joey> some of the notable ones that we </joey>
<garnt> remember are like stuff like buying a </garnt>
<garnt> figure closest to the price of 420 and </garnt>
<connor> also </connor>
<garnt> as well </garnt>
<connor> of course of course </connor>
<connor> i'll be honest i don't remember much of </connor>
<joey> the other challenges i don't either so </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be interesting yeah because </joey>
<joey> by coincidence i remember </joey>
<garnt> like in the first tour i completely </garnt>
<garnt> forgot we had overarching challenges and </garnt>
<garnt> it was only in the second store that i </garnt>
<connor> started to figure out well we we all try </connor>
<joey> to go for the 69 one right i think we </joey>
<joey> all try for the city </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah that was uh that was </joey>
<connor> interesting it's a lot harder than i </connor>
<garnt> thought it was yeah so how did you boys </garnt>
<garnt> feel going into this challenge compared </garnt>
<joey> to i mean my challenges that i got at </joey>
<joey> each store were way easier than last </joey>
<joey> year which is good so i think i i have a </joey>
<joey> better chance this year </joey>
<joey> it's really up to you guys really i </joey>
<joey> think i think god though got like some </joey>
<garnt> of the harder ones </garnt>
<garnt> i just kept getting [ __ ] this year man </garnt>
<joey> which is why i was just like you know </joey>
<joey> what i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just gonna </joey>
<joey> content the first time that's how i felt </joey>
<joey> last year </joey>
<garnt> and this guy got an easy road again for </garnt>
<connor> the most part for the most part i think </connor>
<connor> hard challenges i had to find a </connor>
<connor> a figure from an anime jerry had watched </connor>
<connor> do you know how hard that is </connor>
<connor> i had more like finding the the needle </connor>
<connor> in the haystack </connor>
<connor> like what are you what are you </connor>
<connor> this whole store full of anime and jerry </connor>
<joey> hasn't seen a single one i think uh it </joey>
<joey> was interesting though because we went </joey>
<garnt> to four stores again this year um two of </garnt>
<garnt> them were ones that we've been to </garnt>
<garnt> previously which was a stop and army </garnt>
<garnt> army yes and then we had two brand new </garnt>
<garnt> ones which was rasheem bun and mandarake </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and uh i think the new stores were </garnt>
<joey> definitely a challenge because uh yeah </joey>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> it added some spice into the mix because </garnt>
<garnt> we didn't know what to expect so </garnt>
<joey> especially ending on mandarake it was so </joey>
<joey> much risk came into what was in </joey>
<joey> mandarake because i </joey>
<joey> hadn't been to akihabara for about a </joey>
<joey> good year yeah so i literally had no </joey>
<joey> ideas what would be in any of these </joey>
<joey> stores right yeah mandarake is truly </joey>
<joey> like the needle in the haystack store </joey>
<joey> where like you go in it's it's the don </joey>
<joey> quixote of [ __ ] things i've found the </joey>
<connor> coolest stuff in mandarake oh yeah you </connor>
<joey> also don't find a lot of stuff in </joey>
<garnt> mandarake yeah it's it's either all so </garnt>
<connor> i'm glad we had some variations yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly there was a store that sold </connor>
<joey> everything some stores that didn't sell </joey>
<joey> anything </joey>
<garnt> uh some stores that uh had a lot of loot </garnt>
<garnt> stuff so that's good yeah yeah but i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i was i was kind of nervous kind of </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't i </garnt>
<garnt> it was weird because this time i wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about decorating as much as i </garnt>
<garnt> was winning yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was like i don't care about decorating </garnt>
<connor> the office [ __ ] that yeah it's all about </connor>
<joey> winning by the way if you if you're </joey>
<joey> brand new to trash taste the the figures </joey>
<joey> that you see uh on the backseat are the </joey>
<garnt> stuff that we got last year yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> so we only had a budget of 500 last time </garnt>
<garnt> and they got us all this </garnt>
<garnt> uh so we like we we </garnt>
<joey> what was it six times yeah seven times </joey>
<garnt> the budget now six topics sex top with </garnt>
<connor> the budget i almost believe that the </connor>
<connor> saying of like constraints make uh the </connor>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> what did you say i was like i have sex </garnt>
<connor> this man this man is the oldest one </connor>
<joey> that's why i tried to not say that </joey>
<joey> instead i said six times </joey>
<garnt> it's like i completely i think almost </garnt>
<connor> having no limitations well there was </connor>
<joey> limitations the money was you know but </joey>
<joey> three thousand dollars is a lot yes more </joey>
<joey> than one person will ever spend so i </joey>
<joey> feel like having no limitation nearly on </joey>
<joey> what you could spend almost made it </joey>
<joey> harder yeah yeah because you felt like </joey>
<joey> okay i can buy literally anything now </joey>
<connor> yeah because before is that you would </connor>
<connor> see a 500 figure yeah and it was like </connor>
<connor> well i can't believe that was my budget </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly right you can't buy it </garnt>
<connor> so i almost made it more interesting now </connor>
<garnt> you look for them like the most </garnt>
<garnt> expensive figure in the store and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like okay this is like a sizeable chunk </garnt>
<garnt> in my budget but it's not i'm not going </garnt>
<joey> to be dead in the water even if i buy it </joey>
<joey> yeah let's just say we didn't find a 3 </joey>
<joey> 300 figure </joey>
<garnt> there was some stuff in mandarin </garnt>
<joey> okay yes that was definitely like one </joey>
<joey> figure would have gone our entire budget </joey>
<garnt> yeah but for the most part it definitely </garnt>
<garnt> felt like a big difference from last </garnt>
<garnt> year yeah to this year right because a </garnt>
<garnt> lot </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's a difference between like </garnt>
<garnt> being a student and having like a </garnt>
<garnt> disposable income that's what it felt </garnt>
<connor> like man you know </connor>
<connor> just thinking about some of the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> figures i had to spend money on yeah i </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> no because i remember last year i </garnt>
<garnt> remember going to a store like a stop i </garnt>
<garnt> was looking at figures and like can't </garnt>
<garnt> buy that can't buy that can't buy that </garnt>
<connor> and now this time going into a stop i </connor>
<garnt> was like what can i buy let me just let </garnt>
<joey> me just buy it all you know even the </joey>
<connor> most exciting i'll take your entire </connor>
<connor> stock yeah and it was like i'll go i'll </connor>
<joey> take everything from here to here yeah </joey>
<garnt> and it's like a dent in my body trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste season one versus trash day season </garnt>
<joey> two the peasants versus the kings what's </joey>
<joey> next it's like who can buy out all of a </joey>
<joey> stop first </joey>
<garnt> yeah i actually like got to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where we got to mandarake and i had </garnt>
<garnt> trouble finishing my budget yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> because there was like mandarake had </garnt>
<garnt> some really really cool [ __ ] but the </garnt>
<joey> really really cool [ __ ] was too </joey>
<joey> expensive yeah and then some of the </joey>
<joey> mid-range stuff didn't even make up the </joey>
<joey> budget i had left because originally </joey>
<joey> there's like no in between yeah </joey>
<joey> originally i thought uh we had three </joey>
<joey> thousand dollars to spend </joey>
<joey> um and then only halfway through did i </joey>
<joey> realize oh no the entire budget was ten </joey>
<joey> thousand dollars so technically it's </joey>
<joey> three thousand three hundred thirty </joey>
<joey> three dollars </joey>
<joey> um so </joey>
<joey> so i had to like make up 300 more which </joey>
<joey> i didn't think i had in mandarake yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah um so yeah it was overall very </joey>
<joey> interesting yeah it's very tough yeah it </joey>
<joey> was it was a long day as well my god </joey>
<joey> yeah it's definitely a long day for sure </joey>
<connor> it's great it was good fun though i </connor>
<joey> really enjoyed it i really i really </joey>
<joey> enjoyed it is it exhausting having to </joey>
<joey> run around stores for hours a little bit </joey>
<connor> but i it's not nothing i haven't done </connor>
<connor> before yeah in season one </connor>
<garnt> exactly i definitely felt a lot more </garnt>
<joey> comfortable filming this one than i </joey>
<connor> didn't see yeah you seem like you're </connor>
<connor> like kind of digging it more yeah i </connor>
<joey> remember i remember when we were all </joey>
<joey> filming our intros i had to get away </joey>
<connor> from ghant because it was actually being </connor>
<connor> too loud like morgues now he's like </connor>
<joey> what's up guys it's me gigger </joey>
<garnt> you spend 24 hours </garnt>
<connor> in russian </connor>
<connor> he's gotten too good we've created a </connor>
<joey> monster he's just too good over youtube </joey>
<joey> flashback to season one occupies special </joey>
<garnt> encounters like </garnt>
<garnt> how do i say [ __ ] without a script yeah </garnt>
<joey> because i remember when we were filming </joey>
<joey> season one you boys had finished for </joey>
<joey> like a good 10 minutes filming your </joey>
<joey> intro yeah and i didn't think i'd even </joey>
<garnt> started filming yeah because i'm like oh </garnt>
<joey> cindy uh am i looking a girl yeah </joey>
<connor> what </connor>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> the glow up man it was it was it was </connor>
<connor> great to see we all did a much better </connor>
<connor> job actually i think </connor>
<joey> yeah i hope that came across in the </joey>
<joey> videos yeah you know hopefully they look </joey>
<joey> better sound better and the energy's </joey>
<joey> there yeah yeah although most of the </joey>
<joey> time i did get distracted and i was so </joey>
<connor> focused on doing the things that i </connor>
<connor> forgot to actually talk to the camera a </connor>
<connor> lot of the time i was just so intently </connor>
<connor> focusing on finding these goddamn </connor>
<connor> figures that i didn't i didn't think to </connor>
<garnt> present right now i would like to hear </garnt>
<garnt> even though you should go too long i </garnt>
<connor> would like to hear all of the the </connor>
<connor> overarching challenges because oh sure </connor>
<connor> i'm sure i think it'd be good for the </connor>
<connor> viewers to know what challenges to keep </connor>
<connor> in mind </connor>
<joey> can you stop reviewing so these are the </joey>
<connor> ones that were separate so tell us how </connor>
<connor> much point you get from them as well </connor>
<connor> okay so one point to whoever spends the </connor>
<connor> closest to three thousand three hundred </connor>
<connor> and thirty three dollars and thirty </connor>
<connor> three cents to the budget uh one point </connor>
<connor> to whoever buys the most expensive </connor>
<connor> single figure okay uh the one with the </connor>
<connor> cheapest figure however loses one point </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> figuring from the lowest rated mal </connor>
<joey> series gets one point okay uh the most </joey>
<joey> figurines bought overall gets one point </joey>
<joey> uh most spent on one series gets one </joey>
<joey> point most spent on a non-figure gets </joey>
<joey> one point most spin in one store gets </joey>
<joey> one point so there's lots of </joey>
<joey> room room to wiggle okay uh as we said </joey>
<joey> earlier whoever spends the closest to 69 </joey>
<joey> on a single figure and whoever spends </joey>
<joey> closest to 420 on a single figure get </joey>
<connor> one point each </connor>
<connor> we're counting that as six thousand nine </connor>
<joey> hundred yen or four hundred and twenty </joey>
<joey> thousand forty two thousand yen uh </joey>
<connor> figuring from the highest rated male </connor>
<garnt> series however loses a point that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's the normie point you'll use </garnt>
<connor> uh if anyone bought a hentai figure </connor>
<connor> that's a point because uh you know god </connor>
<garnt> forbid you're going against you </garnt>
<garnt> monetization i totally forgot i had that </garnt>
<garnt> too </garnt>
<garnt> uh i've just </garnt>
<connor> remembered i bought </connor>
<connor> i just said me too </connor>
<garnt> let's just say someone got a point for </garnt>
<garnt> that uh one point to the most figures </garnt>
<garnt> bought from an anime original movie oh </garnt>
<garnt> okay so you know any like shinkai movie </garnt>
<garnt> movie anything like that uh minus one </garnt>
<garnt> point for every funko pop obviously yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh minus one point for every duplicate </garnt>
<connor> character anyone buys and minus two </connor>
<garnt> points for every exact duplicate figure </garnt>
<connor> anyone buys oh i see so we made that </connor>
<garnt> like stakes high because it's like you </garnt>
<garnt> know we might you know say for example </garnt>
<garnt> gan and i might buy and a stolfo figure </garnt>
<garnt> you would lose a point but </garnt>
<garnt> joey's a massive stealth of course but </garnt>
<garnt> there's like lots of the stuff i figures </garnt>
<garnt> right from like different makers so if </garnt>
<garnt> it's the exact same which i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> will happen honestly from the massive </garnt>
<garnt> budget we had then it's two points lost </garnt>
<garnt> uh and then the final one is if you fail </garnt>
<connor> to spend at least a minimum of 50 000 </connor>
<connor> yen at a store or 500 you lose a point i </connor>
<connor> think that was the one we were all kind </connor>
<connor> of paying attention to yeah because i </connor>
<joey> use that as like a good way to gauge </joey>
<connor> the rest of my budget yeah that would </connor>
<connor> encourage us not to hoard all our money </connor>
<garnt> for one store yeah yeah exactly yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> uh just just if we didn't make it clear </garnt>
<garnt> how we are converting we got we're gonna </garnt>
<connor> be saying everything in dollars </connor>
<connor> but that's just basically taking the yen </connor>
<connor> price and dividing by a hundred i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> it's not exactly right but yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's that's exclusive it's the closest </connor>
<connor> you'll you can think of it </connor>
<connor> i guess we should start with the first </connor>
<garnt> store there yeah </garnt>
<connor> so the first store was slashing bun </connor>
<connor> which is what we wanted to go to last </connor>
<joey> year as well yes but unfortunately we </joey>
<joey> couldn't get approved one time yeah this </joey>
<joey> year since we knew we planned ahead yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah okay a huge huge shout out to uh </joey>
<joey> geeks plus for actually sorting this out </joey>
<garnt> like last year last year uh melin sorted </garnt>
<garnt> it out in like five days or something </garnt>
<garnt> before we were going to film this time </garnt>
<garnt> we had they had a bit more time but </garnt>
<garnt> everything went smoothly </garnt>
<joey> like like three weeks or something this </joey>
<garnt> time yeah we learned a lesson and like </garnt>
<garnt> most of the stores a lot of stores we </garnt>
<garnt> went to we got to like have free reign </garnt>
<garnt> over them without our customers which </garnt>
<garnt> was fun as [ __ ] yeah that shimbom was </garnt>
<garnt> great especially because we got to go in </garnt>
<joey> before the store even opened so yeah so </joey>
<joey> move whole floors to ourselves just like </joey>
<joey> going to legoland without anyone there </joey>
<connor> yeah like [ __ ] like awesome </connor>
<joey> younger means dream yeah honestly </joey>
<joey> and you've you've lived out the dream </joey>
<garnt> this is this is actually an actual dream </garnt>
<garnt> right like this is the [ __ ] you wake up </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid being like i have infinite </garnt>
<connor> budget to spend in this store and i can </connor>
<connor> buy anything </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> and you have to buy a figure that we </connor>
<garnt> chose for you one of the stores gone </garnt>
<joey> it's great yeah yeah brilliant so do you </joey>
<joey> guys remember what your challenges were </joey>
<joey> for this store so yeah i've got two </joey>
<joey> challenges for this one i remember i got </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] immediately um so so we actually </joey>
<joey> actually knew what challenges were in </joey>
<connor> trash taste good do we have trash taste </connor>
<connor> good is is he weird </connor>
<connor> sorry i kept calling him </connor>
<connor> trashbox trash boxing so we actually </connor>
<connor> knew the challenges this time because we </connor>
<connor> didn't know them last time and we picked </connor>
<joey> some easy challenges and some harder </joey>
<joey> challenges uh that would be harder to </joey>
<joey> complete you just killed trashbox yeah </joey>
<joey> my god hillside </joey>
<joey> and uh i started off with some of the </joey>
<joey> hardest challenges what were your </joey>
<joey> challenges got my challenge was one </joey>
<joey> find an anime figure or find a figure </joey>
<garnt> from a game that conor has played now i </garnt>
<garnt> play a lot of games </garnt>
<garnt> now now normally this would be easy but </garnt>
<garnt> we're talking about akihabara yeah </garnt>
<garnt> famous for selling anime figures and </garnt>
<garnt> maybe jrpg figures you know um a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> japanese ips </garnt>
<joey> uh it was basically games that connor is </joey>
<connor> not so well in every store there was </connor>
<garnt> multiple games that i had played so if </garnt>
<garnt> you've got this in any store you've been </garnt>
<connor> fine yeah yeah yeah did you pay </connor>
<connor> attention no there was a lot of time </connor>
<connor> that was just a big one there was a lot </connor>
<garnt> of turn-based rpgs a lot of story-based </garnt>
<connor> games yeah i went through </connor>
<garnt> um and then my second chance challenge </garnt>
<joey> was find the most expensive figure in </joey>
<joey> the store and uh buy it oh yeah that's </joey>
<joey> right if these boys found a more </joey>
<joey> expensive figure </joey>
<joey> then you don't get the point then i </joey>
<connor> don't get the points easy that's right </connor>
<connor> and what are your two challenges joey my </connor>
<joey> two challenges were fairly easy so my </joey>
<joey> first one was buy a jojo figure and make </joey>
<garnt> the same pose and i mean you know </garnt>
<joey> georgia figures it everywhere especially </joey>
<garnt> so that wasn't easy given the second one </garnt>
<garnt> i had to kind of uh you know use my </garnt>
<garnt> thinking cap a little bit it was i had </garnt>
<garnt> to buy a figure that can beat goku </garnt>
<garnt> and i have to not only buy the figure </garnt>
<garnt> but i have to convince these two boys </garnt>
<connor> that this character can beat you and the </connor>
<connor> audience you've got to talk </connor>
<connor> i think i figured it out though i think </connor>
<joey> i figured it out i won't be easily </joey>
<joey> impressed in fact i might even be </joey>
<joey> argumentative about it wow it's almost </joey>
<joey> like i'm on trash </joey>
<joey> my two challenges were buy a not anime </joey>
<joey> figure yeah which is very difficult </joey>
<joey> which is tough in </joey>
<joey> uh yeah it was uh because a lot of the </joey>
<garnt> games either had anime or animations and </garnt>
<garnt> i knew that you guys would be [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and that if i bought something that if </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't anime but had some animation </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you would give me [ __ ] right um and </garnt>
<garnt> there were shows that i thought didn't </garnt>
<garnt> have animes that apparently are getting </garnt>
<garnt> animes and i thought geez [ __ ] um </garnt>
<joey> and the other one was uh just pick a </joey>
<connor> figure blindfolded </connor>
<joey> oh wow okay so i just span around in one </joey>
<joey> section so that one's not tough it's </joey>
<joey> just it could end up very badly it </joey>
<connor> didn't end up great okay </connor>
<connor> it didn't </connor>
<garnt> we'll see okay we'll see then okay all </garnt>
<garnt> right so wait how many figures did you </garnt>
<connor> guys buy in lashing bun </connor>
<connor> three </connor>
<garnt> three three all right same here three </garnt>
<garnt> okay we started things off like for me </garnt>
<garnt> lashing man had so many good figures </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right it had a lot of high quality </garnt>
<garnt> figures and aside from mandarake it </garnt>
<garnt> actually had the most expensive figures </garnt>
<garnt> that i could find yeah it did yeah which </garnt>
<connor> uh [ __ ] me over obviously </connor>
<connor> well on that note then go on what is the </connor>
<garnt> what is the most expensive figure </garnt>
<garnt> okay we'll go we'll go for that last oh </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> okay so we don't know any of the figures </connor>
<joey> that each other bought i got glimpses of </joey>
<joey> one or two but i overall i don't know </joey>
<joey> what you guys purchased and i hope that </joey>
<connor> you guys don't know what i bought not </connor>
<joey> gonna lie because russian was so early </joey>
<connor> in the morning and i was still like in </connor>
<joey> the waking up process i remember half </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] i bought it rushing </connor>
<garnt> well i only bought three so it's really </garnt>
<garnt> easy for me at lashing bun like i spent </garnt>
<garnt> all of my time trying to complete my </garnt>
<garnt> challenges right so i like i didn't even </garnt>
<garnt> consider the overall challenges i even </garnt>
<garnt> forgot that we had overall challenges </garnt>
<garnt> because i was just trying to like i used </garnt>
<garnt> up all of my time completing every like </garnt>
<garnt> my all my challenges because i remember </garnt>
<garnt> the store was like opening up the </garnt>
<garnt> general public and i was like rushing to </garnt>
<garnt> get my figures onto like are you rushing </garnt>
<garnt> man </garnt>
<garnt> okay that's not funny </garnt>
<garnt> maybe million laughs though </garnt>
<garnt> of course melin would laugh </garnt>
<garnt> all right well yeah i remember joey like </garnt>
<garnt> looking at me and he's like oh you </garnt>
<garnt> haven't got your figures yet and i'm </garnt>
<joey> just like no i completed my challenges </joey>
<connor> in like 10 minutes yeah yeah mama pretty </connor>
<garnt> easy and the rest of the 50 minutes i </garnt>
<joey> was just perusing because because both </joey>
<joey> of them had me looking around a lot so </joey>
<garnt> the second challenge which i did second </garnt>
<garnt> um which was after perusing around to </garnt>
<garnt> try and find the most expensive figure </garnt>
<garnt> was trying to find a figure from a game </garnt>
<connor> that conor has played well why don't you </connor>
<connor> tell the story while introducing the </connor>
<joey> figure yeah okay well which one do you </joey>
<joey> think it is okay well i'll tell the </joey>
<garnt> story because the figure is not actually </garnt>
<garnt> that big right because because i had the </garnt>
<garnt> most expensive figure challenge i tried </garnt>
<garnt> to go on a budget at this point because </garnt>
<connor> it was the beginning of the day and so i </connor>
<connor> look around i look around at what </connor>
<connor> figures are available with dashing band </connor>
<connor> i look around there's final fantasy no </connor>
<garnt> connor's definitely not played final </garnt>
<connor> fantasy </connor>
<garnt> is it is it really it doesn't have you </garnt>
<garnt> played final fantasy vii no you haven't </garnt>
<connor> you haven't i don't know i haven't </connor>
<connor> finished it </connor>
<joey> i'm sorry i wouldn't count that </joey>
<joey> when wait the remake no the original </joey>
<joey> what you've played the original final </joey>
<garnt> fantasy vii i got like 10 hours in and i </garnt>
<connor> quit </connor>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<connor> what </connor>
<joey> years ago </joey>
<garnt> i actually don't believe you how have </garnt>
<connor> you never mentioned this before because </connor>
<connor> i didn't finish it </connor>
<joey> well you've played it yeah i've played </joey>
<joey> it you know the basic concept of it yeah </joey>
<connor> why have we never talked about this </connor>
<garnt> because i didn't really like it that </garnt>
<garnt> much </garnt>
<connor> wait so you've owned the ps1 no no it's </connor>
<garnt> on steam </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so you've played it in your adult </garnt>
<connor> life uh yeah when i was like 18. </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> it used to go on like steam sales all </connor>
<connor> the time </connor>
<garnt> oh my god wow that was literally the </garnt>
<garnt> first figure i stole and i i know that </garnt>
<connor> was the first figure right </connor>
<garnt> if you bought that i didn't i didn't </garnt>
<connor> beat it i didn't mean it i didn't read </connor>
<joey> it but you played it yeah it doesn't say </joey>
<garnt> you needed something oh true </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so so like mostly i looked </garnt>
<connor> around on the second floor and i didn't </connor>
<connor> notice that there were arc night figures </connor>
<garnt> on the second floor until people were </garnt>
<connor> talking about it yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> because i saw archives yeah i had such </connor>
<garnt> little time that i spent so much time </garnt>
<garnt> trying to buy the most expensive figure </garnt>
<garnt> that i just like lost all my time so i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't see any arc like figures um and </garnt>
<garnt> then i went downstairs because all </garnt>
<connor> basically all of the second floor were </connor>
<connor> like expensive gaming figures which are </connor>
<connor> just like basically fate and final </connor>
<connor> fantasy which i didn't know that you </connor>
<connor> played all right so that would have </connor>
<connor> played fate </connor>
<connor> yeah i know i know i know you haven't </connor>
<connor> played fakes </connor>
<connor> um so i go downstairs and uh i don't </connor>
<connor> really see much it's again it's mostly </connor>
<connor> anime figures </connor>
<connor> um and then i see i see a shelf </connor>
<garnt> and it's all persona and i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> i was saying to myself </garnt>
<garnt> i've been trying to convince connor to </garnt>
<garnt> play persona for two [ __ ] years and </garnt>
<garnt> it has led up to this point and i was </garnt>
<garnt> pissed that connor if you were a good </garnt>
<garnt> friend you would have taken my </garnt>
<garnt> recommendation and started playing </garnt>
<connor> persona 5 but no one time i played </connor>
<connor> persona your house for like 15 minutes </connor>
<joey> does that count i don't know if that </joey>
<garnt> counts </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<connor> what happened was i was watching uh </connor>
<connor> sydney go around some uh like it looked </connor>
<garnt> like a digital maze or something mentos </garnt>
<connor> no no it's one of it was one of the uh </connor>
<joey> dungeons all the later dungeons </joey>
<connor> give me the control i'll do it the loss </connor>
<connor> and then i got lost too </connor>
<garnt> sorry it didn't really help wow yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> spent a good 20 minutes so technically i </garnt>
<garnt> have played this wow yeah i haven't </garnt>
<garnt> played it much but yeah okay so come on </garnt>
<garnt> come on but then the third one i saw was </garnt>
<garnt> a mega man one and i've connor's never </garnt>
<garnt> talked about mega man before right i </garnt>
<garnt> don't have you ever heard him talk about </garnt>
<joey> mega man i've talked about mega man on </joey>
<joey> the show and i don't think he was like </joey>
<garnt> he's never mentioned it but like but </garnt>
<garnt> like i saw mega man and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> mega man seems like a corner game you </garnt>
<joey> know it's it's it's like it's like i </joey>
<joey> could see connor playing mega man </joey>
<joey> there's a platformer it's a shooting </joey>
<joey> platformer yeah yeah yeah like you used </joey>
<joey> to speed run cuphead right yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah exactly but like but like i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> if like </garnt>
<garnt> did you own a nintendo i what what is </garnt>
<garnt> your game console history because like </garnt>
<garnt> that this made me question what your </garnt>
<garnt> game console history was because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like you haven't played final fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't own a ps1 i had a </garnt>
<connor> nintendo 64. i had a nintendo 64. my </connor>
<connor> parents took it away because they </connor>
<connor> thought games were evil yeah and i </connor>
<connor> managed to convince them to get me uh </connor>
<garnt> ps1 i broke then i got a ps2 and i got a </garnt>
<connor> gamecube and a wii </connor>
<joey> then an xbox and now pc most of the main </joey>
<joey> line consoles there yeah so i remember </joey>
<garnt> so i didn't think connor would be old </garnt>
<garnt> enough to have like a super nintendo or </garnt>
<garnt> nintendo and like where else you play </garnt>
<garnt> mega man apart from the old school </garnt>
<garnt> consoles right pretty much um so have </garnt>
<connor> you played mega man because i didn't get </connor>
<connor> it not like fully i've played it at like </connor>
<joey> you know like friend's house for like a </joey>
<joey> few right like no i've never like </joey>
<joey> committed to sit down and people yeah it </joey>
<connor> is a very </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> i'm an xbox kid and i'm like okay xbox </garnt>
<connor> like gamecube era i'll stretch it out </connor>
<connor> and say maybe he had a lot </connor>
<connor> of this figure man </connor>
<connor> and then and then sydney came in clutch </connor>
<connor> and was just like gone how can you </connor>
<connor> forget literally the most </connor>
<connor> successful franchise in the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> world </garnt>
<garnt> how can you forget the one that's </garnt>
<garnt> literally right in front of your face </garnt>
<garnt> literally the most successful franchise </garnt>
<garnt> in the world and it's a tiny figure </garnt>
<garnt> because it's a pikachu figure okay </garnt>
<garnt> 220 yen </garnt>
<joey> and i i got this not forgetting that </joey>
<joey> whoever gets the least expensive figure </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i might have just [ __ ] myself over by </joey>
<joey> uh earning a point and then losing a </joey>
<garnt> point uh otherwise i would have got </garnt>
<garnt> something more expensive maybe you </garnt>
<garnt> should uh keep track of that because </garnt>
<joey> that might very much be a contender yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's fine that's an okay thing he's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely i mean i mean i know you've </garnt>
<garnt> po i know you've played pokemon uh we've </garnt>
<garnt> talked about it several times and even </garnt>
<connor> if we hadn't talked about it i could </connor>
<connor> like you could you could bring this to </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> 90 of anime fans or just people in </connor>
<connor> general they probably would have played </connor>
<connor> pokemon yeah there's also cyberpunk </connor>
<connor> overwatch a bunch of other actual was </connor>
<garnt> that cyberpunk </garnt>
<connor> ones yeah was that one one on the first </connor>

<joey> is </joey>
<joey> eight thousand two hundred and fifty so </joey>
<joey> eighty two dollars yeah and this persona </joey>
<joey> one is two hundred 200 </joey>
<garnt> wow okay </garnt>
<garnt> two hundred dollars this is a really big </garnt>
<connor> box for what doesn't look like it should </connor>
<joey> be this big yeah right yeah well like </joey>
<garnt> this is the this is the persona 5 the </garnt>
<connor> animation persona one </connor>
<connor> technically an anime figure </connor>
<garnt> what's the difference between persona 5 </garnt>
<joey> the animation figures uh it's about the </joey>
<joey> main it's that the main character his </joey>
<garnt> name is </garnt>
<garnt> oh </garnt>

<connor> i'll </connor>
<garnt> yeah we want to keep the boxes </garnt>
<garnt> oh okay okay that's a clean joseph </garnt>
<garnt> that's clean as [ __ ] yeah right so was </garnt>
<joey> this the pose that you did outside oh my </joey>
<joey> god no no i did i did the standard </joey>
<garnt> joseph post oh okay yeah it just said do </garnt>
<joey> a jojo post off that do you hate your </joey>
<garnt> poses okay i i thought he said do the </garnt>
<garnt> same jojo pose and i'm just like i don't </garnt>

<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah okay is it on camera </garnt>

<joey> okay okay all right </joey>
<joey> we're being nice yeah i would just watch </joey>
<garnt> your back if i were you being nice </garnt>
<garnt> okay so this one's got like a full like </garnt>
<garnt> well [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> joseph she's very top-heavy </garnt>
<connor> he's kind of like rohan where like you </connor>
<connor> uh oh he's uh </connor>
<connor> let me have a look at this judge </connor>
<connor> everyone jerry sets up this persona one </connor>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<garnt> this is quite the nice figure i wonder </garnt>
<garnt> why it's okay the thing with jojo </garnt>
<garnt> figures is i've learned basically a jojo </garnt>
<connor> figure expert at this [ __ ] point um </connor>
<connor> jojo figures are weirdly expensive </connor>
<connor> sometimes </connor>
<connor> i've bought some so there's a certain </connor>
<connor> line of jojo figures that i don't think </connor>
<connor> are that impressive yeah they're </connor>
<connor> visually they're not that uh </connor>
<connor> appealing i'd say </connor>
<connor> and they're some of the most expensive </connor>
<connor> jojo figures as you'll see cause i </connor>
<connor> actually bought some of them myself yeah </connor>
<connor> um it's weird and i don't really get it </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> so i guess it's strange but this one </garnt>
<garnt> normally when they're like this they're </garnt>
<garnt> pretty good the ones that move for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason are like triple the price yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> if you got like the shittier version of </garnt>
<connor> this and it moved it'd be 200 </connor>
<garnt> he's just like hi i'm uh oh </garnt>
<connor> i'm generic main character </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> there we go there's someone around </joey>
<garnt> my brain isn't working </garnt>
<garnt> are we keeping all the figures bruh that </garnt>
<joey> costs 80 </joey>
<joey> he's so top-heavy he's he's built like a </joey>
<joey> brick [ __ ] out he's joseph's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] joe star dude </connor>
<connor> i gotta say he's holding glasses his </connor>
<connor> stand is very very big compared to the </connor>
<garnt> figure </garnt>
<garnt> like the the uh </garnt>
<garnt> the circumference of uh the stand is uh </garnt>
<garnt> very big </garnt>
<garnt> there we go </garnt>

<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um do you want a cheers in front of one </connor>
<connor> of my challenges or a generic video uh </connor>
<connor> which one do you want to do first </connor>
<connor> none of them none of them why they're </connor>
<connor> all pretty all right they're all pretty </connor>
<connor> all right okay i'll do the jojo one </connor>
<joey> first then all right </joey>
<joey> okay oh jelly nice but look at the price </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<garnt> it's two hundred dollars for joy </garnt>
<connor> why did you bring a 200 figure of jolene </connor>
<connor> i didn't want to spend much money in the </connor>
<connor> store and i wanted a figure and i needed </connor>
<connor> one that would put me over my bud over </connor>
<joey> the 500 minutes oh this is a sass as </joey>
<joey> well they're usually like rather </joey>
<joey> expensive so these are the ones yeah </joey>
<joey> super action uh statues that's the one </joey>
<connor> you can move these ones are always so </connor>
<connor> expensive and i don't think they look as </connor>
<joey> good as the others </joey>
<joey> oh and lie i think that jonathan one is </joey>
<joey> cooler than this jelly one yeah i mean i </joey>
<joey> can i can take it out but </joey>
<joey> it's just </joey>
<connor> and this is opened and it's two hundred </connor>
<garnt> dollars i don't know what this would be </garnt>
<joey> what makes them that like much price </joey>
<joey> it's the hype of part six the hyper part </joey>
<joey> six yeah i'm not entirely sure </joey>
<garnt> there were a lot of expensive jojo </garnt>
<connor> figures these are the expensive ones </connor>
<joey> like or that that figure line yes yeah </joey>
<joey> the sasses are very expensive the </joey>
<joey> movable figure lines for some reason are </joey>
<garnt> quite expensive jojo uh maybe a figure </garnt>
<garnt> expert </garnt>
<garnt> can tell me why out there i don't really </garnt>
<garnt> know maybe maybe it's more difficult to </garnt>
<connor> design figures that move it could be </connor>
<joey> yeah there's also a lot of like movable </joey>
<garnt> parts as well i think that's what it is </garnt>
<garnt> but like i feel like with removable </garnt>
<garnt> figures i feel like the static one </garnt>
<garnt> static ones actually generally i've </garnt>
<connor> always said this i prefer static i i do </connor>
<connor> too i i i don't want to think about </connor>
<joey> posing it i don't yeah i despise the </joey>
<connor> little pieces that you have with it that </connor>
<connor> you can't put anywhere where do i put </connor>
<joey> them i just i just with the essay this </joey>
<garnt> is i just don't like the the joints </garnt>
<garnt> having like </garnt>
<garnt> exposed and then you look like it looks </garnt>
<garnt> like an angel because like whatever pose </garnt>
<garnt> you have you put with the movable </garnt>
<garnt> figures it's never going to be as cool </garnt>
<garnt> as </garnt>
<garnt> one like this with like a static pose </garnt>
<connor> maybe this one's cool because jolene it </connor>
<joey> comes with like her extended hands </joey>
<joey> oh that's kind of cool </joey>
<joey> i haven't seen that before so perhaps </joey>
<garnt> this is quite a unique one because </garnt>
<garnt> there's like </garnt>
<garnt> she has extended fingers here </garnt>
<connor> but yeah i suppose two hundred dollars </connor>
<connor> though </connor>
<joey> god damn </joey>
<joey> that's that's a big span </joey>
<connor> it's the same as this yeah </connor>
<garnt> sorry i know like i remember i remember </garnt>
<connor> i thought like when i first walked into </connor>
<connor> the store when i was doing like my most </connor>
<garnt> expensive figure challenge i thought the </garnt>
<garnt> most expensive figures was going to </garnt>
<garnt> going to be around 200 </garnt>
<garnt> because that's what i could find at </garnt>
<joey> first um so knowing that that's 200 i </joey>
<joey> think uh yeah what's your most expensive </joey>
<garnt> figure </garnt>
<garnt> we'll get to that oh my god he's [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> teasing us of course of course true </connor>
<garnt> youtube needs a clickbait right </garnt>
<connor> so this is the second figure that i </connor>
<connor> bought uh so this is </connor>
<connor> this is from one of my favorite artists </connor>
<connor> yum </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so if you didn't know yamu did uh miru </garnt>
<garnt> tights and he has done the art for </garnt>
<garnt> another anime that's coming out this </garnt>
<garnt> season i believe which is uh gun buddy </garnt>
<garnt> probably shouldn't have that on the </garnt>
<connor> screen for too long oh [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah oh okay i </joey>
<garnt> okay well i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it as </garnt>
<garnt> static as possible so mudan has an easy </garnt>
<connor> time censoring this we get it it's it's </connor>
<connor> a it's a very hot figure um so let's </connor>
<garnt> let's </garnt>
<garnt> see this out so </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't actually know that uh his </garnt>
<garnt> characters had figures </garnt>
<joey> so when i saw this i've never seen that </joey>
<garnt> either actually yeah cause like i don't </garnt>
<garnt> do you count this as a hentai figure i </garnt>
<joey> don't really count this as a hentai i </joey>
<joey> mean yomo is a hentai artist if it's not </joey>
<connor> from an anime and it's inspired by like </connor>
<joey> a hentai artist but he has he has made </joey>
<joey> but he's made an anime mirror tights was </joey>
<joey> an anime it is his anime and i think his </joey>
<joey> ganbare doki chan yeah </joey>
<joey> i think that's the second one where it </joey>
<garnt> like focuses </garnt>
<garnt> on office girl workers yeah um and i </garnt>
<joey> think this is clearly has these uh </joey>
<garnt> fetishes just put straight i respect it </garnt>
<connor> what i'm saying is he has amazing art </connor>
<connor> stop cocking us show us the figure i'm </connor>
<connor> trying to okay this is uh this is going </connor>
<connor> to be the first of many lude figures uh </connor>
<connor> because because you had sydney yeah </connor>
<connor> unfortunately having sydney as a camera </connor>
<joey> woman um i'd i'd like i'd sometimes just </joey>
<joey> wander off and then i'd look behind me </joey>
<joey> and she just wasn't there and she'd just </joey>
<joey> be like filming this lewd figure and i'm </joey>
<joey> like sydney </joey>

<joey> oh yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah sorry </connor>
<connor> uh if you're on a patreon enjoy if </connor>
<connor> you're on youtube sorry that this is all </connor>
<connor> blurred but </connor>
<garnt> i'm wondering what this looks like on </garnt>
<garnt> youtube is it is it going to be blurred </garnt>
<joey> or is it just going to be the black box </joey>
<joey> it's a black box or is it going to be </joey>
<garnt> like the white glowy thing no it's not </garnt>
<joey> done choose carefully </joey>
<joey> is it the white bars </joey>
<connor> i'm taking this off now yeah that was </connor>
<joey> two hundred dollars oh my god you know </joey>
<garnt> so you've spent two two hundred dollars </garnt>
<garnt> for it's totally that two two hundred </garnt>
<connor> dollar figures yeah well i had to make </connor>
<connor> sure i </connor>
<garnt> reached the 500 minimum i mean was that </garnt>
<garnt> nothing you just wanted to buy out of </garnt>
<connor> like your own volition i was so focused </connor>
<connor> on the challenges because i had one that </connor>
<connor> i struggled with which we'll discuss </connor>
<joey> right next time afterwards money will </joey>
<joey> span iso </joey>
<connor> you can take you can take that one home </connor>
<connor> i'll take that one home [ __ ] yeah dude </connor>
<connor> all right gun what was your most </connor>
<connor> expensive figure that you purchased okay </connor>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> what was the most expensive figure that </garnt>
<joey> you guys i don't know you know what you </joey>
<joey> bring yours out and then if it happens </joey>
<joey> to be more than the one that we found </joey>
<garnt> then you get the point </garnt>
<garnt> okay well you know what </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to go out and say </garnt>
<joey> no no no no no no no no i know i didn't </joey>
<garnt> get the most expensive figure </garnt>
<joey> so what was the most expensive figure </joey>
<joey> do you think are you saying that uh the </joey>
<connor> amelia one was the most expensive one </connor>
<connor> that you found i thought it was that was </connor>
<garnt> seven hundred dollars that was seven </garnt>
<garnt> hundred dollars yeah is it nice i found </garnt>
<garnt> a more expensive one </garnt>
<connor> i actually took a photo of it just for </connor>
<connor> proof yeah in the meantime </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] gone </connor>
<joey> all right that's </joey>
<joey> gone that's not a figure where are we </joey>
<connor> gonna display that </connor>
<joey> you have to go through here </joey>
<joey> you have to go through here </joey>
<garnt> so obviously i had the most expensive </garnt>
<garnt> figure store and to tell the story of </garnt>
<garnt> this one as well so my first instinct </garnt>
<garnt> was of course to go to the hentai </garnt>
<garnt> section because you know sydney aside </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes the most expensive figures are </garnt>
<joey> the hentai ones they are they are pricey </joey>
<garnt> as we've said </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah as we've just established and </garnt>
<garnt> i saw some for like 150 dollars at first </garnt>
<garnt> i was like oh that's pretty expensive </garnt>
<garnt> 200 oh okay now now we'll get into the </garnt>
<garnt> territory 250 all right 300 okay </garnt>
<garnt> and then i went into the fate section </garnt>
<garnt> where dreams died because because of </garnt>
<joey> course i did where dreams are made where </joey>
<joey> dreams are made by lawrence </joey>
<joey> and holy [ __ ] i found so many good </joey>
<joey> figures and like some of them and like </joey>
<garnt> as you're about to see with this one </garnt>
<garnt> i've bought </garnt>
<garnt> like at which point do we not call it a </garnt>
<garnt> figure and does it become a statue you </garnt>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> bring it on out i mean i see it in the </joey>
<joey> corner of my eye but uh it's pretty fun </joey>
<connor> so oh my god </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] god where are we gonna put </connor>
<joey> that so i'm gonna kind of like </joey>
<joey> can you even see me anymore over here hi </joey>
<garnt> so i found a few fake figures i don't </garnt>
<connor> know if you can even see me right now i </connor>
<connor> can't hear you gone over the [ __ ] the </connor>
<garnt> monolith slab in front of you so i found </garnt>
<joey> this for </joey>
<garnt> 500 and something bucks 150 dollars 550 </garnt>
<garnt> dollars and i was just like there's no </garnt>
<connor> way </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna either take it off the table </connor>
<garnt> or open all right all right can uh can </garnt>
<garnt> can one of you guys open it </garnt>
<garnt> someone's gonna i'm gonna need help </garnt>
<connor> cracking that boy open it's literally </connor>
<garnt> like a fancy action board that's so cool </garnt>
<garnt> though oh that is pretty cool it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually like made of like felt yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay so i found that and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yes i have found the most expensive </garnt>
<garnt> figure in the store and it's a figure i </garnt>
<joey> want because </joey>
<joey> that that's not a figure because that </joey>
<joey> looks [ __ ] amazing that's a statue </joey>
<garnt> that looks [ __ ] amazing and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i want this yeah and then i turn the </garnt>
<garnt> corner and i see this amelia figure for </garnt>
<garnt> 700 </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] my life </garnt>
<garnt> i can't buy a 550 figure and a 730 </garnt>
<garnt> figure at once so i was like the reason </garnt>
<garnt> i almost ran out of time was because i </garnt>
<garnt> was just sitting there with both figures </garnt>
<garnt> next to each other being like </garnt>
<garnt> do i go for the win do i go for the </garnt>
<garnt> point or do i go for my heart </garnt>
<connor> and always the point </connor>
<connor> and i looked at the emilia figure and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like </connor>
<connor> i'm not gonna i'm not gonna make the </connor>
<garnt> same mistake as subaru i'm gonna go [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amelia i'm gonna go for the thing that's </garnt>
<garnt> right in front of me and i chose the </garnt>
<garnt> fate figure and you know what </garnt>
<garnt> i don't regret a damn thing that is </garnt>
<joey> actually the coolest thing i've ever </joey>
<joey> seen though but you also wouldn't have </joey>
<connor> got the point anyway if you went for the </connor>
<joey> image yeah because uh i found one you </joey>
<garnt> see i think you should have looked a </garnt>
<garnt> little harder in the hentai section okay </garnt>
<garnt> because i found this one and it's uh 935 </garnt>
<garnt> what is that what is it what can i have </garnt>
<garnt> a look at that </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh </garnt>
<garnt> from uh </garnt>
<garnt> which is actually a game i've played </garnt>
<connor> and uh it's it's just like a witch girl </connor>
<connor> that doesn't from this very 900 yeah but </connor>
<joey> it's from a very famous uh hentai game </joey>
<garnt> and it's yeah 935 </garnt>
<garnt> there's the photo </garnt>
<joey> so yeah uh instead i um you went for </joey>
<joey> your heart i went for my heart and i'm </joey>
<joey> just and i'm just like i respect that </joey>

<garnt> bro [ __ ] you </garnt>
<garnt> joey what is that </garnt>
<joey> so this is one of the few russian bun </joey>
<joey> figures that didn't come in a uh in a </joey>
<joey> box </joey>
<garnt> it just came by itself </garnt>
<garnt> joe you've just bought goku </garnt>
<garnt> i know i have not i've bought super </garnt>
<garnt> saiyan goku black actually you've bought </garnt>
<garnt> black goku </garnt>
<garnt> i bought super saiyan goku black because </garnt>
<garnt> canonically he does kill goku </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but so is half of the [ __ ] cast </garnt>
<joey> in dragon ball z so wouldn't you say </joey>
<joey> that half of the cast in dragon ball z </joey>
<garnt> can beat goku </garnt>
<garnt> no he technically looks like he </garnt>
<joey> literally fought goku and killed him </joey>
<garnt> that it means that he beat goku goku is </garnt>
<joey> fighting goku yeah so drac welcome to </joey>
<garnt> dragon ball super buddy </garnt>
<garnt> so without have having watched dragon </garnt>
<garnt> ball super i know they go to like </garnt>
<garnt> multiple universes </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm gonna guess that uh this comes </garnt>
<garnt> from </garnt>
<garnt> one of the multiple universes that's </garnt>
<joey> right but the thing is right super </joey>
<connor> saiyan black goku goes to the other </connor>
<connor> universe yourself can beat yourself it's </connor>
<joey> not this is super saiyan black that's </joey>
<joey> goku right no it's super saiyan black oh </joey>
<garnt> shoot he's </garnt>
<joey> wait what's the line again don't shoot </joey>
<joey> he isn't black oh yeah that's it </joey>
<connor> but he is i don't know if you should get </connor>
<garnt> a character that can beat goku he's </garnt>
<joey> literally a character that kills goku is </joey>
<garnt> that not a character that can beat goku </garnt>
<garnt> so would you say that majin buu is a </garnt>
<joey> character that can beat goku yeah </joey>
<joey> because he literally kills goku yeah but </joey>
<garnt> goku comes back and then beats margaret </garnt>
<joey> have you maybe considered that goku </joey>
<joey> maybe isn't all that strong </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> the mother joe joe </garnt>
<garnt> what are you saying you can't say that </garnt>
<joey> the [ __ ] dies like six times i </joey>
<joey> don't think a guy who dies six times in </joey>
<joey> his own show is </joey>
<connor> considered strong so much and coming </connor>
<garnt> back how does that ask toriyama okay </garnt>
<joey> okay but can he beat goku now in the </joey>
<joey> latest episode of dragon ball super </joey>
<garnt> right because otherwise otherwise half </garnt>
<garnt> of the characters in anime can be like </garnt>
<garnt> child goku when he was a kid you know </garnt>
<garnt> just because someone can beat him you </garnt>
<joey> are at some point </joey>
<joey> should have been more specific with the </joey>
<garnt> challenges in that case </garnt>
<garnt> what do you think about this connor what </garnt>
<joey> do you think about this i literally </joey>
<joey> searched up characters that have killed </joey>
<joey> goku and he was the first one that came </joey>
<joey> up and i literally saw perfectly the </joey>
<joey> exact same form as well of when he this </joey>
<joey> is the hand that took goku's life right </joey>
<connor> here i think it's [ __ ] but it's alright </connor>
<connor> you can have the [ __ ] point thank you </connor>
<joey> all right thank you i don't know </joey>
<joey> honestly my kindness dude if this wasn't </joey>
<joey> gonna pass i was about to [ __ ] quit </joey>
<garnt> wait did was that the only thing you can </garnt>
<garnt> think of was there like no other there </garnt>
<joey> were possibilities see the problem is </joey>
<joey> all the other characters that can all </joey>
<garnt> the other characters in dragon ball that </garnt>
<garnt> have killed goku canonically just don't </garnt>
<joey> exist honestly </joey>
<joey> it's all dragon ball super characters </joey>
<garnt> right now i thought you were going to </garnt>
<garnt> pick like a jojo character like if if </garnt>
<garnt> you would pick like like who like um </garnt>
<garnt> like gold experience requiem or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that then i'd be like you </garnt>
<garnt> know what </garnt>
<joey> you know what there's a dragon ball fan </joey>
<connor> out there that has an argument against </connor>
<connor> that rohan rohan could be </connor>
<joey> no no see like see that all of that is </joey>
<connor> see all of that is your own opinion </connor>
<connor> because you guys love jojo more than </connor>
<connor> dragon ball super this is this is </connor>
<joey> canonical facts </joey>
<garnt> all right dragon ball </garnt>
<garnt> fans what what do you think you have the </garnt>
<garnt> final say we're gonna give him the point </garnt>
<garnt> now but uh you have the final say in the </garnt>

<joey> dragon ball bring bring bring on the </joey>
<joey> bring back monolith holy crap oh </joey>

<garnt> god </garnt>

<garnt> story go on it was to buy a non-anime </garnt>
<garnt> figure okay and i'm surprisingly very </garnt>
<garnt> difficult because i thought okay well if </garnt>
<garnt> i bought something like overwatch you'd </garnt>
<garnt> be like oh no </garnt>
<garnt> there's overwatch animations it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> count yeah you know there's all this </garnt>
<garnt> nonsense and [ __ ] that you guys would be </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] mean about and then i found the </garnt>
<garnt> terminator figure and i thought oh </garnt>
<garnt> that'd be great turns out there's a </garnt>
<joey> terminator terminated </joey>
<garnt> yeah coming out or something i don't </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] know everything i found had an </garnt>
<garnt> anime found some star wars figures i was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh fantastic there's a star wars </garnt>
<connor> truly </connor>
<connor> the best figure i've ever purchased that </connor>

<garnt> an </garnt>
<connor> check this [ __ ] out </connor>
<garnt> what </garnt>

<garnt> know they sold this why do they sell </garnt>
<joey> gellard grindelwald who is that that </joey>
<connor> doesn't sound like a real character it's </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> it's johnny deck </connor>
<garnt> johnny depp </garnt>
<garnt> that's meant to be johnny depp oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> sake 200 200 the only thing i could find </connor>
<connor> and after i purchased it in the video i </connor>
<connor> found a figure that would have met the </connor>
<connor> criteria for like one dollar or was it i </connor>
<connor> covered what it was it was something i </connor>
<connor> was pissed off i buried it in my mind </connor>
<connor> why is this [ __ ] [ __ ] this movie </connor>
<connor> sucked </connor>
<garnt> i haven't even seen fantastic i haven't </garnt>
<connor> even seen it yeah yeah [ __ ] it's me why </connor>
<connor> is this like [ __ ] oh it looks [ __ ] </connor>

<connor> yourself no no no no </connor>
<garnt> you should </garnt>
<joey> of course you want grindelwald on the </joey>
<garnt> set who wouldn't want grindelwald uh uh </garnt>

<joey> hello he looks like he's mid </joey>
<joey> transformation into edward scissors </joey>
<garnt> hands what so can someone explain </garnt>
<garnt> fantastic beasts to me it's it's it's a </garnt>
<joey> spin-off of the harry potter series </joey>
<joey> right i'm pretty sure yeah it's set in </joey>
<joey> the same universe but it doesn't mention </joey>
<joey> hogwarts or any of its characters </joey>
<joey> it's the time before oh sorry well you </joey>
<joey> know i haven't seen it i enjoyed the </joey>
<garnt> first movie a lot no yeah i was excited </garnt>
<connor> for the second movie did you like gerald </connor>
<connor> grindelwald or whatever that was [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> she </connor>
<connor> and the second movie was [ __ ] it was so </connor>
<joey> bad and i was really annoyed because i </joey>
<joey> really liked the first one yeah and i'm </joey>
<joey> pissed is he only in the second one </joey>
<joey> uh he appears like a little bit in the </joey>
<connor> first round but like like so what's the </connor>
<connor> plot of fantastic beasts oh [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> it's complicated is it yeah </connor>
<garnt> i've never known what has got to do with </garnt>
<garnt> harry potter this is the main bad guy </garnt>
<connor> it's just in the same universe </connor>
<garnt> that's it yeah yeah it's in the same </garnt>
<joey> universe as it's written by jk yeah okay </joey>
<connor> okay i could see oh wow his joints move </connor>
<joey> oh you can make him you can make him </joey>
<joey> walk and get on his knees </joey>
<joey> you know connor at least it's not a </joey>
<joey> funko pop yeah exactly you don't lose a </joey>
<joey> point two hundred dollars </joey>
<joey> what's this </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> you spent </connor>
<connor> like 4200 </connor>
<connor> i think johnny depp is buying that i </connor>
<connor> kept them in business </connor>
<garnt> what i want to know is yeah who who is </garnt>
<garnt> buying fantastic beasts figures out of </garnt>
<connor> here i'm sure there are like harry </connor>
<joey> potter otaku's out there right yeah </joey>
<joey> definitely get this out of my mind </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> don't say dumbledore but i did my i did </joey>
<garnt> my challenge he is in the he is in the </garnt>
<garnt> movies yeah yeah and yeah that was uh </garnt>
<joey> everything i bought in lashing yeah same </joey>
<connor> so how many did you buy three i bought </connor>
<connor> three i'm sure you spend gamers three as </connor>
<joey> well i spent five hundred and seventy </joey>
<connor> eight dollars in dashimbon wow </connor>
<connor> 500 </connor>
<garnt> 8 000 no 589 </garnt>
<joey> i spent </joey>
<connor> 572 dollars wow we were all really close </connor>
<connor> holy crap wait no this is a stop oh </connor>
<connor> never mind </connor>
<connor> am i bad </connor>
<garnt> looks like i just spoiled myself last </garnt>
<garnt> time uh i spent 674 </garnt>
<connor> dollars all right the next store is a </connor>
<connor> stop and uh this is the one that we went </connor>
<connor> to last time and it was a fan favorite </connor>
<connor> dare i say because it's quite visually </connor>
<connor> appealing yeah it's really cool really </connor>
<connor> interesting store </connor>
<connor> tons of figures and you really do have </connor>
<connor> to look yeah so i hope you guys spent a </connor>
<connor> lot of money or bought a lot of figures </connor>
<garnt> i know i bought quite a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i think i bought like in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> pure number um </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's either a stop or army army </garnt>
<joey> i bought the most figures i </joey>
<joey> actually didn't buy a lot oh really okay </joey>
<joey> so first of all what were your </joey>
<joey> challenges okay so my two challenges </joey>
<garnt> were </garnt>
<garnt> uh mine was one to buy a female figure </garnt>
<garnt> and two to bide a lewd figure which is </garnt>
<garnt> great pretty easy so i could get two </garnt>
<garnt> figures in one and i guess i'll start </garnt>
<garnt> off </garnt>
<garnt> shop </garnt>
<garnt> my figure first i believe this is it </garnt>
<connor> um so i i actually like this was this </connor>
<connor> was the first time that i actually tried </connor>
<connor> to be tactical about what i bought um </connor>
<connor> for once in your life yeah in lashing </connor>
<joey> once again you know we had riaz like </joey>
<joey> last year and this time we actually came </joey>
<joey> in for the clutch yeah this time we had </joey>
<joey> the fake figure where you know what it </joey>
<joey> didn't matter i it didn't matter about </joey>
<joey> the game i just followed my heart </joey>
<joey> all right so </joey>
<garnt> this was the lude figure that i bought </garnt>
<garnt> um so mudan gets ready to censor this uh </garnt>
<garnt> because i'm not sure i can't remember </garnt>
<garnt> how lude it is i don't think it's hentai </garnt>
<garnt> level loot </garnt>
<garnt> uh but it is definitely lewds </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> oh and it is that girl </garnt>
<garnt> from </garnt>
<joey> i can't remember she's just gone i think </joey>
<joey> oh it's from um </joey>
<joey> no no no it's a </joey>
<joey> boring girlfriend uh what's oh cycano </joey>
<joey> psychonauts yeah that's the one uh so </joey>
<joey> yeah it's that girl from cycling yeah do </joey>
<joey> you want me to point this towards the </joey>
<garnt> camera uh the reason the reason there's </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of panty the reason </garnt>
<connor> there is there's a lot of a lot of panty </connor>
<garnt> and from one angle it's safe </garnt>
<garnt> and i mean she's uh she's not putting on </garnt>
<garnt> thigh highs but uh she is putting on her </garnt>
<garnt> socks right and so the reason i bought </garnt>
<garnt> this one was because it was a female </garnt>
<joey> figure </joey>
<joey> it was </joey>
<joey> a lewd figure and </joey>
<joey> it was very very close to 420. i'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna reveal how much this was okay okay </joey>
<joey> just because i know youtube bought some </joey>
<joey> other ones but uh yeah well we'll reveal </joey>
<joey> those at the end but i will say it is </joey>
<garnt> close to 420. oh okay so that's that's </garnt>
<connor> around 520 for that </connor>
<connor> yeah what what did go into the mahogany </connor>
<joey> wood what's going on here i mean kind of </joey>
<joey> stuff is pretty expensive cyclone itself </joey>
<garnt> is pretty expensive and i'm not sure why </garnt>
<garnt> like i feel like it's just i i was </garnt>
<garnt> surprised that this one cost this much </garnt>
<joey> right it's just like weirdly popular in </joey>
<joey> japan for some reason i don't know why </joey>
<garnt> but like i i decided to i have no idea </garnt>
<connor> why yeah i decided to go for it because </connor>
<garnt> i couldn't like looking back i couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> find many figures that were close to the </garnt>
<garnt> 420 mark yeah so i like i saw this one i </garnt>
<garnt> was like this one's close-ish so let's </garnt>
<joey> just go for this one and see where it </joey>
<garnt> takes right right all right </garnt>
<garnt> joey watch which okay </garnt>
<garnt> my ones were uh the first one was get a </garnt>
<garnt> fist of the north star figure </garnt>
<garnt> which was perfect because this is all </garnt>
<joey> styles like one of my favorite manga </joey>
<garnt> series of all time you were so lucky to </garnt>
<garnt> get this one in um a stop because you </garnt>
<joey> would have any other star would have </joey>
<garnt> been [ __ ] if you're like it's maybe </garnt>
<joey> like a stop and maybe mandarakey </joey>
<joey> and uh </joey>
<joey> no way we chose this one because we know </joey>
<joey> we knew it could be completed if like </joey>
<garnt> the right circumstances were exactly but </garnt>
<garnt> like because it's such an old series </garnt>
<garnt> it's rare to find yeah any figures it's </garnt>
<joey> just rare in general to find anything </joey>
<garnt> fistful of the north star related yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but i got one you asked did you </garnt>
<garnt> actually hell yeah i did god [ __ ] it not </garnt>
<garnt> only that i i got a twofer ladies and </garnt>
<connor> gentlemen i got a two for one two for </connor>
<connor> one i got two for one i not only got my </connor>
<joey> boy kenshiro but i also got </joey>
<connor> da or as well as a combo set look at </connor>
<connor> that oh my god how much were they </connor>
<joey> these yeah these were uh if i remember </joey>
<joey> correctly it wasn't actually that </joey>
<joey> expensive this one </joey>
<connor> uh these were i think </connor>
<connor> 148 dollars oh together together </connor>
<joey> yeah it's actually not bad at all </joey>
<joey> actually i think no no no no i think </joey>
<joey> this was actually the cheapest one i </joey>
<connor> think this was 25 dollars </connor>
<connor> that's pretty cool yeah for for a two i </connor>
<garnt> mean you know these are like kind of i </garnt>
<garnt> mean they weren't in box for one yeah </garnt>
<connor> but it was a two for one so you you </connor>
<garnt> line it up like that that's pretty sick </garnt>
<garnt> hell yeah boys the boys are back in town </garnt>
<connor> let's go </connor>
<connor> i'll just show one off that i go yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah go for it oh my gosh </garnt>
<connor> pretty cool </connor>
<garnt> looking mm-hmm </garnt>
<garnt> jotaro figure oh nice oh okay from like </garnt>
<connor> the 90s ova oh yeah oh </connor>
<joey> i've never really seen i love the dangly </joey>
<garnt> bits actually yeah i've never seen it in </garnt>
<garnt> the 60s </garnt>
<garnt> i wanted more on the set and i thought </garnt>
<garnt> this is really [ __ ] cool because it </garnt>
<joey> must have been modeled after the old 90s </joey>
<garnt> because like jojo doesn't use a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> scarf thing in the </connor>
<garnt> in the new one no i'm so glad i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> get any jojo figures because otherwise </garnt>
<garnt> i'd be losing points left and right </garnt>
<joey> right now i'm glad you didn't get joseph </joey>
<connor> but also why does he look more like </connor>
<garnt> lupin </garnt>
<joey> oh a little bit a little bit yeah yeah i </joey>
<garnt> mean i just think it was sick i think it </garnt>
<connor> was um not that much as well remember </connor>
<joey> correctly the problem with a stop is </joey>
<connor> that you can't actually see which ones </connor>
<connor> they were that's right yeah so i have to </connor>
<joey> remember we don't know how much you want </joey>
<joey> yeah i have to remember it </joey>
<connor> i remember this one was quite cheap it </connor>
<connor> was like 2 000 4000 no more than that </connor>
<connor> like okay yeah pretty good uh what else </connor>
<garnt> do i've got yeah so after i got uh after </garnt>
<garnt> i've completed as many challenges as i </garnt>
<garnt> could i basically just you know oh this </garnt>
<connor> also completes one of my challenges but </connor>
<joey> many of my figures which is get a </joey>
<connor> character from a shirt and protect oh </connor>
<joey> easy </joey>
<garnt> i did what any guy would do and just </garnt>
<garnt> start collecting waifus um </garnt>
<joey> so very admirable i respect that i got </joey>
<joey> echidna from uh zero season two </joey>
<garnt> i got her school uniform one which is uh </garnt>
<garnt> why why because the kid is great this is </garnt>
<connor> cute </connor>
<connor> oh dude she's so cute what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bro come on um of course i got a chisel </connor>
<garnt> figure so i couldn't actually find many </garnt>
<connor> cheese </connor>
<connor> i couldn't actually find many </connor>
<connor> cheeseburgers </connor>
<connor> does this count as a funko pop </connor>
<joey> i just i just wanted to buy one rent a </joey>
<joey> girlfriend figure because i couldn't </joey>
<joey> actually find many and uh i couldn't </joey>
<joey> find any reason yeah i couldn't find </joey>
<joey> many of chizuru so i don't know if there </joey>
<joey> was like if not enough had been made uh </joey>
<joey> these were pretty cheap they were about </joey>
<joey> in the ten dollar range yeah i could </joey>
<joey> tell yeah </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<connor> and i mean you know you know i just uh i </connor>
<connor> just wanted to pump pump the figure </connor>
<garnt> numbers up with uh some girls that </garnt>
<garnt> hadn't been on the uh shelf yet </garnt>
<joey> okay i bought uh two other ones that </joey>
<joey> weren't a challenge so the first one i </joey>
<garnt> got was </garnt>
<joey> mitsuha from kimono noah ah okay [ __ ] i </joey>
<joey> didn't see that one yeah and because one </joey>
<joey> of the challenges is get a figure that </joey>
<joey> is from an anime movie original yeah so </joey>
<joey> that's one point for me this was </joey>
<joey> actually the most expensive this was </joey>
<connor> 258. was that wait was it get the most </connor>
<joey> anime figures from the movie original </joey>
<joey> was it no no just one i think oh i </joey>
<garnt> thought we had that challenge </garnt>
<joey> was it the </joey>
<garnt> you should double check i'm pretty sure </garnt>
<connor> get the most and i think there's one </connor>
<connor> from an anime original movie oh wait it </connor>
<joey> was get one yeah </joey>
<connor> those two movie challenges right </connor>

<garnt> from the 90s yeah that's what i went for </garnt>
<connor> exactly yeah yeah you don't often see </connor>
<connor> the older ova figures but i feel i feel </connor>
<connor> like they've got a nicer build quality </connor>
<garnt> in some ways mm-hmm </garnt>
<garnt> this is cause it's because like it was </garnt>
<joey> like jojo wasn't mainstream when the 90s </joey>
<joey> ova came out yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> no no it's so big i just couldn't help </connor>
<joey> myself </joey>

<garnt> figure it's like somebody like somebody </garnt>
<joey> in the factory was like all right we've </joey>
<joey> got the model down perfect uh now we </joey>
<joey> just gotta apply pain and they're like </joey>
<garnt> uh it's going out </garnt>

<garnt> hunter and i just when i saw it and i </garnt>
<connor> knew i had the spare budget i couldn't </connor>
<joey> yeah i couldn't say no the only reason </joey>
<joey> why i didn't buy this last year is </joey>
<connor> because it was over our budget yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's so sick yeah i actually wish i </connor>
<garnt> brought it like fences </garnt>
<garnt> i actually wish i bought more in a stop </garnt>
<garnt> because there were like more cool </garnt>
<joey> figures that i wanted to buy but like i </joey>
<joey> didn't know how much i would be spending </joey>
<joey> in like the next ones yeah yeah um but </joey>
<joey> looking back um i wish i there were so </joey>
<garnt> many figures that i wish i had bought </garnt>
<garnt> there were like some black lagoon </garnt>
<connor> figures and some gaps </connor>
<connor> yeah the gowns figure i really wish i </connor>
<garnt> had bought yeah yeah the gangster was </garnt>
<garnt> cool actually so hot yeah but i mean i'm </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean like a stop's a cool store um </garnt>
<joey> so it's lashing band there were so many </joey>
<garnt> cool figures in lashes they're in the </garnt>
<joey> same building as well yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> careful this was 160 dollars </joey>
<garnt> it's pretty sturdy </garnt>
<connor> is that the most expensive figure oh no </connor>
<connor> this is the most this is the 300 yeah </connor>
<connor> this is </connor>
<connor> close to the 40s it's like the flimsiest </connor>
<garnt> plastic thing ever but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i imagine it's i imagine it's just that </garnt>
<connor> much because of how pretty rare it is </connor>
<joey> yeah i do i mean i've never seen that </joey>
<connor> before i've never seen that i don't know </connor>
<joey> where you even buy it or where you get </joey>
<garnt> it from i i it must have been available </garnt>
<garnt> quite a while probably a collective </garnt>
<connor> collector's item it's it's just the </connor>
<connor> coolest thing i've ever seen it's so </connor>
<garnt> ridiculous like isn't this amazing i </garnt>
<garnt> love it i love it so much </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this this has a different center of </garnt>
<garnt> gravity </garnt>
<joey> honestly it does </joey>
<joey> it's very top-heavy </joey>
<connor> a little bit make sure you kind of feel </connor>
<connor> like how dumb it would look in real life </connor>
<connor> if you sure gone when he was going super </connor>
<connor> saiyan all top </connor>
<joey> but yeah that was my uh this is my hall </joey>
<joey> at h you bought a lot of days yeah i </joey>
<connor> mean you mostly all of it was this oh </connor>
<joey> yeah mostly it was jojo figures yeah </joey>
<connor> mostly it's three dios and a gone yeah </connor>
<connor> so four jojo figures uh black baller </connor>
<connor> black butler and uh </connor>
<garnt> it's pretty good oh can it be black goku </garnt>
<connor> all of these can beat goku i think </connor>
<joey> that's still my favorite </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> that's your favorite when we have this </connor>
<joey> joey how dare you proud </joey>
<joey> the thing is i saw this one last year i </joey>
<joey> just can't believe this one's real </joey>
<joey> and it like unironically looks epic as </joey>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> i can't get </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> so we found a meme recently which is </connor>
<connor> just like um like ultrasound </connor>
<connor> goku with the caption could you repeat </connor>
<garnt> that and it's like you can see his dick </garnt>
<joey> just half chopped off it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> like the edge of his [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> on the screen is the funniest thing i've </joey>
<garnt> ever seen in my life all right was uh </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was a stop moving on i </garnt>
<garnt> need the toilet so before we move on to </garnt>
<garnt> amiami though um joey what was this </garnt>
<garnt> thing about this guy buying kirito </garnt>
<joey> figures that i've heard about </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah yeah so when i was lining </joey>
<joey> up at a stop there was a dude in front </joey>
<joey> of me it's in my video as well but there </joey>
<joey> was a dude in front of me in like a </joey>
<joey> full-on business so it was like a proper </joey>
<joey> japanese salary man and uh i overheard </joey>
<joey> and i thought i thought i doubted myself </joey>
<joey> for a second i overheard the words </joey>
<joey> kirito </joey>
<joey> and 600 thousand yen </joey>
<garnt> i thought </garnt>
<garnt> which is six thousand dollars six </garnt>
<garnt> thousand dollars </garnt>
<joey> and i was like </joey>
<garnt> excuse me </garnt>
<garnt> that that can't be right did you get a </garnt>
<garnt> glimpse i leaned in closer no i think he </garnt>
<garnt> ordered it in bulk at asoc because i </garnt>
<garnt> think there was just too many and then i </garnt>
<garnt> found out as i was you know he left and </garnt>
<garnt> as i was checking out and you know i </garnt>
<garnt> talked to the dude i was like so uh the </garnt>
<garnt> guy the guy before me </garnt>
<joey> what what did he buy if you don't mind </joey>
<garnt> me asking and he said oh he bought six </garnt>
<garnt> thousand dollars worth of kirito figures </garnt>
<connor> they do exist and i was like oh my god </connor>
<joey> they actually exist </joey>
<joey> these types of waves exist so he </joey>
<garnt> literally went into the store and said </garnt>
<joey> i'll take your entire team [ __ ] your </joey>
<joey> entire story </joey>
<garnt> kirito figures who's buying six thousand </garnt>
<joey> dollars worth of kirito for that dude he </joey>
<joey> was probably like in his maybe mid 30s </joey>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> just buying like i think he bought like </garnt>
<garnt> 13 or 14 kirito figures like so many </garnt>
<joey> that he didn't even like bother bringing </joey>
<garnt> them up he i think he just gave them the </garnt>
<joey> paper and said just send it to me </joey>
<garnt> oh my dropped his money and they just </garnt>
<garnt> left is this like an investment is is is </garnt>
<joey> he like is this </joey>
<joey> like a kirito </joey>
<connor> that's the only explanation i have for </connor>
<connor> this guy it was insane a big fan you </connor>
<connor> know i guess so all right boys what </connor>
<connor> challenges did you have at amiami so for </connor>
<joey> army army we have three challenges </joey>
<garnt> because uh we yeah we just want to make </garnt>
<connor> it a little spicy yeah yeah we thought </connor>
<garnt> that we could spend a lot of money there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and and we did we uh this was </garnt>
<garnt> probably going to be the longest segment </garnt>
<joey> yet because we bought a lot of figures </joey>
<joey> so my one were fairly varied my one was </joey>
<joey> get a figure that's american uh buy a </joey>
<joey> wall scroll and buy an incestuous series </joey>
<joey> and shout i love incest while holding it </joey>
<joey> uh now for the incestuous one i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> have to finish that here because i </joey>
<joey> didn't have enough time to actually grab </joey>
<joey> it and shout it because literally the </joey>
<garnt> moment i picked it up sounds really </garnt>
<joey> convenient to me but literally the </joey>
<joey> moment i picked it up the staff came </joey>
<joey> over and just took it out he's like this </joey>
<joey> one okay took it out of my hands i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> i can't even tell him i like incest yeah </garnt>

<connor> it's no one's fault but you should have </connor>
<joey> done it i'll be happy to take half a </joey>
<connor> point for this honestly because </connor>
<connor> i'd be lucky to get half a point on this </connor>
<connor> joke i'd like i'd like to at least get </connor>
<connor> half one because i did buy i did finish </connor>
<joey> half the challenge i did actually buy an </joey>
<joey> incestuous figure i just literally </joey>
<joey> didn't have the time to get you know say </joey>
<connor> the thing so if if we're nice to you </connor>

<joey> some point i have to be nice to you guys </joey>
<connor> what do you mean </connor>
<garnt> all right i got us back </garnt>

<joey> was like [ __ ] what else what else is </joey>
<joey> incest what else is incest i know i'll </joey>
<joey> ask the incest man right here so i ran </joey>
<joey> up to ghant i said bro </joey>

<joey> yours </joey>
<garnt> what's an incest shot </garnt>
<garnt> and i and i just gave him some uh </garnt>
<garnt> philosophical [ __ ] that i made up on </garnt>
<garnt> the spot yeah even though i've i saw </garnt>
<garnt> about 10 erimanga sensei figures along </garnt>
<garnt> the way why is there so many </garnt>
<joey> i don't know i don't know i don't know </joey>
<garnt> it's popular enough i guess but uh it's </garnt>
<connor> okay okay </connor>
<garnt> i guess replace this lemon style yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah but yeah there you go i found </joey>
<connor> myself a sagiri figure uh it's actually </connor>
<joey> not too bad to be honest with you i'm </joey>
<joey> not exactly a fan of uh erimanga sensei </joey>
<connor> but this is actually pretty solid i </connor>
<connor> think you'd have the fbi knocking if you </connor>
<joey> said you were well i mean gone should be </joey>
<joey> used to that by now </joey>
<garnt> uh this one was uh 211 dollars </garnt>
<garnt> 211 dollars for an air market </garnt>
<joey> yeah this i mean i don't know where i </joey>
<joey> didn't have like your eagle like incest </joey>
<joey> eagle vision so uh this is the only one </joey>
<joey> i could find </joey>
<joey> i'm okay not seeing the figure you know </joey>
<joey> i'm sure there's like a child's play mat </joey>
<connor> there what the [ __ ] is that yeah i'll </connor>
<connor> bring it out but i'll bring it out don't </connor>
<joey> worry </joey>
<joey> i think it's supposed to symbolize </joey>
<connor> sagiri's like bed right what happens in </connor>
<connor> this anime why is it children's style uh </connor>
<joey> because she is a hentai artist </joey>

<connor> should buy one you saw recently yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it's not like i've seen zero this </joey>
<connor> year unbelievably i know </connor>
<connor> luckily this wasn't too difficult as </connor>

<connor> had spoken about watching the evangelion </connor>
<connor> movie yeah so i bought i just bought </connor>
<connor> neva oh nice oh nice i know what you're </connor>
<connor> gonna say you're gonna be like oh it's </connor>
<connor> not the the right type from the right </connor>
<connor> because i know it has the movie on it </connor>
<garnt> but it isn't it isn't though no it isn't </garnt>
<garnt> it isn't </garnt>
<garnt> that's not that's not even close you had </garnt>
<garnt> so many ava options </garnt>
<joey> actually that's you know what it is </joey>
<connor> that's not even like canon evangelion </connor>
<connor> what's even going this is evangelion in </connor>
<connor> train form </connor>
<connor> it's even going what the [ __ ] actually </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah it's not even an eva it's an </joey>
<connor> ava collab with shinkaniong oh it's ava </connor>
<garnt> which [ __ ] did you buy </garnt>
<connor> you had so many choices of ava </connor>
<joey> have you bought a [ __ ] ava shinkansen </joey>
<garnt> what have you done </garnt>
<connor> what have you done connor </connor>
<connor> if it's a jojo collab with a t-shirt </connor>
<connor> it's still jojo you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> it's still evangelion what are you </connor>
<connor> obviously about to ask connor i should </connor>
<joey> get the point yeah that's uh that's </joey>
<joey> proper there you go you also bought an </joey>
<garnt> evangelion gun yeah so you both lose a </garnt>
<connor> point no no yes oh okay we don't we do </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> i got him i got a point and then lost it </joey>
<connor> yeah no you didn't even get a point you </connor>
<joey> lost it no i get it it's just even now </joey>
<joey> you don't even that is not you look if </joey>
<garnt> we're not going to count my recent anime </garnt>
<connor> well we're not counting </connor>
<connor> bro </connor>
<joey> that's the average that's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> shinx though this is a that's </joey>
<garnt> you literally could have picked so many </garnt>
<connor> evangelion figures you picked the one </connor>
<joey> that's a [ __ ] train either </joey>
<joey> none of uh either i get no point yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm happy i'm content with making god </connor>
<joey> lose a point </joey>
<joey> i will give you the point if you can if </joey>
<joey> you can say that i get the point for the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] uh humans on the eyeball no no </joey>
<connor> no because it's the exact same thing he </connor>
<joey> gave you the half a point for the year </joey>
<connor> no because the exact same vein no it's </connor>
<connor> not yes it is </connor>
<joey> i'm sorry i don't remember watching shin </joey>
<joey> cutty on in 2021 it wasn't about </joey>
<connor> watching shin kalyan it's about getting </connor>
<joey> old it is </joey>
<connor> figure series it literally says it on </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] box </garnt>
<garnt> i need to know connor why did you choose </garnt>
<garnt> that figure there was so many ava </garnt>
<joey> figures there because all of them look </joey>
<joey> so boring what about the bna one that </joey>
<connor> you said you were gonna buy </connor>
<connor> yeah i found out that because we </connor>
<joey> literally did a video this year on the </joey>
<connor> netflix yeah then i went to my calendar </connor>
<joey> and we actually filmed that in like </joey>
<connor> december oh really so god damn so gant </connor>
<connor> loses one point and i get nothing cause </connor>
<garnt> i lost the point i gained oh we both no </garnt>
<connor> no you both lose the point both lose the </connor>
<joey> point yeah and then i get the point for </joey>
<joey> now you don't get the point i only lose </joey>
<connor> the point if i get the point because </connor>
<connor> you'd have to admit that it's an eva for </connor>
<connor> me to lose the point to begin </connor>
<connor> with so what i'm saying is right if you </connor>
<joey> agree that means it's either you lose no </joey>
<joey> points or you lose two points no it's </joey>

<garnt> i don't think even infinity can uh take </garnt>
<joey> account of whatever the [ __ ] that is of </joey>

<joey> options to find a lot of character </joey>
<connor> plushies </connor>
<connor> um sorry and then like </connor>
<connor> for some reason </connor>
<connor> and then uh hidden right in the corner </connor>
<connor> joey and then right in the corner </connor>
<garnt> what's up </garnt>
<connor> i'm august </connor>
<garnt> yeah you both lose a point yay what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> what the you know what worth it for the </joey>
<garnt> among us you know you know although you </garnt>
<garnt> know though i didn't want to stop there </garnt>
<joey> because uh the plushie where you got </joey>
<joey> moromagus the plushie needed a friend </joey>
<joey> okay the plushie </joey>
<joey> okay look </joey>
<joey> look i i know the challenge was just to </joey>
<garnt> buy one character plushie yeah but i </garnt>
<garnt> felt like you know you can't play among </garnt>
<garnt> us with just one just one person okay </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> the character needs a friend okay </garnt>
<garnt> i got steve as well </garnt>
<joey> hell yeah let's </joey>
<joey> of minecraft go </joey>
<joey> boy steve </joey>
<joey> we're selling our own smash bros right </joey>
<garnt> here yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> well among us in smash when </garnt>
<garnt> that's practical </garnt>
<connor> yeah i couldn't not get this yeah this </connor>
<connor> was too perfect what is this so these </connor>
<garnt> are like buildable i guess like like </garnt>
<connor> lucky boxes for a mogus character yeah </connor>
<joey> it's among us it's a mongoose gacha </joey>
<garnt> can we get the boxes off the table </garnt>
<garnt> luckily none of these are the red the </garnt>
<joey> red amongst yeah </joey>
<garnt> so does it count is it the same </garnt>
<joey> character i don't know does it count </joey>
<connor> because none of them are red well let's </connor>
<joey> open them up and find out who is uh no </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> from the same series none of these are </connor>
<joey> red though </joey>
<joey> oh yeah he's from the same series yeah </joey>
<connor> but you've bought how many series from </connor>
<connor> jojo yeah yeah only one set of </connor>
<connor> duplicates </connor>
<garnt> yeah but that that was only one set </garnt>
<connor> right because it was yes so so you so </connor>
<connor> if i'm counting this is one yeah yeah so </connor>
<garnt> you guys you got the humongous guy </garnt>
<garnt> that's literally a character no no i got </garnt>
<connor> i got the red among them because they're </connor>
<connor> not they're not different they're all </connor>
<garnt> the same </garnt>
<connor> there's the white </connor>
<connor> one there's the purple the green the </connor>
<joey> black the white and the red glow in the </joey>
<joey> dark they're all the same characters </joey>
<connor> look look look they're just different </connor>
<garnt> costumes it's the same color when you're </garnt>
<garnt> voting for someone to get off right well </garnt>
<joey> dude it's the same it's a different </joey>
<joey> costume it's the same character yeah </joey>
<connor> we've already established we both lose a </connor>
<garnt> point and i get a point because it's ava </garnt>
<garnt> no no no no no we've established that we </garnt>
<garnt> both don't lose a point </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> he has not bought a red among us </garnt>
<connor> character you can see there you can see </connor>
<connor> on the [ __ ] box they are the same </connor>
<connor> characters when you vote someone after </connor>
<garnt> you go the among us character no you say </garnt>
<connor> reddit sas connor you don't go </connor>
<connor> among us </connor>
<garnt> you got reddit </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] purple </garnt>
<connor> what's their name it's red well it's a </connor>
<connor> crew mate it's red he's a crew it's a </connor>
<joey> red crewmate it's a red crew mate yeah </joey>
<connor> and that's a crew mate it's a red </connor>
<connor> crewmate they're both the same because </connor>
<joey> this is the green logic joey's probably </joey>
<joey> bought like 15 duplicates here no </joey>
<joey> because i'm counting this as one because </joey>
<joey> it came in one box </joey>
<joey> well if you open them all up how many </joey>
<joey> characters are there </joey>
<connor> five yeah so you have five duplicates no </connor>
<connor> because this is one all right well you </connor>
<connor> can either take the five minus points or </connor>
<garnt> you can take the one minus points here </garnt>
<garnt> that it </garnt>
<joey> i am going to argue this till the day i </joey>
<joey> die if there was a red among us </joey>
<joey> character i will happily take the l yeah </joey>
<joey> i agree if there was a red among his </joey>
<joey> character i'd be like joey yeah we got </joey>
<joey> the same </joey>
<connor> character because i literally </connor>
<connor> i literally tried like i literally like </connor>
<connor> predicted maybe one of these character </connor>
<connor> maybe one of these guys will buy an </connor>
<garnt> among us character right so i was like </garnt>
<garnt> so i was like which i actually had to </garnt>
<garnt> pick one that i thought the guys </garnt>
<joey> wouldn't actually buy so i picked red </joey>
<joey> yeah and luckily there's no real well it </joey>
<joey> sucks that you both got the crewmates so </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter anyway you both lost </joey>
<connor> the point in the end that's a red </connor>
<connor> crewmate and there isn't a point off of </connor>
<connor> them both </connor>
<connor> audience what do you think audience what </connor>
<garnt> most definitely going to say </garnt>
<connor> what is this under the contention </connor>
<joey> ashley isn't this the stupidest [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> your honor your honor i object </joey>
<connor> you object you can't you will look like </connor>
<connor> clowns </connor>
<connor> you both lose one point oh my god </connor>
<garnt> there's no doubt about it all right i </garnt>
<garnt> actually bought a b stars figure because </garnt>
<garnt> i wanted to take it away from connor </garnt>
<joey> just in case i bought as well hell yeah </joey>
<joey> no no not not now like in my </joey>
<joey> in my personal life </joey>
<garnt> don't tell me that you're like oh that's </garnt>
<joey> the one i bought joe </joey>
<joey> i i pre-ordered this before it came out </joey>
<garnt> oh okay yeah yeah it's really yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i was looking around and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like well i've got all my points </garnt>
<garnt> let's try it let's try to [ __ ] over um </garnt>
<garnt> so you know it didn't matter in the end </garnt>
<joey> anyway yeah it didn't matter hell yeah </joey>
<joey> that's it's such a nice figure as well </joey>
<garnt> it is </garnt>
<joey> did you even watch peace stars this year </joey>
<joey> though uh yeah season two i did okay </joey>
<connor> yeah so yes that did you take one point </connor>
<connor> off of them actually uh it's under </connor>
<connor> contention </connor>
<connor> we're having points on the contention </connor>
<joey> this year what the [ __ ] take it off for </joey>
<joey> them no no it's under contention this is </joey>
<connor> not under under what what the court of </connor>
<connor> the clowns what the [ __ ] you know the </connor>
<joey> court of the law </joey>
<connor> the court among us the court of among us </connor>
<garnt> the court of the sus </garnt>
<connor> i'm sorry i'm sorry but if we're going </connor>
<connor> far by among us laws then the majority </connor>
<garnt> wins right it's by major majority votes </garnt>
<connor> so therefore therefore you would have </connor>
<connor> you would have been voted out if you're </connor>
<connor> both in agreement you can't just both </connor>
<connor> keep making up rules and then say we </connor>
<joey> have the majority </joey>
<joey> we're not making overalls that's </joey>
<joey> literally what you just did we did an </joey>
<joey> emergency meeting we voted and we voted </joey>
<connor> that your opinion was voted off because </connor>
<connor> you're in the same game the same figure </connor>
<connor> and the same characters so they voted </connor>
<joey> the same character are you colorblind </joey>
<joey> the same character </joey>
<joey> there is not none of these look like </joey>
<joey> this character they literally look the </joey>
<joey> exact same none of these they're all the </joey>
<connor> crew members they're literally the same </connor>
<garnt> character i can't believe this is </garnt>
<garnt> they're the same character how can like </garnt>
<garnt> six of them go around at the same time </garnt>
<connor> they're all wearing different costumes </connor>
<connor> gone </connor>
<connor> because why because they're all the same </connor>
<garnt> characters because they're different </garnt>
<garnt> characters johanna no they're wearing </garnt>
<garnt> what do you think </garnt>
<garnt> are you telling me they're all clones or </garnt>
<garnt> yes they are lit that is literally the </garnt>
<joey> point of the thing is that you can </joey>
<joey> change color because there is no </joey>
<connor> distinction between them because they </connor>
<joey> are the same character </joey>
<garnt> what if what if this guy's name is gary </garnt>
<connor> and this guy's name is greg it's not </connor>
<garnt> well how do we know have you have you </garnt>
<connor> looked into amongst them at all yes they </connor>
<connor> don't have any names they're all the </connor>
<garnt> same character </garnt>
<garnt> so every fact so all among us characters </garnt>
<garnt> are just clones of each other yes </garnt>
<joey> i like to hear your opinions among us </joey>
<joey> fans uh anyone who's uh </joey>
<connor> knows anything about among us law i </connor>
<connor> think can back us up that uh these are </connor>
<connor> all different characters </connor>
<joey> all right bring out the uh what else is </joey>
<garnt> in my box </garnt>
<garnt> what else have i got i'm i'm just gonna </garnt>
<garnt> keep bringing that [ __ ] out so the other </garnt>
<connor> challenge i had was to buy a wall scroll </connor>
<garnt> so uh i just bought a show what's wrong </garnt>
<connor> do you even need to see it no no okay no </connor>
<joey> one cares it's like no one cares </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean like my challenges were to i </garnt>
<garnt> mean one of them was this and one of </garnt>
<garnt> them was that so that's both of my </garnt>
<garnt> challenges because the next challenge </garnt>
<garnt> was to uh squat anytime i saw every zero </garnt>
<garnt> figure and i really regret not going to </garnt>
<garnt> the gym because my [ __ ] god that </garnt>
<garnt> burnt the next day i'm not even joking </garnt>
<garnt> right because now that i've moved into a </garnt>
<garnt> house with stairs </garnt>
<garnt> just going up to my bedroom hurts </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like i just after that i just </garnt>
<garnt> bought figures that i liked </garnt>
<joey> oh i wanted to get that got his county </joey>
<garnt> figure i wanted to get that so bad um </garnt>
<garnt> just because i i've never seen a fully </garnt>
<joey> cooling fully represent </joey>
<joey> boys that's the blue candy too yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> i have a red candy at home actually </garnt>
<garnt> hell yeah so i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i'm glad that they're still making fully </garnt>
<garnt> cooling figures are they still is this </garnt>
<garnt> new because i didn't know this results </garnt>
<joey> right isn't everything at army army like </joey>
<garnt> relatively new i think this is from the </garnt>
<joey> second hand </joey>
<joey> um is it from the second hand section </joey>
<joey> yeah it's from the second hand right um </joey>
<joey> yes literally says 1990. </joey>

<joey> yeah so uh that's that nice uh ashley </joey>
<connor> can you get me the the lamp </connor>
<connor> yeah this is something that i was gonna </connor>
<connor> buy yeah so i kind of saw me reaching </connor>
<connor> out for this and i thought it was too </connor>
<connor> cool not to get yeah i wanted to get </connor>
<garnt> this for myself for the longest time but </garnt>
<garnt> i got a majora's mark it's not a figure </garnt>
<joey> but i thought it looked cool in the </joey>
<garnt> studio it's a majora's mask </garnt>
<garnt> light up statue yeah sydney actually </garnt>
<connor> went back to amiami and bought this oh </connor>
<connor> really like two days after it's pretty </connor>
<connor> sick it is really good that looks that </connor>
<connor> would look amazing </connor>
<joey> it off to them they can get it oh yeah </joey>
<joey> good idea </joey>
<joey> well um </joey>
<connor> a bunch of [ __ ] from anime only movies </connor>
<joey> just to win this this prize </joey>
<connor> oh a ton of food all the ghibli stuff </connor>
<connor> like 5 000 of them just so i make sure </connor>
<connor> that i get that done </connor>
<joey> wow </joey>
<joey> it's all jubilee too yeah i don't know </joey>
<garnt> why i didn't think of jubilee yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why i just wanted to either </garnt>
<connor> uh one two like when i when i i remember </connor>
<joey> the challenge of anime only movies and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh man how many hosoda figures </joey>
<garnt> are there no because i was just like how </garnt>
<garnt> many shinkai figures i was like pro </garnt>
<garnt> that's a that's an anime only akira </garnt>
<connor> jerry's gonna i figured it would be </connor>
<connor> whoever got the most because it was the </connor>
<joey> most anime figures yeah sorry i thought </joey>
<joey> i got mistake i thought it was the most </joey>
<connor> expensive no no no so i bought six from </connor>
<garnt> ghibli all right </garnt>
<garnt> you've got that point </garnt>
<joey> you've got that point but do you have a </joey>
<joey> majora's mask lamp i don't think so but </joey>
<connor> i have um </connor>
<joey> this is sick though like you can </joey>
<connor> actually put food in it and it will like </connor>
<joey> chomp it and spit it out </joey>
<joey> what do you need that for i don't know i </joey>
<connor> just thought it was it was cool to have </connor>
<garnt> no face figure that can chomp and spit </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fair enough no yeah i guess uh </garnt>
<joey> fire from house that's cute right </joey>
<garnt> calcifer i think uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you can see you can hear you can </garnt>
<garnt> hear nabi um cheering because is it okay </garnt>
<joey> this is the only thing that gets now be </joey>
<garnt> excited it's oxton because she's okay </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's okay altar the [ __ ] is this </garnt>
<joey> what is this it's okay someone's the </joey>
<garnt> best looking fate some sometimes you </garnt>
<connor> roll for a character and uh you are </connor>
<joey> unfortunately oh it's from fate yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah later </connor>
<joey> it talks to alter those the best </joey>
<garnt> character from honestly this this is </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of like her ranking in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> gameplay it's like it's it's not the </garnt>
<garnt> best but in terms of [ __ ] design holy </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] this is one of my favorite designs </joey>
<joey> i agree and if you bought this you would </joey>
<joey> have got a point joey because i don't </joey>
<joey> own her i tried tried rolling for her </joey>
<joey> did not get her um well </joey>
<joey> we'll we'll find out about that later </joey>
<joey> that was in monroe i was in monday yeah </joey>
<joey> and that's and that's why you know if </joey>
<garnt> you can't if sometimes you roll for a </garnt>
<garnt> gacha and you don't get it so sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> you go out your way and you own them </garnt>
<garnt> physically and that's uh that's what i </garnt>
<joey> did okay okay so my biggest challenge at </joey>
<joey> army army was to get a figure of a </joey>
<garnt> character that is american </garnt>
<joey> okay now i had to double check here </joey>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<joey> it didn't say anime character it just </joey>
<joey> said character right because admittedly </joey>
<joey> there isn't a whole lot of american </joey>
<garnt> anime characters there's a few there's a </garnt>
<garnt> few like that guy from yugioh yeah </garnt>
<joey> there's a few but definitely not </joey>
<connor> famous enough to make a figure out of </connor>
<connor> yeah right but luckily i i checked with </connor>
<connor> the staff and i said okay does it </connor>
<connor> necessarily have to be anime it doesn't </connor>
<joey> say it needs to be anime so as long as </joey>
<joey> it's an american and you guys have no </joey>
<joey> problems with it being an american then </joey>
<joey> i thought it was okay right so </joey>
<joey> i got </joey>
<joey> probably one of the most american people </joey>
<joey> ever </joey>
<joey> lebron james </joey>
<joey> why is there a lebron james </joey>
<joey> what american you can't argue it's a </joey>
<joey> figure </joey>
<garnt> i'll i'll give you that i'll give you </garnt>
<garnt> that i'll give you that too </garnt>
<garnt> representative </garnt>
<joey> we have we have a lebron james speaker </joey>
<garnt> in the studio </garnt>
<joey> applause ladies and gentlemen why the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] is there a lebron if </garnt>
<garnt> lebron james can appear in space jam he </garnt>
<joey> can appear in trash taste okay he's </joey>
<joey> technically an anime character he was in </joey>
<joey> space too </joey>
<joey> well i thought cause why is it like </joey>
<connor> movable </connor>
<garnt> you can make him dunk you can make him </garnt>
<garnt> do the finger thing as well it's great i </garnt>
<connor> love this </connor>

<garnt> [ __ ] you know what you know what guys </garnt>
<garnt> i was this close to buying one as well i </garnt>
<connor> was this close oh </connor>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> at least the reason is what your price </joey>
<joey> was because i was like at least let me </joey>
<connor> be mine cheaper and it was cheaper so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you you overpaid by 20 bucks that's </connor>
<joey> all right i'm going to take one of these </joey>
<joey> home </joey>
<joey> all right two points off i guess because </joey>
<garnt> we're idiots two points two points you </garnt>
<joey> want to see it </joey>
<garnt> i'm good man i'm good </garnt>
<connor> guys guys we can have one in our both </connor>
<connor> shows we'll have one in each corner so </connor>
<connor> one of my challenges to buy a male </connor>
<joey> character and this was it why that one </joey>
<connor> you could have gone for any other male </connor>
<connor> character there's a reason why joey okay </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> i also bought something else to go along </connor>
<connor> with it okay </connor>
<joey> oh you bought the motorbike oh you </joey>
<joey> bought the motorbike i'm so glad you </joey>
<joey> bought that i don't know because i saw </joey>
<joey> it and i was like </joey>
<joey> i don't know because it's not going to </joey>
<joey> give me any points or anything but oh </joey>
<joey> there's alter okay </joey>
<joey> look at that octa ultra dude </joey>
<joey> damn </joey>
<joey> goddamn oh it is easily the best looking </joey>
<garnt> fake character i'm i'm sad now though i </garnt>
<garnt> don't own her this this is this is </garnt>
<joey> making me so sad i now know that you </joey>
<connor> don't own her </connor>
<connor> so this is the bike and yeah it's a big </connor>
<connor> box yeah i bought this because i well i </connor>
<garnt> was going to buy this because it was 600 </garnt>
<garnt> and i thought at the time i'm i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like i was very confident the time that </garnt>
<garnt> it was the most expensive figure i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if you guys bought another one yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i still you know from all the stores so </garnt>
<joey> far i think it is i think so far yeah so </joey>
<joey> the reason why i bought the other figure </joey>
<connor> was to try and secure the challenge of </connor>
<connor> spending the most on one series yeah how </connor>
<joey> much how much was this bike </joey>
<garnt> 600 600 </garnt>
<joey> oh my god it's like a whole mic it's </joey>
<garnt> like a full-on operation oh my god look </garnt>
<joey> at that this is not a podcast episode </joey>
<joey> anymore this is just an unboxing yeah </joey>
<garnt> i like how we've just made a glorified </garnt>
<garnt> unboxing episode and uh audio aliens are </garnt>
<joey> gonna be so confused yeah if you're </joey>
<joey> watching if you're if you've come this </joey>
<joey> far oh </joey>
<joey> lord </joey>
<joey> so cool </joey>
<garnt> yo i can only get so erect dog </garnt>
<joey> that's amazing oh it moves holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that is so cool </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] i hope you can [ __ ] put it </joey>
<connor> on the set </connor>
<joey> yeah that's like canada </joey>
<joey> i hope i hope you can put canada on that </joey>
<garnt> god damn that looks good that is so cool </garnt>
<connor> again that's not that that supersedes a </connor>
<connor> figure i think that's yeah that's just a </connor>
<joey> statue </joey>
<joey> oh dude i really hope you can get him to </joey>
<connor> sit on it so the main so the main reason </connor>
<connor> i wanted to get it was because i was </connor>
<connor> near certain that yeah it did indeed </connor>
<connor> yeah oh </connor>
<joey> i mean that's impressive but look at my </joey>
<joey> boiler </joey>
<joey> clean </joey>
<joey> look at that physique that perfect </joey>
<joey> physique oh look at that look at that </joey>
<connor> that's so cool so i wonder why it </connor>
<connor> doesn't really stand up very well i </connor>
<joey> think in even in the the movie it kind </joey>
<joey> of leans when it stands yeah but like </joey>
<garnt> it's like that i think i think it needs </garnt>
<garnt> to stand on the side right the boys are </garnt>
<joey> low right yeah the set though i thought </joey>
<joey> that would look sick behind us yeah </joey>
<joey> having you know a one to sixth scale of </joey>
<connor> the bike i just thought you can't say no </connor>
<garnt> to that yeah that that's sick you know </garnt>
<garnt> what that legitimately looks amazing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh worth wasting two points for um </garnt>
<joey> so yeah i agree you know what i ain't </joey>
<garnt> even mad i lost two points because we </garnt>
<garnt> got that yeah we got that in the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> seven yeah right right right isn't this </connor>

<joey> joe i didn't know you were a hatsune </joey>
<joey> miku fan what can i say i like anime </joey>
<garnt> we've gotten to the point where the </garnt>
<garnt> figures we've bought we buy are so big </garnt>
<garnt> that it's actually blocking us yeah uh </garnt>
<garnt> so i'm not gonna unbox this but this is </garnt>
<connor> the memorial dress uh hatsune miku </connor>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<joey> yeah that one is also the one that is </joey>
<connor> closest to 420 for me okay we'll we'll </connor>
<connor> so we'll uh well funny enough the </connor>
<connor> one of the things i have left is the </connor>
<connor> closest to 420 for me oh nice oh okay </connor>
<joey> all right </joey>
<connor> i don't know what the [ __ ] this is pull </connor>
<joey> it out it happened to be so close to 420 </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is that </garnt>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> thank god i do not know what this is uh </connor>
<joey> this is </joey>
<garnt> megazone23 </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know what that is i'm guessing </garnt>
<connor> it's like a super obscure yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> probably a super old makeup show </garnt>
<garnt> where will i get it destroyed for </garnt>
<garnt> calling this a transformer because it </garnt>
<connor> kind of looks like a transformer </connor>
<connor> so i'm guessing this is some very og </connor>
<joey> isn't garland like a different character </joey>
<joey> from a different show yeah it's final </joey>
<connor> fantasy right i'm guessing it's rare or </connor>
<connor> something because it's 420 i think it's </connor>
<joey> like i think i think just looking at the </joey>
<joey> font of the show name it looks like an </joey>
<garnt> old show uh in like the mech section of </garnt>
<joey> me oh </joey>
<connor> like that's what it looks like so i </connor>
<connor> guess yeah i don't want to be here all </connor>
<garnt> day opening for you guys yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so yeah we'll just take that off </garnt>
<joey> stream good stuff that's my closest i </joey>
<garnt> have one more uh how many do you have </garnt>
<joey> left i'm done would you want to go first </joey>
<garnt> i just went </garnt>
<garnt> okay um so uh oh you go first because </garnt>
<connor> this one's a hentai thing right well i </connor>
<connor> thought my last challenge was get </connor>
<connor> something from an anime </connor>
<connor> that the boys haven't watched okay </connor>
<connor> and what better than an anime that isn't </connor>
<garnt> even out yet because there's no possible </garnt>
<garnt> way you could have watched it </garnt>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<garnt> nice </garnt>
<joey> arc nights and i i was i was running </joey>
<connor> around the store and i thought there was </connor>
<joey> a few hasn't it been </joey>
<joey> yeah it's been announced announced yeah </joey>
<joey> and you haven't watched it we haven't </joey>
<joey> watched it </joey>
<joey> no one's seen it nobody's seen it except </joey>
<joey> for the people working on it so i </joey>
<joey> thought perfect and and you know me and </joey>
<connor> joey like arc knights i do i still play </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> i don't play it you didn't get the chin </joey>
<joey> one though </joey>
<connor> see i i went for the more expensive one </connor>
<joey> uh okay but the children was i know you </joey>
<joey> like that i i like chen more yeah why is </joey>
<garnt> the four star no she is she is five </garnt>
<joey> stars she's literally the first unit you </joey>
<joey> get yeah she's she's kind of repeating </joey>
<garnt> she's yeah yeah she's literally the </garnt>
<connor> default unit yeah i don't even know how </connor>
<joey> to open her her like final e2 is like </joey>
<joey> obvious [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm sorry if you don't play arc </joey>
<connor> knights yeah well so this is the main </connor>
<connor> character from arc knights i'm guessing </connor>
<joey> she'll be in the anime as well i think </joey>
<joey> she'll be the main goal in the app yeah </joey>
<connor> um yeah that's so nice though because i </connor>
<connor> have uh i've seen the nendoroids of army </connor>
<connor> i don't like nendoroids </connor>
<connor> i like nanderoids but i i really like </connor>
<connor> the nendoroids for armia but like a full </connor>
<connor> figurine of that i actually might </connor>
<joey> i actually might go and buy this </joey>
<joey> like it's actually it's actually so nice </joey>
<joey> if there's one thing arc knights does </joey>
<joey> absolutely amazingly it's character </joey>
<joey> design yeah yeah i think i think there </joey>
<garnt> is there is no better game that can do </garnt>
<joey> better character design and it's [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> so cool </garnt>
<garnt> like i've been looking i've been eyeing </garnt>
<garnt> up some arc night figures that haven't </garnt>
<garnt> been released yet yeah um like </garnt>
<garnt> the e3 one that's coming out looks </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's coming out next year oh i i </garnt>
<connor> remember it for being super open yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> she's still open she's still open </joey>
<connor> well that's that's the arc okay that's </connor>
<joey> actually so cool i love that oh yeah </joey>
<joey> army is so cute dude </joey>
<connor> yeah well that's that was 150 bucks nice </connor>
<garnt> uh i thought you know it's completely a </garnt>
<garnt> challenge and it's a pretty good figure </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so what was your challenge again oh </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>

<joey> cool thing yeah no complaints uh that's </joey>
<joey> a nice figure </joey>
<connor> all right all right </connor>
<garnt> one more point for me yeah so i've got </garnt>
<connor> one more figure and of course amiami has </connor>
<connor> like a really good selection of hentai </connor>
<connor> and lude figures right yes so i wanted </connor>
<connor> to get a hentai figure and i found the </connor>
<garnt> weirdest hentai figure i've ever seen </garnt>
<garnt> okay bet okay </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> on the front it looks like a normal </garnt>
<garnt> hentai figure right but the figure </garnt>
<garnt> is just an ass </garnt>
<connor> i'm gonna have to blow that </connor>
<joey> it's literally just an oh this is like </joey>
<joey> the this is like the way they get sucked </joey>
<garnt> into a wall right right stuck in the </garnt>
<garnt> wall you only get half the figure so </garnt>
<joey> it's just the ass can't how are we going </joey>

<joey> or designed this character that the </joey>
<joey> figure is based off of i mean the cover </joey>
<connor> is like wow </connor>

<connor> well it was like 800 on a yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> hell so yeah and you lost two points for </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<connor> but it was worth it because that was </connor>
<garnt> worth it </garnt>
<garnt> right i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> the bike is probably gonna be the most </garnt>
<connor> visibly like striking on the thing </connor>
<connor> because yeah none of this [ __ ] can fit </connor>
<connor> on the desk </connor>
<connor> or there </connor>
<joey> i don't know i don't know you can fit </joey>
<garnt> this thing </garnt>

<joey> it's so funny </joey>
<joey> let's go to the next store all right but </joey>
<joey> last and certainly not least is the </joey>

<joey> smorgasbord of just random </joey>
<garnt> shimorgas board of random [ __ ] in there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was like really excited to go to </garnt>
<garnt> mandarake because like we always when we </garnt>
<garnt> go to akihabara or anywhere on mandarake </garnt>
<garnt> is we always got to hit up that store </garnt>
<garnt> because it's literally a lottery because </garnt>
<garnt> you never know what you can find you can </garnt>
<joey> find some of the coolest [ __ ] and then </joey>
<garnt> sometimes you go on the ship you go </garnt>
<joey> there and you find some of the dumbest </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] right so it was like how did you </garnt>
<garnt> guys feel going into mandarake do you </garnt>
<joey> feel like you had enough budget uh i had </joey>
<joey> more than enough budget in fact i had to </joey>
<connor> make sure i got as close to three three </connor>
<connor> three three as possible in mandaraki </connor>
<connor> which is like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] impossible yeah i have like 500 </connor>
<connor> bucks left yeah oh really yeah i had </connor>
<joey> like nothing left i had like 500 bucks </joey>
<joey> just to meet the criteria i mean you did </joey>
<joey> spend a [ __ ] on it i had to go to i mean </joey>
<joey> actually take stuff out oh that i could </joey>
<joey> was able to spend five hundred dollars </joey>
<connor> at mondragon oh [ __ ] yeah okay i still </connor>
<joey> wanted to get quite a lot of things yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah uh let's go uh what was it so we </joey>

<garnt> figure that gantt hasn't pulled for </garnt>
<garnt> or doesn't have yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh mine was to </garnt>
<connor> uh ask the store clerk for an </connor>
<connor> recommendation recommendation </connor>
<connor> um yeah i'm just gonna lose a point </connor>
<connor> right away yeah </connor>
<joey> how many do you how many deals </joey>
<connor> do you have i'm not gonna lie i totally </connor>
<connor> forgot that we were doing duplicate </connor>
<connor> characters i thought it was only </connor>
<garnt> duplicate figures no no no that's extra </garnt>
<joey> extra we've learned the hard way about </joey>
<garnt> duplicate characters and figures how </garnt>
<garnt> many points have you lost well i i lost </garnt>
<connor> two points now to dx yeah he has because </connor>
<garnt> he has four drops so i've lost wait does </garnt>
<garnt> he have four diodes yeah he bought three </garnt>
<garnt> at a stop yeah does does the deal and uh </garnt>

<joey> that's still d all right would it count </joey>
<connor> i mean it's like a duo i don't know no </connor>

<joey> obsession because your love for deer </joey>
<joey> well the reason i actually bought this </joey>
<garnt> one was because i wanted to get as close </garnt>
<garnt> as possible uh to the uh number and this </garnt>
<garnt> is one of them that i chose again i </garnt>
<garnt> totally forgot about um the </garnt>
<joey> the duplicate the duplicate thing yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i ended up buying this but i mean </joey>
<joey> there's a lot to keep track of but i </joey>
<connor> also got very very close to the uh three </connor>
<joey> thousand three hundred and thirty three </joey>
<joey> okay nice nice all right so my one uh </joey>
<joey> was </joey>
<joey> that i had to buy a fgo character that </joey>
<joey> god doesn't have on fgo </joey>
<joey> now uh </joey>
<joey> i'm not gonna lie it's been way too long </joey>
<garnt> since uh i played fgo myself </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so tell me your thought process on </garnt>
<joey> this because like my thought process was </joey>
<connor> okay i knew all of the basic characters </connor>
<connor> that you get at fgr yeah like the ones </connor>
<garnt> that are just like guaranteed so those </garnt>
<garnt> were cl obviously out of the window yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay i thought all right i i talked </garnt>
<joey> about it with knobby my cameraman yeah </joey>
<garnt> he was like an fgo expert and we </garnt>
<joey> basically made it yeah we we basically </joey>
<joey> like did a hypothesis on what might he </joey>
<garnt> not have i feel like you were really </garnt>
<garnt> lucky getting nabi as a cameraman </garnt>
<garnt> because if conor got it yeah he would </garnt>
<joey> have been he would have [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> he would have just had to pick the fake </garnt>
<garnt> character yeah so i i had the choice </garnt>
<garnt> because i wanted to get as close to </garnt>
<garnt> three three through three as possible </garnt>
<joey> yeah i had the choice to either buy a </joey>
<joey> shitload of fate nenderoids </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> and just hope just hope that you don't </joey>
<joey> have one of them right or </joey>
<joey> i just go big and go hard on one figure </joey>
<joey> to get as close as possible i hope you </joey>
<garnt> went big and went harder i went big and </garnt>
<joey> went higher okay what did you get </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> i have i have a backup so i i bought two </joey>
<connor> fake ones okay okay so the first one i </connor>
<joey> bought because i'm not too confident </joey>
<connor> right do you have </connor>
<joey> ishtar </joey>
<garnt> i got spaceshi </garnt>
<joey> no archer archer ishtar do you have </joey>
<joey> archer ishtar ah so you have the </joey>
<joey> character ishtar i'd say you have ishtar </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's different it's like the </joey>
<connor> goku black [ __ ] again no no no no no no </connor>
<joey> no no no </joey>
<garnt> it's very different in fgo it's very </garnt>
<garnt> different okay but that's okay that's </garnt>
<joey> okay you can think about that because i </joey>
<garnt> have enough </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> do you have </joey>
<garnt> gray </garnt>
<garnt> no yes let's go </garnt>
<joey> hell yeah navi oh my god okay because </joey>
<connor> this was the big gamble for me because i </connor>
<joey> was like i found gray in the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> corner like the back corner the [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> that what is he what is he the grey is </connor>
<joey> like the like a grim reaper uh what </joey>
<connor> class is it uh zep rails airplane </connor>
<joey> nothing no i think she's uh i have to </joey>
<connor> check i think yeah i think it's a saber </connor>
<joey> the saber i think it's a safe [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> now </connor>
<garnt> yeah i did not know </garnt>
<garnt> wait wait is gray released on </garnt>
<garnt> us fake go servers i i yeah the event </garnt>
<joey> was up yeah the event came out recently </joey>
<garnt> oh okay oh no </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i wouldn't have pulled for gray </garnt>
<joey> anyway so </joey>
<joey> i saw this and i looked at na'bi and i </joey>
<joey> was like this is a recent character </joey>
<joey> isn't it he was like yes and i'm like he </joey>
<joey> hasn't been playing that heavily </joey>
<joey> recently so there might be a chance but </joey>
<joey> i was so scared because this cost 160 </joey>
<joey> dollars right so i was like i have to go </joey>
<connor> like all balls no brain on this can we </connor>
<connor> get this out of the box can uh yeah </connor>
<joey> let's get this out of the box because </joey>
<joey> this is actually a really nice feature </joey>
<joey> oh assassin okay </joey>
<garnt> okay but that's i mean great gray is not </garnt>
<joey> even from like the mainline fate series </joey>
<connor> no no no </connor>
<connor> who is from the main i know i don't want </connor>
<connor> to know that </connor>
<garnt> here we </garnt>
<garnt> account just give go your [ __ ] i </garnt>
<joey> secured the point i secured the point </joey>
<garnt> add a point on to me baby all right i </garnt>
<garnt> had a po i had a point on for joey he </garnt>
<joey> deserves although yeah although he had </joey>
<joey> like the biggest cheat sheet of all time </joey>
<joey> i might imagine having navi as a chichi </joey>
<garnt> for </garnt>
<garnt> that for that challenge yeah what would </garnt>
<garnt> you have done if you got that challenge </garnt>
<connor> corner i bought a saber figure or </connor>
<connor> something </connor>
<garnt> do you own saber </garnt>
<garnt> i actually don't not the main lightsaber </garnt>
<connor> oh really yeah yeah oh wow </connor>
<connor> the the only good character from fate is </connor>
<connor> uh alexander the the the great the chad </connor>
<connor> alexander </connor>
<garnt> yeah i like i remember the characters </garnt>
<joey> from faith in terms of designs i really </joey>
<garnt> like ishtar so that's why </garnt>
<garnt> also ishtar is like a rin face so i'm </garnt>
<joey> just like anytime there's a rin face for </joey>
<joey> sale i know i know you </joey>
<garnt> please buy another dio figure go ahead </garnt>
<connor> go ahead go ahead and watch your figures </connor>
<connor> if you like okay okay okay not dios </connor>
<garnt> though show us one of yours um so first </garnt>
<connor> thing i bought was a nico robin one this </connor>
<garnt> was the </garnt>
<garnt> this was the recommended one from the </garnt>
<garnt> store clerk oh really </garnt>
<connor> because you could have recommended a </connor>
<connor> little more expensive </connor>
<garnt> this is i mean i i did tell him i did </garnt>
<garnt> tell him you know price price is an </garnt>
<garnt> issue and he was just like um so you </garnt>
<garnt> asked the store clerk for a </garnt>
<connor> recommendation what does he recommend he </connor>
<connor> goes do you like one piece </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like okay you're doing </connor>
<connor> you're doing it you're like a pleb </connor>
<connor> did you </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm like i guess you're just doing </connor>
<garnt> your job how you literally picked the </garnt>
<garnt> least like inoffensive </garnt>
<joey> franchise you could go for at least he </joey>
<joey> picked like you know post time skip </joey>
<garnt> robin right at least it's probably </garnt>
<garnt> probably </garnt>
<garnt> robin </garnt>
<garnt> the funny thing is uh so this was like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the first figures i got at the </garnt>
<garnt> store </garnt>
<garnt> um so obviously with with a random guy </garnt>
<garnt> asking him asking him for a </garnt>
<garnt> recommendation you know i get it as a </garnt>
<garnt> store clerk you don't want to you don't </garnt>
<joey> want to go crazy yeah you don't want to </joey>
<garnt> seem too weird yeah you know you don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to seem too like when you ask the </garnt>
<garnt> waiter for a wine recommendation he you </garnt>
<joey> know you know if he uh you know offers </joey>
<joey> you the most expensive oh wait i got him </joey>
<joey> yeah he's not going to go for like the </joey>
<connor> fancy no no he's going to do it for like </connor>
<garnt> a medium one yeah yeah yeah yeah um so </garnt>
<garnt> afterwards uh at the end when i had to </garnt>
<garnt> like buy another figure uh his station </garnt>
<garnt> was actually next to the hentai figures </garnt>
<garnt> section </garnt>
<joey> of course </joey>
<joey> and i'm sure sydney was frothing at the </joey>
<garnt> mouth yeah and when he saw us uh when he </garnt>
<garnt> saw </garnt>
<garnt> that uh </garnt>
<garnt> when he saw that hentai figures were an </garnt>
<garnt> option yeah and that sydney was like </garnt>
<joey> choosing a hentai figure he was just </joey>
<joey> like oh those were options </joey>
<joey> i could have picked one of those </joey>
<garnt> oh why didn't you tell me </garnt>
<joey> he went for literally the plebiest </joey>
<garnt> if you ask a staff for recommendation </garnt>
<connor> he's like yeah the one with absolutely </connor>
<connor> gargantuan tits and like vagina he's </connor>
<connor> you're going to be like uh what yeah </connor>
<garnt> because i will say out of all the </garnt>
<garnt> one-piece figures he did like he did </garnt>
<garnt> like pick the most cultured one he </garnt>
<connor> possibly could that is true robin is </connor>
<joey> probably the most voluptuous one yeah </joey>
<connor> it's just a normal looking one piece for </connor>
<connor> you yeah it doesn't look like anything </connor>
<garnt> exceptional </garnt>
<garnt> i mean compared to like getting like one </garnt>
<joey> of the male characters yeah </joey>
<joey> you know if it was like a standard zorro </joey>
<connor> or like sanji character then it would </connor>
<connor> have been like i like wrong yeah there's </connor>
<joey> like a mcdonald's toy </joey>
<connor> dude i'd go to mcdonald's every day </connor>
<joey> did you give me if we got this for happy </joey>
<joey> meal i'd be [ __ ] i'd be very happy </joey>
<garnt> i'd be like mom we're getting mcdonald's </garnt>
<garnt> once again </garnt>
<joey> here's the great figure right here okay </joey>
<joey> that's a big ass scythe look at that </joey>
<garnt> i've already seen grey and like lord </garnt>
<garnt> elmaloy's case files um which i believe </garnt>
<joey> is the spin-off oh that sounds pretty </joey>
<connor> sick yeah yeah it's very cool it's </connor>
<joey> visually appealing yeah yeah i'm pretty </joey>
<garnt> happy with it and god doesn't have it </garnt>
<garnt> it's a it's another saber face it's </garnt>
<joey> another savage yet another saber face </joey>
<garnt> how do i get this [ __ ] plastic off </garnt>
<joey> you just have to rip the plastic i think </joey>
<connor> oh never mind there we go well all right </connor>
<connor> i will say i am glad that you didn't buy </connor>
<connor> a saber figure yeah because i bought a </connor>
<garnt> saber figure really wait connor you </garnt>
<garnt> bought a fate figure </garnt>
<garnt> wait hold on a second hold the phone </garnt>
<joey> does that mean you guys lose a point </joey>
<garnt> because he has the beast </garnt>
<joey> hold up for us hold up a second </joey>
<garnt> bro </garnt>
<garnt> oh ashley you okay actually okay </garnt>
<garnt> um so i didn't know this but apparently </garnt>
<joey> he definitely did pick a culture duh </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] should where's the g </joey>
<joey> string </joey>
<joey> oh now we all know who my favorite </joey>
<garnt> one-piece character is </garnt>
<garnt> god damn okay all right robin i see you </garnt>
<garnt> i don't remember that in the uh anime </garnt>
<joey> okay hold on a second question time </joey>
<joey> you bought a saber </joey>
<joey> you have the big saber you bought a </joey>
<connor> russian bun does that count </connor>
<joey> nah </joey>
<connor> i don't know what what do you think </connor>
<connor> connor i thought you you bought uh a </connor>
<connor> sabre of the [ __ ] or something i don't </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> it's literally the exact same it is </joey>
<connor> actually </connor>
<connor> broke off oh [ __ ] i just don't break off </connor>
<garnt> where did this come from connor what </garnt>
<garnt> have you done what you've done to your </garnt>
<connor> fate figure i don't know oh i already </connor>
<connor> actually just broke oh my god i think </connor>
<joey> you'll lose a point just for that to be </joey>
<connor> honest </connor>
<garnt> i mean it doesn't matter because you </garnt>
<joey> both bought sabers so you lose a point </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<connor> so take a point off why did you buy a </connor>
<joey> sabre gone why did you do it you didn't </joey>
<joey> think he was going to buy a saber no i </joey>
<garnt> didn't you didn't think you didn't think </garnt>
<garnt> i was going to buy a fate yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> why that's why i was that's why when i </garnt>
<garnt> got the [ __ ] like buy a fate </garnt>
<joey> character that god doesn't have i was </joey>
<joey> sweating my ass off because i'm like i'm </joey>
<joey> definitely going to lose a point because </joey>
<joey> he's probably bought all the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> fake characters </connor>
<connor> okay wait where did i put this how do i </connor>
<connor> mount this </connor>
<connor> just on that right no </connor>
<joey> if you want to figure this out for me </joey>
<joey> that'd be great please give me the story </joey>
<connor> yeah so actually you know i have watched </connor>
<connor> fate as much as i mean that i hate it i </connor>
<connor> i just hate it because god talks about </connor>
<joey> it so god damn much wait this should be </joey>
<joey> a like a stand </joey>
<connor> like a long thing uh maybe it's in the </connor>
<connor> box or something i don't know well </connor>
<garnt> that's that's a good saber figure </garnt>
<connor> actually </connor>
<connor> this broke off one of the things i don't </connor>
<connor> know why it's very flimsy oh it's it's </connor>
<garnt> it's oh it's a little end here yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i mean uh if you weren't careful </garnt>
<garnt> with that which uh you definitely </garnt>
<garnt> weren't gonna look careful with it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> maybe let's see so i guess another point </garnt>
<connor> oh my god i'm losing so many points </connor>
<garnt> connor's like kind of gaining points and </garnt>
<garnt> then just losing them just as quickly </garnt>
<joey> did you guys help did you take a point </joey>
<connor> off guard in connor yeah okay all right </connor>
<joey> so that that's actually a good fate for </joey>
<connor> you i like the one that's really nice </connor>
<garnt> that that is a very nice sabre figure i </garnt>
<connor> think it wasn't that i'll </connor>
<joey> god it's nothing but fate here look at </joey>
<connor> that it's god's dreamland right here i </connor>
<connor> know right </connor>
<joey> gray and saber </joey>
<garnt> wait i woke up on a podcast where people </garnt>
<garnt> bought face uh fate figures and none of </garnt>
<garnt> them were bought by me what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> going on how much do you think this cost </connor>
<connor> this one yeah </connor>
<connor> 200 interesting it's about 200 right 100 </connor>
<garnt> bucks oh wow wow be good for 100 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> yeah not bad at all yeah so yeah like i </garnt>
<garnt> said i mean on the whole fake [ __ ] but i </garnt>
<connor> like re-zero </connor>
<connor> phase zero a lot </connor>
<connor> that's a freudian </connor>
<connor> i do like roushira </connor>
<connor> i like i like unlimited blade works and </connor>
<garnt> i like fake zero should watch heaven's </garnt>
<garnt> feel as well you're here </garnt>
<connor> you've no no no me you've literally </connor>
<connor> ruined fate for me i actually can't </connor>
<connor> watch it </connor>
<connor> all right uh what else did you guys buy </connor>
<connor> how many more </connor>
<connor> i've got one more </connor>
<connor> i know what you've got left i saw you </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] ask for it </garnt>
<garnt> so i so one thing that i think is </garnt>
<garnt> underrepresented on trash taste is mecca </garnt>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> um so i bought a 400 mech transformer </connor>
<garnt> well we will go evacuate too </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think so i i really hope not is </garnt>
<garnt> it a building one </garnt>
<connor> i'm [ __ ] buy a building open it up </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna we're </garnt>
<connor> it's like perfectly flat of course </connor>
<connor> there's no way it would fit in there no </connor>
<garnt> because i've seen i've seen this like </garnt>
<garnt> this i've seen i've seen the gunpla and </garnt>
<garnt> normally like if it's a building one the </garnt>
<joey> back has you should lose the backers </joey>
<joey> i just assume all gundam ones are just </joey>
<joey> the gun plus </joey>
<garnt> if this yeah because because i i've </garnt>
<connor> already wanted a gundam um that wasn't a </connor>
<connor> gunpla but it was impossible to find and </connor>
<connor> uh yeah i have i haven't actually seen </connor>
<connor> gundam pathway yet but alan will not </connor>
<connor> shut up about it </connor>
<connor> allen is my editor and he's just like </connor>
<joey> gone and the biggest gundam simply you </joey>
<joey> know he's allen's like gone if you do </joey>
<joey> anything uh just watch gundam hathaway </joey>
<joey> because actually no it is already no </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> wow look at that so alan i hope i've </joey>
<garnt> made you proud by uh buying a gundam and </garnt>
<garnt> it's actually really nice apparently </garnt>
<garnt> gundam hathaway isn't that a transformer </garnt>
<garnt> according to the bbc yeah </garnt>
<joey> all right you were at the bbc yeah </joey>
<garnt> this is this is there's so many parts </garnt>
<joey> this is </joey>
<garnt> look look this this is this is like a </garnt>
<garnt> pre-built gun plot this is this is </garnt>
<connor> baby's first gun maybe the guys can </connor>
<connor> build it off camera very fast </connor>
<garnt> yeah um so alan just told me to tell </garnt>
<joey> people to watch gun and hathaway um </joey>
<joey> that's all i know i've heard very good </joey>
<joey> things i've actually like legit i've </joey>
<garnt> heard so many good things about gundam </garnt>
<garnt> hathaway </garnt>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> so yeah we finally have a mecca apart </garnt>
<connor> from you guys you've heard of the foot </connor>

<connor> i actually only bought two but there </connor>
<connor> were like two ones that built the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] banks there were like two high </connor>
<connor> quality figures i go for high quality </connor>
<connor> what are you saying what are you </connor>
<connor> insinuating </connor>
<joey> i go for quality it's all right connor </joey>

<connor> collection </connor>
<connor> is this is this what is this this is my </connor>
<joey> most expensive figure i bought i saw </joey>

<connor> joey vastly overpaid for it i did vastly </connor>
<joey> overpay for it but that's all right </joey>
<connor> because this is going to be that's not </connor>
<connor> the point that's not that's not the </connor>
<connor> point </connor>
<connor> the point can go on the [ __ ] at least </connor>
<garnt> this can go on the shelf </garnt>
<joey> i paid how much did you pay for it i </joey>
<garnt> paid 990 for this </garnt>
<joey> so i better [ __ ] win the most </joey>

<connor> thousand dollars it's probably very rare </connor>
<connor> i've never seen it before i've never </connor>
<connor> seen it before so i'm guessing that's </connor>
<connor> why it costs so much yeah i mean it's </connor>
<connor> sick and it can go on the shelf thank </connor>
<connor> god yeah exactly it's not too big it's </connor>

<garnt> go in the shelf we just need some </garnt>
<garnt> we just need some like black tape we can </garnt>
<garnt> do like uh canonically censored um </garnt>
<joey> canonically censored i realized this </joey>
<joey> part </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] yeah what happened yeah oh no it </joey>
<garnt> came it happened when i took it out of </garnt>
<joey> the bag oh [ __ ] that's all right we can </joey>
<joey> we can bond it </joey>
<garnt> imagine if you paid 990 </garnt>
<joey> no i do remember it saying that this was </joey>
<garnt> uh broken in one point this was broken </garnt>
<garnt> in one part </garnt>
<garnt> oh my gosh that must be like that's an </garnt>
<joey> easy thing that must be like super rare </joey>
<joey> yeah that's an easy fix uh </joey>
<joey> what else do you get what else you got </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] that nesco </connor>
<connor> don't tell me you got one as well go on </connor>
<garnt> uh i just remembered i just bought some </garnt>
<garnt> other [ __ ] there's a naruto teddy bear </garnt>
<garnt> oh a kakashi teddy takashi teddy bear oh </garnt>
<joey> he's my favorite fortnite character dude </joey>
<garnt> yeah some some stuff i bought just to </garnt>
<garnt> pad out the number just to get as close </garnt>
<joey> to uh yeah it's a question how much did </joey>
<joey> you guys do like </joey>
<joey> small scale adjustments to get to the </joey>
<garnt> phone okay so the the difficult thing </garnt>
<joey> about mandarake </joey>
<garnt> is that </garnt>
<garnt> some price tags had tax on it and some </garnt>
<garnt> price tags didn't right so trying to </garnt>
<garnt> calculate if the price you were getting </garnt>
<garnt> was actually like with tax or without </garnt>
<garnt> tax was like [ __ ] insane see because </garnt>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> just completely coincidentally i thought </joey>
<joey> i was gonna have to do that when i </joey>
<joey> bought my three figures yeah but then </joey>
<joey> when i calculated everything </joey>
<joey> i literally couldn't it was that it was </joey>
<joey> that close i really yeah i actually like </joey>
<joey> completely coincidentally i got insanely </joey>
<joey> close to three three three three i hope </joey>
<joey> as closer </joey>
<connor> than you two what's your cheapest figure </connor>
<connor> by the way gone </connor>
<connor> the pikachu because i've got an even </connor>
<connor> cheaper one have you actually 100 yen no </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] way oh you just lost the point </joey>
<connor> there you've lost another point i lost a </connor>
<garnt> point to gain a point </garnt>
<joey> i thought for sure the pikachu would </joey>
<joey> have lost him a point i i was so </joey>
<connor> confident that i would get the exact </connor>
<connor> amount that i had well no no he yeah he </connor>
<joey> hasn't what what was i bought for 100 </joey>
<connor> yen so what was 200 no but what was that </connor>
<joey> bought for what challenge nothing </joey>
<joey> it was it was so that he could get as </joey>
<garnt> close to all right uh um don't add a </garnt>
<garnt> point yeah it's it's whether he gets </garnt>
<connor> close to the number enough do you like </connor>
<connor> out of mastercard um you're almost sure </connor>
<connor> sure </connor>
<connor> there you go you can have that one </connor>
<garnt> this is going in the background corner </garnt>
<connor> no it's not going anywhere </connor>
<garnt> is that what you bought </garnt>
<connor> uh i bought one more thing buy a figure </connor>
<joey> from a show that you'd all watched all </joey>
<joey> right that was a challenge right </joey>
<joey> nice ah okay well you know what i i i </joey>
<joey> like it because you've bought you've </joey>
<joey> you've completed uh you've completed </joey>
<joey> this uh the code geass journey and </joey>
<connor> you've now found a mate for c2 which you </connor>
<connor> bought last night exactly right it's </connor>
<joey> perfect yeah so i can open this up let's </joey>
<joey> have a look i ain't even mad with this </joey>
<joey> one so this one's great that's a clean </joey>
<connor> win that's a clean thing i see nothing </connor>
<garnt> but dubs here yeah that is a dog so give </garnt>
<connor> me a point back </connor>
<garnt> you added one back </garnt>
<garnt> yeah wow </garnt>
<garnt> is that everything you bought joey </garnt>
<garnt> that's everything i only bought three </garnt>
<garnt> things </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah because like the thing about </garnt>
<garnt> mandarin okay the [ __ ] horror one was </garnt>
<garnt> a thousand dollars </garnt>
<garnt> i had to use my budget somehow that's </garnt>
<garnt> true </garnt>
<garnt> i think the biggest the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> difference between this figure special </garnt>
<garnt> and the last figure special is that i </garnt>
<garnt> was like i was like struggling to find </garnt>
<garnt> things to like fit the budget that we </garnt>
<garnt> had set yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> like we could have in most of the stores </garnt>
<garnt> we could have bought like the most </garnt>
<garnt> expensive figure there and a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> times we did buy the most expensive </garnt>
<garnt> figure there uh within reason yeah oh </garnt>
<joey> that looks good that's a nice straight </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<connor> clean fit oh </connor>
<connor> it connects </connor>
<joey> i have one more thing okay but connor i </joey>
<garnt> think me and you are going to need to </garnt>
<garnt> swap uh because i i'm going to need i'm </garnt>
<garnt> going to need the table for this uh </garnt>
<garnt> conor can we swap for a second why don't </garnt>
<garnt> you put it there huh </garnt>
<garnt> also i want both your reactions at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time okay </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> all right so i've got one more surprise </garnt>
<garnt> um it's a bit it's a bit uh out of the </garnt>
<joey> box okay literally yeah you're telling </joey>
<garnt> me i could see it </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<joey> um that's the size of my girlfriend so i </joey>
<garnt> was struggling to like fill up my budget </garnt>
<garnt> right and </garnt>
<garnt> mandarake had a lot of cool figures but </garnt>
<garnt> nothing that really like not nothing </garnt>
<garnt> that really likes you know spoke to me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> um and then i was thinking uh if you've </connor>
<connor> got another fake figure i'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] kiss </garnt>
<garnt> don't uh don't guess what this is yet </garnt>
<joey> right so should we close our eyes i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna close my eyes </connor>
<connor> i swear to god god if it's another fake </connor>
<garnt> one </garnt>
<joey> i'm so excited okay okay is this what it </joey>
<joey> feels like to be a small child during </joey>
<garnt> christmas </garnt>
<joey> you know what </joey>
<joey> i'm hearing a lot of uh struggling </joey>
<connor> oh okay so before you open your eyes i </connor>
<connor> just want i just i just want to uh </connor>
<connor> put a bit of back story to this okay it </connor>
<connor> better be quick okay </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> um we like to [ __ ] on america a lot as </connor>
<connor> you know trash tastes part of trash </connor>
<connor> taste is [ __ ] on american culture </connor>
<connor> yeah okay </connor>
<connor> and so i thought instead of [ __ ] on </connor>
<connor> american culture for once why not </connor>
<connor> embrace it </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hell what was that what was that </joey>
<garnt> that's okay </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] steal brick and so i thought we </joey>
<garnt> can embrace american culture together </garnt>
<garnt> for trash taste okay so you boys can </garnt>
<garnt> open your eyes </garnt>
<connor> what the [ __ ] god </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> okay um so this is an airsoft gun </garnt>
<garnt> um but </garnt>
<garnt> i did not know that airsoft guns look </garnt>
<garnt> like this </garnt>
<garnt> this is </garnt>
<connor> a steel brick do you want to feel this </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> oh my god if if police come they're </connor>
<garnt> going to arrest us that </garnt>
<garnt> are we going to get demolished oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> so for obvious reasons i'm not going to </garnt>
<connor> put get out of the box yeah because this </connor>
<connor> looks way too realistic how much was </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> this was only 300 bucks </connor>
<garnt> i like this is this is making me wonder </garnt>
<garnt> what the airsoft community is like in </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> because this is </garnt>
<joey> well if a zombie apocalypse happens i </joey>
<connor> know who i'm going to </connor>
<connor> like this is the closest thing </connor>
<connor> oh okay </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah of course of course of </garnt>
<connor> course uh this is not going out of the </connor>
<connor> box uh just in case anyone ever thinks </connor>
<joey> that this is anything but an airsoft gun </joey>
<joey> but uh youtube this is an airsoft gun </joey>
<joey> don't worry about it i think we might </joey>
<joey> have to blur it for you we'll probably </joey>
<joey> have to blur for youtube patrons </joey>
<joey> there you go enjoy uh </joey>
<garnt> enjoy that and so yeah this is uh so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was like you know what </garnt>
<garnt> americans love gun so let's just buy a </garnt>
<garnt> gun </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> americans what do you think how </garnt>
<joey> realistic does this video because yeah </joey>
<joey> could you have sounded more like a </joey>
<connor> neanderthal america love gun america </connor>
<connor> but if you [ __ ] bought this </connor>
<connor> i can't believe god you didn't realize </connor>
<joey> the whole point of this </joey>
<connor> challenge was the five figures for the </connor>
<garnt> background of our set no i wanted to buy </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] to see your reaction i thought that </garnt>
<garnt> was the whole point of the thing of the </garnt>
<joey> challenge </joey>
<joey> i wanted to get a good reaction out of </joey>
<connor> it oh you got a reaction where do we put </connor>
<connor> this i don't know </connor>
<joey> about the other figures but actually </joey>
<joey> where do we put this we can put this how </joey>
<connor> do we get rid of this without someone </connor>
<connor> calling the police </connor>
<connor> we can figure that out later yeah let's </connor>
<connor> figure that out later </connor>
<joey> change to me </joey>
<connor> hello we've had a time skip no [ __ ] if </connor>
<joey> you couldn't notice uh i lost all my </joey>
<joey> hair from thinking so hard </joey>
<garnt> so we are recorded the previous </garnt>
<garnt> recording for so long that we actually </garnt>
<garnt> ran out of time uh so we couldn't record </garnt>
<garnt> the outro and uh we thought you know we </garnt>
<garnt> thought about having some continuity </garnt>
<garnt> yeah then joey got his haircut so we </garnt>
<joey> were just like yeah i didn't i didn't </joey>
<connor> quite think about that </connor>
<joey> i'm not a team player here </joey>
<joey> so yeah i guess uh we wanted to i think </joey>
<joey> the last thing we wanted to do was to </joey>
<joey> tally up all the points right of all of </joey>
<joey> the challenges that we were doing yes </joey>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> also do a forfeit as well unfortunately </garnt>
<joey> uh because we recorded for so long i </joey>
<joey> mean i think the recording's like three </joey>
<joey> hours long now or something like that </joey>
<joey> it's a very long episode yeah so </joey>
<joey> yeah so we rather think about it and we </joey>
<joey> thought that it would be better if we </joey>
<connor> tallied up the points on stream and </connor>
<connor> we're not just going to do that there </connor>
<connor> are a few points that are under </connor>
<connor> contention like for example uh is still </connor>
<connor> angry two weeks later </connor>
<connor> is uh is the character that joey bought </connor>
<garnt> can can he beat goku is it even goku in </garnt>
<garnt> the first place you know how many </garnt>
<garnt> characters in a mogus </garnt>
<connor> that was a real contagion they are the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] same i'm sure you guys will </connor>
<garnt> agree with me live on the 21st yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so what we're going to do is we're going </garnt>
<garnt> to do something similar to what we did </garnt>
<garnt> for our trash chase awards uh we're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna have a bunch of categories some of </garnt>
<garnt> them which we argued on this podcast and </garnt>
<garnt> some of them are entirely new categories </garnt>
<garnt> like who do you guys think bought the </garnt>
<garnt> best figure and who do you guys think </garnt>
<garnt> bought the worst figure and other things </garnt>
<garnt> that we can think of that are going to </garnt>
<garnt> contribute to the final score for what </garnt>
<garnt> we have and then we will be doing our </garnt>
<garnt> forfeit </garnt>
<garnt> it's live on stream </garnt>
<garnt> live on stream live on stream and well </garnt>
<joey> and i guess like as well we'll also be </joey>
<garnt> able to like show you guys some of the </garnt>
<connor> figures that we couldn't really like </connor>
<connor> delve upon too much in the episode </connor>
<connor> otherwise this would have been like a </connor>
<connor> five hour episode so any things we </connor>
<connor> missed during this episode you'll be </connor>
