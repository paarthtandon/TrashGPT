<joey> - So my son's left cookies and milk, </joey>
<joey> on his bedside table. </joey>
<joey> How do I tell him that Santa is lactose intolerant? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - So do I just drink the milk </joey>
<joey> and take the shits for my son? </joey>
<joey> - Well... - Do I leave it there </joey>
<joey> and break his heart? </joey>
<connor> - I remember one time my dad was like, </connor>
<connor> "No no, no Connor, Santa likes beer." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) (upbeat music) </connor>

<connor> - This is a Christmas special. </connor>
<joey> - This is our Christmas special that we are not recording. </joey>
<connor> - You wrapped it up and everything. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit. </connor>

<connor> - Yeah, sure. - What the fuck man. </connor>
<connor> - I wrapped it up. </connor>
<connor> - By the way, Merry Christmas, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think this should be airing on Boxing Day, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do Americans have Boxing Day? </connor>
<garnt> Meilyne, do Americans have Boxing Day? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] What do you mean Boxing? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, no they don't have boxing day. </joey>
<joey> - Boxing day is the day after Christmas Day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] It's not anime so I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, that's true. (thuds) </connor>
<connor> So they maybe riding on the on the thing, </connor>
<joey> - [Both] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So, the box is fine, so you can open it up. </joey>
<garnt> - [Both] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they maybe writing on the thing in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> Joey, ignore it don't read it, just. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, I wanna look at the box. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so you can, just open the box now </connor>
<connor> but when inside, I think they'll be a label on it. </connor>
<garnt> Just don't read the label, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - Garnt it might be in kanji. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you should... - Okay, well, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't read anyway. </garnt>
<connor> - Just rip it open. - So I'm all good. </connor>
<connor> (Joey shrieking) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, to explain what Boxing Day is, </connor>
<connor> isn't Boxing Day, </connor>
<connor> the actual day you're meant to open your presents? </connor>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<garnt> - Isn't that why it's called Boxing Day? </garnt>
<connor> - Is that what it is called? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that's why it's called Boxing Day. </garnt>
<connor> - It was just the day you ate all the leftovers. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I was told Boxing Day was like an event, </connor>
<joey> where everyone boxes it out. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it's a little music box. </garnt>
<garnt> - So don't open yours yet, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't, you might wanna play it up to the microphone. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. - Everyone needs to be silent. </connor>
<garnt> (music box winding) </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me play this. - Guess the song. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, guess the song. </connor>
<connor> (bell chiming) </connor>
<garnt> - Is this your name? (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. Oh my god, thank you so much. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor chuckling) Where did you get this? </connor>
<garnt> - I think I know exactly where he got this from. </garnt>
<joey> All right, I'm not gonna look at the look at the label. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, don't look at the labels Joey. </connor>
<connor> (music box winding) </connor>
<connor> I got Joey something too. </connor>
<joey> - All right, I have to wait for yours to shut up. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, let's night call Zenzenzense. </garnt>
<garnt> (bell chiming) (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that just stops it. </connor>
<connor> - Huh! - I think it just stops it. </connor>
<connor> (bell chiming) </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I can't hear it. </connor>
<connor> - I can hear it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, </joey>
<connor> (singing in foreign language) that one right. </connor>
<connor> Fucking, that's also your name, right? </connor>
<connor> - It's the same band, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's Radwimps. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's the ending, </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause Joey always sings this song in karaoke. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so it's a... </joey>
<connor> - I don't sing this one in karaoke. </connor>
<connor> - Do you know what I fucking did? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, I sing a fucking, </connor>
<joey> I sing Zenzenzense mostly. </joey>
<garnt> - Zenzenzense and the one from, Weathering with You. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Weathering with You. </joey>
<garnt> I like this song as well. </garnt>
<connor> - We have a bunch of musical boxes. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) - Yay. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know if you can hear in the background, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just going on now, </garnt>
<garnt> I shouldn't have winded it so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Boxing day is the day after Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] And you can (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, Boxing Day the day after Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Did you have boxing day in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we do. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's just so... </joey>
<connor> I don't know if the mic is picking that- </connor>
<connor> It is loud as fuck in this room right now. </connor>
<connor> I think I know exactly what you got in this box. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I bought one as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, did you? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I like Ghibli ones as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause your anime songs, and I was like, </joey>
<connor> I should buy anime songs for the boys. </connor>
<joey> - I got one actually which was like a Vulpix from Pokemon. </joey>
<connor> - I saw that. - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that one's really cute. </joey>
<connor> - This is an awesome gift though. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah there you go.. </connor>
<connor> - I could easily give this to all my friends. </connor>
<connor> - You're welcome boys, thanks for my gift. </connor>
<joey> - Thank you very much. (Connor chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - I'll get you a present soon don't worry. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's not like we literally just decided </joey>
<garnt> this was the Christmas episode, the day of recording. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, we didn't know this was gonna </joey>
<connor> be the Christmas episode. </connor>
<connor> - I just thought I'd bring a gift, I'll be nice. </connor>
<connor> Wow it's really going on. </connor>
<connor> - It's just fucking going. </connor>
<connor> It just keeps going, doesn't it? </connor>
<garnt> - Meilyne, do you wanna have this for now? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, do you wanna hold on to this? </joey>
<connor> Just get it off screen. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Okay, I'll just put it outside. </connor>
<connor> - Put on my desk, - Yeah it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - Just put on my desk it should be fine. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but.. - It will turn off naturally, </connor>
<joey> don't turn it anymore. (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just leave it, just leave it. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Just let it sit on the desk it will be fine. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, but I know exactly where you got those from </joey>
<joey> because you took a trip, didn't you? </joey>
<connor> - I did, I went up to Hokkaido, but it's all good. </connor>
<garnt> You should chill a little vacation. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Just relaxing, it's nice. </connor>
<garnt> - Every YouTuber needs a vacation every now and again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and just eat all their food, food's amazing there. </garnt>
<joey> - I told you they've optimized the food, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's good, man, it's good. (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> It's as good as everyone says it is. </connor>
<connor> You should go. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Go if you get the chance. </connor>
<connor> - What are some like, specific dishes that you had up there, </connor>
<joey> that you would recommend to people who wanna go to Hokkaido? </joey>
<connor> - Anything with milk in it is just like the best. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Does it meet the hype? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I've heard so much about Hokkaido milk </connor>
<garnt> and what is so good about the milk there? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the breed of cow... </joey>
<connor> - I don't know it's rich, it's real rich. </connor>
<joey> - It's like full cream. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I had like a milk ice cream. </joey>
<connor> I don't normally like milk ice cream, </connor>
<connor> but it was just like, intense milk hit you. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (Connor sighing) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - I saw you posted a picture of beer ice cream as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's like... </connor>
<connor> - Just to prove that Japan does every flavor of self serve. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why you'd ever want beer ice cream. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, there was like ice cream, that was just beer </connor>
<connor> and I was like, I mean sure, I'll try it. </connor>
<joey> I like both these things individually. </joey>
<joey> - Even alcoholics will like that one. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Yeah this will be good. </garnt>
<connor> - It tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> - I can't imagine a beer flavored anything aside from beer, </connor>
<joey> and it tastes... </joey>
<connor> - It's just like a musky ice cream. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the weirdest flavor ice cream you've had? </connor>
<connor> - Rum ray, am joking. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - How dare you? Probably the beer right? </connor>
<connor> - Probably the beer right. </connor>
<connor> I've normally, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I've had fish ice cream before. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, - What, where, Japan? </connor>
<garnt> - In Japan. - Oh, that sounds disgusting. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it was like a salmon ice cream. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt exclaiming) Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They do that shit here with food. </connor>
<garnt> They're like, I don't care about the boundaries. </garnt>
<connor> I like both these things let's make it into food. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like the equivalent of fucking, </garnt>
<connor> what some Americans do, </connor>
<connor> which is like buying of McFlurry </connor>
<connor> and then just dipping it with fries. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, but I... - Which just blows my mind. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, but actually I kind of like that. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no. - No, no. </connor>
<joey> - Why? - What? </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I went to, fucking Oki took me to a Steak n Shake once, </joey>
<connor> which is where like, the optimal place of where you do that. </connor>
<joey> And I just saw like six Americans dipping their fries </joey>
<joey> into the shakes, I'm just like, I can't. </joey>
<joey> I can't be here, I have to leave. </joey>
<garnt> - We're living in a first world country dude. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) Why are you eating like this? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, like, I don't do it often </connor>
<connor> but it tasted pretty good when I've done it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't get it, it's like a nice, </joey>
<joey> it's the synergy of the saltiness of the fries </joey>
<connor> and the sweetness of the shakes, I'm like no. </connor>
<connor> - I don't understand why it works, it just does, right? </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't though. </joey>
<joey> - Also Steak n Shakes, </joey>
<joey> there the most depressing place in America. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> I went to one at midnight, 'cause I was like, yeah... </connor>
<joey> - Maybe because you went at midnight. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - There was $1.50 burgers. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I was just like, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, you've never been to a White Castle before. </joey>
<joey> That's true depression. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay... </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never been to a White Castle before. </garnt>
<garnt> Does it meet the hype? </garnt>
<joey> - White Castle, the hype of what? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I only know White Castle because of that one movie, </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - What's it? Harold and Kumar or something like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. - And... </garnt>
<garnt> - So, White Castle doesn't sell burgers, they sell sliders. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, so it's like the tiny buggers. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the difference between a burger and a slider. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a mini burger, right? </joey>
<joey> - A slider is just like a mini burger, apparently. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know where it comes from. </garnt>
<connor> But basically they sell sliders instead of burgers. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But like normally, right, like when you buy a slider, </connor>
<connor> you go to some American restaurants. </connor>
<connor> And I like meat, like my chicken Parmesan sliders, </connor>
<connor> that shit's bomb... </connor>
<connor> - They don't say it like that, </connor>
<connor> - What? (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Parmesan, </connor>
<joey> - Parmesan sliders. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, what do you say? </joey>
<connor> - It's the way you added that- </connor>
<connor> - Chicken Parmesan sliders. - Parmesan. </connor>
<garnt> - Parmesan. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just call it Parmesan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Parmesan? - Parmesan yeah, Parmesan. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh dude, </connor>
<connor> that hurts me hearing that. - British man's language. </connor>
<connor> Alright go ahead then. </connor>
<connor> - Anyway, that chicken, </connor>
<connor> my favorites are chicken Parmesan sliders right. </connor>
<connor> So it's like the chicken Parmesan, </connor>
<connor> then you put like some lettuce in it. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking nice, </connor>
<connor> but White Castle slider is literally just two soggy buns, </connor>
<connor> and the thinnest patty in existence. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - It's like paper thin patties. </connor>
<connor> - It's pathetic. - Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - So you can get like a six pack of... </connor>
<connor> - Six pack of sliders. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like a six, </connor>
<connor> they box it like a six pack of sliders for $4 or something, </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "This is true depression." </joey>
<connor> - All I know is that everyone I know who goes there, </connor>
<connor> has like the shits afterwards. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is like... </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> to me that's like, </connor>
<connor> how on earth we've got to the point </connor>
<connor> where that's just an acceptable outcome. </connor>
<joey> - How is it that Americans have gauged </joey>
<joey> the tastiness of a fast food joint, </joey>
<connor> by how much this stomach is just destroyed the next day? </connor>
<connor> - You know what... </connor>
<connor> - People are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah it's not a good chili's meal, </connor>
<joey> unless I'm shitting myself constantly the next day." </joey>
<garnt> - But I feel the same with Indian though. </garnt>
<connor> I have to destroy the toilets. </connor>
<connor> - Sure. - After I eat Indian, </connor>
<connor> so I can kind of get it, but at the same time, </connor>
<garnt> I can only do it, like at most once every few weeks. </garnt>
<connor> - But like a burger shouldn't do that. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) A burger shouldn't... </joey>
<joey> like Indian, I've always accepted the Indian does that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because of the spices right? </joey>
<joey> - It's all the spices, </joey>
<garnt> but it's just like bread and meat, </garnt>
<garnt> what is happening? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What went wrong? </garnt>
<joey> - It's the oil. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, you know, </joey>
<connor> also the most egregious thing that I hear they do, </connor>
<connor> is that they put the grease on top of the burgers. </connor>
<connor> That's disgusting. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Who did this? And who likes it? </connor>
<connor> Because I remember I went to Steak n Shake, </connor>
<connor> and they did this to my burger, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, I don't want this anymore. </connor>
<connor> Why would you do this?" - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "It's like you took the worst part of the meat, </connor>
<connor> which is the part that makes you feel sick." </connor>
<connor> - Have you... </connor>
<garnt> - "And you put it on top, why?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember when I was staying at Sydney's </garnt>
<garnt> family's house in Wisconsin. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And they got a takeaway pizza joint one day. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And one of the big selling points </garnt>
<garnt> of this takeaway pizza joint, is they had garlic bread. </garnt>
<garnt> And the selling point, was that if you put a wet paper towel </garnt>
<garnt> on the garlic bread, </garnt>
<garnt> it would literally soak it in oil. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And they were hyping this up to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yo, if you put that, if there's so much oil on this." </garnt>
<garnt> That if you put the wet paper towel, it will soak it, </garnt>
<garnt> and it will become completely wet. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just thinking, "How is this a selling point? </garnt>
<garnt> Why would I want to eat this?" </garnt>
<joey> - It's like that Simpsons episode, </joey>
<connor> when Homer is trying to get so fat </connor>
<connor> that he gets the disability like being, </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And Dr Nick's like, </connor>
<connor> "Grab the burger, </connor>
<joey> rub it against the piece of paper' (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> and then go, see through, you can eat it." </joey>
<garnt> - I thought it was like a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought it was satire, - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But no, they literally, </garnt>
<connor> like market it there, as this garlic bread is so oily, </connor>
<connor> that you can literally soak up </connor>
<connor> an entire paper towel, - That's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - And I just think about it and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I hold it in my hands and it was literally dripping </connor>
<garnt> and I took one bite, - That's.. </garnt>
<garnt> - And one bite was enough for me. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like the pure survival food </connor>
<connor> 'cause the sheer amount of oil, could power a lamp, </connor>
<joey> for like decades. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever heard of this American burger joint </joey>
<connor> called the Heart Attack Grill? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The fucking... I was watching a video yesterday, </connor>
<connor> of this guy who ate the the biggest one there </connor>
<connor> which is called the quadruple bypass burger, </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it's literally think of a Big Mac, </connor>
<connor> but stack six big macs on top, - Yeah, I've seen it, </connor>
<garnt> it's ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was like, I already thought that, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like 20,000 calories as well. </garnt>
<garnt> This guy demolishes it in five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how the fuck he did it. </garnt>
<garnt> But the part that got me was, he was like alright, </garnt>
<joey> we're getting to the bun now, the bun by the way, </joey>
<joey> is soaked in lard. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, - [Garnt] Oh, disgusting. </joey>
<connor> - "You shouldn't..." </connor>
<connor> - That's so veil. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> "A piece of bread should not be soaked in anything." </joey>
<garnt> - Nothing should be soaked in pure fucking fat. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, also the fries were oiled in pure lard as well. </joey>
<connor> - That's disgusting. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> I just... </joey>
<joey> - And you get a shake on top of that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand the appeal of that. </connor>
<connor> That's just ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> - It just sounds gross. It looked gross. </joey>
<joey> It looked like something out of the alien movies </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, why.. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't wanna put that in my stomach. </joey>
<connor> - Why do people hate their bodies? </connor>
<garnt> Like... (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's only like some, let's say cuisines </garnt>
<garnt> you can only enjoy when you want to destroy your body. </garnt>
<connor> And that's probably, </connor>
<connor> like at 3:00am, - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - After like... </connor>
<connor> - After five guys. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - After five guys or like, </connor>
<connor> I can never eat a kebab sober, </connor>
<connor> like something has got... (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> something has gone wrong with me. </connor>
<connor> Like something has gone wrong with my life. </connor>
<garnt> If I'm eating a kebab, and I'm completely sober. </garnt>
<joey> - You know I'm hella depressed, </joey>
<garnt> when I'm eating a kebab for lunch. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I love a great burger with a bit of grease on it </connor>
<connor> a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Just a little bit. </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> But there's a clear line, that no even drunk me would pass. </connor>
<connor> And the Heart Attack Grill to me is just like, </connor>
<joey> there is no reason why I would wanna come here, </joey>
<joey> other than to feel healthy. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Like and just look and be like damn. </joey>
<joey> - Because any meal you have after, </joey>
<joey> going to the Heart Attack Grill. </joey>
<joey> You'll be like damn, - But also you just stay there </joey>
<connor> you see the other patreons and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'm doing pretty good for myself." </connor>
<connor> "Hey, like damn, okay. Maybe I am in shape." </connor>
<joey> - Because I think the selling point </joey>
<joey> of the Heart Attack Grill is that, first of all, </joey>
<joey> like, when you walk in, </joey>
<joey> they put on like a hospital gown on you. </joey>
<joey> And they sit you in a wheelchair, to wheel you in. </joey>
<joey> And here's the kicker, if you weigh over 300 pounds, </joey>
<joey> you get the meal for free. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like it should be the opposite. </connor>
<connor> You should be like, it's like taxing the rich right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> If you're already fat, you should be charging at least, </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) [Both] Double. </joey>
<connor> - To force you to maintain, this egregious weight. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like the concept of Heart Attack Grill, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just kind of like, if you you hear it </garnt>
<connor> and you're like, this is like fiction, right? </connor>
<joey> This is from like some dystopian society. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this is from like some George Orwell. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So this is how they fatten you up, before they dispose you. </joey>
<connor> - You know when we watch this like 500 pounds life videos. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, 600 pounds life </joey>
<connor> - That one whatever, you watch it, </connor>
<connor> and you realize that most of these people just have trauma. </connor>
<connor> Like at what point do we start like... </connor>
<connor> Okay, maybe it's not trauma, </connor>
<connor> if he's walking into the Heart Attack Grill. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Maybe that's on him. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt chuckling) You know what I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think that there's going beyond a point of comfort food </connor>
<connor> and there's gonna be like, this is just his fault. </connor>
<connor> Because this shows, </connor>
<connor> these videos with these 600 pound people, </connor>
<connor> do you really fucking good job </connor>
<connor> at making you feel sorry for them and be like, </connor>
<joey> "Yo' man, okay yeah, like his parent died at five. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Yeah, eating disorder. </joey>
<joey> - For some reason, at the age of five, </joey>
<connor> his mama is taking him to the Heart attack Grill, </connor>
<connor> and that's the only way that she can remember him. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I get it." (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> "I sympathize with you, but should you?" </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, what if my parents were like, </connor>
<connor> It's all have had since the age of 10." </connor>
<connor> would I be doing crack </connor>
<connor> would I be doing crack, but it's just comfort. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) - It's comfort food. </connor>
<connor> - To me, it's like, there's a clear limit, </connor>
<connor> to the point where you're gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> alright, well, maybe I should stop feeling sorry for you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's just... </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I never watch those shows that like feel sorry. </joey>
<connor> - Well 'cause I've noticed I watched them </connor>
<connor> and they do a really good job making you think </connor>
<joey> damn, like I guess, </joey>
<connor> that could be me. - Yeah they set up, </connor>
<garnt> that's the thing, they set it up as a sob story. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - But what you're seeing </garnt>
<garnt> and what you're hearing is </garnt>
<garnt> the complete opposite. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Two different things. </connor>
<joey> - Two entirely different things. </joey>
<joey> - Well I think, as so many wished, a little chubbier, </joey>
<connor> not knowing in that level. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Like I get it, I get how you can gain weight. </connor>
<connor> But there's like a limit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Of where I think, that it would go beyond anything. </connor>
<connor> - Like some of these that, you dint like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know like fucking 15 hotdogs in the morning </connor>
<joey> with cheese and chili on it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think I would draw the line, </joey>
<connor> I think I can't (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Right yeah, but that's the thing... </connor>
<connor> The thing that surprises me more </connor>
<connor> is not the fact that there's, </connor>
<connor> like complaining about having all this weight problems </connor>
<connor> and then they proceed to eat a whole fucking box of chilies </connor>
<connor> right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also just the egregious amount </connor>
<joey> of food that they can somehow stomach. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, it just looking at it makes my stomach hurt. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just doesn't make sense to me </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like you must have like, just grown up with this </garnt>
<garnt> and because, every time I go to America, </garnt>
<garnt> I always like the food portions in there. </garnt>
<joey> We've talked about this before, are massive then. </joey>
<joey> I'm forced to have to, have these massive food portions </joey>
<joey> and like the first week, fucking great. </joey>
<joey> After a week of staying in America. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna go home. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, is that salad? </connor>
<connor> And I ask for the salad, </connor>
<joey> and what comes out is a fucking forest. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> This aint a fucking salad. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like six heads of lettuce. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - The amount of dressing is like the same as the meal, </garnt>
<garnt> its like 1600 calories. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, what of like a fucking rabbit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like did you deforest the entire Amazon rainforest </garnt>
<connor> just to put on my plate like this. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> This is the kind of like free portions </garnt>
<connor> we're talking about here. </connor>
<connor> - This sucks man, 'cause it's such, it's so unfair. </connor>
<connor> Because if you get fat in Japan, I feel like that's on you. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But if you get fat in America, it's like, </joey>
<joey> everything was set up against you. </joey>
<joey> - Welcome to the system. </joey>
<joey> - Everything was set up to make you fat. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So it's like how the fuck, it's not fair, which is why... </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like my diet in America is awful, </garnt>
<connor> obviously 'cause of the food there. </connor>
<connor> - I keep saying whenever I go there. </connor>
<connor> - But also, I get to the point </connor>
<connor> where I want to have something, </connor>
<joey> but something not greasy, </joey>
<joey> and especially like in the Midwest, where it's like, </joey>
<joey> the countryside, there's a lot less choice </joey>
<joey> and a lot less healthy choices as well. </joey>
<connor> So, you're kind of forced to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, you can have, to cook for yourself." </connor>
<connor> And if you can't cook for yourself </connor>
<connor> then you're pretty much fucked. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah. - And that's why, </connor>
<connor> its so much harder to eat healthy over there </connor>
<garnt> than is, say like in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - But even then in America, I remember I went to the... </connor>
<connor> to Walmart, and I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> lets get some healthy foods, </connor>
<connor> And it was really hard to find the actual stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> The actual healthy stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then I go to the next aisle, there's a whole aisle, </connor>
<connor> this blew my mind, of hotdogs, </connor>
<connor> a whole aisle of hotdogs, not sausages, hotdogs. </connor>
<connor> And I was like this is insane, </connor>
<connor> I thought there was only one type of hotdog. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize that hotdogs, </connor>
<connor> were any different from each other, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they all taste the same. </connor>
<connor> Hotdogs never taste any different. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do you ever notice, </connor>
<connor> when you go to your friend's barbecue, whatever, </connor>
<connor> and they give you a hotdog, </connor>
<connor> have you ever been like wow, </connor>
<connor> this tastes different from my hot dog? </connor>
<connor> - No. - No it's always like, </connor>
<connor> I put mustard on that, </connor>
<joey> but that's how you differentiate it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They all taste the fucking same. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's all the different brands. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and somehow they had like 10 rows </connor>
<connor> on a whole aisle of hotdogs. </connor>
<connor> I was blown away, I was like this is insane. </connor>
<connor> - I think like there is difference, </connor>
<connor> in sometimes it's filled with cheese </connor>
<connor> and sometimes... </connor>
<connor> - That's vile. Don't do that. </connor>
<connor> I don't want- - Really? </connor>
<joey> No I like that. - No, no because... </joey>
<garnt> - No, because this is American cheese we're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's a real cheese. </garnt>
<connor> If it was filled with actual like real cheese, </connor>
<joey> then yeah, I'd be a little open to it. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm pissed off they've managed </connor>
<joey> to infiltrate Japan somehow, </joey>
<joey> 'cause whenever you get anything </joey>
<joey> with cheese on top of it here, </joey>
<garnt> its such a gamble, whether its American, like fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> - Plastic cheese, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Fucking Americans. </connor>
<garnt> - See this is the advantage of not putting </garnt>
<connor> condiments and everything. </connor>
<connor> I can actually- </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off </connor>
<connor> - Taste the fucking difference </connor>
<connor> between a normal hot dog and the cheese hot dog </connor>
<joey> and like... </joey>
<joey> - Because that's an important life skill, isn't it? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, I know I can't differentiate </garnt>
<joey> between 10 different brands of hot dogs. </joey>
<garnt> - Because otherwise that's life, </garnt>
<garnt> you just put condiments on it all the time, </garnt>
<joey> then it just tastes like the condiments, right. </joey>
<joey> You don't get to taste the softies and the difference. </joey>
<garnt> - Again its this energy. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you think we are fucking </garnt>
<garnt> drowning out hotdogs and sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, it looks kind of looks like a lot of the times. </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - If I gave you five brands of generic hotdogs, </connor>
<connor> would you be able to tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between any of them? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I wouldn't be able to. </connor>
<joey> - I mean. - That just sounds like, </joey>
<connor> a Trash Taste special. (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not that big of a fan of hotdogs, but I mean I can... </garnt>
<joey> - What is like a food like, </joey>
<joey> if we gave you different types of it, </joey>
<joey> that you'd be able to differentiate? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt exclaiming) </joey>
<joey> - [Myelin] Not tap water. </joey>
<garnt> - Not tap water. - Tap water. </garnt>
<joey> - I can differentiate between tap water </joey>
<connor> and normal water, but not like say. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone can. </connor>
<connor> - Not say like Voss water. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand Voss water. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is Voss water? </connor>
<connor> - Have you never heard had of Voss water? </connor>
<connor> - No. - It's like the.. </connor>
<connor> really, really posh water that comes in a glass bottle. </connor>
<joey> You can see it on screen now, </joey>
<joey> and it's only at like- - It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - Really high class hotels. </joey>
<joey> - And I've sampled one before, </joey>
<joey> I remember 'cause it was like, </joey>
<garnt> I was really, really thirsty </garnt>
<garnt> and it was the only water available, </garnt>
<garnt> and it just taste like water. </garnt>
<connor> - There is no difference between the bottled water brands </connor>
<connor> I'm convinced, and when you watch how they, </connor>
<connor> half of it comes from the same fucking place, </connor>
<connor> which is just the normal taps, </connor>
<connor> that all the people are using in the area. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, dude you know what's the one type of person </joey>
<connor> that I'll never be friends with? </connor>
<connor> When someone will take a sip of water </connor>
<connor> and being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, this is hard water, can I get some soft water please?" </connor>
<joey> People like that... I know people like that in California, </joey>
<connor> - I knew someone who could only drink a brand of, </connor>
<joey> I can't remember which brand. </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Evian. </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Literally refused to use any other water, </connor>
<connor> and if they used bottled water, like in like cup noodles, </connor>
<connor> had to be bottled Evian. </connor>
<garnt> Can you believe this. (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't know man, I don't like tap water. </garnt>
<connor> - Whatever. </connor>
<connor> - I have gone through a phase where... </connor>
<connor> - I have got one million views on YouTube </connor>
<garnt> and then this is what happens, </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> he's like 'Only Evian on me'. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckling) </connor>
<joey> - Well I mean because is tap water drinkable in the UK? </joey>
<garnt> - [Both] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's drinkable in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. - Where I live, </garnt>
<garnt> I've grown up where every where in my life </garnt>
<garnt> tap water is sucked. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I've heard about this mythical good tap water </garnt>
<garnt> that people talk about some of the times, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor is one of those people. </garnt>
<joey> - Come to Australia bro, we have great top water. </joey>
<joey> - I've always had like, shitty tap water, </joey>
<joey> - It depends, 'cause if you get it from a quality </joey>
<connor> that's like- </connor>
<connor> - Like this, to me this clearly tastes like tap water, </connor>
<connor> 'cause if I can taste the sink in tap water, </connor>
<connor> its like inferior water fro me, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna taste something metallic. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna... sometimes I get the hard water thing, </connor>
<connor> 'cause sometimes I drink tap water and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I feel even more dehydrated- </connor>
<connor> - I'd like a little picture. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Than when when I first drank this water. </connor>

<connor> Now presently gentlemen, </connor>
<garnt> my favorite thing about Raid Shadow Legends. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Both] Raid. </garnt>
<connor> - Raid, is that it plays itself, </connor>

<connor> you can just let the game play it. </connor>

<connor> at the tavern gentlemen? </connor>

<connor> click that link in the description down below </connor>
<connor> or as I like to say raid that link in the description </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'll see you gamers inside. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you, </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you, to Raid for sponsoring this video. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the best time to judge </garnt>
<garnt> how good water is, is when you're hung over. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause when I'm hung over, </garnt>
<garnt> there are definitely different levels, </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> I feel different levels of hydration when I'm hangover. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I need, when you're feeling like shits </garnt>
<garnt> and you want to feel re hydration again </garnt>
<garnt> that's when like, </garnt>
<garnt> I will stick by the bottled water every time over tap water. </garnt>
<connor> I mean I will take tap water... </connor>
<connor> - Dude, I just drink a liter of whatever is near me. </connor>
<joey> - Oh dude, if I'm like, depending on how hungover I am, </joey>
<connor> I'll fucking drink a liter of toilet water, </connor>
<connor> anything to just get something like fucking fluid in me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know that's what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor chuckling) </connor>
<joey> It's like... </joey>
<connor> - You have ever like (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I have seen a Japanese YouTuber do that before. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, well it go didn't go out well though. </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe it's because, </connor>
<connor> at least in Sydney bottled water is almost </connor>
<connor> non existent in Sydney. </connor>
<connor> Because legitimately the tap water is just </connor>
<connor> as good as the ball water. </connor>
<connor> - And also bottled water in Australia is fucking expensive. </connor>
<joey> It's like, a bottle like that big is like $4. </joey>
<connor> - I only buy bottled water because I'm out </connor>
<connor> and I can't just find a tap to drink. </connor>
<joey> (Connor chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah no here, </connor>
<connor> because bottled water is cheap, </connor>
<connor> but t's like 100 yen, </connor>
<connor> so that it's a little bit more affordable. </connor>
<joey> But in Australia, if someone was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the Woolies </joey>
<connor> - What about water fountains? </connor>
<garnt> Do you drink from water fountains? </garnt>
<garnt> - I drink from water fountains </garnt>
<joey> when I am desperate enough. </joey>
<joey> - It depends where. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it depends on where. </joey>
<joey> - And how clean or dirty that water fountain is. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like a lot of this has come up from my upbringing </joey>
<connor> cause in Thailand, you can't drink tap water. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - So I've just gotten used to </connor>
<joey> like always buying bottled water. </joey>
<joey> - That makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, that makes sense. </joey>
<connor> - I do genuinely think the taste of tap water </connor>
<connor> tastes like shit where I am. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - I can taste the chalk where I... </connor>
<connor> - No in Brighton. - All right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It taste really metallic </connor>
<garnt> I am not a fan of the metallic taste. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean it was nice in Wales, </connor>
<garnt> and here I felt it... </garnt>
<garnt> - But in London is fucking salty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, London I don't know, </garnt>
<connor> but then in London you're getting that like cholera shit. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't trust the water in London </connor>
<connor> I mean Wales is nice, the quarry was right next to me. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like because, I don't know how it is </garnt>
<garnt> but everywhere I've been to where it's like a big city. </garnt>
<connor> Normally I don't... tap water tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> - Countryside is. </connor>
<connor> - Like if okay, </connor>
<connor> - Like if you're in a hotel, </connor>
<connor> - And you're already thirsty, </connor>
<connor> do you go for the bathroom water? </connor>
<garnt> Or do you go for the fridge minibar water? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where you pay for it? No fucking way, </connor>
<connor> am I paying for that water. </connor>
<connor> - No, no I'm not paying that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause that's- - He fucking did. </connor>
<connor> The hotel bathroom water is like the worst. </connor>
<connor> - No dude, - That's where I draw </connor>
<garnt> - No dude, I'm never... </garnt>
<joey> - I am never paying for water in a hotel, </joey>
<connor> - No. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> - That's ridiculous, </joey>
<connor> - That's ridiculous, it's like... </connor>
<connor> - I feel like a hotel is the one place </connor>
<connor> that should not be allowed to charge for water. </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Am literally paying. - Like you're already, </joey>
<joey> - Like you're already charging the (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - I'm paying for a basic necessity, </joey>
<joey> which is just like being some where, </joey>
<joey> and you're gonna charge me for water? </joey>
<joey> Fuck off. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - No way. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, for me, I genuinely can't taste </joey>
<joey> the fucking difference anyway, so if I'm like... </joey>
<connor> - Shout out to hotels that give out bottled water for free. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, shout out that you are the G's. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - So I don't have to fucking go through all the voss water. </garnt>
<connor> - And not like just one bottle they give you like four </connor>
<joey> and they're like go ham man. </joey>
<joey> We refill them all every day. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And the best is when you come back from a day out </joey>
<joey> and the bottles are like back, as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's the good shit. </joey>
<garnt> - On the topic of food, </garnt>
<garnt> so with it being Christmas right now, </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone just had their Christmas meals </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Mm-hmm. </garnt>
<connor> - What are your preferences, in your Christmas meals? </connor>
<connor> Because, I'll be honest, </connor>
<connor> so last year, we all celebrated Christmas together </connor>
<connor> and we had a hot pot. </connor>
<connor> - My mother traditionally left... </connor>
<connor> - It was it was a great fucking hot pot but, </connor>
<connor> I aint gonna lie, </connor>
<garnt> it just felt like something was missing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's not there's not the fucking turkey </connor>
<garnt> and whatever... </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, I will say this, </connor>
<connor> I think turkeys overrated as fuck, man. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand the hype behind turkey. </connor>
<joey> - I think turkey is just like an inferior chicken. </joey>
<garnt> - It is, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like imagine chicken but just drier with less taste, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just turkey. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't understand, why all the holidays... </garnt>
<joey> - You know what it is? </joey>
<joey> It's someone who just got a turkey </joey>
<joey> and just went into Photoshop and did this. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like everything is thinner, it's just bigger. </joey>
<connor> - I think if you have like a real nice turkey, </connor>
<connor> it's been like seasoned well you, </connor>
<garnt> it's, I think it could be better than chicken. </garnt>
<connor> - No, because like, the problem with turkey is that, </connor>
<connor> even if it's seasoned well, right? </connor>
<garnt> You get the outer part, that's nice and seasoned. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you get to the inner fucking drier... </garnt>
<connor> - That's why you gotta cook it, you gotta cut it, </connor>
<connor> in a way you get the skin and the bite in the same bite. </connor>
<joey> - But you can do that with chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but... </joey>
<joey> - And with less price. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I feel like you can make a turkey </joey>
<connor> like skin taste better than chicken. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, it depends. </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne agrees, and you know Meilyne. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but Meilyne's American. </joey>
<joey> do you like any other meats? </joey>
<connor> Cause sometimes my family used to do like duck or ham. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like roast pork. </connor>
<joey> - I think all generally pork is the best for Christmas. </joey>
<connor> - I think all generally, pork is the best for Christmas. </connor>
<joey> and chickens like the backup but I think... </joey>
<joey> - Really, I think a good fucking ham is just like, </joey>
<joey> you can't beat that shit. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Define what you mean by ham, </garnt>
<joey> do you mean like roast pork or like ham? </joey>
<joey> - You could do either, like... </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I don't really like ham, </garnt>
<garnt> like roast ham. </garnt>
<connor> - Does that guy like anything, </connor>
<connor> - I don't know like... </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong with you? (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - You sounded like, </connor>
<connor> kind of like a gammon steak. </connor>
<connor> Kind of like, - Yeah, it could be. </connor>
<connor> - Because I'm not a fan of gammon. </connor>
<joey> That's just like, the inferior part of bacon. </joey>
<garnt> - This man is not a fan of anything. </garnt>
<connor> - It is literally the opposite. </connor>
<connor> It is literally the more expensive bacon. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> That's literally what gammon is. </connor>
<joey> - I've never heard, </joey>
<joey> - I've never heard, what is a gammon? </joey>
<connor> like meatier cut of the pig. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - And it's normally more expensive than bacon, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause bacon is the cheapest part of the pig. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's shit and gammon's like the actual... </garnt>
<connor> I thank you very much. </connor>
<connor> - You been fucking brainwashed Garnt, </connor>
<connor> - How are you gonna argue with me, </connor>
<connor> that bacon is not the best part of the pig? </connor>
<joey> - It's the most overrated part of the pig. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - We never used to eat bacon. </garnt>
<connor> Bacon used to be like the shitty part. </connor>
<garnt> - I literally know vegetarians who have been converted </garnt>
<garnt> to meat eaters because of bacon. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think it's the meme, right. </connor>
<connor> Everyone says bacon is like the best food, right? </connor>
<garnt> - It's 'cause the smell of bacon, </garnt>
<garnt> - I just think bacon it's like, </garnt>
<connor> it's not that great like, it's just kind of tastes okay. </connor>
<connor> - Especially the American bacon. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck are you talking about? </joey>
<connor> - American bacon is... </connor>
<garnt> - American bacon is the best bacon. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, it's fucking awful. - Oh, fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - It's the best bacon. </connor>
<joey> - Fuck off, </joey>
<joey> - Fuck off, stop clapping Meilyne. </joey>
<garnt> - British back bacon, is like the worst bacon. </garnt>
<connor> - Its the best way to have bacon. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't love bacon period. </joey>
<joey> - Because right, normal bacon is like 50 to 70%, </joey>
<connor> It's more fat than.. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not saying it's healthy, but I'm saying it tastes </garnt>
<connor> Like fat inherently just tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> - No it, if it. </connor>
<connor> - The meat is the best part. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> There's a reason why it's more expensive. </connor>
<connor> - The one thing I don't like about bacon, </connor>
<connor> is that it is way too overpowering. </connor>
<connor> Especially when you put it with other things. </connor>
<connor> Like if you have like, </connor>
<connor> say like you put bacon on a burger for instance, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people love that shit, right? </connor>
<connor> But for me, when bacon is on a burger, </connor>
<connor> all I taste is the fucking bacon. </connor>
<connor> Like I'd rather just have.. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather just replace everything with bacon </connor>
<connor> and will taste the same. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the nice condiment that you need, </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the nice condiment that you need. </garnt>
<joey> - I like bacon on my burger, </joey>
<garnt> because I don't eat any ketchup or mayo </garnt>
<garnt> or fucking whatever on my burger, </garnt>
<garnt> I just... </garnt>
<connor> - So you don't know sauce or whatsoever on your burger? </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - You're a fucking clown Garnt. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<joey> I actually like, </joey>
<connor> - That's probably why he likes turkeys, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it's like the driest fucking burger </joey>
<connor> - This man's like water this, water that. </connor>
<connor> - I want my bacon to be all fat, </connor>
<joey> just give me the fucking fat, </joey>
<joey> - Give me the driest fucking burger </joey>
<joey> and non-tap water please that's... </joey>
<connor> - Streaky bacon is like far beyond the better bacon. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is streaky bacon? </connor>
<connor> - Streaky bacon is the American bacon. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. - So I didn't know how like, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause whenever I... </connor>
<connor> - So to Americans, British bacon is similar to Canadian, </connor>
<garnt> - What's the difference? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah to America, </garnt>
<garnt> - To America, British bacon is just like ham. </garnt>
<joey> - So British is more like 80-90% bacon, </joey>
<joey> and it's like 10% fat on the edge. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a thick (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - [Both] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like as a kid, </connor>
<connor> I would hate British bacon, </connor>
<connor> because I would just like eat the bacon parts first </connor>
<connor> because I would just like eat the bacon part first </connor>
<connor> cause that was the best tasty part, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that was the best tasty part, </connor>
<connor> You're actually disgusting, - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> cause it wasn't.. </connor>
<connor> - You would save fat and eat it. </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't he wasn't the fat part, </connor>
<connor> it was the fat with like the little piece of meat in there. </connor>
<connor> And then I realized that, </connor>
<garnt> American bacon is just all that. </garnt>
<garnt> So American bacon is just like the best part of the bacon. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause actually, </garnt>
<connor> - We actually had a podcast for you </connor>
<connor> and then you sit here and tell me you just wanna eat fat. </connor>
<joey> You just want fat. </joey>
<connor> And I'm supposed to give a fuck about your food opinions? </connor>
<connor> - And this man doesn't eat the crust on a pizza right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> It's like the fatty part of a bacon, </joey>
<joey> is literary the equivalent of how you've </joey>
<joey> labeled crust on a pizza. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's the fucking opposite, </garnt>
<garnt> because the crust in the pizza tastes like nothing </garnt>
<garnt> and the most tastiest part of the bacon, is the fatty part. </garnt>
<connor> That's why Americans have figured out, </connor>
<connor> the best tasting part of the bacon, </connor>
<connor> because they've just taken the streaky bacon, </connor>
<connor> which is the most tastiest part </connor>
<connor> and put it all in one. - You're beyond saving. </connor>
<joey> - We've lost this man, - You're beyond saving, </joey>
<connor> - We've lost this man. </connor>
<connor> - You're beyond saving, unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> - If it's just the bacon part, I've talked about this, </connor>
<connor> the bacon part, is just to me like pork, </connor>
<connor> is just vanilla beef. </connor>
<garnt> We've talked about this, (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> unlike the only part that's better, </garnt>
<garnt> is the fatty part of the pork. </garnt>
<garnt> Like pork belly, pork belly tastes fucking great </garnt>
<garnt> and that's mostly fat. </garnt>
<joey> You gotta.. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I admit, pork belly is fucking bomb, </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's 'cause.. - But that's because, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's also not a very like cheap pork. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Bacon isn't anything cheap. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Bacon is inherently cheap. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's an expensive part of the pork. </garnt>
<connor> - The fat is good. - It's because.. </connor>
<connor> of the fatty content, </connor>
<connor> of the fatty content, that's what gives it the flavor. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause pork by itself, </connor>
<garnt> - (indistinct) with more meat added. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you get chunks where you get a bit like half meat </garnt>
<garnt> But, that's like an actual like richness to it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's chunky. </garnt>
<joey> - I just don't fuck with the taste of bacon. </joey>
<connor> - And normally, pork belly is not like on its own, </connor>
<joey> it's normally included with other things. </joey>
<connor> - It's like in a broth or something. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas like bacon, </connor>
<connor> it's like you can have it with other things, </connor>
<connor> but again, it just overpowers everything. </connor>
<connor> - No one makes a fucking broth out of bacon, </connor>
<connor> like that's just disgusting, 'cause it's shit. </connor>
<joey> excuse me. (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - Someone scrap that out please. </garnt>
<garnt> - When we spoke about the food episode, </garnt>
<garnt> we got really heated. </garnt>
<connor> Like a day or two after Joey was like, you know what Connor? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, no, I thought about it, </joey>
<connor> - See. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause in the food episode as I agreed with Garnt </connor>
<connor> it's better than pork. </connor>
<connor> But then I thought I'm like no wait. </connor>
<joey> - Ton katsu, cuts it on, </joey>
<joey> - Tonkatsu, katsuzen that's all pork. </joey>
<connor> it's so shit. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe you can make a burger, It's literally so limited, </connor>
<connor> that normally has meat, is normally, pork block, </connor>
<connor> to the other side of the fence here </connor>
<connor> and say pork, yeah. - Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I can't believe. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that you... - 'Cause pork. </connor>
<connor> that you like streaky bacon over like actual meat, </connor>
<connor> just says the reason why you can't appreciate good meat. </connor>
<connor> - For me pork just tastes... </connor>
<connor> - I rest my case your honor. - Pork, </connor>
<connor> - I rest my case your honor. </connor>
<connor> - Pork, just tastes like well done beef. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God! Are you insane. (shrieking) </connor>
<connor> - As we all know, nobody fucking likes well done beef. </connor>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - No Garnt, I'm getting a call right now, </garnt>
<garnt> it's from the circus, </garnt>
<connor> it's from the circus, </connor>
<connor> they want to they want to know your address, bro. </connor>
<connor> Like what the fuck what? </connor>
<joey> you're the entire circus. </joey>
<connor> - It tastes nothing like beef. </connor>
<connor> - It tastes nothing like beef. What are you on about? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the good, the fucking best part of beef, </garnt>
<garnt> is like the moisture, and like, it's... </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> oh duck is just a fatty chicken, </connor>
<connor> that's all it is, man. (Connor chuckling) </connor>
<joey> It's like it's the same thing right? </joey>
<connor> It's the same thing right? </connor>
<connor> That's, they're not even remotely similar in taste. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I've never ever... </connor>
<joey> - Every chef who is watching this episode, </joey>
<joey> - Every chef who is watching this episode, </joey>
<joey> just had a stroke. </joey>
<connor> There's just like... </connor>
<connor> pretty realizes what a fucking clown you are Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) - No, no. </connor>
<connor> I'm sticking my corner man, beef is superior to pork. </connor>
<connor> - This man literally, - Except for bacon, </connor>
<connor> - Garnt out here literally arguing, </connor>
<connor> his fucking like kiddie meal preferences and food, </connor>
<connor> pretending is at the gourmet table, </connor>
<connor> like get out of here gourmet, come on. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Christmas. </joey>
<garnt> - Anyway going back to Christmas meals. </garnt>
<connor> - Going back to Christmas meals. </connor>
<connor> - I used to fucking hate Christmas meals, </connor>
<connor> 'cause my parents used to make, </connor>
<garnt> and they honestly they probably still do, </garnt>
<connor> fucking awful gravy. </connor>
<connor> It's like jelly. - Eewh! </connor>
<connor> - I feel like Christ mas meals live and die </connor>
<garnt> by the quality of gravy. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's true, </garnt>
<connor> because I used to eat all of the components on their own. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, - Because I refused, </connor>
<connor> to eat my parents' gravy. </connor>
<connor> And the whole family was like, "What's wrong Connor? </connor>
<joey> Why are you doing it? It tastes good. </joey>
<joey> What do you mean?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, the KFC gravy, although not great, </joey>
<joey> tastes better than this shit." </joey>
<joey> It's the consistency. Anything that's jelly, I don't like. </joey>
<connor> - There's like a perfect middle, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if it's too jelly, it's basically like a solid. </connor>
<connor> - It should be flake. </connor>
<joey> - But if it's like, I've had liquidity. </joey>
<joey> - It's the fucking... </joey>
<connor> - Gravy should... - There's nothing </connor>
<garnt> more depressing than watery gravy. </garnt>
<connor> - You know right, when you pour that shit in, </connor>
<connor> if it splashes, it's too... </connor>
<connor> It needs to like mold, but not be like jelly. </connor>
<connor> - Like fucking, I'm calling you out mom. </connor>
<joey> do you guys like eggnog? </joey>
<garnt> do you guys like eggnog? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have, I... </garnt>
<garnt> - I've tried it once, I am not a fan. </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't have eggnog, Meilyne just turned around and... </garnt>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Japanese eggnog? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh no. - Meilyne just seems for eggs </garnt>
<garnt> - She said Japanese eggnogs. </garnt>
<garnt> - She said Japanese eggnog. </garnt>
<connor> but then like two Christmases ago when I went home, </connor>
<connor> my aunt, like handmade eggnog, </connor>
<connor> and you have that with like... </connor>
<joey> - It's like, do you like custard? </joey>
<joey> - It's okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's basically, think of custard but it's a drink. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then my friend introduced me to eggnog, </joey>
<joey> with a fireball and usually I don't fuck with fireball, </joey>
<joey> i think fireball's overrated as fuck. </joey>
<joey> But that with eggnog is like, It's so good. </joey>
<joey> Something like... </joey>
<joey> - You can have an apple pie and drink eggnog. </joey>
<connor> I like it with the solid to like help. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's why you have it with the Christmas meal. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - I've been trying to find eggnog in Japan, </connor>
<joey> cause I fucking love that shit. </joey>
<joey> 'cause I fucking love that shit. </joey>
<joey> I just, it just doesn't sound good. </joey>
<connor> It just doesn't sound good. </connor>
<joey> Like it doesn't sound like, I'll try though. </joey>
<joey> like the word 'eggnog', </joey>
<connor> like the word eggnog, </connor>
<joey> is the least appealing sounding word. </joey>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<joey> It sounds like eggnog. </joey>
<joey> - It's sounds like a dirty porno. </joey>
<connor> - I just think that, </connor>
<connor> - I just think that.... </connor>
<joey> - Eggnog nine. My favorite porn. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just, I feel like, </connor>
<connor> - I just, I feel like, 'cause my family's like mega British. </connor>
<connor> So I don't have the Christmas meals to me, </connor>
<joey> It's probably this they were 1000 years ago. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - Just people awkwardly sitting around a table, being like, </joey>
<connor> "Yes, did you like your presents?" </connor>
<connor> I did like my presents mother. </connor>
<connor> "I did like my presents mother." </connor>
<connor> "Should we open a cracker?" </connor>
<connor> Do you have crackers in Australia? Christmas crackers? </connor>
<connor> - Thought you mean like white people? Like yes we do. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Yes Connor... </garnt>

<connor> - Yeah with the ones with like little... </connor>
<joey> - With the ones with like little... </joey>
<connor> The Christmas crackers that you pull? </connor>
<garnt> - Is that part of the American... </garnt>
<connor> - You both pull an end of this cracker, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah and then whoever gets the bigger half, </joey>
<connor> - And then whoever gets the bigger half, </connor>
<garnt> gets the shit inside. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have this? - It's like a kinderek. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a kinderek but as a... </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's little things, </garnt>
<joey> that like little plastic toys and stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And there's always like one ready shit joke? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you have like... </joey>
<joey> - And the paper crown. </joey>
<connor> - And the paper crown. </connor>
<connor> - There's always a paper . (Chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Wow, America doesn't have this, huh. </connor>
<garnt> - No America doesn't have that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No America doesn't have that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but we... </garnt>
<garnt> - Uncultured. </garnt>
<connor> - You pull one of those, they're overpriced, </connor>
<connor> they're like $10 for a pack of 10. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) And it's shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When you're like five, </joey>
<joey> - When you're like five, </joey>
<garnt> you're like this is fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like death note levels of like mind games, </garnt>
<garnt> but then you realize... </garnt>
<garnt> - I got six crowns (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I got six crowns. (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> And then when you start cheating you realize that, </garnt>
<connor> because when you're, </connor>
<connor> because when you're the one who's supposed to lose </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And then they pull </connor>
<connor> And then they pull and you realize it's not happening. </connor>
<connor> You're like fuck, I've been called out, I've cheated. </connor>
<connor> - [Both] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Apparently in America, </connor>
<garnt> - Apparently in America, it's not a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] It's a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - Is it a thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard, in some parts in a lot of parts of America, </garnt>
<joey> - I heard, in some parts, in a lot of parts of America, </joey>
<connor> - I hated them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I never got them. </joey>
<connor> - I never got them either. </connor>
<connor> - I don't like the idea of being teased, </connor>
<joey> - I don't like the idea of being teased, </joey>
<connor> for like 25 days on chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, - It's not even a bar, </connor>
<connor> It's like a small amount. </connor>
<connor> - To me advent calendars, </connor>
<connor> to explain advent calendars for anyone who doesn't know. </connor>
<garnt> So you get a calendar at the beginning of December, </garnt>
<connor> and every day you can open up like a day of the week, </connor>
<connor> and you get a different piece of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - God these white people. - And.. </connor>
<joey> - God these white people. </joey>
<joey> - And unlike as as a kid, (Connor chuckling) </joey>
<connor> it was just like the equivalent of know not November, </connor>
<joey> but just for chocolate. </joey>
<garnt> You know what I mean? (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - It is the most blue balls of end, </connor>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> like Christmas right? (chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> Is it a morning thing? Or is it an evening thing? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought it was a morning thing. </connor>
<connor> - First thing in the morning, </connor>
<connor> you go you, </connor>
<garnt> you go, it was like as a kid it was it was the only time, </garnt>
<garnt> you could eat chocolate, first thing in the morning. </garnt>
<joey> - It was, but it was like it threw off my vibe, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was saying, </joey>
<joey> why am I fucking eating Chocolate in the morning? </joey>
<joey> cause Christmas for us, </joey>
<connor> 'cause Christmas for us, </connor>
<joey> is in like the middle of the summer. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You buy it and it's just like the... </joey>
<connor> you can see the chocolate kind of melting </connor>
<joey> from inside the thing, you just open it is like </joey>
<joey> (Joey guffing) (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> are like the wooden ones? </joey>
<connor> - My parents would never fucking buy me the expensive ones. </connor>
<connor> - Wooden advent calendars? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Wooden advent calendars? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the traditional... </connor>
<connor> - The traditional wooden, </connor>
<connor> - The traditional wooden, </connor>
<joey> like the traditional advent calendars I've seen, </joey>
<joey> And then you open this like wooden door, </joey>
<connor> to open the chocolate. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - My mom refused to pay more than a $1 for mine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So she would always, </garnt>
<garnt> wait until December 4th, (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> to get it. </connor>
<joey> And I remember being like, </joey>
<garnt> And I remember being like, "Okay mom." </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - So three days of expired chocolate. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, mom I see you, </connor>
<garnt> I see what you're doing here. (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> but for some reason to me, </garnt>
<garnt> but for some reason to me, advent calendar chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> just tasted better. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know why, like it's... </garnt>
<garnt> I have exactly the same opinions </garnt>
<connor> I have no idea, </connor>
<connor> I have no idea, why? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's the same Cadbury's chocolate, </connor>
<connor> it tastes 10 times better to me. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. I may the only one. </joey>
<joey> - I used to agree, </joey>
<joey> - I used to agree, because I hadn't had an advent calendar, </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, oh, fantastic. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be a kid again. </connor>
<connor> Cause I had one like three years. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I had one like three years. </connor>
<joey> And I ate it, </joey>
<joey> And I ate it, and I'm like, wow, this is just shit. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) This is shit. </joey>
<joey> I put them all out, </joey>
<joey> I put them all out, on like December 5th. </joey>
<joey> I grabbed them all up, put it in my hand. </joey>
<connor> - Did you guys, have the one where like... </connor>
<joey> - Squish them together. </joey>
<joey> - You're kind of like, it like cracks out like a medicine? </joey>
<connor> - [Both] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's cause you were a kid. </connor>
<connor> Because I, </connor>
<connor> Because, you know when you're a kid, right? </connor>
<connor> Did they have these in Australia, where they had? </connor>
<connor> So in the UK they have this standard like $1, $2, eggs. </connor>
<connor> Which is just an egg, </connor>
<connor> maybe you get a chocolate bars as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But when you were a kid, you'd always see the big egg. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm talking like $30, $40 egg, that was like giant. </connor>
<connor> (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> I feel like the magic is lost, </connor>
<connor> when you know you could buy it. </connor>
<connor> Because my parents were never gonna buy me the $30. </connor>
<connor> They would never buy more than one egg. </connor>
<connor> So like, you don't need more than that. </connor>
<connor> And so when I was like, two years ago, </connor>
<connor> I bought the big egg. </connor>
<connor> - Right. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - But it was reduced for like 10 bucks. </connor>
<connor> I had I thing it was gonna be fucking, </connor>
<connor> like God-tier experience, </connor>
<connor> came with its own shitty mug, </connor>
<garnt> and two chocolate balls. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just fucking shitty chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> It was just, it was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, wow! - I'm the opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I realized, when I put all this chocolate down, </garnt>
<connor> it was like 300 grams of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I could have bought like... </connor>
<joey> - I think 'cause the inside's hollow. </joey>
<joey> - Because I could have bought like five times the amount </joey>
<joey> of chocolate than when I paid. </joey>
<joey> We're fucking paying out the ass, </joey>
<connor> for them to put it in a fucking mold </connor>
<connor> and just fucking seal it together. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a fucking clown. </garnt>
<garnt> - Logically my mind knows this. </garnt>
<garnt> But every time it's Easter, like even as an adult, </garnt>
<garnt> like now that I am an adult, I just buy one, </garnt>
<garnt> I eat it on the same day, </garnt>
<garnt> which is what something I could never do before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the next day, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in my local Tesco's or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'll go for another Easter egg. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> I can do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is- - Crack another one. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the thing is I always buy the Cadbury's ones, </garnt>
<garnt> so that they always have like the chocolates, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's always like Cadbury's buttons or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know I can taste, </garnt>
<garnt> that it's exactly the same chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, it's something about Easter eggs, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like the right thickness, </garnt>
<garnt> t's just something about eating an Easter egg, </garnt>
<garnt> that just makes you feel like a king. </garnt>
<joey> - I actually prefer the ones, that will like shaped out </joey>
<joey> like a rabbit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, those are pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Those are good. </joey>
<joey> - There's a good one lint one to Lenore, </joey>
<connor> those ones like thick as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So something, maybe it's not just Easter eggs, </garnt>
<garnt> something about eating hollow chocolates, </garnt>
<garnt> that just hit different in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know about that one too. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what is wrong in my psychology, </garnt>
<garnt> to be like chocolate bar, get that shit away. </garnt>
<garnt> Hollow chocolate, okay, let me nibble on this. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm curious, is there... </connor>
<connor> Do you have a worst </connor>
<connor> or best Christmas present you've ever received? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, God. (sighing) </joey>
<joey> The best one I received, </joey>
<joey> I feel like the younger you were, </joey>
<connor> the better your Christmas present </connor>
<connor> at the time right? </connor>
<joey> - 100% dude, back when I could </joey>
<joey> just get a bunch of shitty toys </joey>
<joey> that lasted 10 minutes, I was like, "What!" </joey>
<joey> - The probably best Christmas gift I ever got was, </joey>
<garnt> I got, Gameboy Advance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit. - When I was like five, </garnt>
<garnt> and I played like the shitty like Corby port. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like the SNES game, </garnt>
<joey> which I found that ages ago, was like $5 game. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I was just like, "This is amazing father, thank you." </joey>
<joey> (Connor chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Probably the best present I've ever got was an N64. </connor>
<connor> And I think it was more the experience around it, </connor>
<connor> because so I was at my cousin's house and I opened it, </connor>
<joey> remember when game consoles, were like the gods here, </joey>
<joey> of anything you could ever get? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! - Like no gift to compare. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know your parents loved you, </connor>
<connor> when they got you a game console right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like, "I feel truly loved, </connor>
<connor> thank you mother and father." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I remember my parents got me, </joey>
<connor> when I was I don't know when that came out, </connor>
<joey> do you know when the Wii was like impossible to get. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like 2005 or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it was impossible to get. </joey>
<joey> Well they were like all sold out in the UK, </joey>
<connor> when my dad worked in Germany for like most of my life. </connor>
<connor> So when he came back for Christmas, he brought me </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Holy fuck, how did you get a Wii?" </connor>
<connor> And then as we went to plug it on Christmas day, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Couldn't fucking plug it in, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he had the German plug. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then 'cause my dad obviously just forgot to buy one. </connor>
<connor> And I remember booting it up and it being like, </connor>
<connor> (foreign language) (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then there were like the thing, like control, warning. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like... (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think warning your attention. </connor>
<joey> - It was warning, </joey>
<joey> - It's like (foreign language) or something. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "What is this dad? Dad, help me." </connor>
<connor> My dad couldn't fucking speak German, </connor>
<connor> so he was like, "I don't know son, what are we doing? </connor>
<connor> I don't know." </connor>
<connor> I fucking had Wii sports but like, </connor>
<garnt> and some other games.. </garnt>
<garnt> - V sports. (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I had some game and the title was German. </garnt>
<connor> I remember just I was like so fucking confused as a kid. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What the fuck is this?" </connor>
<joey> - I think I got the Wii for Christmas as well actually, </joey>
<connor> now that I think about it. </connor>
<connor> - She was bald man. (crosstalk) </connor>
<joey> - But you know what ended up happening, </joey>
<connor> because it was when Wii sports was like insane? </connor>
<connor> The day we got it working, which is next day, </connor>
<connor> Wii sport, I couldn't fucking play, </connor>
<connor> 'cause all my fucking older relatives are playing, </connor>
<connor> Wii bowling drunk. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "When am I gonna play Zelda? What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> This is my gift, what the fuck?" </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) Go on Garnt.. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I just remember my ... </garnt>
<garnt> One of my best memories of the N64, </garnt>
<connor> which is the first time my boost up GoldenEye, </connor>
<garnt> with my cousins. </garnt>
<connor> I think that was my first proper like, </connor>
<garnt> multiplayer experience, 'cause it was like "Whoa, </garnt>
<connor> four people can play at the same time </connor>
<connor> and we can play together." </connor>
<connor> And at that time, that was fucking mind blowing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the best full play game back then, </connor>
<connor> was probably like fucking Bama man </connor>
<connor> or something like that. - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Mario Party maybe? </connor>
<joey> - No because Mario Party wasn't out there yet. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't out there. </joey>
<joey> - The first one was on N64. </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - And I remember we stayed up to like 4 a.m, </connor>
<garnt> which back when I was a kid, was like... </garnt>
<joey> - I might as well late, not sleeping for two days. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<joey> - I might as well might have been up for 40 hours. </joey>
<connor> - Whenever you get a brand new game console man, </connor>
<connor> those endorphins are firing off. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, of course. </garnt>
<connor> - They're like, oh my God dude. </connor>
<garnt> I don't really get that anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you can afford everything now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess so right? </connor>
<garnt> - It's like doing a pine of cocaine. </garnt>
<connor> - Like seeing the PS5 I'm like, I know if I get it, </connor>
<connor> I'll play like Demon Souls and be like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'm sure like. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause The Jumper is not significant anymore, </connor>
<connor> - PS4 games can load 20% faster now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, cool, epic man, oh, wow, really excited. </connor>
<garnt> - Like going from SNES to an N64 it's like, whoa! </garnt>
<connor> - It's insane. - 3D </connor>
<garnt> You fucking kidding me, I can walk in any direction? </garnt>
<garnt> What? Up is forward. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What is this analog stick? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> The cancer, that is the fucking N64 control. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I look at that thing now, and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "How did anyone think this was a good idea?" </joey>
<connor> - I love picking it up stone, </connor>
<connor> being like "God damn you ugly son of a bitch." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> I love you. </connor>
<connor> - I feel it again. </connor>
<garnt> And I put my thumb on the analog stick, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "How is it this fucking hot?" </garnt>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> Like this is designed to give blisters, </garnt>
<garnt> how did this pass the ergonomics test? </garnt>
<joey> - The moment I like put my thumb on the joystick, </joey>
<joey> my palm just starts to hurt. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like the memories </joey>
<joey> of blistered palms doing fucking this, my party too. </joey>
<joey> - You could get gloves from Nintendo </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause they lost a lawsuit. </joey>
<connor> - Because of Mario Party won. 'Cause of the palm injuries. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, my palm, I got destroyed... </joey>
<garnt> - I couldn't believe that, it's insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just assumed the design team at Nintendo, </garnt>
<connor> the first day on the job, </connor>
<garnt> they just took like an ergonomics book </garnt>
<garnt> and just set it on fire. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Its like, "Okay, we're designing </garnt>
<garnt> the N64 controller now guys." </garnt>
<connor> - "Is it fun? Put it in?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Man I remember as well that same Christmas </connor>
<connor> when we got the Wii. </connor>
<connor> My older brother got, not the Death Star, </connor>
<joey> what's the other big battleship in Star Wars? </joey>
<joey> The one that's like a fucking like that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh the... </joey>
<joey> - Destroyer or something, </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking remember. - Something like that. </joey>
<joey> - And then he built it all, </joey>
<connor> and for some reason had the amazing idea, </connor>
<connor> to put it near the TV, </connor>
<connor> in front of where we were with the Wii. </connor>
<connor> And I'm sure you can imagine what happened. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It fucking hit the roof. </connor>
<connor> Someone did the bowling through it, slammed the roof, </connor>
<connor> smashed down and destroyed this thing, </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> that he'd spent like eight hours building, it was so funny. </connor>
<joey> I'll never forget that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Watching my dad playing Wii Sports, </joey>
<connor> is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life, </connor>
<connor> because I... </connor>
<connor> - Broomers get so into it. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude, he was so into fucking Wii boxing as well. </connor>
<connor> It's like, of all the Wii sports ones, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> it was the fucking most intense one. </connor>
<connor> - I'm Mike Tyson, Joey watch. </connor>
<connor> - And oh my God just watching my dad's fucking doing this </connor>
<connor> for like two hours, it's just so funny. </connor>
<connor> - I remember one Christmas, I don't know how old I was. </connor>
<connor> So I was in Sunday school, </connor>
<connor> and I fucking hated Sunday school, </connor>
<connor> 'cause why the fuck would I wanna go, it was well, </connor>
<connor> when you are like eight, </connor>
<connor> I didn't understand why I cared about, </connor>
<connor> why I should care about Jesus and shit? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> To me, I was like, "Who is this guy? And why do I care?" </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Who is this guy? </garnt>
<connor> - Whose man's? </connor>
<garnt> - Who's the big J man, that everyone keeps talking about? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And so, I remember this. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hated it. </connor>
<connor> My parents for some reason, 'cause my parents, right. </connor>
<connor> Not to out my parents here right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> But they said they were, religious. </connor>
<connor> My parents weren't fucking religious. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> They just wanted to be... </connor>
<connor> It's literally like I feel like the white suburban family. </connor>
<connor> It's like, wait, yeah, we believe in Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we love J man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah we love him, we're all... </connor>
<connor> You know, my, whatever. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like were not fucking religious. </connor>
<connor> I actually asked my mom and dad, </connor>
<connor> when was the last time when they went to church. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, how many decades? </connor>
<joey> - 1972. (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Right, so they put me... they had the genius idea </connor>
<connor> to put all of me and my brothers, in Sunday school. </connor>
<connor> And my older brother, he never complains about stuff. </connor>
<connor> He just gets on with it. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - And me, you know me, I like to complain. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, before we get into your story. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is Sunday school? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you don't know, okay true. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a church school, right? </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, I mean, it's in America as well. </connor>
<connor> I think it's more popular in America, but in the UK as well, </connor>
<connor> it's normally for like Christian stuff </connor>
<connor> or Catholic or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you learn in Sunday school? </garnt>
<connor> Because I've never been to Sunday school. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus. (chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - I just know about Sunday school. </garnt>
<connor> - So I think I was too young, </connor>
<connor> to do the super religious stuff. </connor>
<connor> So 90% of the time, they just spoke about religious, </connor>
<connor> they would tell stories. </connor>
<connor> And I remember being like, "Who the fuck cares." </connor>
<connor> And also, I remember coloring in so many pictures, </connor>
<connor> so many fucking pictures. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I remember... </connor>
<connor> - Did you have a Jesus coloring book? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we had like a Jesus coloring page. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - And I fucking hated it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, "Who is this guy? Why do I care?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Why am I coloring this guy? </connor>
<connor> - This is the fifth time we've colored in his birth. </connor>
<connor> Do we really need to keep coloring this man? </connor>
<connor> I do remember being like, </connor>
<connor> and also one time, and it was, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'd watch TV shows in American cartoons. </connor>
<connor> And they have like the paddling bowls. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I have this very very vivid memory. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Of one time one of the kids bringing </connor>
<connor> in the paddling balls, and it was like </connor>
<connor> the coolest fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they immediately took it away from him. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "No I wanna play with the paddling ball." </joey>
<joey> - Why did they take away from him? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, 'cause it's Jesus time. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No one interrupts Jesus. </joey>
<connor> - And they made us do like a play at Christmas, </connor>
<connor> when I was like eight or nine. </connor>
<joey> - Oh well like the birth of Jesus and stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I think that my school did that as well. </joey>
<connor> - But it wasn't in school though, </connor>
<garnt> we had to do it in fucking Sunday school. </garnt>
<garnt> - What role did you get? </garnt>
<garnt> - I had to give meh. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember being like, "Mom, I don't..." </connor>
<connor> - You were one of the wise men? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was one of the wise men. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, man you got a big role. </garnt>
<connor> - I was the snowman. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But I think this 'cause, I think. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - That was literally what I did. </connor>
<connor> I literally just did this on stage. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - And then my mum still has pictures being like, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt applauding) </connor>
<garnt> "Great performance, great performance." </garnt>
<connor> (hands clapping) (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think I was one of the wise men, </garnt>
<connor> only because I, there wasn't enough kids, </connor>
<connor> to fill the other roles. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Because there wasn't enough kids in the school. </connor>
<connor> I hated it. I remember. </connor>
<connor> And then also, I was like," Why do I have to have meh, mom?" </connor>
<connor> He's got gold. I want gold. </connor>
<connor> That's bullshit. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't know how to say meh at the time, </connor>
<connor> when I was a kid. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Why, it's just... (both bleating) </connor>
<connor> - Gold, I know gold mother. </connor>
<connor> Come on, give me ... (Connor chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I remember we had to do this shitty play. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I hate this so much. I hate it. </connor>
<connor> And so for one Christmas, I asked my mom I was like, </connor>
<joey> she was like, "What do you want for Christmas?" </joey>
<connor> - Meh. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I dead ass looked her in the eyes, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't care about gifts. </connor>
<connor> Just please don't make me go to Sunday school." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) I want my Sundays back mom. </connor>
<connor> "I'm going to school five days a week </connor>
<connor> and then another day I have to turn up </connor>
<connor> and fucking color pics of Jesus, </connor>
<joey> are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> I hate this shit." </joey>
<joey> And I think honestly, that's the reason why I just care </joey>
<joey> for like zero religion now. </joey>
<connor> Because they pushed it so heavily on me </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, this is shit. </connor>
<connor> It's all a bunch of nonsense. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We're reading books, stories about this dude, </connor>
<connor> who I don't give a fuck about, like there's no college. </connor>
<connor> - So you went to you went to a Catholic school as well? </connor>
<connor> - No, it wasn't a Catholic school </connor>
<joey> but they did make us pray, three times a day. </joey>
<connor> - Wait so, what? </connor>
<connor> - So in Wales, a lot of schools should make you pray. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's just like a religious country in general. </joey>
<connor> - Even if it's an atheist school. </connor>
<connor> - There's no atheist school. </connor>
<garnt> It's just, it's a school and then a lot of them have like... </garnt>
<connor> - It's just a school. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - In my secondary school and my primary school, </connor>
<connor> I think you pray three times a day. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, really? </garnt>
<connor> - But the thing is right, that you realize, </connor>
<connor> maybe like in high school, you're like, oh, </connor>
<joey> they won't tell you off, if you don't pray, </joey>
<connor> 'cause they can't. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's a religious thing. </connor>
<joey> - But it's still a school rule? </joey>
<joey> - Well, no, it's... </joey>
<joey> - Like a school suggestion? - it's like a cult right? </joey>
<joey> Because when you get in this thing, right? </joey>
<connor> You go to school and then everyone suddenly bows their head </connor>
<connor> and starts fucking speaking in tongues. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - You're like, "Oh, shit, I should probably join in on this, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna be the only one left out. </connor>
<connor> But then you realize after on, </connor>
<connor> they're not gonna do anything if I don't pray </connor>
<connor> and just stand there and look around and be like, </connor>
<connor> "What's going on?" </connor>
<connor> You see all the other kids. </connor>
<connor> And so I would just refuse to do it eventually. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, I'm not praying. </connor>
<connor> I don't believe in this nonsense. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why they made us do it. </connor>
<joey> Because we weren't a religious school. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing, it's like I find that a bit weird, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it would make sense if you went to a Christian school </connor>
<connor> or a Catholic school. </connor>
<joey> - It might have been like, </joey>
<connor> it wasn't officially a Christian school, </connor>
<garnt> but like a lot of the schools in Wales were like, </garnt>
<garnt> Christian and school, something. </garnt>
<connor> - I think just a lot of schools in England are like that, </connor>
<connor> anyway, because, I don't think I went to a Catholic </connor>
<connor> or religious school. - No I do. </connor>
<connor> - We still did religious things around Christmas time. </connor>
<connor> And I had no idea what the fuck was going on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah fuck. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I come from a Buddhist family. </connor>
<connor> So we'd have events in the church and stuff like this. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "This isn't a temple." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) "What is this?" </connor>
<garnt> - God, it's just like singing Welsh hymns, </garnt>
<garnt> I know that the fucking voice didn't get to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had to sing hymns as well. I had no idea what they.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Me neither there was one, It was called </garnt>
<garnt> (speaking foreign language) </garnt>
<connor> and it means cum on my head. </connor>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - And so... - J man please. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Behave yourself, </joey>
<joey> I know it's your birthday and all but fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally called like (speaking foreign language) </joey>
<connor> It literally translates to cum my head. </connor>
<connor> Every time they would like... </connor>
<connor> 'cause there was a sheet of 12 hymns </connor>
<connor> and they would never do (speaking foreign language) </connor>
<connor> because everyone would always like, </connor>
<connor> look at each other and giggle </connor>
<connor> and because the chorus was just shouting, like loudly, </connor>
<connor> ♪ Dod ar fy mhen ♪ </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - They would never pick it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone would just start screaming, cum on my head. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) In Welsh. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we're all fucking kids. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. - And we found it funny. </connor>
<connor> And every time they'd pick it, it was like a fucking event, </connor>
<joey> because every old... </joey>
<joey> It was the one time where, </joey>
<joey> all the kids who didn't really sing </joey>
<joey> and go (mumbling) </joey>
<garnt> and would start, would proudly sing like.. </garnt>
<connor> - They'd be like- </connor>
<connor> - All right boys in queue right? </connor>
<joey> (Connor chuckling) (Joey clearing voice) </joey>
<joey> - That's weird because I went to... </joey>
<joey> my high school was a Catholic school. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even though I'm not Catholic personally, </connor>
<connor> but we didn't even have to do the whole praying thing. </connor>
<connor> We would have to do, maybe like an end of term mass, </connor>
<garnt> or like a beginning of term mass and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Both] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That's like bring on the new year </joey>
<joey> but yeah, we never had to do any... </joey>
<connor> - I did, it was one of those things that when you left, </connor>
<garnt> you're like, "That was weird, wasn't it?" </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> "That was weird that they made us pray." </garnt>
<garnt> We were like pray before every meal and stuff, and like.. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a bit weird. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it is weird. What's up with that Wales, man? </joey>
<garnt> And eventually my parents did grant </garnt>
<garnt> my Christmas wish and start... </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? - [Garnt] Oh really. </garnt>
<connor> - Got you out of it? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I... </connor>
<connor> - At what age? </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, it was before I started secondary school, </connor>
<connor> so it must have been.. </connor>
<joey> - How long were you in there for? </joey>
<garnt> - I think like two or three years. Fucking hated it. </garnt>
<connor> - You make it sound like a prison. </connor>
<garnt> How long were you in there for? </garnt>
<garnt> - How long were you in? </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt exclaiming) </connor>
<connor> - I literally... </connor>
<connor> - Have you readjusted to society now? </connor>
<connor> - The amount of times I was like, "Mom, I cannot. </connor>
<connor> I know you think this is just me being a fucking kid, </connor>
<connor> but I fucking hate this." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Please, take me out of this." </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, as a kid, like anything religious, </garnt>
<garnt> was just the most boring thing for me. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember whenever my mom would take me </garnt>
<connor> to temples and everything to go pray </connor>
<connor> and talk to the monk and everything. </connor>
<connor> I just wanted to go home and play N64 honestly. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like this, what's fun to do here? </connor>
<garnt> There is literally nothing fun to do here, </garnt>
<connor> in this religious place. </connor>
<connor> - This is why like when you see like those families, </connor>
<connor> who like their kids, </connor>
<connor> just get like indoctrinated into the (mumbling) </connor>
<connor> Raised into the... I think it's indoctrinated. </connor>
<connor> - Indoctrinated. - I think so, </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) they got... </garnt>
<garnt> - Call out to anyone who's religious. </garnt>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like the super religious people, right? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I remember even was like eight, </connor>
<connor> and I would hear these things like, </connor>
<connor> "He turned wine into water." </connor>
<connor> And I remember being like eight years old, </connor>
<connor> like did he though? </connor>
<connor> Did he? I've never seen anyone do that? </connor>
<joey> Pretty... </joey>
<joey> - I'm actually... </joey>
<connor> - But I'm gonna be like, that sounds a bit bull shit to me. </connor>
<connor> - Just press X to tell. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I do remember vividly being like, I don't know about that. </connor>
<joey> - Think so it didn't happen. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's the same thing with Santa Claus, </connor>
<connor> like my parents would try and tell me at like age 10 </connor>
<connor> that Santa was real. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm not having any of that." </connor>
<connor> Come on. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Reindeer's that can fly? </connor>
<garnt> Come on mom. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a question. </garnt>
<garnt> At what age did you figure out, that spoilers alert, </garnt>
<connor> Santa isn't real. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, dude, I've like went on an operation, </connor>
<joey> at midnight to like find out. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) To prove... </joey>
<joey> - You did like the stealth mission? </joey>
<connor> - To prove to them, that I knew what they were doing. </connor>
<joey> And I found out. </joey>
<joey> - I found out accidentally, </joey>
<connor> because I think it was maybe like 10 or 11. </connor>
<connor> And it was Christmas night and I was like, fuck, </connor>
<connor> I really need to pee. </connor>
<connor> I drank too much, whatever it was. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I got up in the middle of the night. </connor>
<connor> My dad was like this, next to the tree. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And he just caught me red handed </joey>
<joey> and he's like, </joey>
<garnt> all right son it's time you found out. </garnt>
<connor> - [Both] (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - It's time you knew the truth. </connor>
<garnt> - You got me kid. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Both] (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I know where, </garnt>
<connor> because, you know, </connor>
<connor> I did like a thorough sweep of the house. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, a few days before, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, </joey>
<joey> they'll be presents here. </joey>
<connor> My theory is correct. </connor>
<connor> My hypothesis. </connor>
<connor> Couldn't find any presents in the house, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, </connor>
<connor> they must be hidden in the garage. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, great, </connor>
<connor> I'll wait till midnight, </connor>
<connor> on Christmas until they bring them in. </connor>
<garnt> And as I slept, right, it was like covert ops. </garnt>
<garnt> Just pretending to sleep. </garnt>
<connor> My parents came in to check if I was sleeping. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And I wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I don't remember the exact age I found out, </garnt>
<garnt> like Santa wasn't real. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, the smartest dumb kids in existence, </garnt>
<garnt> because I would like be figuring out, </garnt>
<connor> all these like logistics of how Santa, </connor>
<connor> could be able to send these presents rounds. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there would be years, where you know, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't be at home. </connor>
<connor> So I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "How's Santa gonna figure out I a aint home?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You'd be that sober? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So, we'd be sitting at my cousin's house, right? </connor>
<connor> And the presents would still be there, </connor>
<connor> even though we were staying at my cousin's house, </connor>
<connor> no matter where we were every year. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason, it just didn't click to me as a kid, </connor>
<connor> that Santa wasn't real. </connor>
<connor> But, instead of just realizing that Santa wasn't real, </connor>
<connor> I was in my head. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "So this is how Santa knew I was staying here." </connor>
<connor> So we went to our house, didn't see I was there. </connor>
<connor> Saw like, the notes that I left somewhere, </connor>
<connor> or saw, like the phone call, that I had with my cousin, </connor>
<connor> that will come around to his house. </connor>
<connor> So that's how Santa knew, </connor>
<connor> that I was staying around my cousin's house. </connor>
<connor> And I explained this to my parents at the time, </connor>
<connor> and my parents just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Yeah, you've figured it out." </garnt>
<connor> - You got them - "You've figured it out." </connor>
<connor> You've out-smarted Santa. </connor>
<connor> - God damn it, he's smart. </connor>
<connor> - You're like the whiteboard with like the pins on it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like does he operate like time zones? </connor>
<joey> Like how does it look? Yeah fucking help. </joey>
<connor> - I think I just remember being like, </connor>
<connor> "Damn, none of this Jesus stuff seemed to have happened." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> When I was like 10, I don't know if this Santa stuff's real. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause none of this shit's happening, </connor>
<joey> I'm trying wine. </joey>
<joey> - Did you ever do like... </joey>
<connor> I think it's just like an American thing, </connor>
<connor> but did you ever do leave like the the cookies </connor>
<garnt> and the milk? - Yeah, we did that. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - We didn't do that. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't do that. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think that my dad just wanted food. </connor>
<connor> - I saw this brilliant, </connor>
<connor> Reddit post of like a dad, being like, </connor>
<joey> "So my son's left cookies and milk on his bedside table. </joey>
<joey> But how do I tell him that Santa is lactose intolerant?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> "Do I just drink the milk and take the shits for my son?" </joey>
<joey> - Well... </joey>
<joey> - "Do I leave it there and break his heart?" </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I remember one time my dad was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no Connor, Santa likes beer." </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm definitely doing that to my child. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - And so he legit poured beer for himself </connor>
<connor> And then just drank it obviously. </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he poured cold water for himself. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I was gonna be to my son, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Did you know that Santa loves gin and tonic?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah Santa likes, an espresso Martini. </connor>
<connor> - Leave the gin and tonic, </connor>
<connor> it maybe be as cheese platter on there. </connor>
<connor> That will do, I mean Santa will definitely eat that. </connor>
<joey> - The double of course. </joey>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Double shot. </joey>
<joey> - Santa, doesn't like cookies, he like brownies, </joey>
<joey> but like the special brownies. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the special brownies. </garnt>
<joey> - Give Santa the special brownies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Santa loves G Fuel. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Just put a cup of G Fuel next to the brownie. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't believe that your dad did not say that to you. </garnt>
<joey> - That is so big brain. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause he just wanted a beer. </garnt>
<connor> - That is being brain as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause he knows that we believe it. </connor>
<connor> Like I believed that it wasn't real, </connor>
<connor> but I also was like, maybe, a little bit, </connor>
<connor> there's a chance that someone's drinking this, and yeah... </connor>
<joey> - I mean Santa is a grown adult, you know he might... </joey>
<connor> He's working hard. </connor>
<joey> - Possibly driving and drinking, </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) but I mean, that's okay. </connor>
<joey> - Like, question to you guys. </joey>
<connor> Do you normally have like a normal... </connor>
<connor> What's your Christmas Day like? </connor>
<garnt> What's your typical Christmas Day like? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you have any schedules? </garnt>
<connor> Do you have any like... </connor>
<connor> - Used to have, you'd open presents first thing. </connor>
<connor> Which is always the best part, </connor>
<connor> but it always goes downhill from there. </connor>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you remember the age where, </garnt>
<connor> you just couldn't sleep before Christmas, as a teenager, </connor>
<garnt> you're just like, "Dude, I don't care about this any more." </garnt>
<connor> - Well, because you realize, when you were like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, did you always use to pick a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> and you would get some of them, </garnt>
<garnt> or did you get everything that you picked? </garnt>
<garnt> - I would get some of them. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, </garnt>
<garnt> - Because my parents would also be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Listen, Connor, Santa's got a budget." </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Really?" </connor>
<connor> So then I had to look for the products within the budget. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I never connected the dots, </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> you know, from age eight or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But I would go through like, </connor>
<garnt> we had to think of like Argos. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, Argos. - What's that? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a... </garnt>
<connor> they had like a giant, fucking gigantic booklet. </connor>
<garnt> - Imagine the most depressing store you can think of, </garnt>
<connor> you go into the store, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's not a store, It's just a store of catalogs. </connor>
<joey> So imagine like Amazon warehouse, </joey>
<connor> but it will have a slight... </connor>
<connor> - Like an Amazon IRL. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So you'd go in, you could book it online </joey>
<connor> or back then you had to go to the store </connor>
<connor> and take off the boxes you wanted. </connor>
<garnt> According to the catalog. </garnt>
<joey> - Seems depressing is fun. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it was. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the cats... </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - As a kid though, this shit was magical, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it had like everything in it. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So you would go through and now you realize </connor>
<connor> this was just fucking overpriced. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - With all the shit lost, but back then there was no Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> so you're fitting it in the budget. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because how are you going through it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause back back in the day, </garnt>
<connor> you didn't really have the internet. </connor>
<connor> So you'd have to hold off this catalog. </connor>
<connor> So you go into this at Argos store. </connor>
<connor> And there was this catalog, </connor>
<connor> that was like as thick as a brick. </connor>
<connor> You could fucking murder someone with this catalog, right? </connor>
<connor> - Your phone book? </connor>
<connor> - You'd go in and you flip to like the index. </connor>
<connor> You'd go in and usually like (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Case closed. </connor>
<connor> - It's right under act as well. </connor>
<connor> - And so you flip through the index </connor>
<connor> and go through like the game sections and the toy sections, </connor>
<garnt> which was the only sections you really looked at. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] All right. </connor>
<garnt> - And then it was just like free picking space, </garnt>
<connor> - I never had anything... </connor>
<connor> - And then basically, when I turned off Christmas morning, </connor>
<garnt> there'll probably be a few surprises, </garnt>
<connor> but most of the stuff that I wanted would be there. </connor>
<connor> Except that one time like I said, </connor>
<connor> that kind of upset, fucking dad bought me cricket tickets. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Which he did a lot. </connor>
<connor> - I clearly expressed my disdain for cricket </connor>
<connor> but I thought this is gonna change his life. </connor>
<joey> - I genuinely like other than the Gameboy Advance, </joey>
<joey> I genuinely don't remember what else I got, from Santa. </joey>
<connor> - One Christmas I just got like all Yukio, </connor>
<connor> like I got the fucking jewel arm thing and I got like... </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you got one of those? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I got... </connor>
<connor> - Aargh, jealous. </connor>
<joey> - All my friends have got one as well. </joey>
<joey> - Jealous. </joey>
<joey> - We would turn up to school and we play Yukio, </joey>
<joey> but then they just stopped playing after they realized, </joey>
<joey> my dad is spooky. </joey>
<connor> - I guess Santa didn't have the budget for that for me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I asked for one year, </connor>
<connor> but I just didn't get it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I mean... </connor>
<connor> - Dad was like, "Fuck this little shit, doesn't need that." </connor>
<joey> - I think he just got me like a bunch of booster packs. </joey>
<connor> - He has the graveyard and the fold out thing, </connor>
<garnt> with the back of the booster pack, he'll be fine. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he'll be all right. </connor>
<connor> - I remember for me, it was always video games. </connor>
<connor> I never asked for anything but video games. </connor>
<connor> And that was because as a kid, </connor>
<connor> there were only two times in the year, </connor>
<connor> when I could get new video games. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And one of them was my birthday, </joey>
<garnt> and the other one was Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is a fucking rare occasion, </connor>
<garnt> if I managed to get a game outside my birthday or Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I remember, it was the highlights of my year, </garnt>
<connor> because I'll be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Finally I can play something other than Super Mario 64 </garnt>
<connor> for like this like millionth time." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And so, I couldn't get every game, </connor>
<connor> so I normally get like two, </connor>
<connor> if it was like a fucking special year. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was like, I knew my parents loved me, </connor>
<connor> when I got three video games man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, three games, is like the limit for me as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like 100 quid, 120 pounds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're pushing it. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I mean, that's probably why, </garnt>
<garnt> I always remember the N64. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause the N64 was just like God modes. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I had never gotten a bigger present in my life, </garnt>
<garnt> at that moment. </garnt>
<connor> - Now that you say that, </connor>
<connor> I think I remember why I wanted to... </connor>
<connor> Why I kept doing like chess stuff and being good at things, </connor>
<connor> because my parents buy me shit. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> If I wanted things, they would buy me stuff. </connor>
<connor> So I said I should just win the stuff that I'm good at </connor>
<joey> and they'll keep buying me things. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause whenever I like win a tournament or whatever, </joey>
<joey> they'll go and buy me a game. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, stonks. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> Let's just get good at something. </connor>
<joey> - I think that was me, but just with school </joey>
<joey> and especially Japanese for me. </joey>
<joey> Like if I did well in like my Japanese tests and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> My mom would be like, "Yes, that is my son." </joey>
<connor> - My brother was always better. So it didn't matter. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "I gotta find another niche." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fair enough. </joey>
<connor> - Do you have any family traditions at Christmas? </connor>
<connor> - We just have like family come over... </connor>
<joey> - We have two parties, we have, </joey>
<connor> one Christmas Eve so like 24th, </connor>
<connor> the night we would have kind of bring, </connor>
<garnt> all that family friends over. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So all my childhood friends and whatnot, </garnt>
<garnt> and friends from school and whatnot, come to ours </garnt>
<joey> and then Christmas Day, </joey>
<joey> the next day is when it's like family. </joey>
<joey> Like during the day. </joey>
<joey> - For me it's the other way round. </joey>
<joey> Family day it's like completely sober, </joey>
<joey> it's like Christmas Day. </joey>
<joey> Boxing day is when the fucking party is at. </joey>
<joey> Where we get drunk with the family. </joey>
<garnt> - Now Boxing days is recovery day for us. </garnt>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Boxing days is like, "We've had two parties back to back, </joey>
<connor> we've gotta recover." </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Stuff like family come over I think, </joey>
<connor> and have a nice little get together. </connor>
<connor> - It's nice for us as well, because at my parents place, </connor>
<connor> we have this... </connor>
<connor> because it's during the summer in Australia. </connor>
<connor> We have this big... </connor>
<connor> We have like an out place, </connor>
<connor> with this like big backyard like deck, </connor>
<connor> that looks over everything </connor>
<connor> and so just crack open a cold beer, </connor>
<connor> in like the fucking 30 degree summer, </connor>
<garnt> on a Christmas is fucking awful, </garnt>
<garnt> - I keep forgetting that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's weird to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Or we go to my uncle's place and we jump in his pool, </connor>
<joey> and we just do the pool all day on a Christmas Day. </joey>
<garnt> - It was it was super weird for me, </garnt>
<garnt> like two three years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> when I was living in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were celebrating Christmas in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just like, 30 degree heat </garnt>
<connor> and us opening Christmas presents under a Christmas tree. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "This isn't very Christmassy." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sweating man. </connor>
<connor> - This doesn't feel very Christmassy. </connor>
<connor> I have to put the AC on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, okay. Have you ever had a white Christmas? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've had it once. </garnt>
<joey> - Once. </joey>
<joey> - I've had it once. </joey>
<joey> - So my family most of the time, </joey>
<connor> preferred like go on like vacation for Christmas. </connor>
<connor> I think that just they love going on vacation. </connor>
<connor> And the stuff they always used to do is like, </connor>
<connor> "We're not gonna buy you stuff Connor, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna take you places." </connor>
<connor> Which I appreciate now. </connor>
<connor> But as a kid I fucking hated it. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "I don't wanna go to fucking France, mom. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hate France. Everyone in France is a dick head. </connor>
<connor> can't you just get me the new Game board." </connor>
<connor> - You don't see family on Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - So it depends on, I think every other year, </connor>
<joey> So so we would sometimes go skiing or snowboarding. </joey>
<joey> Which sounds fucking epic now. </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - Your family have the right idea man. </connor>
<connor> They are big brain. </connor>
<garnt> - But you know, when I was a kid, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, 'I don't want to fucking be away, </connor>
<connor> this is my time off, you're making me do work." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause to me right, </connor>
<connor> skiing and snowboarding with my family was like a chore, </connor>
<connor> when I was a kid. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - Because they're so fucking slow. </joey>
<joey> I would have to like go on a ski thing, </joey>
<joey> and I would just be like, I would wait at the top. </joey>
<joey> - Come on peasants. </joey>
<joey> - I would wait at the top and I'm like, just go ahead. </joey>
<connor> I'll be down. I'll follow you </connor>
<connor> and I would wait for five minutes on my phone. </connor>
<connor> And then when I was like, </connor>
<connor> it's been five minutes time to go like full speed down </connor>
<connor> and catch up and like overtake them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I used to wait, </connor>
<connor> and then you know also when you're a kid, </connor>
<connor> and you don't have money, I'm fucking hungry as shit </connor>
<connor> and these results, 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> we would go on like packages. </connor>
<connor> So they were pretty cheap. </connor>
<connor> Not that am trying to bash my parents, </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> I'm very grateful, </connor>
<connor> but they were like the cheapest possible way, </connor>
<garnt> that you could go to like Italy and ski. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Which is fair enough. </connor>
<connor> I mean I applaud the effort, </connor>
<connor> but when you had to eat out at these places, </connor>
<connor> they like charge a lot for like food and drinks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah! </connor>
<connor> - She was like, </connor>
<connor> "We're getting one meal between us all. </connor>
<connor> We're all gonna split it." </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Fuck mom I'm starving." </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> "I would not, </connor>
<garnt> for more than one sixth of the pizza right now." </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, but going now as an adult, </garnt>
<connor> I have my own money. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'll waste all my money on the food there, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck, I wanna be full. </connor>
<garnt> - Because like these activities, </garnt>
<connor> I've realized the reason we enjoy them so much as an adult. </connor>
<connor> - Do you do with friends? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, not just that. </connor>
<connor> But because we can get alcohol involved. </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Like you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's just like going on trips and everything, </connor>
<joey> it just fun out with a pine and... </joey>
<joey> - Oh it's 9 a.m it's time for flying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause what you do after you have your fun activity, </joey>
<joey> and you just want to wind down? </joey>
<garnt> As a kid you have fucking nothing to do. </garnt>
<connor> But as an adult, you can just, </connor>
<connor> get drunk with the boys and us. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I enjoy spending more time with my family </connor>
<joey> now that I'm an adult, than I did when I was a kid. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I've worked, I've had three white Christmases </connor>
<joey> and all three of them have been </joey>
<joey> because I was working at a ski resort in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's say having a white Christmas in Australia. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, no. That's a different type of white Christmas. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> But yeah, like I had the whitest Christmases </connor>
<connor> in like ski resorts </connor>
<connor> because it's just fucking white everywhere. </connor>
<garnt> But like, the only difference between the Christmas night, </garnt>
<garnt> at a ski resort and every other night, </garnt>
<garnt> is that there's just more white people outside really? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> That's the only difference, </garnt>
<garnt> because what do you do at a ski resort? </garnt>
<connor> Other than skiing and snowboarding? </connor>
<connor> You get shit faced? </connor>
<joey> Yeah, that's the only... </joey>
<joey> - Sauna, is normally a good chance. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Oh, like on sauna, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, other than that, </connor>
<connor> It's like the only other thing, </connor>
<connor> if you if you wake up in the morning, </connor>
<joey> you're like, "Oh, man, my body's feeling a bit sore, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna go skiing or snowboarding." </joey>
<joey> There's nothing to do during the day, </joey>
<joey> other than to go to the one bar that's open 24/7 </joey>
<connor> and just gets shit faced. </connor>
<connor> - And also because like, fucking skiing and snowboarding, </connor>
<joey> is so fucking exhausting. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, </joey>
<joey> "Alright, that fucking pine is like amazing." </joey>
<garnt> You've ever been skiing or snowboarding. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never been skiing or snow boarding. </garnt>
<connor> - It's always been... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, like, the reason I've never been is just 'cause, </garnt>
<garnt> every holiday we went to Thailand, </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's also one of those things where I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why my family just were like, </connor>
<connor> let's just go skiing for the first time. </connor>
<connor> I feel like normally you go with someone, who's been. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So they can be like," I'll help you out." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Also like skiing lessons. </connor>
<connor> - Skiing lessons yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also, you know, when I was growing up, </connor>
<connor> I wasn't in the most privileged position, </connor>
<connor> where my family could kind of afford that, </connor>
<connor> because I feel like going skiing </connor>
<garnt> is like an expensive holiday. </garnt>
<garnt> Or can be, expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it is. I mean... </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause, </joey>
<joey> - Especially if you're in a country that doesn't have </joey>
<connor> like resorts nearby. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. - Exactly right. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I realized this, </joey>
<connor> when I started flying for like conventions and stuff, right? </connor>
<connor> I was I always thought, </connor>
<joey> the airports were even worse than they actually are. </joey>
<joey> Because right, if you get one of those package deals, </joey>
<joey> the company that does the package deal, charters the plane. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So you all have to like wait in this fucking horrible line </joey>
<joey> these planes are like the fucking worst. </joey>
<connor> And the people are the worst as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the worst kind of British tourists. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which I'm sure you've all seen videos </connor>
<connor> of you watch like Apple meltdowns. </connor>
<connor> It's always British people, always. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Dude these these fucking flights are awful, it's the most, </connor>
<connor> oh, God. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> You've been on them? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've been on okay, so the most depressing place </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to on earth I think, is Luton Airport. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, it's awful. (Connor clearing voice) </joey>
<joey> - Or in UK? - In the UK? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so we stayed, so you know, back before... </joey>
<joey> back when I was just like fucking poor and all that stuff. </joey>
<joey> We booked this holiday. </joey>
<joey> It was me and Sydney at the time. </joey>
<joey> So we booked this holiday on this like budget airline, </joey>
<joey> that flew out of Luton, </joey>
<joey> and I remember to save costs, </joey>
<joey> when needed to stay near Luton, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was actually cheaper to stay near Luton, </joey>
<joey> than to like get there in the morning, </joey>
<joey> in the like rush hour. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And so we picked the cheapest hotel, </joey>
<joey> which happened to be Easy hotel, </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, no! </joey>
<joey> - Which I didn't know, </joey>
<joey> - That already sounds (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so in Europe, </joey>
<joey> there's this there's this budget airline called EasyJet. </joey>
<joey> - It's the worst. </joey>
<joey> - And it's the worst, one of the worst airlines. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say it's the worst, </joey>
<connor> - What's worse Ryanair? </connor>
<connor> - I'd say Ryanair. </connor>
<connor> Ryanair is fucking (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - There just both two sides of the same coin. </connor>
<connor> - Anything that flies out Luton, </connor>
<connor> is automatically like horrible for me. </connor>
<connor> But like, so we stay in Easy hotel, </connor>
<connor> and I've never felt like I've paid </connor>
<connor> to stay in a prison cell before, </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Until I stayed there. </connor>
<connor> So it was like we go in </connor>
<connor> and there's literally like no windows. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a white room right, with a bed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just a black room. </connor>
<connor> And like the walls are paper thin and they were like, </connor>
<garnt> I could hear at least like three different people, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking in different rooms. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> And I go into the shower, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a shared shower right or is it? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, you had your own private shower, </garnt>
<connor> but it was... </connor>
<connor> (Connor exclaiming) </connor>
<joey> - That's one step up isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - But like there wasn't even like a door </joey>
<joey> to like separate the shower from the bed, okay? </joey>
<joey> So so it was just like curtains, </joey>
<joey> so you open up these curtains </joey>
<joey> and then there is like a toilet seat </joey>
<joey> and then there is a shower right next to it </joey>
<joey> and it just it was the like definition </joey>
<connor> of how I imagined a prison shower to be right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the only thing said that... </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's nothing separating the toilet </connor>
<connor> from the shower. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - So you just showering and so what while you're showering, </connor>
<connor> the toilets just like getting fucking soaked, </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And it's got like the gray kind of like floor as well. </connor>
<connor> So if you felt like I was in a prison cell, </connor>
<garnt> and I had to pay good money. </garnt>
<joey> - How much was it for like, a night? </joey>
<joey> I can't remember, like 20 quid a night. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck hell. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I would have rather stayed in prison cell. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - It just like me and Sydney there, </joey>
<connor> but I was like, I better not drop the soap man. </connor>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I better not drop the soap while am here. </connor>
<connor> - Something will just burst through the fucking walls like, </connor>
<joey> (growling) </joey>
<joey> - Its just like Ryanair and EasyJet, </joey>
<joey> if you forget your ticket, </joey>
<joey> they charge you like 50 euros or... </joey>
<joey> - I got charged that when we flew from </joey>
<connor> fucking Amsterdam to Ireland. </connor>
<garnt> - I got charged that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you? - Yeah I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never wanted to smack an attendant in my life right, </garnt>
<joey> but when she said that, </joey>
<joey> I was like my hand is my backhand is ready. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and like if you have over like five kilograms </connor>
<connor> or something, which is like, </connor>
<connor> what you're obviously going to have over. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - They charge you like 50 pounds to bring a carry on. </joey>
<garnt> It's ridiculous. </garnt>
<connor> - So dumb. </connor>
<connor> - It's awful (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Because it's right in this fine print, </connor>
<joey> where they tell you you can't check in, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I think that's the big one, </joey>
<joey> I understand, not having, </joey>
<joey> not be able to check in or everything, </joey>
<joey> but like putting it in like the fine print. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's just a dick move. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is like, what is it like? </joey>
<connor> Like Argso designs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> That is it. </garnt>
<connor> - And they have like a million ads, before you even get to, </connor>
<connor> you wanna like get to, </connor>
<connor> like the amount of fucking rental cars, </connor>
<connor> they fucking try and show you, </connor>
<connor> is up the ass online. (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - It's like no, no. </connor>
<connor> - And also even if the plane is completely empty, </connor>
<connor> they won't let you choose seats </connor>
<connor> and they on purpose scatter you, </connor>
<connor> so that they force you to pay to sit next to each other. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But I'm like fuck that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're not doing that, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> I'll see him when I land. Who fuck cares. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's like that. - I'm not that desperate, </joey>
<joey> that I need to be within a two meter radius of my friends </joey>
<connor> all the time, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - We have something similar in Australia, </joey>
<joey> It's called Jetstar. </joey>
<connor> - Every every fucking like continent has that. </connor>
<joey> (Joey exclaiming) </joey>
<joey> - That's so bad. </joey>
<joey> I fucking flew Jetstar once from Sydney to Brisbane. </joey>
<joey> And it was like an hour and a half flight, </joey>
<joey> but it's the worst fucking flight I've ever been on. </joey>
<connor> - God. </connor>
<connor> - Like delayed three hours for no reason. </connor>
<connor> And then you get there </connor>
<connor> and then it's like 60 million years </connor>
<connor> for the luggage to come out on the other side. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, where's is this luggage? </connor>
<joey> - God it's like, you've been on Norwegian? </joey>
<joey> You've been on Norwegian right. </joey>
<garnt> - I've been on them. </garnt>
<connor> - You'll fucking hate Norwegian airlines. </connor>
<joey> - It's all right. </joey>
<connor> - Norwegian's okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's not, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Like compared to other budget airlines, </connor>
<garnt> Norwegian is like the Rolls Royce of budget airlines man. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - Like. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's 'cause it's the only budget airline, </connor>
<connor> that's like long haul I swear, </connor>
<connor> and you can do you can have a 12 hour flight </connor>
<connor> and they will give you no food. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - On Norwegian? - You have to pay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but like any any budget airline that has movies, </garnt>
<joey> - I think... </joey>
<garnt> - That has a movie choice is already, </garnt>
<garnt> like better than 90% of... </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it only has movies, </garnt>
<connor> because they don't make those planes, </connor>
<connor> the ones that do long haul, without them built in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think they do that anymore. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's possible, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure if they could have removed the TVs </connor>
<connor> and made you pay for them, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure they would have. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> But like the fact that they can go 12 hours </connor>
<connor> and not give you food, like blows my mind. </connor>
<joey> - I've never been on Norwegian airline that long. </joey>
<connor> - Don't. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say I've been on worse, </garnt>
<connor> - And and also it's a 12 hour flight right </connor>
<connor> and they try and they charge you for like a carry on. </connor>
<joey> - Where the fuck were you flying to? </joey>
<connor> - LA to UK. - UK to LA, </connor>
<joey> - And always Norwegian. - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Because they were by far the cheapest. </connor>
<joey> - You guys didn't have like American or United </joey>
<connor> or anything? </connor>
<garnt> - There's America. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then- - So- </garnt>
<garnt> - But they were more like double the price. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Broke as fuck, so it was like either Norwegian, </garnt>
<connor> which was pretty consistently always like 400 bucks. </connor>
<joey> Return. - Jesus. </joey>
<connor> - From London to LA and then the next stop, </connor>
<connor> was like United which was like 500 </connor>
<connor> but back then is like 100 bucks. </connor>
<connor> I was like, that's a big deal. </connor>
<connor> Like that's a slightly better hotel. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, it wasn't 400 to 500, </garnt>
<connor> it was like 400 to 600. </connor>
<connor> - 600 to 700. - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - I think you got what you paid for. </connor>
<connor> I think that Norwegian is good for the price. </connor>
<joey> And if you're like someone broke, </joey>
<joey> who's trying to go to like AX or something, </joey>
<joey> or trying to go to LA for for the... (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - But it was just like every single time. </connor>
<joey> - You just run the risk of you know dying of starvation, </joey>
<connor> - Every single time I was on the plane, </connor>
<connor> I was fucking hungry. </connor>
<connor> - Just eat a shit ton before you get on, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Bring a ton of snacks </connor>
<joey> and you'll be good. </joey>
<joey> - You just have to fast on air. </joey>
<garnt> - The first time I didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know that, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I saw that you could pay for a meal. </connor>
<connor> But I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, they'll give you like a snack or something. </connor>
<connor> Nothing. You don't get anything. </connor>
<joey> You get nothing. </joey>
<joey> - Would you like this granola bar for $6. </joey>
<connor> (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - And like these chairs, I don't know how they, </connor>
<connor> it's like they've engineered these chairs, </connor>
<connor> to be fucking god awful. </connor>
<connor> Like, at least other airlines, have semi competent chairs, </connor>
<connor> but for some reason on Norwegian airlines, </connor>
<connor> they fucking handcrafted this shit, </connor>
<connor> to be disgusting and painful. </connor>
<connor> And if you get in the middle row of the four, </connor>
<connor> it's like just give up on being happy in life, </connor>
<connor> for the next 12 hours. </connor>
<connor> And one time I went on it, </connor>
<connor> And there's, I was on the end, the aisle seat, of the three. </connor>
<connor> Okay, well, it's not the middle of the four. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm happy. </connor>
<connor> And this couple were like making out next to me. </connor>
<connor> I swear they were fingering each other. </connor>
<connor> Because I was like, this is disgusting. </connor>
<connor> I wanna die, please, please. </connor>
<connor> And no amount of like, don't look at the side, </connor>
<connor> could like focus me on Game of Thrones Season Four </connor>
<connor> or the fuck I was watching. </connor>
<connor> I was like, please, please, please. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's like this the one time </joey>
<joey> you curse that you have a periphery, right? </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Because the one every time, </connor>
<connor> I would take my headphones off for a second, </connor>
<connor> I could hear like (mimicking) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Tell you what, if you're gonna go on a budget airline, </connor>
<connor> just pay 300 bucks for a good pair </connor>
<connor> of noise canceling headphones. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Honestly, like, that's the best advice I can give you. </connor>
<connor> Don't cheap out on them. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what it is about </garnt>
<garnt> the airplane design of seats, that are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> ergonomically designed to be the most uncomfortable thing </garnt>
<garnt> you've ever sat on. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you see those standing seats they were trying to make. </connor>
<garnt> - No. - What </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like to fit more people in, </garnt>
<garnt> they're trying to make standing seats for airlines. </garnt>
<garnt> So that like they can fit more people, </garnt>
<connor> its just basically like this, </connor>
<garnt> - At this point, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the difference between that and just being cattle? </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, we're just we literally being herded in. </garnt>
<connor> - Obviously it was the budget airlines trying to do this. </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - It's like fucking sardines. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - 'Cause they were like, </joey>
<connor> we can fit 20% more passengers in the economy, </connor>
<joey> if we do this. </joey>
<joey> - But no one wants that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - No passenger wants that. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause their argument, was that if it's a two hour flight, </connor>
<connor> you can stand for two hours? </connor>
<joey> - No, no, I don't want to. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, it's terrible. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking awful. - What's that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't mind a one hour flight, I'm like, whatever. </joey>
<connor> But like when it's 12 hours, sometimes I like bad seat. </connor>
<garnt> - Even a prison transport system has seats guys, come on. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - They do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even a prison bus you can sit down, right? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> Come on now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's sad man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the point was, is that now that I'm older, </joey>
<connor> I'm grateful that my parents took me on vacation. </connor>
<connor> But when I was a kid I fucking hated it. </connor>
<garnt> - Also now I'm older, I'm glad I have disposable income. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Back to the thinking about to the broke uni student days. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Going back to Christmas? </connor>
<garnt> Did you ever have like any Christmas movies </garnt>
<garnt> or like stuff that you'd watch? </garnt>
<joey> - I never got the concept of Christmas movies </joey>
<garnt> or like holiday movies. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, like my dad is like such a fucking film snob. </connor>
<connor> - I hated it. </connor>
<connor> - But the moment he hears the word Christmas movies, </connor>
<joey> he's like, poof. </joey>
<connor> Get a shit away from me. </connor>
<connor> - I had relationships where they would wanna watch, </connor>
<connor> fucking around that time, </connor>
<connor> they would just be obsessed with watching </connor>
<joey> the same fucking movies and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't wanna watch for the 50th time." </joey>
<joey> - I'm currently in that relationship right now. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fucking man. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you know what? </joey>
<connor> "Disney movies are fine, </connor>
<connor> but can we know not watch just Disney movies? </connor>
<connor> Can we just watch something else? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I'd rather that, </joey>
<joey> than the shitty live action Christmas movies. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's always, </joey>
<joey> they always have like the same kind of titles. </joey>
<joey> It's always the same theme of like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's a romantic comedy kind of, </joey>
<joey> but it's also wholesome." </joey>
<joey> And by the way, the entire soundtrack to the movie, </joey>
<joey> is Christmas carols. </joey>
<joey> Have fun. </joey>
<joey> - Every relationship I've been in, </joey>
<connor> they're like, "Yeah, </connor>
<connor> I love this Christmas movie and they put it on, </connor>
<connor> it's fucking Elf, it's always Elf." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's always Elf. </garnt>
<connor> - It's always fucking elf. </connor>
<garnt> - Elf is like the Christmas class. </garnt>
<joey> - I was trying to... </joey>
<joey> - Its like The Office for like white people </joey>
<joey> but on Christmas (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - I was trying to convince Aki that Die Hard </joey>
<garnt> is a Christmas movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is, a Christmas movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - She did not believe me. </garnt>
<connor> She was like, "Die Hard the fucking yappy KI1 " </connor>
<connor> Yes the Ep KI1 that is a Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - There are two things that I know </connor>
<connor> that I will probably not get on with the person </connor>
<connor> that if that if they say like if they love Disney movies </connor>
<joey> more than like a healthy amount, </joey>
<joey> or if they want a horse. </joey>
<joey> Those are the two. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> The two ways I know I'm probably not gonna get on with them. </joey>
<joey> Some slides. </joey>
<joey> - What is it? What is it about horse speeding? </joey>
<connor> - Everyone his haul skills are crazy man. </connor>
<connor> - Because they they're gonna love the horse. </connor>
<garnt> Especially being a relationship with one. </garnt>
<garnt> They're gonna love the horse more than they ever love you. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, and that's just like, that's a fact. That is 100% </garnt>
<garnt> - Horse skills are just the equivalent of car dudes. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - It's dudes with a Honda Civics in the profile picture. </connor>
<connor> - No offense, Alexi, but... </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never, at least with us like we never got like, </garnt>
<connor> especially with like Halloween movies as well. </connor>
<connor> It's like Halloween movies, Christmas movies. </connor>
<connor> Are there even Easter movies? Is that a thing? </connor>
<connor> - They try to make that. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that a genre? </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - That shouldn't be a genre of Easter movies. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Passion of the Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> [All] The passion of Christ. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - Passion of the crisis at least a movie. </joey>
<joey> Good old fun. </joey>
<connor> - One time my best mate, his dad for his like 14th birthday </connor>
<connor> got in fucking Bruno on DVD. </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<connor> He had no idea what it was. </connor>
<connor> But his joke was like, I think you're gay son. </connor>
<connor> So his Bruno. </connor>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - No joke. I remember I went to his house, </garnt>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> What the fuck happens in this family? </connor>
<garnt> We watched fucking Bruno like 15 at his house. </garnt>
<garnt> And I mean so confused with some other things. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just like the equivalent just like, </joey>
<joey> here you go."Why are you gay?" </joey>
<connor> - Why are you gay? </connor>
<garnt> - You are gay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's Bruno, he was that one kid where his parents </garnt>
<connor> just didn't seem to give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, yeah, sure you can watch porn. </connor>
<connor> Where are you two heading? </connor>
<joey> - All right, whatever. We'll get to it eventually. </joey>
<connor> All right, just just get a head start, you'll be good. </connor>
<garnt> - So fucking weird, so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> watching some of the Christmas movies. </garnt>
<joey> But I do like the feeling of just getting together </joey>
<joey> and watching a movie. </joey>
<joey> Like, it doesn't necessarily have to be a Christmas right? </joey>
<joey> - That's what I understand. </joey>
<connor> - I like watching like family movies, </connor>
<garnt> especially on Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - My parents just have shit tastes and movies. </connor>
<joey> - What? Wait, what's the definition of a family movie? </joey>
<joey> Like a rom com? Or? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I showed my parents like Wolf children </garnt>
<joey> with the family. </joey>
<joey> - That was like a very nice, </joey>
<joey> it was it was nice family bonding. </joey>
<connor> - I can not get my parents to watch anything animated. </connor>
<joey> There like," Cartoons, no, no, no." </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no this was something I had to like, </connor>
<connor> slowly slip in the idea for years. </connor>
<connor> This is like this was like inception. </connor>
<connor> You know, for years, I would be like... </connor>
<connor> - Plant like seed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you don't just like rock up </connor>
<connor> and Christmas and be like, "Mom, Dad, I want to show you </connor>
<garnt> some animated titties." </garnt>
<garnt> No, you gotta like plant the seed to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yo, there's this." </garnt>
<connor> - Like, I could not get my parents to like </connor>
<connor> no matter what I do, they would refuse. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, my dad was like fucking strict about his movies. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause again, he's a fucking film snob. </joey>
<joey> So he's like, "The only anime movies that I will like </joey>
<joey> and enjoy is Akira and Wicked City." </joey>
<joey> "If it doesn't have animated, I ain't interested. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </joey>
<joey> - I think to people in the UK, </joey>
<joey> especially around my parents age, </joey>
<joey> to them anything animated equals for children. </joey>
<joey> - Right? We should show them Wicked city. </joey>
<connor> (chuckles) - I'm sure if I did... </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - My dad like Ninja Scroll as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your dad has taste, man. </garnt>
<garnt> But those are the only three movies, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, "Is it violent, does have titties in it? </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt chuckles) I'll watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - Hell ya. - So there's no way... </garnt>
<garnt> - Already a Christmas movie, though, is it? </garnt>
<joey> - No, I don't expect my dad to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, son, Merry Christmas. Let's watch Wicked City." </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I never got the idea of holiday movies. </garnt>
<garnt> I just never really saw the point. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, again, for us, like Christmas was like, </garnt>
<joey> a time to like celebrate with like family. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like do believe in the so called </garnt>
<connor> like Christmas spirits and everything like that? </connor>
<connor> - What do you think I'm? </connor>
<connor> Do you think... </connor>
<connor> - Well I don't know, because like, It's different now. </connor>
<connor> But the only the only thing that's different now </connor>
<connor> really is being a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like my like my entire life, </connor>
<connor> up until I became a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> Christmas was this like special holiday. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it was a holiday. </joey>
<joey> Like, especially if you're in like an office job as well. </joey>
<joey> It was the biggest holiday of the year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so I don't know it was just like it. </joey>
<joey> I feel like I got programmed into thinking </joey>
<joey> that this was like a just a special holiday. </joey>
<joey> And even if I wasn't my family, </joey>
<connor> you know, something like watching Christmas anime for me, </connor>
<connor> like watching like some of my favorite Christmas anime, </connor>
<connor> like The Disappearance of Haruhi. </connor>
<connor> He was just like that. </connor>
<connor> That's something I could never get bored of watching them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, me too. </connor>
<connor> - It's a Christmas Day. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<joey> I know you love (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't give a shit about most Christmas movies. </joey>
<garnt> But give me that Christmas anime man. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I never I never chopped up. I never thought. </joey>
<garnt> Oh... </garnt>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - I suppose it's weird for you. </joey>
<garnt> Because you grew up in a country where sunny and Christmas, </garnt>
<joey> you know? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Every Christmas movie... </joey>
<garnt> - There's no there's no concept of like, </garnt>
<garnt> grabbing a blanket and cuddling up on the couch </garnt>
<connor> to watch a Christmas movie. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Because you'd be sweating. (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - Always fucking cold in the UK. </joey>
<connor> So it's like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - For us, It's like, "Oh, Merry Christmas, </joey>
<connor> let's turn it on the cricket." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> that was in for us. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I think that as I get older, </connor>
<connor> I think I appreciate the idea of it more, </connor>
<connor> which is just spending time with families. </connor>
<connor> My little brother lives with my parents </connor>
<connor> and my older brother doesn't live too far away. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - So it's not often to go visit him. </connor>
<connor> But for me it's, 'cause I haven't seen them </connor>
<connor> in over like a year I guess, when I moved to Japan. </connor>
<connor> And originally they were like, </connor>
<connor> "You want to come back for Christmas Kotah? </connor>
<connor> Like the first Christmas was like three months </connor>
<joey> after I moved here. </joey>
<joey> "Like No, I just got here." </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> I'm not coming back, fuck that, I'll come next Christmas." </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna celebrate Christmas with the boys. </joey>
<joey> - I'll come next Christmas site, that never happened. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my family and like over a year and a half now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Is that weird, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - No, it's weird. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm sure you would have seen them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I would have normally, yeah, definitely seen them. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We would not be here right now if the regular Corona. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Probably if it would be back but that's </joey>
<joey> how it is unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> And I guess as I get older, </joey>
<joey> it's made me appreciate that what it is it's an excuse </joey>
<garnt> to go see my family then come off. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. Like I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> Like when as as a kid and as a young adult, </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Who gives a shit about tradition." </connor>
<connor> - I'm too cool. </connor>
<connor> - Who really gives about- </connor>
<connor> - Fuck the system. </connor>
<connor> - Who really gives about tradition and all </connor>
<connor> this stuff but like growing older, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "There is something a bit special </connor>
<connor> about keeping family traditions </connor>
<connor> and doing something special and like, </connor>
<connor> it's, the whole Christmas bear thing </connor>
<connor> is like cheesy and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> But I will say like, </connor>
<connor> doing something special that you do every year on Christmas </connor>
<garnt> that reminds you of how you were as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff that your parents parents like bestowed upon you </garnt>
<garnt> and everything is like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's something special about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You appreciate, I appreciate them all. </garnt>
<garnt> Like those like I really liked as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't get as a teenager and a young adult. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, more I've grown older the more I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, that's a special thing." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I also wanna just keep in touch with my parents, </connor>
<connor> obviously and just see them as much as I can. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I just thought about I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Fuck, my little kid's gonna be a little shit </garnt>
<garnt> if its raised by me." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, he's gonna fucking, he's gonna fuck </garnt>
<garnt> off the moment he can. </garnt>
<connor> I better instill some values in him to come back and say hi. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> But I'm an old fuck. </connor>
<connor> - "Fuck my dad, you did the same thing." </connor>
<connor> It's like no. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I mean like, as a kid, </connor>
<connor> the highlight of Christmas was the fucking presence, right? </connor>
<connor> As you grow older presence become like a non factor now. </connor>
<garnt> Is when you can just, when you have a disposable income, </garnt>
<joey> - Like, alright, give me the presence. Give me a drink. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because my parents now, they're like, </joey>
<connor> "What do I get you Connor?" </connor>
<connor> Because you know, you buy everything you want. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Well, I don't know actually, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. Think of something." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - "Yeah, money can I ask money?" </garnt>
<garnt> - So now our presence are just like a non factor, </garnt>
<connor> you you gotta have something to look forward </connor>
<connor> to for the Christmas holidays, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<joey> - Spending time with the family. </joey>
<garnt> - Spending time with the family. </garnt>
<garnt> - Spending time with the family, or the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, to explain what we did last year in Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> We just stayed up to like 3 a.m watching Super Monkey Ball, </connor>
<connor> speed runs and it was fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - That was good. - Amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't belittle it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can we start tradition. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<connor> Obviously I could start that fucking tradition, right? </connor>
<connor> You don't know the magic of Super Monkey Ball speed runs </connor>
<garnt> until you watch one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude that like, especially when you're drunk as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like insane. Like it just defies gravity. </garnt>
<connor> And like, just enjoyment, but it's really entertaining. </connor>
<connor> It was super entertaining. </connor>
<connor> - But we also watch Die Hard right before that. </connor>
<connor> - We did watch, or we did we actually did watch. </connor>
<connor> - Oh we did watch a Christmas movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because that was when I was still naive </garnt>
<connor> and thinking like Die Hard isn't a Christmas movie. </connor>
<connor> And then you guys will like, "No, no trust us." </connor>
<connor> - You can still eating the hotpot, right. </connor>
<connor> While I play it, that's right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then we're like, let's watch a Christmas movie. </connor>
<connor> Die Hard. </connor>
<joey> And then we want something like, "Well, you know what? </joey>
<joey> It's I stand corrected. This is a Christmas movie." </joey>
<connor> - It is Christmas movie. </connor>
<garnt> - You know before fucking Bruce Willis </garnt>
<garnt> just gave up on acting. </garnt>
<garnt> You've seen his recent films. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, fucking how that awful. - Really. </joey>
<joey> - He refuses to like do anything </joey>
<joey> and he's a double doing everything. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - You should watch some of them. </joey>
<joey> - Do you watch, what is it called Hard kill? </joey>
<joey> Watch that movie. </joey>
<joey> - Hard kill? </joey>
<joey> - Hard Kill, watch that movie. </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like a fucking Die Hard. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking watched it </joey>
<joey> and it's oh my fucking god. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I watched Looper, and I was like... </joey>
<garnt> - I just realized the absurdity of that name. </garnt>
<connor> - He does... </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey and Garnt] Hard Kill. </garnt>
<connor> - He does like he just like six movies a year </connor>
<garnt> and there all like straight to DVD. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like a Kadima character, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Seriously, watch these dudes. </joey>
<joey> - Its like a metal geek (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - In some of these scenes he's given so little fuck </connor>
<connor> about trying, that like it's just a dubbed over actor. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like... </garnt>
<connor> - He's so lazy dude. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's take two edgy words and smash them together. </garnt>
<garnt> Like hot death knife, hot kill. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Please okay, this Christmas, we're watching Hard Kill. </connor>
<connor> And you could see how fucking awful Bruce Willis is. </connor>
<joey> - I gonna say I gotta say. </joey>
<connor> - He's fucking terrible. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think the last Bruce Willis film </connor>
<connor> I watched was Looper. </connor>
<connor> And even then it was like, your not even trying. </connor>
<connor> - You've given up, you don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - This guy's made his cash already, like he's just </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - You have made so much money just fucking stop. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That one Joseph Gordon Levitt is like acting, </garnt>
<garnt> Bruce Willis which is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You can you can carry this one." </garnt>
<connor> - (crosstalk) And it's just like Bruce Willis. </connor>
<garnt> He stands up to the set </garnt>
<connor> and apparently like all the things he does </connor>
<joey> is like he agrees to do like three days of shooting right? </joey>
<joey> And that's it like no more, no retakes. </joey>
<joey> - Really. </joey>
<joey> - And hot, anything that physically doesn't require him </joey>
<joey> is a body double. </joey>
<connor> So even if it's like getting on his knees. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like don't you get a body (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<joey> Because he's too lazy to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> I did watch a, I don't know when it was pretty recent. </joey>
<connor> But why it did like a Bruce Willis </connor>
<connor> answers like most googled questions. </connor>
<connor> - He doesn't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - It was one of the most boring wide videos I'd ever seen. </connor>
<joey> Because he just he was monotone the entire time. </joey>
<connor> - At least like Harrison Ford, when you can tell </connor>
<garnt> that he respects the movie and the director </garnt>
<garnt> tries like in Blade Runner, the new one. </garnt>
<connor> He was fucking amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But when he's in interviews, </joey>
<connor> he's like, "I don't fucking give a shit." </connor>
<connor> Bruce Willis is always like that. </connor>
<connor> Like nothing makes Bruce Willis care. </connor>
<connor> Like he literally is like the angriest oldest con, </connor>
<connor> in all of these interviews like, you can tell he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah whatever, I've made my money. </connor>
<connor> I just set up I just tuned up and said words, it's acting." </connor>
<connor> Like all right Bruce Willis fucking out. </connor>
<joey> - God could you imagine if YouTubers get to that point? </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't know I didn't want to say, </connor>
<connor> but some of us are already there. </connor>
<joey> Not us. </joey>
<joey> I mean, some YouTubers already there. </joey>
<connor> - God, I just couldn't imagine just still doing it </connor>
<joey> when I hate this. </joey>
<joey> I'm not like that. </joey>
<connor> - Like especially if you've already </connor>
<joey> made your fucking fortunate and name. </joey>
<garnt> - At that point, you just doing it stay relevant. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but like the thing is like you don't have </connor>
<connor> to stay relevant. </connor>
<connor> If you don't Like at the point of like Bruce Willis, </connor>
<joey> like everyone knows your fucking name </joey>
<joey> and what you look like. </joey>
<connor> - That's why like, no one watches action movies </connor>
<connor> and like that has like a big name to it. </connor>
<connor> That's why they get him, because they can... </connor>
<connor> He just makes it a lot of bank, </connor>
<connor> his name has a lot of poll for action movies, </connor>
<connor> doesn't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - I mean are action movies even like a big thing nowadays? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause John wick is... </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<garnt> - I was gonna say like, aside from john wick. </garnt>
<connor> - But that's the thing right if you can bring it back </connor>
<connor> and you can do it well, with the right actors, </connor>
<connor> like it'll be huge. </connor>
<joey> - Like you're talking about like, ones that aren't falling </joey>
<joey> under like a notable IP. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But John Wick why can't kill (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Like John Wick, wasn't a notable IP, </connor>
<connor> until (indistinct) notable IP. </connor>
<joey> - But when did John Wick one... (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - Hard Kill to me sounds like one of those titles </joey>
<connor> where like say when I when I was in Thailand, right? </connor>
<connor> That I would I would always have this, </connor>
<connor> I would always go to like in like Southeast Asia. </connor>
<connor> There's always these stores that you can buy like, </connor>
<connor> pirated pirated DVD. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you'd go through like you flick through the covers, </connor>
<joey> and you'd see these like the most random movies </joey>
<joey> of these like A-list actors, but you'd never heard </joey>
<joey> of the film before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - That's Hard Kill. </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - That is also all of Bruce Willis' recent filmography. </connor>
<connor> Its old movies like, how is this man doing </connor>
<joey> eight movies a year? </joey>
<joey> How does that happen? How do you have time for that? </joey>
<joey> - I kind of want to just like go through his IMDb, </joey>
<connor> just to see the title. </connor>
<joey> - And it's like, that I think </joey>
<connor> that's the reason why and like, imagine at the time, </connor>
<connor> people would probably didn't give a fuck </connor>
<connor> about action movies until like Terminator came out. </connor>
<connor> And probably at that time, you're like, </connor>
<connor> this is this is crazy. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck like, because I mean, </connor>
<connor> that's not James Cameron directing it, which... </connor>
<garnt> - Like 80's was like a fucking golden period </garnt>
<connor> for action movie. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because it was like the Schwarzenegger, </connor>
<garnt> who's the other one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Stallone. - Stallone, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Claude Van Damme. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean I could, really easily re watch, like so many </garnt>
<garnt> of their action movies. </garnt>
<connor> - And that's also when like martial arts </connor>
<garnt> when results I was drawn to like, kind of... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like before John Wick, </garnt>
<garnt> there was this huge period, where action movies </garnt>
<garnt> were just not putting in the numbers any more. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm so reading these fucking titles, </joey>
<joey> I've never had any of these fucking movies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because they're all straight to DVD. </joey>
<joey> - So we have 2017, First kill. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Acts of Violence, Death Wish, Airstrike, </joey>
<joey> 10 Minutes Gone. </joey>
<joey> Trauma center, Survive The Night. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know any of it. </garnt>
<garnt> By the way, all of those are direct to DVD. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. All of them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sounds like a satire of themselves at that point. </garnt>
<connor> - No one wants to hire him, because why would you, </connor>
<connor> he's just gonna turn up and fucking be lazy. </connor>
<joey> - And this five movies right now that has been announced </joey>
<joey> with Humana that is like to be announced. </joey>
<connor> Midnight in the Switch Grass. </connor>
<joey> - Well we got... - Cosmic Scene. </joey>
<joey> - All right, we're watching one of these on Christmas man, </joey>
<connor> I got it because they fucking awesome, we're gonna watch it. </connor>
<joey> He's given up dude. It's terrible. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God that's really bad. </joey>
<joey> - Stop making films, like why? </joey>
<connor> - Its really sad. </connor>
<connor> - We'll watch one of these on Christmas </connor>
<connor> and tell you how it is next time. </connor>
<connor> - Why? - Oh, my God! </connor>
<garnt> - Do you boys have any plans this Christmas, like? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean... </joey>
<garnt> - I'm curious to see what this Christmas will be like </garnt>
<joey> in the current world situation. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Sure. </joey>
<garnt> - It's probably gonna be the most depressing Christmas </garnt>
<joey> of all time. </joey>
<joey> - Because Christmas in Japan is like it's a bit weird, </joey>
<joey> because... </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna explain what Christmas in Japan is like? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so essentially... </joey>
<joey> - Be it by KFC </joey>
<joey> - Christmas in Japan is sponsored by KFC, basically, </joey>
<garnt> it's like KFC, is the go to place. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did that start? </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan, okay, it's because I did a video </garnt>
<garnt> on this a few years ago, but basically the theory </garnt>
<joey> is that Colonel Sanders right, looks like Santa. </joey>
<joey> ([Garnt Chuckles) That's the theory. </joey>
<joey> Because think about it, right? </joey>
<connor> Think about it. Christmas colors. </connor>
<connor> What are the Christmas colors red? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> What does Colonel Sanders dressed up in red, right? </joey>
<connor> - Doesn't he, white it is I thought. </connor>
<joey> - But the KFC color has red on it and then Colonel Sanders </joey>
<joey> is an old guy with a white beard. </joey>
<joey> Kind of looks like Santa right? </joey>
<garnt> - And I bet if you trace that back, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the most five head KFC employee </garnt>
<joey> like working in the marketing team. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that's basically it, it was a marketing ploy by KFC </joey>
<garnt> to be (crosstalk) basically they were like well, </garnt>
<connor> the Christmas dinner overseas and in the West </connor>
<joey> they have chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They have roast chicken. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> Fried chicken is kind of the same thing right? </connor>
<connor> Like still chicken. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Why don't we try this, Let's try one (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> We're gonna try and sell this, and it just fucking exploded </connor>
<joey> because you can't get a roast chicken in Japan, </joey>
<connor> other than KFC. </connor>
<connor> - Outside of some convenience, </connor>
<connor> I saw this there'll be an employee dressed </connor>
<connor> in a Santa outfit, with a fried chicken. (crosstalk) </connor>
<joey> - They sell like cakes, right? </joey>
<connor> - This is fucking weird, what am I looking at? </connor>
<joey> - It's bizarre. </joey>
<connor> - I'm looking at an Asian man dressed in a Santa costume, </connor>
<connor> selling me fried chicken in the name of Christmas. </connor>
<joey> I'm like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - But it's also weird as well because, </joey>
<joey> like normally like everywhere else in the West, right? </joey>
<garnt> Christmas is like a family thing. </garnt>
<garnt> You gather like mom, dad, grandparents. </garnt>
<joey> Here in Japan it's like a beta balance. </joey>
<connor> - It's a you go on dates. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you all should go to the prom. </connor>
<garnt> That's that's Christmas eve. </garnt>
<joey> - But that part I understand </joey>
<joey> because literally a week later its New Year's Eve right? </joey>
<connor> And New Year's Eve is like </connor>
<connor> a super Buddhist family thing in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So it makes sense... </connor>
<connor> - The opposite of what it is in Western cultures. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - In Wester culture like its like oh, New Year's Eve. </connor>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> See next year parents. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. So I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I personally have I mean, well, this year, </garnt>
<garnt> I plan to go up north to go see Chris. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're gonna we're gonna go </garnt>
<connor> to Nazi Spies and have KFC for Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - For Christmas. (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the plan. That's the plan. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, man, first time ever. </connor>
<connor> I've been lucky five years. </connor>
<connor> First Year, I'm gonna have </connor>
<joey> the true Japanese Christmas experience </joey>
<joey> of eating KFC. </joey>
<joey> I'll let you boys know how depressing it actually is. </joey>
<garnt> But... </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's not like I remember before coming to Japan, </garnt>
<connor> I'd heard so many rumors about Japanese KFC </connor>
<connor> being the best KFC in the world. </connor>
<connor> You ain't tried KFC until you had Japanese KFC </connor>
<garnt> and then I came here and then I hate it </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was just KFC. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The UK one was better even. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought the UK we have a better menu. </joey>
<connor> - It is the most meat KFC I've ever had. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I love the burgers, the chicken sandwiches </connor>
<garnt> that you get in KFC. </garnt>
<garnt> That's fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, they're fucking awesome. </garnt>
<connor> - In the UK, they're so good as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I don't know what it is about UK, KFC. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is good. - I mean... </garnt>
<joey> - I feel though you guys have kind of perfected </joey>
<joey> like fast food chicken with Nando's right? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that's like South African though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - But we just I think every single fast food chain </joey>
<joey> in the UK has like fried chicken options </joey>
<connor> as a not on its own. </connor>
<connor> Like McDonald's I think some of those popular </connor>
<joey> stuff they sell in the UK is like, </joey>
<garnt> just like a chicken selects </garnt>
<joey> and also like the wrapped chicken. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's fucking amazing, that's the best thing I get. </garnt>
<connor> - That sounds good. </connor>
<connor> And every like dirty kebab </connor>
<connor> still has like the fried chicken option as well. </connor>
<connor> So this is fried chicken everywhere. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Because British is the best KFC, </connor>
<garnt> Japan is like somewhere in the middle </garnt>
<garnt> and then America is like(crosstalk) </garnt>
<joey> - Do I want to feel like shit? KFC it is. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know why, like American KFC </garnt>
<garnt> just stopped trying 'cause there's not like America </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have bad fried chicken options. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just one of the like, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the biggest chains are just the worst in America. </garnt>
<connor> And I don't understand why. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember I was drunk one time </garnt>
<joey> someone gave me a KFC chicken. </joey>
<joey> - In America? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Even drunk me was like this is violent. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<connor> And it's bad if I'm drunk me is like, </connor>
<connor> this is too much. </connor>
<connor> I draw the line at the amount of grease </connor>
<connor> that is on this thing. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like the skin wasn't crispy. </connor>
<connor> It was moist from all the grease it had. </connor>
<connor> That's vile sorry we somehow turn </connor>
<connor> this all around a bashing America. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </connor>
<connor> I love America I do, I just what's going on now? </connor>
<joey> - America can't do chicken correctly. </joey>
<joey> Case in point Chick-fil-A? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Chick-fil-A. </garnt>
<garnt> But like that's why I don't understand why anyone </garnt>
<joey> in America would eat KFC when there's stuff like, </joey>
<joey> chick-fil-A or Popeye. </joey>
<joey> - I never see good reviews on Google Maps or for like KFC. </joey>
<joey> It's always like two stars, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> who's willingly going in here? </joey>
<joey> Stop giving them fucking customers, just stop. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because its Sunday, right and chick-fil-A is closed. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, I mean, not not all parts </joey>
<garnt> of America have Chick-fil-A apparently. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, they don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - East Coast doesn't have Chick-fil- A or something. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - There's like different chains, </garnt>
<joey> different areas as well, I know. </joey>
<connor> But what I know is KFC is the worst </connor>
<connor> fried chicken I've ever had in America. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, honestly, now I feel like Christmas for me </connor>
<connor> is more of like, it's Christmas when I spend it </connor>
<connor> with the people, right? </connor>
<joey> So it doesn't have to be on Christmas Day. </joey>
<connor> Around the time give or take </connor>
<joey> as I hang out with some friends. </joey>
<joey> - It could be like a week before. </joey>
<connor> - Get a few drinks. </connor>
<joey> - Just be like let's just do an early Christmas. </joey>
<connor> - Strange a few gifts, you know , its Christmas. </connor>
<garnt> - I do want to do something on Christmas, </garnt>
<connor> because this... </connor>
<connor> - I do. </connor>
<connor> - I find like Christmases where I've done nothing before. </connor>
<connor> And it is a bit depressing when you're just like by yourself </connor>
<connor> or they do nothing. </connor>
<connor> You go on your timeline, you get into twitter </connor>
<garnt> everyone's opening presents with each other just like... </garnt>
<garnt> - But what if you haven't like Christmas Day, </garnt>
<garnt> the next day with your friends? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like alright, whatever, I'm getting it. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's what's worse </garnt>
<connor> is New Year's alone for some reason. </connor>
<joey> - I've had New Year's alone before </joey>
<connor> - Yes, say I have to, and for some reason, </connor>
<connor> It's more depressing than Christmas alone. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - I spent New Year's, </joey>
<joey> one year in the worst fucking way possible. </joey>
<joey> I think I was like 16 </joey>
<joey> and I was working up at a ski field the first time </joey>
<joey> I was working up at a ski field. </joey>
<joey> And we're in the middle of Hokkaido in the mountains. </joey>
<joey> It's like fucking minus 30 degrees in a fucking Blizzard. </joey>
<joey> And of course, I'm working that day. </joey>
<joey> I'm outside in the fucking Blizzard shoveling snow. </joey>
<connor> But on top of that, one of the hotels </connor>
<connor> had a blocked sewage system. </connor>
<connor> And I had to get in there with a fucking shovel. </connor>
<connor> So imagine a 16 year old right? </connor>
<connor> In the middle of a fucking blizzard </connor>
<connor> in the mountains. </connor>
<connor> Literally shoveling shit out of the ground. </connor>
<connor> - I like, "Happy New Year" </connor>
<garnt> Like 11 p.m, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And literally the moment we've uncovered the thing, </garnt>
<connor> my boss was like, "Oh it's the next year." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. "Happy New Year." </connor>
<connor> - Did you unclog it? </connor>
<connor> Oh, yeah, we did. - Nice. </connor>
<connor> - But also it was like, cool. </connor>
<connor> My first experience of the New Year is the smell </connor>
<joey> of frozen shit. </joey>
<connor> - And it's only up from there, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, well, sure. </connor>
<connor> It was a good year, but it wasn't. </connor>
<joey> It wasn't the greatest start of the year, </joey>
<joey> that's for sure. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like New Year's like the biggest hoax </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone's put over the case. </garnt>
<connor> - It's never as good as you want it to be. </connor>
<garnt> - It's hyped up as the biggest party of the year. </garnt>
<garnt> And nobody knows what they're doing </garnt>
<garnt> until the day before I swear to fucking (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - Everything's full. Like you can't get in anywhere. </connor>
<garnt> - Everywhere is overpriced. </garnt>
<garnt> Everywhere is full, everyone's doing something </garnt>
<garnt> aside from you, for some reason, </garnt>
<connor> even though you ask a week before, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, what are you doing with New Year's." </connor>
<garnt> and they don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> And yes somehow on New Year's you're that one fucker </garnt>
<garnt> who just has nothing nothing planned. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's always the last one like the last day </garnt>
<joey> of the year, </joey>
<connor> you have the biggest FOMO of the year. </connor>
<connor> And you like (breathes heavily) </connor>
<connor> - It is always somehow always more often </connor>
<garnt> than not doing nothing like always being like, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck I missed out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, you might as well rename New Year's Eve FOMO party, </garnt>
<garnt> because that's what it is. </garnt>
<joey> That's what New Year's Eve is. </joey>
<joey> Everyone goes out because they're afraid of missing out </joey>
<joey> because I've spent New Year's alone before </joey>
<joey> and it is depressing. </joey>
<joey> - Its really depressing. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, it's it's really fucking depressing. </garnt>
<connor> - Shout out to the people out there who's gonna be alone. </connor>
<garnt> - But like, at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> some of my worst fucking nights have been </garnt>
<connor> on New Year's Eve as well. </connor>
<joey> - Its never a good night. </joey>
<garnt> It's always just so stressful because you can never get </garnt>
<joey> like a taxi either. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - If you need to get back, </joey>
<connor> 'cause everyone's getting taxis (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - It only took me one New Year's Eve </joey>
<joey> of going out to know that. </joey>
<joey> All right, next New Year's Eve from now on </joey>
<joey> is just house parties. </joey>
<connor> - The only people who win Uber drivers, man. </connor>
<connor> They're the only ones winning the New Year. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, man. I got, New Years is for the worst. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I just realized how much I hate New Year's </connor>
<garnt> Because I gotta do something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to be sad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like yo, either sad or you're having a shit night, </garnt>
<connor> or you're broke. </connor>
<connor> There's no... </connor>
<connor> - There's no perfect New Year's Eve. </connor>
<connor> - There's no perfect New Year's Eve. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, sure. </garnt>
<connor> - My God, I fucking hate New Year's. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Do you guys have any plans for this New Year? </joey>
<connor> - [Both] No. </connor>
<joey> - I'll figure that out when it comes to it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you'll figure that out before... </connor>
<garnt> - We just said we don't, we nobody knows what they're doing </garnt>
<garnt> until like the day fucking before. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because everyone's they always do this thing </connor>
<connor> for New Year's right? </connor>
<joey> Where everyone's like, </joey>
<joey> "We could go here," like everyone is always like, </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> Everyone's throw suggestions on New Year's but no one wants </joey>
<joey> to commit to it. </joey>
<connor> Because you don't want to be the asshole </connor>
<connor> who took them to a place that's full. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then it's like, "Well, then what?." </garnt>
<connor> Like we're in the... </connor>
<garnt> - Because no one wants to commit 'cause everyone knows, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, this place is gonna be overpriced and full" </garnt>
<connor> Let's leave this until like the last moment, </connor>
<connor> because the thing is, there is no good place </connor>
<connor> for New Year's Eve. </connor>
<garnt> But you have to go to a place, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Like your your maybe your friend can get you </connor>
<connor> into somewhere and then you can only get </connor>
<connor> like half your friends in. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then it's like, well, what the fuck is happening? </connor>
<connor> Do we just leave half off friends </connor>
<connor> and tell them to go fuck themselves? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I'm like the best New Year's Eve party would </garnt>
<garnt> probably be a house party. </garnt>
<garnt> But like no one wants to host a New Year's Eve house party. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<joey> - Sure, it's always like a voting ballot, </joey>
<joey> but you just don't want that. </joey>
<connor> - And even then it's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Do I really like everyone in this party?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like see other people? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like as like a teenager, </garnt>
<joey> if you're hosting a New Year's Eve house party, </joey>
<joey> that house is getting trashed? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You knew it was getting trashed. </joey>
<joey> And no matter how small you wanted it to be? </joey>
<joey> It was never going to be small. </joey>
<garnt> Because it's a New Year's Eve party. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but yeah, because you don't want it to be like </joey>
<joey> because it's somehow like, </joey>
<joey> reverse like depressing when it's like, three people. </joey>
<joey> - Too small and it's depressing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like I'd like I swear like, </joey>
<garnt> as a teenager you'd have like fucking sniffer dogs trying </garnt>
<joey> to sniff out house bodies man you just like, </joey>
<joey> "Where can we go boys? Where can we go?" </joey>
<joey> - "I've heard in the grapevine that there </joey>
<joey> is a house party somewhere around here." </joey>
<connor> - That one mate who knows someone who'd known someone </connor>
<connor> who's less who'd heard about, </connor>
<connor> a house party happening (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - Not proud of it definitely spent a New Year's just going </connor>
<connor> to house parties that like we just full </connor>
<connor> and then not being able to get into any of them. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I was like, "Guess we're just going to Tesco </connor>
<connor> and getting a few beers and just sitting outside." </connor>
<connor> - I've had some of the most like depressing New Year's Eve </connor>
<connor> go it's like trying to like house haunt a house party. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And we just be literally be like, six. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like the time we would stop and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, who's heard some rumors?" </garnt>
<garnt> "We're gonna follow up a rumor. Phone up all your contacts." </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Get the clues, right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Call all the favors you know like... </garnt>
<connor> Because no one wants to be that guy who invites everyone </connor>
<connor> to the house. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - But sometimes, you know I mate he owes you a favor </connor>
<connor> who's out the house party. </connor>
<connor> Your like, "Just give me the general directions." </connor>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - When you've had a friend who just got blackout drunk </connor>
<joey> before midnight, that's like fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I've been there before. </joey>
<connor> - Like, gonna fucking take care of that man, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I've had some New Year's where I've like </joey>
<joey> passed out like 10 p.m. </joey>
