<joey> pleasant feeling so it's a little darker </joey>
<connor> than normal but don't worry about it </connor>
<connor> it's audio </connor>
<garnt> only listen none of us have </garnt>
<connor> photosensitive epilepsy because that was </connor>
<garnt> like dangerous </garnt>

<joey> lucky that uh yeah none of us stuff from </joey>
<joey> that but anyway boys how are you doing </joey>

<connor> feel like a 10. you took like </connor>
<connor> thai food doesn't do that to you you </connor>
<joey> took two shits in the span of an hour </joey>
<connor> it's pretty uh it's pretty remarkable </connor>
<connor> i'm not proud of it joey i'm not </connor>
<joey> uh it happens man don't worry yeah like </joey>
<connor> literally you know that like curry plays </connor>
<garnt> near our house like </garnt>
<garnt> literally every time i come home after </garnt>
<joey> that i'm just like i immediately have to </joey>
<joey> take a [ __ ] and then i wake up in the </joey>
<connor> middle of the night </connor>
<connor> it's unfortunate being like a white guy </connor>
<garnt> who loves spicy food because my body </garnt>
<connor> does not agree with it but i love the </connor>
<garnt> taste of it i mean i suffer the next day </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like being white being southeast </garnt>
<connor> asian being anything your body just </connor>
<connor> doesn't love spicy food like oh really </connor>
<connor> you get that as well no i can handle </connor>
<connor> spicy food but my stomach doesn't like </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> like every time like every time i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like chow down on a massive </connor>
<connor> fat indian right it's like a ticking </connor>
<connor> time bomb okay </connor>
<connor> i don't know i described like a fat in </connor>
<garnt> hungary </garnt>
<joey> and it's a [ __ ] ticking time bomb </joey>
<joey> like i know because there's there's a </joey>
<joey> local indian place i order from then </joey>
<joey> they do it like proper spicy and </joey>
<joey> depending on what time of the day i eat </joey>
<joey> it in </joey>
<joey> like there's a timer where i have to </joey>
<joey> wait six hours and i'm just like gonna </joey>
<joey> be like okay </joey>
<joey> this hour i'm gonna be just like </joey>
<joey> incapacitated on the toilet </joey>
<joey> that's just the way it's gonna be like </joey>
<joey> sometimes when i have it for dinner i'm </joey>
<joey> just like oh no </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna wake up at like 3 a.m </joey>
<connor> sometimes because my stomach just needs </connor>
<joey> to go now </joey>
<connor> oh man i just wa i was gonna say i hope </connor>
<connor> you're enjoying this podcast guys where </connor>
<connor> the first 10 minutes we're talking about </connor>
<joey> violent shits i just thought you it's </joey>
<garnt> very relatable content hashtag </garnt>
<garnt> painful [ __ ] hashtag relatable take a </garnt>
<connor> painful [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> question do you think it's weird that we </connor>
<connor> like listen to ourselves often </connor>
<connor> like because we have to hear our voice </connor>
<joey> all the time yeah i think that's weird i </joey>
<joey> mean it was weird when we first started </joey>
<connor> off right because </connor>
<connor> people at home have you ever listened to </connor>
<connor> your like your voice recorded you </connor>
<garnt> probably hate it right i'm assuming </garnt>
<garnt> right i mean i've never grown out of </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> yeah you're yeah you're still if anyone </joey>
<garnt> should be grown out of it it's you </garnt>
<garnt> i i i hate looking at my own like </garnt>
<garnt> hearing my own voice looking at my own </garnt>
<garnt> content </garnt>
<joey> like whenever i do a collaboration with </joey>
<joey> someone i watch like the bare minimum </joey>
<joey> just to get what's going on and then </joey>
<joey> like i watch every moment of that collab </joey>
<joey> that i'm not in </joey>
<garnt> i'm just like oh i'm in it skip skip </garnt>
<garnt> ahead ah okay okay you're like you're </garnt>
<connor> like in the comments timestamps please </connor>
<connor> of when i'm not </connor>
<connor> why wait so why though like why why can </connor>
<connor> you like i mean okay </connor>
<connor> wait maybe it's the better question </connor>
<connor> asked why can we stand our own voice </connor>
<connor> because that's probably the weirdest </connor>
<joey> idea </joey>
<joey> because you just got used to it right i </joey>
<joey> mean like yeah i don't think anyone grew </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<joey> right and like ever ever went into that </joey>
<joey> situation i'm sure every family had it </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<joey> your parents would just be like you know </joey>
<joey> what there's nothing really to watch oh </joey>
<joey> i found some home videos we can watch </joey>
<joey> those and you're like </joey>
<joey> no thank you because i don't know i </joey>
<joey> always </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hate it when my parents would </joey>
<joey> play home videos in france oh </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah this is always me being a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] idiot yes but it's also </joey>
<joey> it's also but it's also like the i used </joey>
<joey> to have like a [ __ ] squeaker voice </joey>
<connor> when i was like five years old </connor>
<connor> i legitimately used to sound like hi </connor>
<connor> guys </connor>
<connor> and my dad would always [ __ ] rag me </connor>
<connor> on me like man your balls really dropped </connor>
<joey> all of a sudden </joey>
<joey> and i [ __ ] hated that because when </joey>
<joey> you're a kid you're not aware that you </joey>
<connor> have that voice </connor>
<connor> no right because everyone is the same </connor>
<joey> voice around you exactly exactly and you </joey>
<joey> grow with your voice so you don't </joey>
<joey> suddenly be like </joey>
<joey> oh my voice got deeper unless it's like </joey>
<joey> a really </joey>
<garnt> rapid growth like finally yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> you're just like your bull is just </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] dropped </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i thought when it i thought when </garnt>
<garnt> it happened i thought it was gonna go </garnt>
<joey> back </joey>
<joey> i thought it was like i thought i was </joey>
<connor> sick or something right right and </connor>
<joey> everyone at school didn't believe me </joey>
<joey> yeah but that's because your balls </joey>
<joey> dropped like a [ __ ] cannonball right </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> mine kind of dropped yeah mine kind of </garnt>
<garnt> dropped like you know this is just like </garnt>
<connor> putting </connor>
<connor> like a rock in water it's just it's just </connor>
<connor> a very slow drop </connor>
<connor> that's a very slow joke well you know </connor>
<connor> what i mean it's like </connor>
<joey> because you grow with it especially if </joey>
<joey> it's a natural drop </joey>
<joey> then you don't realize that oh i went </joey>
<joey> from [ __ ] alvin and the church </joey>
<garnt> we were really talking about the speed </garnt>
<connor> our balls drops now yeah </connor>
<connor> so you don't watch the podcast at all </connor>
<connor> after we i like that </connor>
<garnt> you don't watch trash taste wow i i </garnt>
<connor> watched like some highlights </connor>
<connor> i i don't know like because i feel like </connor>
<connor> with me i'm just </connor>
<connor> super self-critical and i've always been </connor>
<connor> this way whether it be with my work </connor>
<joey> or myself and that's why like i'd say </joey>
<joey> like i've i've seen </joey>
<joey> anytime i see like criticisms of my </joey>
<joey> videos and my work i'm just </joey>
<joey> i'm more fine with it because there </joey>
<joey> hasn't been something that's been said </joey>
<joey> about me </joey>
<joey> that i haven't already said about myself </joey>
<joey> in some way shape or form </joey>
<joey> so unless i'm like super proud of a </joey>
<joey> video i really </joey>
<connor> i find it difficult to watch it because </connor>
<connor> i see all the things that </connor>
<joey> i kind of could improve on it or that i </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] hate about it </garnt>
<connor> it's just out there i can't like so </connor>
<joey> you're too much of a perfectionist </joey>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> i don't like from one i hate the word </garnt>
<joey> perfectionist but you are a </joey>
<garnt> perfectionist </garnt>
<garnt> and i i like this i prefer the term </garnt>
<joey> self-critical </joey>
<joey> a self-critical perfectionist is what </joey>
<joey> you are essentially </joey>
<joey> because like you have an editor but you </joey>
<joey> also </joey>
<joey> edit your own stuff too right like </joey>
<connor> everything yeah you always do like the </connor>
<joey> finishing touches yeah i always do the </joey>
<garnt> finishing touches </garnt>
<joey> and like when there's a collab where i </joey>
<garnt> have zero control over i'm that's just </garnt>
<joey> like i wake up in a cold sweat but i'm </joey>
<joey> not like </joey>
<garnt> what if i just look like an [ __ ] on </garnt>
<garnt> this one oh you know it's </garnt>
<joey> so wait so then how do you get through </joey>
<joey> your editing process because you have to </joey>
<joey> listen to yourself right over and over </joey>
<garnt> and over again </garnt>
<joey> yeah so are you just like cringing </joey>
<joey> internally as you're like ah i need to </joey>
<connor> edit this </connor>
<connor> cause you you're doing like you know you </connor>
<connor> you had jokes you had punch lines yeah </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> you not like think damn that was a good </connor>
<garnt> delivery i nailed that delivery </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and sometimes i listen to a joke </garnt>
<garnt> and i edit it for like three hours and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like this joke's not funny </garnt>
<garnt> anymore </garnt>
<garnt> and i just cut it and it's it's it's a </garnt>
<garnt> weird thing where </garnt>
<garnt> depending on how my mood is my video </garnt>
<garnt> could just be completely different </garnt>
<garnt> like i could i could just be watching </garnt>
<garnt> myself and i'm just like i hate i hate </garnt>
<garnt> this part i'm gonna just </garnt>
<garnt> re-record this entire segment even </garnt>
<garnt> though it's gonna add like two three </garnt>
<garnt> hours to my [ __ ] video making process </garnt>
<joey> and then i do it see that's why i'm glad </joey>
<joey> that i got an editor that has comp </joey>
<joey> that i gave complete creative freedom so </joey>
<joey> because i'm pretty sure you were talking </joey>
<joey> about this earlier but like </joey>
<joey> at least with my editor uh he leaves in </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that </joey>
<connor> i would have otherwise cut out no that's </connor>
<connor> that's what i like i i tell </connor>
<connor> anyone i hired edit for me i'm like i </connor>
<connor> don't care how bad it makes me look yeah </connor>
<joey> just make it funny yeah like </joey>
<connor> please make it funny because because the </connor>
<connor> at least right you're gonna get the </connor>
<connor> draft right and you're gonna check it </connor>
<connor> and if it's really [ __ ] bad then you </connor>
<connor> can just tell them to cut it out but a </connor>
<garnt> lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> it's like oh i in my head i was i </garnt>
<garnt> thought this was not going to make it </garnt>
<garnt> into the video but he kind of </garnt>
<garnt> twisted it in a way where it's like oh </garnt>
<joey> you know what that's kind of a funny bit </joey>
<joey> i never thought about </joey>
<connor> yeah like where i like fail a joke and </connor>
<joey> i'm like let me do that again yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> they leave that in yeah yeah that's just </garnt>
<garnt> a joke </garnt>
<joey> i mean i guess it's like the difference </joey>
<joey> between like heavily scripted content </joey>
<joey> and more like improvised content because </joey>
<joey> there are times when </joey>
<connor> i think i have like a [ __ ] banger of </connor>
<connor> a joke and then i watch it like 30 times </connor>
<connor> as i'm editing it </connor>
<joey> and i have to like question whether it </joey>
<joey> was funny in the first place or whether </joey>
<joey> i've </joey>
<joey> seen it so many [ __ ] times i just </joey>
<garnt> lost all like </garnt>
<connor> comedy comedic effect to me the the </connor>
<connor> reason i asked that question earlier was </connor>
<connor> because i i saw a video i don't know i </connor>
<connor> don't know if it was a ted talk it </connor>
<connor> sounds like a ted talk topic </connor>
<joey> but it was something like people </joey>
<joey> everyday people should just like </joey>
<joey> record their voice and listen to it so </joey>
<joey> they can improve their speaking in </joey>
<joey> general to be more confident right </joey>
<joey> yeah because that theory was that your </joey>
<joey> overall </joey>
<joey> general quality of life in like doing </joey>
<joey> anything in daily life </joey>
<joey> improve drastically if your speaking is </joey>
<joey> more confident like if your voice is </joey>
<joey> more </joey>
<garnt> i agree with you i would agree with that </garnt>
<garnt> and i think in general definitely like </garnt>
<joey> if there's been the one big thing in my </joey>
<joey> life that has </joey>
<joey> done me solids it's it's the voice tip </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> and talking you know for sure yeah just </garnt>
<joey> going at it i don't know </joey>
<joey> and i maybe think a lot i'm like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> i guess i'd never really thought about i </joey>
<joey> mean obviously </joey>
<joey> you know people say oh you have nice </joey>
<joey> voices yeah not to stroke my [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dick but </joey>
<joey> you know that's the compliment i get the </joey>
<joey> most right and i thought you were </joey>
<joey> putting voices </joey>
<joey> that's the reason i became a voice actor </joey>
<connor> because people were telling me like hey </connor>
<joey> you have a nice voice and i thought </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] you know you what you're right </joey>
<connor> i'm like damn </connor>
<connor> i do kind of i'm kidding because when i </connor>
<joey> first recorded myself i thought it </joey>
<joey> sounded like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and then everyone thinks that though </joey>
<garnt> right right but then it's one of those </garnt>
<garnt> things where i think that </garnt>
<garnt> it's definitely helped me a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> because not only have i improved my </garnt>
<connor> enunciation and just general </connor>
<connor> patterns of my speech it just made my </connor>
<connor> whole life more confident by </connor>
<joey> doing that yeah because you have general </joey>
<connor> self-confidence yeah because </connor>
<garnt> because if i'm hearing it i'm like damn </garnt>
<connor> i sound good yeah like </connor>
<connor> is that conceited as [ __ ] no no no no no </connor>
<garnt> i mean i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's just you just you get a skill </garnt>
<garnt> set by practicing it right </garnt>
<connor> i mean like you get you get happy with </connor>
<connor> the ability that you have to like </connor>
<connor> change it and make it sound the way you </connor>
<garnt> want i think yeah and like i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> even just being on trash taste and just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> like i don't watch every episode that </joey>
<joey> i'm in but like i still will have to </joey>
<joey> watch like certain clips just to check </joey>
<joey> in and everything like that </joey>
<joey> and i feel like especially my speaking </joey>
<joey> skills has gotten a lot and better </joey>
<joey> i've gotten a lot better i of course i'm </joey>
<garnt> so on point </garnt>
<garnt> as soon as i say that you really drove </garnt>
<joey> that point home </joey>
<joey> thank you oh my god no i agree like i </joey>
<connor> used to [ __ ] hate </connor>
<garnt> public speaking like in school it was oh </garnt>
<garnt> me too the worst thing </garnt>
<garnt> and which was weird because i used to be </garnt>
<joey> part of my school's debating team like </joey>
<joey> we had like a debating team </joey>
<joey> and you know it was like groups of three </joey>
<joey> and you'd usually go against other </joey>
<connor> schools about whatever the [ __ ] it was </connor>
<joey> yeah we do not have this in the uk i </joey>
<joey> don't think unless you're in oxford </joey>
<connor> cambridge i don't think so </connor>
<joey> i definitely didn't have this where i </joey>
<connor> grew up well yeah i mean it was </connor>
<connor> literally just the three of us </connor>
<connor> yeah and so i was i decided to join that </connor>
<connor> because i realized how much i [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hated public speaking </connor>
<connor> and how bad i was just speaking in </connor>
<connor> general so i was like </connor>
<connor> how old are you and you decided to do </connor>
<connor> this this was in actually this no this </connor>
<joey> was in elementary school so this is like </joey>
<joey> god damn sixth grade so like eleven </joey>
<joey> twelve-year-old jerry's like you know </joey>
<connor> what i have a deficiency </connor>
<connor> i would like to improve yeah i'm going </connor>
<joey> to do that you know you know what like </joey>
<joey> watching all those like squeaker family </joey>
<joey> videos man i was just like </joey>
<joey> i knew i didn't </joey>
<garnt> so basically yeah so i joined this </garnt>
<garnt> debating team um </garnt>
<garnt> and of course like i was in it for like </garnt>
<garnt> two years but </garnt>
<garnt> i was still nervous as [ __ ] like i was </garnt>
<garnt> very fiddly and kind of </garnt>
<joey> i had this really bad habit of swaying </joey>
<joey> as i talked yeah yeah like you don't </joey>
<garnt> realize how many subconscious things you </garnt>
<garnt> do until you get filmed </garnt>
<joey> yeah why you should record yourself yeah </joey>
<connor> no and that and that's what we did all </connor>
<connor> right so </connor>
<connor> my parents sometimes would come to these </connor>
<connor> debating things with </connor>
<connor> other schools and of course they would </connor>
<joey> record it just for memory's sake </joey>
<joey> and of course i'd be forced to watch it </joey>
<joey> during our </joey>
<joey> family [ __ ] you know family videos on </joey>
<connor> the 4k </connor>
<connor> monitor exactly </connor>
<garnt> jesus christ i look like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> schizophrenic patient </garnt>
<joey> i'm just i'm just [ __ ] fiddling like </joey>
<connor> so my conclusion is </connor>
<connor> yeah but you were 12 dude i've already </connor>
<joey> shipped my pants at that situation </joey>
<joey> all the other like schools we went up </joey>
<garnt> against yes we're just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> chatter [ __ ] yes yes your honor let me </garnt>
<garnt> let me defend </garnt>
<garnt> myself and my colleagues right here is </garnt>
<garnt> like and meanwhile i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> you have a point but no </garnt>
<garnt> it was that level it was [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> horrible </garnt>
<garnt> but then so i i tried to use that skill </garnt>
<garnt> when i first started doing youtube </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but of course like everyone's first </garnt>
<garnt> youtube videos it's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it [ __ ] sucks and you know i had that </garnt>
<garnt> i still have this problem to this day </garnt>
<connor> where i say </connor>
<connor> like and you know way too much yeah and </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> people on trash taste the point of that </connor>
<connor> being like yeah take a shot every time </connor>
<joey> joyce is like or you know </joey>
<joey> and you'll be dead in the first five </joey>
<garnt> minutes you have like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone subconsciously has a lot </garnt>
<joey> of filler words that you don't normally </joey>
<joey> hear yourself saying because it's </joey>
<joey> filler words when you say it you kind of </joey>
<joey> like fill in the gap yourself and </joey>
<garnt> there are times when i say like a lot </garnt>
<garnt> and then there are times when i just </garnt>
<joey> swear a lot as well yeah it's either </joey>
<joey> like you know or [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> that's my three words but also i'm </connor>
<connor> sitting there </connor>
<connor> right you know i'm a viewer right who am </connor>
<joey> i to be like </joey>
<joey> your company just like too much you know </joey>
<connor> as if they'd as if they have like the </connor>
<connor> most immaculate speech </connor>
<joey> who are you who are you to judge </joey>
<joey> it's like do you go around not saying </joey>
<joey> the word like ever </joey>
<joey> in your speech like with any other </joey>
<connor> people like i don't know i guess it's </connor>
<joey> because uh </joey>
<joey> is it is it i don't know i i don't get </joey>
<garnt> it because i i i understand </garnt>
<joey> that everyone has [ __ ] that they do yeah </joey>
<joey> they might want to change </joey>
<joey> but there's somebody my eye [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> why do you need to feel the need to like </joey>
<joey> tell people i guess wow there's really </joey>
<joey> something right yeah you're right </joey>
<connor> you're good you keep talking okay yeah </connor>
<joey> but um what were we talking about </joey>
<joey> yeah so like you know youtube videos </joey>
<joey> fixing your </joey>
<garnt> speech yeah because i feel like when </garnt>
<garnt> when people see </garnt>
<garnt> when people see doing stuff on youtube </garnt>
<joey> nowadays it's like the expectation is </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> for some reason the expectation is they </joey>
<joey> must know what they're doing they're </joey>
<joey> professionals right right and it's </joey>
<joey> really weird because </joey>
<joey> i remember the first time i felt this </joey>
<joey> was when i started to get asked to do </joey>
<joey> like panels and stuff </joey>
<joey> oh and i was thinking to myself i've </joey>
<joey> never been good at public speaking my </joey>
<joey> entire [ __ ] life </joey>
<joey> and just because i have this audience </joey>
<joey> this virtual audience on youtube </joey>
<joey> like conventions and stuff especially </joey>
<joey> expect you to like be in </joey>
<joey> like a top-tier panelist and stuff i'm </joey>
<joey> just like this is a skill i had to like </joey>
<joey> learn trial by fire you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> because my first few panels were [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and i felt like [ __ ] because i was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> at public speaking but </joey>
<joey> because you were forced to be put to put </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> they forced you to be put in that </joey>
<joey> situation you just had to learn it on </joey>
<joey> the fly </joey>
<joey> but i do find it funny that just because </joey>
<joey> we're on youtube people do have this </joey>
<joey> expectation of just like </joey>
<joey> yeah they must be really confident and </joey>
<joey> have this professional kind of [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> background </joey>
<joey> otherwise how would they get all these </joey>
<joey> subs right like you couldn't talk </joey>
<joey> probably and they seem to forget that </joey>
<garnt> we all started in the same place making </garnt>
<garnt> videos in our uni bedroom or our parents </garnt>
<garnt> bedroom </garnt>
<joey> parent's basement or something like that </joey>
<joey> in my case it's a little bit </joey>
<joey> different because i hated public </joey>
<joey> speaking but i was always </joey>
<joey> okay in front of large crowds which is </joey>
<joey> weird you think it's kind of character </joey>
<connor> isn't that literally public speaking </connor>
<joey> no but he's not he's the thing </joey>
<connor> no that's the thing though it's like </connor>
<connor> when i was doing the debating team stuff </connor>
<connor> the most we would ever talk in front of </connor>
<connor> was maybe 30 people yeah </connor>
<joey> right and there's some weird it's really </joey>
<joey> counterintuitive but </joey>
<joey> a lot of the times i'm more nervous in </joey>
<joey> front of a small crowd </joey>
<joey> than i am alive i think it's more </joey>
<connor> intimate right like it's </connor>
<joey> if you have to do it in front of people </joey>
<joey> you know especially yeah i think it's a </joey>
<garnt> lot harder because i've done like </garnt>
<garnt> because i used to do uh classical piano </garnt>
<connor> and i </connor>
<garnt> played live at like the sydney opera </garnt>
<connor> house once in front of like a thousand </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] i'm dropping that like yeah i </connor>
<garnt> mean i guess </garnt>
<garnt> that came out of nowhere yeah so yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> basically i i used to do like musically </garnt>
<connor> properly yeah um </connor>
<connor> and i got the chance to perform at the </connor>
<garnt> sydney opera house in front of like </garnt>
<connor> a thousand people 14 15. wow </connor>
<garnt> um and yeah it was just like yeah you're </garnt>
<joey> playing at the opera house </joey>
<connor> i'm like like the opera house like that </connor>
<connor> that's the asian parents dream right </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> my mom </joey>
<joey> did your mum [ __ ] film it and then </joey>
<joey> like frame it and then frame it and then </joey>
<garnt> put in like the safe and stuff yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> of course you did of course i </connor>
<connor> think one thing that really helped me </connor>
<connor> realize that should start not giving a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] is that uh </connor>
<joey> and this is just in general life as well </joey>
<joey> is that like i think i remember who told </joey>
<joey> me this they were like everyone is </joey>
<joey> always </joey>
<joey> way more worried about themselves than </joey>
<joey> they ever are about you oh yeah and so </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> if you just think about it like that and </joey>
<joey> think about how you think about it when </joey>
<joey> someone is public speaking </joey>
<joey> i don't [ __ ] care if they're [ __ ] i'm </joey>
<joey> just most of the time i'm just sitting </joey>
<joey> there anyway </joey>
<joey> like they can just say anything and i'll </joey>
<joey> probably be like oh cool yeah all right </joey>
<joey> like unless they like literally [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> their pants on stage i'm not going to </joey>
<joey> think anything bad of them right right </joey>
<joey> so if you go into that mindset of okay </joey>
<joey> i'm going to talk in front of these </joey>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> none of them care really [ __ ] it how can </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] this up i </connor>
<joey> can't be terrible yeah but speech that i </joey>
<joey> feel is a little bit different because </joey>
<joey> even if you do [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> you can very quickly try and fix it </joey>
<connor> right it's a little bit different when </connor>
<connor> you're </connor>
<connor> playing solo piano in front of a crap </connor>
<connor> yeah dude </connor>
<joey> just dude it's not classical anymore </joey>
<garnt> it's jazz </garnt>
<garnt> when you go on stage do you remember the </garnt>
<garnt> stuff you do and the stuff you say </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't remember no [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> like because sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> do you still get nerves when you have </garnt>
<joey> like a big panel or big event </joey>
<joey> no no i get nerves right up until i'm on </joey>
<garnt> stage same here same thing so like on </garnt>
<garnt> the like </garnt>
<joey> up the stairs going onto the stage i'm </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nervous </joey>
<garnt> it's the anticipation yeah it's just </garnt>
<joey> like i just want to get this over with </joey>
<garnt> you know what i mean i just want to get </garnt>
<connor> on stage and just do my [ __ ] yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> the reason why is because you know if </connor>
<joey> you're doing a debate thing </joey>
<joey> no one cares about who you are right </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but when it's your </joey>
<joey> your panel right all the people come for </joey>
<joey> you yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so i could sit there and salt them for </joey>
<joey> 20 minutes they probably like damn </joey>
<joey> connor's exactly like he is on camera </joey>
<joey> hell yeah it's just as much of an </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean like because i mean </joey>
<joey> that that's how you deal with like </joey>
<joey> hecklers right like yeah you just give </joey>
<joey> them [ __ ] yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> everyone's like oh that was funny you </joey>
<joey> know have you ever had hiccups at a </joey>
<joey> panel </joey>
<garnt> yeah one time really yeah what hasn't </garnt>
<garnt> so oh god it was it a [ __ ] hentai </garnt>
<garnt> panel </garnt>
<garnt> and oh well that's of course of course </garnt>
<joey> it's dude r18 panels i've never done one </joey>
<connor> because </connor>
<joey> it's everything i've heard about as a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] horse oh my god i can't if i </joey>
<joey> didn't mention this in like the </joey>
<joey> convention store </joey>
<joey> yeah so i do i i offer to like </joey>
<garnt> conventions i'm like hey do you want me </garnt>
<garnt> to run a hentai </garnt>
<garnt> dubbing panel yeah um and essentially </garnt>
<garnt> what it is is i just get a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> hentai and i blow out the subtitles </garnt>
<garnt> right and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> wing it right just just make [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah people are [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> terrible at it yeah yeah and that's </joey>
<joey> what's funny but eventually you'll get </joey>
<joey> like one person who's actually like </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] funny right yeah and </joey>
<joey> that's what it's for yeah but i think </joey>
<joey> one time i was doing it </joey>
<joey> and there's this dude in the back he </joey>
<joey> must have been like 30 something just on </joey>
<joey> his own </joey>
<joey> and he was just shouting cringe cringe </joey>
<joey> cringe the whole time and i was like do </joey>
<connor> you want to come up he was like </connor>
<connor> no and i'm like well get the [ __ ] out </connor>
<connor> then and everyone was like </connor>
<garnt> golf clubs and then they clap like </garnt>
<joey> everyone no </joey>
<joey> no because our panels there's always </joey>
<joey> that one guy who thinks </joey>
<joey> that like the panel was a youtube </joey>
<connor> comment section yeah </connor>
<joey> and and they always try to like be that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] smart ass and </joey>
<garnt> like throw out that smart ass comment </garnt>
<garnt> and it never [ __ ] it's never [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> funny you know who you are </garnt>
<joey> i don't know i must be blessed because </joey>
<joey> i've never had that at a panel of mine i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<connor> normally at those type of panel the </connor>
<connor> people loud people are good because you </connor>
<joey> could just bring them up yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean if i ever put into that situation </joey>
<joey> i'd do exactly the same thing right </joey>
<connor> god it was terrible stolen the [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> one time there was this hentai and it </connor>
<joey> was </joey>
<joey> brother and sister right and a brother </joey>
<joey> and sister came up to dub it </joey>
<joey> and it was the most the first thing i'd </joey>
<joey> ever done in my life </joey>
<garnt> oh god it was terrible yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> cursed it was so cursed </garnt>
<garnt> i regretted it and it you know when you </garnt>
<garnt> do something you're like this sounds </garnt>
<garnt> hilarious and then it starts you're like </garnt>
<garnt> oh no </garnt>
<garnt> oh no please stop please stop this this </garnt>
<joey> is like immediate regret </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean they offered and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh god yeah this sounds funny </joey>
<joey> and no </joey>
<joey> no no no no no no i've never been </joey>
<joey> tempted to do </joey>
<joey> an r18 panel no i've i've only seen like </joey>
<joey> bad things happening i've only seen and </joey>
<joey> heard the worst thing because here's the </joey>
<joey> thing like if you come to my panel </joey>
<joey> like i'm i'm usually open to any kind of </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] question it is yeah but it seems </joey>
<joey> like when people see </joey>
<joey> r18 in a panel because i've been i've </joey>
<joey> been to r18 </joey>
<joey> yeah they they asked [ __ ] that is not </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> it's it's bad i mean it's not a question </connor>
<connor> it's just </connor>
<connor> dab hentai don't [ __ ] do anything </connor>
<joey> weird yeah and if you do no but what i'm </joey>
<connor> talking about is like the r18 like q a </connor>
<connor> power yeah those are [ __ ] weird i </connor>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> get those it like i don't know what it </connor>
<connor> is some people just think oh it's r18 </connor>
<joey> therefore i can ask them the most like </joey>
<joey> private [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> that they otherwise wouldn't say i'm </joey>
<joey> like no [ __ ] i'm not gonna tell </joey>
<joey> you private [ __ ] just because r18 </joey>
<garnt> i don't care like [ __ ] even my </garnt>
<garnt> therapist doesn't ask this yeah here you </garnt>
<garnt> are </garnt>
<garnt> just asking about the most intimate </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] details of my life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i've never been on another </garnt>
<garnt> 18 panel but i've seen some of the </garnt>
<garnt> questions that has </garnt>
<garnt> some of the questions that have been </garnt>
<garnt> asked on our 18 panels it's horrible </garnt>
<joey> it's horrible </joey>
<connor> it just depends on the crowd doesn't it </connor>
<connor> really sometimes you get real like oh </connor>
<joey> god and sometimes they're quite funny </joey>
<connor> that's the thing it can be funny but </connor>
<garnt> there are just some people who don't </garnt>
<connor> know what funny is like it's funny to </connor>
<connor> them but then the moment it comes out </connor>
<joey> everyone's like </joey>
<joey> yikes you shouldn't have said that i </joey>
<connor> mean that's like discord humor right </connor>
<connor> it's like funny between you and your </connor>
<garnt> friends but not funny to everyone else </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> most of the time so sometimes it's like </joey>
<joey> online humor just doesn't translate into </joey>
<connor> a real real-life situations </connor>
<joey> especially with a lot of discord humor </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean you can tell </joey>
<garnt> when someone's been on discord a little </garnt>
<garnt> too much </garnt>
<joey> when they ask questions like that it's </joey>
<joey> like um okay you need some real </joey>
<connor> interaction </connor>
<connor> man i i i saw this i saw this tweet and </connor>
<connor> i made me think about disco i know i'm </connor>
<connor> keep changing topics here but </connor>
<connor> there was someone who was like um you </connor>
<connor> can't be well adjusted </connor>
<connor> if all your friends are only on discord </connor>
<connor> what do you think about that statement </connor>
<garnt> is that that is a take </garnt>
<connor> um because i thought about it </connor>
<garnt> and uh you know and and i i when i read </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm like that seems way too like </garnt>
<garnt> harsh </garnt>
<joey> yeah but the more i thought about it the </joey>
<joey> more the more people i know who are kind </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> like i don't know and when i was the </joey>
<connor> same when i had friends online i don't </connor>
<joey> think i was very well adjusted when i </joey>
<garnt> only had friends online </garnt>
<garnt> do you know what i'm imagining right now </garnt>
<joey> you know the you know the picture of </joey>
<joey> that stick guy he's just like </joey>
<joey> yeah that that that was that was my </joey>
<connor> exactly yeah </connor>
<connor> it sounds so it sounds too much like </connor>
<joey> that's a bit of a generalization yeah </joey>
<joey> but at the same time i'm thinking </joey>
<joey> huh of the people i know who only have </joey>
<joey> friends on discord and like only have </joey>
<joey> friends on discord </joey>
<joey> um who i've probably like you know </joey>
<joey> especially especially people who have </joey>
<joey> not you know seen </joey>
<joey> anime conventions and stuff right it's </joey>
<joey> like always people who </joey>
<garnt> are a bit weird in terms like how they </garnt>
<joey> are socially adjusted and everything </joey>
<joey> like that this episode is sponsored by </joey>

<joey> difference between </joey>
<joey> online friends and let's say real </joey>
<joey> friends okay </joey>
<joey> because you know i say this as someone </joey>
<joey> who has met </joey>
<joey> most of my friends online and has found </joey>
<joey> my fiance </joey>
<joey> online you know what i mean like i will </joey>
<joey> say that they didn't feel like </joey>
<joey> real friends like until i saw them in </joey>
<joey> real life i feel like that's like </joey>
<joey> sealing the deal </joey>
<joey> because a lot there's there's something </joey>
<joey> about having online friends where </joey>
<joey> there's always that wall of like how </joey>
<joey> well do i really know this person you </joey>
<joey> know what i mean and </joey>
<joey> you could there has been like plenty of </joey>
<connor> times where i've like connected with </connor>
<connor> them immediately you know you guys being </connor>
<connor> like some of them </connor>
<connor> yeah and then there are equally as many </connor>
<connor> times when i've meet them in real life </connor>
<joey> and they're just like </joey>
<connor> wow you were not high and this is weird </connor>
<joey> now and i feel like </joey>
<joey> i've been there you know what i mean and </joey>
<joey> i feel like if you just have that </joey>
<joey> that first step where it is where it is </joey>
<connor> just the online relationship you're </connor>
<connor> missing out on </connor>
<connor> a big part of what it is to you know be </connor>
<connor> friends and be social and everything </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> um i mean i've always been since like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] age 12 </connor>
<connor> i would happily get on [ __ ] voice </connor>
<connor> chat and talk to like [ __ ] 30 year </connor>
<connor> old man </connor>
<joey> why did i do that that's uh yeah that </joey>
<joey> sounds </joey>
<joey> context so he invited me </joey>
<connor> sounds like that chris hanson okay like </connor>
<joey> when you put like cod zombies right i </joey>
<joey> would i would gladly get on the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> mic and like </joey>
<joey> i would like bully these 30 year old men </joey>
<joey> like like i didn't give a [ __ ] dude when </joey>
<joey> i was 12 i would gladly like shout at </joey>
<joey> people like i would be no i didn't love </joey>
<joey> that man well i like the </joey>
<joey> like your anger like </joey>
<joey> my little brother was was too scared to </joey>
<joey> argue people online so when you did </joey>
<joey> start to argue with people online and i </joey>
<joey> was in the other room i'd be like oh and </joey>
<joey> give me the [ __ ] headset i'm going to </joey>
<joey> argue you play </joey>
<connor> so i would [ __ ] shout at them for him </connor>
<connor> yeah because he couldn't do it good and </connor>
<connor> he would lose the arguments i'm like </connor>
<connor> you're not losing the arguments on my </connor>
<connor> account right </connor>
<connor> over my [ __ ] dead body do you think i </connor>
<joey> will allow you to lose this </joey>
<joey> i don't know i would just because it's </joey>
<joey> one of those things right where </joey>
<joey> i would not fall for [ __ ] when i was </joey>
<joey> like 12 or 13 </joey>
<joey> yeah the [ __ ] that they were trying to </joey>
<joey> pull right for some reason </joey>
<garnt> i knew what was happening most of the </garnt>
<garnt> time when i was aware because </garnt>
<garnt> even from like what's happening i was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] playing zombies with them most </garnt>
<garnt> the time mostly </garnt>
<garnt> chill yeah i mean i don't know i think </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was weird back then because </garnt>
<joey> it just started when everyone started </joey>
<joey> voice chatting yeah i think it was new </joey>
<joey> yeah and it wasn't really weird yet now </joey>
<joey> it's weird if you do i think it's super </joey>
<garnt> weird but back then i didn't think of it </garnt>
<connor> as that weird yeah when i was a kid </connor>
<garnt> but maybe i don't know sure i mean back </garnt>
<garnt> then it was like this new thing and now </garnt>
<garnt> with so many [ __ ] weird stories </garnt>
<connor> coming out you've got to be yeah </connor>
<connor> now it's not you know if i had a 12 year </connor>
<garnt> old kid and i thought i'm talking to a </garnt>
<garnt> 30 old man </garnt>
<connor> i'd say i'd like be like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> you doing yeah yeah but like </garnt>
<joey> you know i i get why people will have a </joey>
<joey> lot of online friends </joey>
<joey> because most of the time people search </joey>
<connor> for online friends because they don't </connor>
<connor> find that connection </connor>
<joey> yeah but it's it's the same thing i </joey>
<joey> would say as like you know when you </joey>
<joey> you can have like the best friends in </joey>
<connor> the world but as soon as like you move </connor>
<connor> in with each other and live in the same </connor>
<connor> house that </connor>
<connor> that like change can change a lot of </connor>
<joey> dynamics you know what i mean </joey>
<connor> especially you know you meet someone </connor>
<joey> especially in [ __ ] uni </joey>
<joey> you meet some people you think are chill </joey>
<joey> as soon as you move in with each other </joey>
<connor> you start </connor>
<joey> hating each other yeah that's true and </joey>
<joey> you see all their little [ __ ] ticks </joey>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<connor> stuff that just get on your nerves i </connor>
<connor> mean there was like a i mean i've </connor>
<connor> basically been raised </connor>
<connor> like on the internet right like ever </connor>
<connor> since like age like 11. i was playing </connor>
<connor> runescape i was doing [ __ ] on miniclip </connor>
<joey> like yeah </joey>
<joey> i was and i always did not mind talking </joey>
<joey> to strangers </joey>
<joey> because i always thought like i'm not </joey>
<joey> going to give any personal information </joey>
<joey> you know i never did </joey>
<joey> for some reason i was smart enough to </joey>
<joey> never do anything like that yeah um </joey>
<joey> and there must have been a good chunk </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe like a year in my life where </joey>
<joey> i pretty much only spoke to online </joey>
<joey> people like friends that i i thought </joey>
<joey> were like my friends </joey>
<connor> yeah it must have been the maybe first </connor>
<connor> year of university it's really weird </connor>
<joey> i've </joey>
<joey> i never had a concept of an online </joey>
<joey> friend until i started youtube </joey>
<connor> yeah like i never would get on to like i </connor>
<connor> feel like we were two different sides of </connor>
<connor> like the coin because i </connor>
<joey> i was always like i would always go on </joey>
<joey> because because in my head i was like </joey>
<joey> why would i talk to this random person </joey>
<connor> online when i have irl for instance to </connor>
<joey> talk </joey>
<connor> to well that's this oh that's the way </connor>
<joey> that you go joey's here's where it gets </joey>
<joey> sad i didn't at the time </joey>
<garnt> and the thing is right is that you think </garnt>
<joey> oh this is like because i used to see </joey>
<joey> those those things on twitter because </joey>
<joey> back then you should see these things </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> irl uh online friends or real friends </joey>
<garnt> yeah mom you don't get it you know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah back when tumblr was like you know </garnt>
<joey> pink tumbler </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and i used to totally agree </joey>
<joey> with that because i was like i was 16 </joey>
<joey> that's all i had and then </joey>
<joey> after i like actually actually got real </joey>
<joey> friends i was like </joey>
<joey> oh this is what normal friendship </joey>
<joey> like it's like totally different yeah </joey>
<joey> it's something that like i don't think </joey>
<joey> you realize kind of affects you because </joey>
<joey> you totally think you're fine and </joey>
<joey> i think you can be well adjusted sort of </joey>
<joey> if you have </joey>
<joey> only online friends but it's a lot </joey>
<joey> harder yeah because i feel like having </joey>
<joey> that that irl </joey>
<joey> uh kind of interaction to ground you and </joey>
<connor> make sure you're not doing weird things </connor>
<connor> and you're you know </connor>
<connor> that you're interacting in a healthy way </connor>
<garnt> right i mean because the thing about </garnt>
<garnt> only having online friends is that </garnt>
<garnt> inevitably you are just living </garnt>
<garnt> in your own bubble it is an online </garnt>
<connor> bubble right </connor>
<connor> yeah and you live through what you </connor>
<garnt> present to them yeah exactly right </garnt>
<connor> you're only presenting </connor>
<connor> one side of yourself for the best side </connor>
<connor> of yourself you're not seeing every side </connor>
<connor> of a person </connor>
<connor> so inevitably if you just live in a </connor>
<joey> bubble you know you might luck out and </joey>
<joey> be like okay this is actually a healthy </joey>
<joey> nice </joey>
<joey> nicely balanced bubble but you know most </joey>
<joey> of the time </joey>
<joey> it you're missing some kind of that </joey>
<joey> social interaction yeah </joey>
<garnt> social connection that you just don't </garnt>
<connor> get online unfortunately </connor>
<joey> and i also think because i made a lot of </joey>
<joey> the friends through gaming </joey>
<joey> yeah a lot of the time how you were as </joey>
<joey> friends was dependent on </joey>
<joey> how you were in the game right right and </joey>
<joey> obviously i was normally really good at </joey>
<joey> the games </joey>
<joey> yeah so i was normally like yeah i'm </joey>
<joey> kind of i'm kind of cool you know </joey>
<joey> and it was one of those things where </joey>
<joey> online when i saw these people like i </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> to those friends i was respected and </joey>
<joey> they thought wow this guy's so cool you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> he just does his own thing and but in </joey>
<joey> real life i was a [ __ ] loser </joey>
<joey> and it kind of made this dichotomy in my </joey>
<joey> head where i'm like yeah i'm funny yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm charming and then i go meet up with </joey>
<joey> people and i [ __ ] struggle </joey>
<joey> like i couldn't i didn't know how to </joey>
<joey> because i hadn't really i wasn't very </joey>
<joey> well adjusted </joey>
<joey> yeah and it made me think a lot and </joey>
<joey> makes me look back and i don't know it's </joey>
<joey> like how do you convince someone when </joey>
<joey> they're in that </joey>
<joey> to see it like it when they're in that </joey>
<joey> sense of i only have online friends how </joey>
<joey> do you make them see that maybe they're </joey>
<joey> it's not a healthy relic like it's not </joey>
<connor> very healthy because to them they might </connor>
<connor> be perfectly happy and fine right and </connor>
<joey> that's the thing i </joey>
<connor> i think it's just a matter of </connor>
<joey> perspective right because to them that's </joey>
<joey> all they know </joey>
<joey> yeah so i don't think um until they </joey>
<joey> actually experience the other side </joey>
<joey> of like trying to begin and start and </joey>
<joey> maintain irl friends </joey>
<joey> yeah they just won't know they'll be </joey>
<joey> like why would i do that when </joey>
<connor> this is so much easier and more </connor>
<connor> comfortable and also i realized as well </connor>
<joey> that like </joey>
<joey> when i was predominantly spending all my </joey>
<joey> time online it felt like i could never </joey>
<joey> make any progress </joey>
<garnt> in my life because i i was not investing </garnt>
<garnt> anything in </garnt>
<garnt> real life right i was maybe i'd go to </garnt>
<garnt> work yeah and i would go home but that </garnt>
<joey> was about it right i never made any </joey>
<joey> investment </joey>
<joey> elsewhere right right i felt like my </joey>
<joey> life stagnated because of that </joey>
<joey> because i didn't you know i think when </joey>
<joey> you make friends i don't seek out </joey>
<joey> something else </joey>
<joey> right right because when you make </joey>
<joey> friends irl it's not just that it's like </joey>
<joey> you miss out on a lot of opportunities </joey>
<joey> in general like because you're not </joey>
<joey> putting yourself out there you're not </joey>
<joey> you're not you know </joey>
<joey> maybe other jobs you might hear about </joey>
<joey> you know other you miss out on a lot of </joey>
<joey> things i think yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's not just as simple as </joey>
<joey> having friends and having friends it's </joey>
<joey> like there's a lot of stuff that comes </joey>
<joey> with having our old friends yeah and </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you know i don't know it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> really made me think a lot </joey>
<connor> recently especially because like moving </connor>
<connor> to japan as well it's really made me </connor>
<connor> think a lot </connor>
<joey> yeah because it's been a year right </joey>
<garnt> since it's been a goddamn year since we </garnt>
<joey> moved here my god </joey>
<joey> already this is this has not felt like a </joey>
<connor> year at all </connor>
<connor> jesus yeah 2020 has been [ __ ] weird </connor>
<joey> to be fair </joey>
<connor> but how is it for you guys your first </connor>
<connor> year here in japan </connor>
<joey> spin i mean okay to be fair it's </joey>
<joey> probably you know pretty abnormal year </joey>
<joey> for people who moved </joey>
<garnt> around this time you know it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> been it's it's been a strange year all </garnt>
<joey> around </joey>
<joey> yeah you know it's i don't think i don't </joey>
<joey> feel like i've spent a proper year here </joey>
<joey> in japan </joey>
<joey> mostly because like i felt like part of </joey>
<garnt> the experience i was expecting </garnt>
<garnt> from japan was to have people visit me </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i mean yeah and i had a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of friends who </garnt>
<garnt> had planned to come visit us in japan </garnt>
<garnt> and it just </garnt>
<joey> honestly that's that's half the fun of </joey>
<garnt> living in this country right it's like </garnt>
<garnt> being like oh man </garnt>
<joey> i've always wanted to visit japan or </joey>
<joey> like i'm coming to visit japan and </joey>
<joey> you're just like </joey>
<joey> my boy i got you bro i wanted to be on </joey>
<joey> the other side of that yeah on the other </joey>
<joey> side of that fence because i've been on </joey>
<joey> i've been on the visiting side and i </joey>
<joey> remember how amazing [ __ ] was </joey>
<joey> when i first moved here and everything </joey>
<joey> was so bright-eyed and you could take me </joey>
<connor> to a [ __ ] family mart or a </connor>
<connor> combination and i'd be like </connor>
<connor> yo yo you eat this like katsu curry </connor>
<joey> every day </joey>
<garnt> eat this fried chicken yeah because </garnt>
<connor> sandwiches what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> just watching just watching those </connor>
<garnt> interactions is like </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] fun because yeah because to </garnt>
<joey> you now it's just so normal but yeah </joey>
<connor> it's just so [ __ ] daily yeah dude i </connor>
<joey> remembered like i was at the supermarket </joey>
<joey> and i would i just thought to myself man </joey>
<joey> i remember when i used to think the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> was like insane </joey>
<joey> yeah and like now i feel like there's </joey>
<connor> nowhere else left on earth where i'm </connor>
<connor> ever going to go and it's going to feel </connor>
<connor> magical </connor>
<joey> and i felt kind of sad for a second </joey>
<joey> because that is the final boss </joey>
<joey> because dude because i've been hyping up </joey>
<joey> japan my whole like </joey>
<joey> teenage to adult yeah yeah it was the </joey>
<joey> one place that i always really wanted to </joey>
<joey> go cause i went to america and it was </joey>
<joey> amazing right yeah i loved it because </joey>
<joey> i've always hyped up america to myself </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and then japan was the last </joey>
<joey> place that i hadn't been to </joey>
<joey> that was like i really want to go here </joey>
<joey> because my parents took me to europe all </joey>
<joey> the time </joey>
<joey> and i was kind of sick of you that </joey>
<joey> sounds so [ __ ] privileged </joey>
<joey> i was sick and tired of traveling you </joey>
<joey> know it's no i mean my parents took me </joey>
<joey> to like france </joey>
<joey> every single year and i was like dying </joey>
<joey> that sounds like a [ __ ] luxury dude </joey>
<joey> we were camping in like tents and i just </joey>
<joey> like playing video games and i couldn't </joey>
<joey> play video games for three weeks so it </joey>
<joey> was basically being like </joey>
<joey> forced to be a caveman for three weeks </joey>
<garnt> and like swim i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i swim every day i guess but i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it was basically the last place i wanted </garnt>
<joey> to go and i remember </joey>
<joey> the first time i landed here even though </joey>
<joey> i hadn't slept for like 20 </joey>
<joey> hours i was so [ __ ] hyped yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> this is [ __ ] insane </joey>
<joey> what i can get a vending machine what </joey>
<joey> it's vending machines and they work i </joey>
<garnt> thought i thought i would like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember when i like </garnt>
<garnt> came in for the first time i thought if </garnt>
<garnt> i ever move here i'm going to get </garnt>
<garnt> vending machine coffee </garnt>
<garnt> every [ __ ] day because this [ __ ] is </garnt>
<garnt> awesome right now i can't </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] stand vending machine coffee </garnt>
<garnt> literally everything that's [ __ ] out of </garnt>
<garnt> here just give me my starbucks like i do </garnt>
<connor> everywhere else when you first come here </connor>
<connor> every vending machine you're like i </connor>
<joey> guess i'm getting </joey>
<connor> coffee yeah it's hot coffee baby </connor>
<connor> but yeah now you haven't you're like </connor>
<garnt> this yeah do you remember when first </garnt>
<garnt> moving here and you're like nom nominate </garnt>
<garnt> which is all you can drink </garnt>
<garnt> like was like god [ __ ] it was like </garnt>
<garnt> earth it was like a god sense like </garnt>
<garnt> whenever we'd go here and we'd go to </garnt>
<garnt> like the izakayas </garnt>
<garnt> and we thought we'd be going to like </garnt>
<garnt> kinokura every [ __ ] day yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's like it's like horde not even a </joey>
<connor> question of course kinokuro is </connor>
<joey> essentially worth the spoons i think </joey>
<joey> we've said that before but it's </joey>
<joey> very cheap very cheap tube yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like 15 bucks for all you can drink for </joey>
<joey> two hours </joey>
<joey> yeah something like that yeah but then </joey>
<joey> you realize oh [ __ ] i actually like my </joey>
<connor> liver </connor>
<connor> a little bit and i don't want to [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ruin it and i also like good food as </garnt>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<joey> and it's not got bad food but you just </joey>
<joey> get very average food yeah yeah you just </joey>
<joey> get better food elsewhere </joey>
<joey> because i remember like coming to japan </joey>
<joey> like everything i </joey>
<joey> i in my eyes all food in japan was </joey>
<joey> amazing </joey>
<joey> and then i lived here and now i you </joey>
<joey> realize that it's all </joey>
<joey> it's all good but there are different </joey>
<joey> tiers of how good it can be </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and i'm gonna i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> wonder what it's like when i </joey>
<joey> when i whenever i go back to england or </joey>
<garnt> something where good food is just </garnt>
<garnt> so much harder to find than it is here </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just readily available </garnt>
<connor> i'm getting a pot noodle the moment i </connor>
<connor> get back bombay bad boy pop noodles </connor>
<joey> you should just like do the opposite you </joey>
<joey> should just [ __ ] commit and just go </joey>
<joey> to a weather spoons </joey>
<garnt> and just be like i love wet the spoons </garnt>
<joey> food well then there you go let's </joey>
<joey> but let's see let's see how it is let's </joey>
<joey> see how it is i i i [ __ ] with where this </joey>
<joey> means </joey>
<garnt> food what i don't understand is connor's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] obsession with the tesco </garnt>
<connor> meal deals tesco meal dessert you had </connor>
<garnt> one you had one </garnt>
<connor> because i forced you to so tesco meal </connor>
<connor> deals right it's a thing in the uk </connor>
<connor> for three pounds which is about maybe </connor>
<joey> just under four dollars four dollars </joey>
<joey> you get a nice sandwich a big bag of </joey>
<joey> crisps and like one of the premium </joey>
<joey> drinks </joey>
<joey> you can get like a smoothie you can get </joey>
<joey> like an energy drink yeah but </joey>
<joey> yeah i took you because you got the big </joey>
<joey> big sandwich it's quite big and you get </joey>
<garnt> a big bag at a crisp you [ __ ] loved </garnt>
<garnt> it i remember you were like yo this is </garnt>
<garnt> all this for three pounds i was like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's insane right </garnt>
<garnt> i i think i'm vaguely wrong and i really </garnt>
<joey> like the sandwiches they make </joey>
<joey> i remember i had the weather spoons that </joey>
<joey> i had on in some kind of train station </joey>
<connor> and i was like yeah that was that was </connor>
<connor> pretty bad i took it i took </connor>
<connor> uh joey to the weather spoons in </connor>
<joey> victoria station it was terrible </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i i don't think whether this </joey>
<joey> means it's terrible i like things on the </joey>
<joey> pub though </joey>
<joey> yeah it does it does but for the most </joey>
<garnt> part weather spoons is like pretty </garnt>
<garnt> pretty decent for the price you get yeah </garnt>
<joey> the one the one there though i was like </joey>
<connor> we were i think we were </connor>
<connor> struggling to find a clean tape oh yeah </connor>
<connor> i was always </connor>
<joey> like longer than actually deciding what </joey>
<garnt> to eat yeah it was gross yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i remember when joey was </garnt>
<garnt> coming to visit me and connor were like </garnt>
<garnt> discussing oh what should we jo </garnt>
<garnt> what should we show him conor was like </garnt>
<garnt> tesco murder tesco murdo </garnt>
<garnt> i'm getting him a tesco muted i'm like </garnt>
<connor> connor for [ __ ] sake nobody gives a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about your three pound tesco meal deal </connor>
<connor> okay right i don't care </connor>
<connor> if i become a billionaire you bet i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna be eating mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> and [ __ ] tesco meal deals until the </connor>
<connor> day i [ __ ] die </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] is value and i won't hear </connor>
<connor> otherwise and it tastes amazing okay </connor>
<connor> it tastes good i i genuinely don't </connor>
<connor> remember eating it like </connor>
<connor> i i feel like i don't know i'm hurt joey </connor>
<joey> no no </joey>
<garnt> like after living in like after living </garnt>
<garnt> in japan and like living in asia where </garnt>
<garnt> convenience stores just have in my </garnt>
<connor> opinion just good food to choose from </connor>
<connor> sandwiches in tesco are better than </connor>
<connor> japan i mean salmon just have like </connor>
<connor> mayonnaise and like ketchup and all that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] in it </joey>
<garnt> i don't need that [ __ ] okay you're out </garnt>
<joey> of the question </joey>
<joey> where where does all the crusts go in </joey>
<joey> japan where is it where's all the crusts </joey>
<joey> gone i don't know probably for some </joey>
<joey> reason all the sandwiches don't have </joey>
<garnt> crusts on them </garnt>
<joey> where is it give me my [ __ ] crust i </joey>
<garnt> love the crust i think though sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> i actually that's the reason i like </garnt>
<joey> japanese sandwiches and some okay in </joey>
<connor> some </connor>
<connor> kid like you can't have mayo you can't </connor>
<connor> eat the [ __ ] crust on your </connor>
<connor> this man doesn't like it's still bread </connor>
<connor> yeah man what's what's the problem it </connor>
<garnt> tastes good yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i just i just it's just it's just wasted </garnt>
<garnt> wasted bread that's like tasteless bread </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> tastes like bread oh it's the flavor </connor>
<joey> dude it's the best part </joey>
<connor> what's so good it tastes like cardboard </connor>
<connor> no it doesn't no it's what yeah </connor>
<joey> it tastes exactly like the bread that </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like the crust on pizza </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> yeah why why does crust on pizza exist </joey>
<joey> and why does everyone pretend </joey>
<joey> it's good it tastes good no it doesn't </joey>
<connor> you eat the pizza </connor>
<connor> for the [ __ ] bread cheese tomato </connor>
<connor> sauce combination why would why would i </connor>
<connor> want to eat pizza </connor>
<joey> that is why would i just want to eat the </joey>
<joey> bread part of the pizza where when i </joey>
<garnt> have pizza </garnt>
<joey> i want the pizza part of the pizza okay </joey>
<connor> that's because you're eating it wrong </connor>
<connor> right you're going right up to the crust </connor>
<garnt> yeah you got to save a little bit of the </garnt>
<connor> sausage </connor>
<garnt> and then girl on the side people think </garnt>
<garnt> of a [ __ ] psychopath when i eat pizza </garnt>
<joey> the way i actually eat pizza at home </joey>
<joey> which is crust first i eat the crust </joey>
<joey> first because </joey>
<joey> i get i get that taste the [ __ ] out of </joey>
<garnt> the way so more um </garnt>
<joey> then how do you hold the pizza i just </joey>
<garnt> hold it like like what the [ __ ] are you </garnt>
<connor> doing </connor>
<joey> you're holding you're holding it like l </joey>
<garnt> dude like you're like look look look i </garnt>
<garnt> i just saved the best part to last why </garnt>
<garnt> would i save the tasteless part till </garnt>
<garnt> last i don't enjoy it but you're making </garnt>
<joey> you're making it tasteless by only </joey>
<garnt> eating the crust </garnt>
<garnt> if if you save a little bit of the sauce </garnt>
<garnt> that sauce could be with the actual </garnt>
<garnt> pizza </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i mean but this but the </garnt>
<garnt> pizza has plenty of sauce look it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like eating the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it's like when you're having a nice </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] meal and you eat your broccoli </garnt>
<garnt> and vegetables first and you </garnt>
<garnt> you and you have like your chicken and </garnt>
<garnt> your steak afterwards you save the best </garnt>
<connor> part of your life </connor>
<connor> you always eat everything separate not </connor>
<garnt> always if </garnt>
<garnt> it like synergizes perfectly if it like </garnt>
<connor> you would know i thought you would </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cross the house with the pizza no it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> the crust just takes the pizza tastes </garnt>
<joey> like an italian hand on this piece like </joey>
<connor> it synergizes because when you get those </connor>
<connor> shitty frozen pizzas right that are like </connor>
<garnt> one dollar or yeah right they're the </garnt>
<garnt> ones with no crust </garnt>
<garnt> you know those [ __ ] fake deep dish </garnt>
<garnt> pizzas that are just all bread yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> the thinnest </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] horrible that's like his [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> dream no my my [ __ ] dream </garnt>
<connor> is like proper thin crust italian pizzas </connor>
<connor> where like </connor>
<connor> the the the pizza goes right up to the </connor>
<connor> crust and it's because it's so </connor>
<connor> thin it doesn't take it doesn't get in </connor>
<connor> the way </connor>
<connor> if it doesn't get in the way sorry you </connor>
<joey> got a grip on something </joey>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] about greasy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hands if the pizza tastes better </joey>
<joey> that's just optimizing the pizza there </joey>
<joey> is so much wasted space on pizza </joey>
<garnt> that's it's it's like the crust gets in </garnt>
<garnt> the way of the pizza taste well then </garnt>
<joey> okay why don't you do this then when you </joey>
<joey> get the pizza next time right and </joey>
<joey> there's a thick crust </joey>
<joey> just fold that [ __ ] in half oh yeah no </joey>
<garnt> because that's like that's like </garnt>
<garnt> that means i feel like you're making a </garnt>
<connor> problem out of this no no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<joey> just roll up the pizza so that it's all </joey>
<connor> in one thing and then i </connor>
<connor> i just assume right whenever i see </connor>
<joey> anyone who you know leaves their crusts </joey>
<joey> on a sandwich </joey>
<joey> or you know leaves the crusts on a pizza </joey>
<connor> i'm like your parents clearly didn't </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> beat it into you yeah [ __ ] dude dude if </joey>
<connor> i if i left crosstalk </connor>
<connor> my mom would have beat myself she would </connor>
<joey> murder me she'd be like why are you </joey>
<connor> wasting food </connor>
<connor> i'll be like i got away with a lot of </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] but leaving food was not one of </joey>
<garnt> them yeah no that's why that's why if i </garnt>
<connor> have to eat pizza i eat it crust first </connor>
<connor> um like it's just </connor>
<joey> oh you make it sound like a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> torture man it is torture for me because </garnt>
<garnt> you're ruining </garnt>
<garnt> you're ruining this good [ __ ] food </garnt>
<connor> with just tasteless bread there's only </connor>
<connor> one time where it's acceptable to leave </connor>
<joey> the crusts on a pizza and that is a </joey>
<joey> buffet </joey>
<joey> of pizza where it's like i gotta </joey>
<connor> optimize this [ __ ] yeah i don't want </connor>
<joey> none of this because it's always [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> but if you just have dominoes then you </joey>
<garnt> have to eat this yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> also and also in like crush just takes </garnt>
<garnt> extra room </garnt>
<garnt> it's just extra room in your stomach </garnt>
<garnt> that can be filled with nice </garnt>
<garnt> tasty pizza i don't want to get filled </garnt>
<garnt> up with like tasteless crust </garnt>
<joey> i want always your [ __ ] [ __ ] pizza </joey>

<joey> for too </joey>
<joey> long crossless gang where are you at </joey>
<joey> where are you at crosslist guys </joey>
<joey> crosstalk </joey>
<connor> 10 year olds raise their hand </connor>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> point is where is the crush japan give </garnt>
<joey> me i don't i don't like it they take it </joey>
<joey> for me because </joey>
<joey> sometimes i think the best part of the </joey>
<garnt> sandwich is like the the give </garnt>
<garnt> that the cream adds to it right you </garnt>
<garnt> gotta bite it yeah yeah yeah target a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit </garnt>
<garnt> yeah sometimes it just crumbles apart </garnt>
<garnt> without the crust it's like the </garnt>
<connor> integrity of this </connor>
<connor> sandwich has been ruined it's it's been </connor>
<garnt> optimized it has not been </garnt>
<garnt> you you cut off all the useless pieces </garnt>
<connor> although </connor>
<connor> i will say sometimes 7-eleven is the by </connor>
<connor> far the guiltiest of this </connor>
<joey> you'll get a sandwich from 7-eleven </joey>
<joey> right and they'll show you the sandwich </joey>
<joey> it looks like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> packed in the front yeah yeah yeah this </joey>
<joey> thing is like quadruple ham slices right </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> you open up this sandwich thing you you </joey>
<joey> get it out you're like oh my god it's </joey>
<joey> thick and then as you realize you grab </joey>
<connor> it in your hand you're like huh </connor>
<connor> it's really really thin pretty thin near </connor>
<connor> the end you peel it up and there's </connor>
<connor> no ham yeah yeah yeah the other half of </connor>
<connor> the sandwich and you're like </connor>
<joey> i've been [ __ ] playing you got </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] click baited by seriously yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i think you have to like weirdly like </connor>
<joey> curl the bread up so you can get like an </joey>
<joey> even bite of bread it's [ __ ] 7-eleven </joey>
<joey> can you [ __ ] sort that [ __ ] out </joey>
<joey> everyone says their food is the best but </joey>
<joey> it's honestly the the worst one out of </joey>
<connor> the box i don't know family mart it's </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> family master worse no i i have to stand </garnt>
<joey> with family mart </joey>
<garnt> oh my god no i'm i'm a i'm a 7-eleven </garnt>
<connor> simp man </connor>
<connor> i i'm you're an awesome simp right yeah </connor>
<joey> i love lawson we look at the combination </joey>
<joey> we'll see </joey>
<garnt> we're going to leave this for the </garnt>
<joey> combini tournament arc okay we'll do it </joey>
<garnt> we need to </garnt>
<garnt> ask there are three genders </garnt>
<joey> oh my god no it's like the difference </joey>
<garnt> between [ __ ] tesco's sainsbury's and </garnt>
<joey> co-op right </joey>
<joey> you know yeah i don't know but i i'll </joey>
<garnt> just agree with you </garnt>
<garnt> in that case but what do they have in </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] australia </garnt>
<joey> what in terms of convenience stores yeah </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> yeah no one no one goes to a convenience </joey>
<joey> store in australia it's it's all just </joey>
<joey> supermarkets it's like </joey>
<connor> bottles as they say no that's a liquor </connor>
<connor> store yeah i know yeah </connor>
<joey> that is your lunch yeah i do i don't </joey>
<connor> want to buy food from a liquor store </connor>
<connor> i i will say probably the the thing that </connor>
<connor> i very quickly got adjusted to that i </connor>
<joey> think that will </joey>
<joey> hit me like whiplash when i return is uh </joey>
<joey> deliveries here </joey>
<joey> oh yes are you speaking of optimized you </joey>
<joey> get so used to it here because what </joey>
<joey> happens is </joey>
<joey> uh we spoke about this on the podcast </joey>
<joey> before we have i don't think so so when </joey>
<joey> you get a delivery in like i guess any </joey>
<joey> other country </joey>
<joey> it's like we'll arrive between 8 a.m and </joey>
<joey> 6 p.m </joey>
<joey> and you just got to be home on a tuesday </joey>
<joey> hope you listen out </joey>
<joey> you know and then you [ __ ] miss it </joey>
<joey> and then they did a single note yeah and </joey>
<joey> they didn't knock on the door </joey>
<joey> they say that they were there and it's </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> um and then it's this whole [ __ ] pain </joey>
<joey> that you got to try and reschedule like </joey>
<joey> oh will you come back in </joey>
<joey> four days and it's like are you kidding </joey>
<joey> me i pre-ordered this game </joey>
<joey> i wanted it today but in japan </joey>
<joey> when you miss a package not only can you </joey>
<joey> reschedule on that day </joey>
<joey> within a two-hour time slot so if you </joey>
<joey> miss it between like 8 and 12 a.m </joey>
<joey> which is the only four-hour time slot </joey>
<joey> yeah you can get it re-deliver between </joey>
<joey> twelve and two </joey>
<joey> four and six six and eight nine ten same </joey>
<joey> day delivery literally the whole day and </joey>
<joey> you can pick the </joey>
<joey> two hours it's nuts and on amazon when </joey>
<connor> you do it you can also pick the two-hour </connor>
<connor> time slot it's </connor>
<connor> nuts yeah it's so insane and it works i </connor>
<garnt> mean i mean there are also like what is </garnt>
<garnt> it where </garnt>
<garnt> the uk and stuff some places have like </garnt>
<connor> in london have like amazon now </connor>
<connor> or something like that yeah that's </connor>
<garnt> insane that's that that's insane </garnt>
<connor> i think i spoke about that in the </connor>
<connor> podcast i ordered like mario party and </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's when it arrives literally a few </joey>
<garnt> hours after you order it </garnt>
<connor> man honestly i wouldn't be surprised if </connor>
<connor> japan gets it yeah yeah yeah i mean i </connor>
<garnt> would love that </garnt>
<joey> because i didn't know i would never </joey>
<connor> leave my house </connor>
<connor> well it was made for groceries </connor>
<garnt> which is weird because i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> back to our podcast last week </garnt>
<garnt> with uh with alexion and i remember </garnt>
<joey> thinking to myself man </joey>
<joey> how would i have survived in japan and </joey>
<joey> got set up </joey>
<joey> if amazon didn't exist like like he did </joey>
<joey> like like when he first moved here and </joey>
<joey> i'm just thinking man so much of my life </joey>
<garnt> has revolved around amazon </garnt>
<garnt> in japan that if i didn't have it i </garnt>
<garnt> would be like </garnt>
<garnt> life would be ten times harder it does </garnt>
<connor> become when something isn't on amazon </connor>
<joey> i've noticed it becomes about 10 times </joey>
<joey> more difficult yeah </joey>
<connor> to get the thing that i want and </connor>
<joey> delivered because you have to look it up </joey>
<connor> and being like all right where's the </connor>
<connor> closest store and then you have to find </connor>
<connor> out when the stores open and then you </connor>
<joey> have to go in and [ __ ] look for it </joey>
<connor> it's just </connor>
<connor> yeah it's a mess gross but i also think </connor>
<connor> i also feel kind of sad because i feel </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<joey> because everything is so easy </joey>
<joey> you know and i i i got comments that i </joey>
<joey> can't believe kind of complains about </joey>
<joey> not knowing japanese </joey>
<joey> and living in japan right not </joey>
<joey> complaining i'm just [ __ ] british and </joey>
<joey> i'm just complaining about the things </joey>
<joey> that i complain about i i know it's my </joey>
<joey> fault for not knowing jeffy he's </joey>
<joey> not a [ __ ] idiot i know that it's </joey>
<joey> probably not a good idea </joey>
<garnt> to not speak japanese i think in japan </garnt>
<joey> but a lot of people do come here to </joey>
<joey> learn yeah right and i do think that if </joey>
<joey> i was </joey>
<joey> forced to you know say 10 years ago or </joey>
<joey> 15 years ago </joey>
<joey> i think that i would have been forced to </joey>
<joey> learn a lot more oh yeah because </joey>
<joey> i would have no choice all right right </joey>
<joey> right now i don't need to do anything </joey>
<joey> google maps tells you where to go google </joey>
<connor> maps tells me the restaurants </connor>
<connor> i can google translate every web page </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's pretty much all sort of </connor>
<joey> it's it's catering more towards </joey>
<garnt> foreigners definitely </garnt>
<garnt> it also doesn't help that this is </garnt>
<garnt> basically a society that has optimized </garnt>
<joey> like getting getting the least amount of </joey>
<joey> human interaction posture </joey>
<joey> you go to a restaurant you have a tablet </joey>
<garnt> and you order your stuff you know you </garnt>
<garnt> so most of the time you don't even need </garnt>
<connor> to talk to anyone you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> which is what i like i get you must get </connor>
<connor> this a lot right do you get comments </connor>
<connor> asking you like how's your japanese </connor>
<connor> coming along how's your japanese </connor>
<joey> kangaroo </joey>
<joey> yeah gone how is it coming it is </joey>
<garnt> is it josu it is i've already gotten </garnt>
<garnt> josie a few times </garnt>
<connor> it's difficult right because it's hard </connor>
<connor> to explain because essentially </connor>
<garnt> i don't i think people have a </garnt>
<garnt> misconception of how much we interact </garnt>
<garnt> with japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i talk to a japanese person and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> forced to speak japanese </garnt>
<garnt> at like most often at the combini or </garnt>
<garnt> at the like denny's or whatever like at </garnt>
<garnt> a restaurant or a store </garnt>
<garnt> those are the three most common times </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a script like i know exactly </garnt>
<connor> what they're going to say yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> because they always say i know exactly </garnt>
<garnt> what you mean because we were we were </garnt>
<garnt> getting coffee like i think it was last </garnt>
<connor> week or something at the bookwork </connor>
<connor> offices and we </connor>
<garnt> kind of ordered the coffee and he almost </garnt>
<garnt> sounded like [ __ ] fluent with </garnt>
<garnt> like all the responses he was making and </garnt>
<garnt> he was just and it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> i know how it is where you've ordered </garnt>
<garnt> something enough times that you just </garnt>
<connor> know the questions </connor>
<connor> yeah i perfectly optimized ordering </connor>
<joey> coffee it's like when it's like when you </joey>
<joey> watch a movie and you say the line </joey>
<garnt> before the action </garnt>
<garnt> i was like i know what you're going to </garnt>
<garnt> say and i know where </garnt>
<garnt> if that script is like buried like in </garnt>
<garnt> the slightest you just go </garnt>
<garnt> you just go like i have no idea what the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm doing what happens is i'll be </connor>
<connor> ordering coffee right and here's the </connor>
<connor> order every single time </connor>
<connor> you go in there you say what you want </connor>
<connor> they'll ask you do you want it to stay </connor>
<connor> or to go </connor>
<connor> yeah you say to go and then i'll ask you </connor>
<connor> you know do you want a bag </connor>
<connor> you say no you don't want to bag and </connor>
<connor> then you just say how you want to pay </connor>
<connor> so you can just say that right and it's </connor>
<connor> always how it is and every time it goes </connor>
<connor> wrong and if joey's with me i'll just </connor>
<connor> slowly turn to joey and be like </connor>
<joey> there's only two times i've seen a slow </joey>
<joey> head turn that's in a horror movie and </joey>
<connor> when i'm with you guys and you it's out </connor>
<connor> of the script </connor>
<connor> it's just a very slow length i don't </connor>
<connor> want to go yeah i don't want to go </connor>
<joey> joey help i just want to be like dozojo </joey>
<garnt> i'll leave it it's it's it's actually </garnt>
<garnt> funny when you're not there because when </garnt>
<joey> it's </joey>
<garnt> something there have been times when </garnt>
<garnt> it's just me and connor and we're out </garnt>
<garnt> like a restaurant ordering something and </garnt>
<garnt> then we get we get something off script </garnt>
<garnt> and it's both of us trying to keep uh </garnt>
<garnt> like cumulatively </garnt>
<garnt> figure out which one of us knows like as </garnt>
<garnt> much japanese as each other like </garnt>
<garnt> like we're trying to like combine our </garnt>
<garnt> japanese knowledge to be like okay you </garnt>
<garnt> know this word i know that word </garnt>
<garnt> so we can let's try and figure out what </garnt>
<garnt> we're saying combining these two words </garnt>
<garnt> together </garnt>
<joey> that's the thing though like that's like </joey>
<connor> one like i'm such a [ __ ] sadist but </connor>
<connor> like that's the one thing i [ __ ] love </connor>
<connor> when </connor>
<connor> friends who can't speak japanese i'm </connor>
<connor> hanging out [ __ ] and we go to like a </connor>
<connor> restaurant or something or we go out </connor>
<connor> somewhere or go traveling somewhere is </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't look japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> don't expect me to know japanese yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> i love every now and then going to a </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant with like a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> non-japanese friends and pretending i </garnt>
<garnt> can't speak what a japanese </garnt>
<joey> i just and just letting them be yes i'm </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> uh nihongo right and this is like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you joy so yeah outside of you know </connor>
<connor> those situations i </connor>
<connor> we pretty much don't really speak to </connor>
<joey> japanese people although to be fair </joey>
<joey> you've been recently </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] interacting with like japanese </joey>
<connor> people on apex all right well so i i </connor>
<connor> thought to myself right </connor>
<connor> i'm taking these japanese classes two </connor>
<connor> times the problem is is i'm not really </connor>
<connor> doing much outside of that and </connor>
<connor> people will be like oh why don't you </connor>
<connor> study more i mean the work schedule that </connor>
<connor> we have is already pretty [ __ ] and </connor>
<joey> there's only so much studying before you </joey>
<joey> have to actually use it in practice </joey>
<joey> right i think like no matter how much </joey>
<joey> studying i do if i'm not using it yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah like practically it's not going to </joey>
<joey> happen yeah it's not poor so </joey>
<garnt> i just decided [ __ ] it okay you know </garnt>
<joey> what i'm gonna i'm gonna stream </joey>
<joey> talking to japanese people on apex </joey>
<joey> trying to make friends yeah managed to </joey>
<joey> make some friends pretty [ __ ] fast </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> okay even though most people do not want </connor>
<connor> to talk i mean i was tuning in to one of </connor>
<joey> your streams and you were like </joey>
<connor> interacting quite </connor>
<connor> well i i can speak super super basic and </connor>
<joey> yeah but they were getting it </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah they can normally </joey>
<joey> understand what i'm trying to say yeah </joey>
<joey> the best thing is is that if i don't </joey>
<joey> know something i'm like </joey>
<joey> chat chat what is this word how do i say </joey>
<joey> this thing and then they tell me and i </joey>
<joey> don't forget it yeah because i'm using </joey>
<garnt> it like a meter yeah </garnt>
<joey> over and over and so that's been really </joey>
<joey> helpful and if you want to go and watch </joey>
<joey> those you can watch them on the </joey>
<joey> highlights whatever they're doing </joey>
<joey> um but yeah that that's been super </joey>
<connor> helpful but outside of that like we </connor>
<joey> don't [ __ ] use it like i mean </joey>
<joey> you can you i i can talk to you guys and </joey>
<connor> jeff but it's okay joey it's different </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it's it's different joey it's because </connor>
<connor> you know how bad we are and it's </connor>
<joey> embarrassing right no no okay okay you </joey>
<joey> gotta you have to throw that aside </joey>
<connor> because like i am fine doing it in front </connor>
<joey> of two thousand people live </joey>
<connor> yeah but not in front of me no not a </connor>
<joey> friend because </joey>
<joey> i'm not gonna judge you </joey>
<joey> we it's like a subconscious thing where </joey>
<garnt> i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> i don't want you to be disappointed in </connor>
<connor> me jerry </connor>
<joey> i'm not going to be disappointed i want </joey>
<garnt> to just impress you man i want to </garnt>
<joey> impress you okay </joey>
<garnt> i just want to get any hunger you joseph </garnt>
<garnt> okay but i i know how jose your japanese </garnt>
<garnt> is man i i </garnt>
<garnt> can't i can't reach that level right now </garnt>
<garnt> man you're like trying to impress your </garnt>
<garnt> dad </garnt>
<joey> come on man this is the only time i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna get my dad's love because </connor>
<connor> i don't know what it is about talking to </connor>
<connor> a japanese person i i even though it's </connor>
<joey> even more awkward because if they don't </joey>
<joey> understand me we're [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah but it's less awkward because they </joey>
<garnt> inherently expect me to be </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] awful yeah so it's it's like </garnt>
<joey> when i do do good it's like oh awesome </joey>
<joey> like it's good so then why don't you </joey>
<joey> just put that on me because </joey>
<connor> you you can probably figure out what i'm </connor>
<connor> trying to say and you'll be like are you </connor>
<joey> trying to say this </joey>
<joey> but i can also just pretend to be like </joey>
<connor> i guess but it's </connor>
<joey> the point is in general we don't really </joey>
<joey> get to talk to as many japanese people </joey>
<joey> as </joey>
<joey> i think people expect us to yeah right </joey>

<joey> that was you could understand everything </joey>
<joey> right yeah did you think you were gonna </joey>
<garnt> talk more japanese like be forced to </garnt>
<joey> when you moved here yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i i i i i thought i did he said </garnt>
<joey> there was such a remorse like because </joey>
<joey> it's so it's weird right because i think </joey>
<joey> everyone in my life expected me to as </joey>
<joey> did i </joey>
<joey> yeah but what ends up happening is that </joey>
<joey> i realized okay </joey>
<joey> i work from home uh i go to a language </joey>
<joey> school where all the staff speak english </joey>
<joey> all my friends speaking things yeah oh </joey>
<joey> no um </joey>
<joey> i stream i i speak in english i go to </joey>
<joey> the gym i don't talk because </joey>
<joey> who the [ __ ] am i going to talk to </joey>
<joey> unless that hulk guy talks to me yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't [ __ ] massive chat i've told </joey>
<joey> that story i think i have right </joey>
<joey> so yeah there's actually like pretty </joey>
<connor> much no time where </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm kind of the same as well like </joey>
<connor> right how often do you speak japanese </connor>
<joey> people outside of </joey>
<joey> business right um yeah i mean because </joey>
<joey> of covert i haven't been able to see my </joey>
<joey> family like at all right right yeah </joey>
<connor> and that as well has made it even worse </connor>
<connor> because strangers don't want to [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> talk to you </joey>
<joey> exactly i mean like our neighbor next to </joey>
<joey> us uh </joey>
<joey> is like really [ __ ] cool old couple </joey>
<joey> and like every time i see them like that </joey>
<joey> i'll talk to them in japanese but </joey>
<joey> i always get so nervous because the </joey>
<joey> moment i start talking to them </joey>
<joey> i can hear it in my inflection that like </joey>
<garnt> oh no </garnt>
<garnt> i'm [ __ ] like losing touch on this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like i haven't been i haven't been </garnt>
<joey> serviced yet </joey>
<joey> because i haven't been speaking enough </joey>
<joey> because all because the only time i'll </joey>
<joey> ever speak to is like with my mom </joey>
<joey> like an occasional skype call or [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> you know it's weird right you live in </connor>
<connor> japan </connor>
<connor> and you're like you're losing yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> so i have to you know i have to like </joey>
<joey> consciously </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] keep you know figuring out ways </joey>
<joey> of like okay </joey>
<joey> how can i use this language because if </joey>
<joey> there's one thing i don't want to lose </joey>
<joey> it's my japanese yeah of course yeah of </joey>
<garnt> course and </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing about languages is that </garnt>
<joey> if you don't use it </joey>
<joey> it'll get rusty and that's true with </joey>
<connor> like mai tai as well yeah now that i'm </connor>
<joey> like out of shape yeah </joey>
<joey> now that i'm living out of thailand i'm </joey>
<joey> just like there's sometimes i'm trying </joey>
<joey> to remember entire word when i'm </joey>
<joey> speaking to my mom </joey>
<joey> and sometimes i get like the japanese </joey>
<joey> word instead because that's something </joey>
<garnt> i've been like studying more recently </garnt>
<garnt> it's really yeah and it's it's weird to </garnt>
<garnt> think </garnt>
<garnt> how little i can have to how little i </garnt>
<garnt> can use japanese and also live here you </garnt>
<garnt> know what i mean because </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of subconsciously find a way to </garnt>
<joey> make it easy for yourself not gonna lie </joey>
<joey> the one actually like one thing i have </joey>
<joey> been starting to do recently is like </joey>
<garnt> every time i read manga or a novel a </garnt>
<garnt> japanese novel or something i read it </garnt>
<garnt> out loud </garnt>
<garnt> just because because if i read it in my </garnt>
<joey> head like of course i'm going to </joey>
<joey> understand it no no no no no no no but </joey>
<joey> it's completely different like reading </joey>
<garnt> and speaking skills is completely </garnt>
<garnt> different yeah </garnt>
<joey> so i've like just kind of very quietly </joey>
<joey> read it to myself </joey>
<joey> just to be just to remember like okay </joey>
<joey> that's how you pronounce that word </joey>
<connor> yeah it's like that for me like reading </connor>
<joey> welsh it's like getting confusing now </joey>
<garnt> because i haven't done it in a long time </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah and it's a </joey>
<garnt> i mean you've seen that washed language </garnt>
<joey> right it's a [ __ ] jumble of sounds </joey>
<connor> it's like all right </connor>
<connor> that's why i don't understand you know </connor>
<connor> people who know like [ __ ] eight </connor>
<connor> languages </connor>
<connor> some people just have it man yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just crazy right like </connor>
<garnt> i don't think inherently i i would ever </garnt>
<garnt> learn more than one language because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> i'm lazy as [ __ ] i'll be honest yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean the thing is like to try to pick up </garnt>
<garnt> a third is like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] my brain is like connor we're </garnt>
<connor> really we're really going to a limit </connor>
<garnt> here man </garnt>
<garnt> really pushing it but but i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> learning language is is </garnt>
<garnt> hard per se i think it's just like okay </garnt>
<connor> if we just </connor>
<connor> all quit youtube tomorrow for like like </connor>
<connor> a year and just focus all our time on </connor>
<connor> actually learning this language </connor>
<connor> i think we'd make like so much progress </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<joey> what's hard about it is trying to learn </joey>
<joey> a language and fit it within our already </joey>
<joey> current lifestyle where we're </joey>
<joey> busy as [ __ ] you know i mean i feel like </joey>
<joey> that's the real problem </joey>
<joey> because it's like i'm trying to find </joey>
<garnt> time where time doesn't [ __ ] exist </garnt>
<garnt> nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> where like it takes a lot of [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> time and dedication to that </joey>
<joey> and it's a long line between being able </joey>
<joey> to speak a language </joey>
<joey> conversationally and being fluent in the </joey>
<joey> way </joey>
<garnt> the only time i've actually gotten like </garnt>
<garnt> able to be and get get proper </garnt>
<joey> japanese practice is when we're [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> out on the lash or something we're at a </joey>
<joey> random barns like </joey>
<joey> like we're we're [ __ ] pissed out of </joey>
<joey> our heads and that's just a random </joey>
<joey> japanese bloke who's as </joey>
<garnt> pissed as us that's pretty much been </garnt>
<garnt> like the best language practice i've </garnt>
<garnt> gotten since i've moved here honestly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that probably is the best way to do </garnt>
<garnt> it because </garnt>
<garnt> because you know if you're like a little </garnt>
<joey> intoxicated then you're going to be less </joey>
<garnt> you know nervous i swear to god i speak </garnt>
<joey> i speak any languages like 10 better </joey>
<garnt> when i'm drunk except english except </garnt>
<garnt> english </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's so true [ __ ] man but i mean </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> languages from what i've learned is like </connor>
<garnt> learning a language and learning music </garnt>
<garnt> or like an instrument is the exact same </garnt>
<garnt> part of the brain yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's and they say like it's the exact </garnt>
<garnt> same with an instrument or language but </garnt>
<garnt> the second one is always going to be the </garnt>
<garnt> most difficult </garnt>
<connor> and then from the third onwards it just </connor>
<connor> gets easier and easier and easier and </connor>
<connor> i guess for all for all three of us the </connor>
<connor> advantage is that we already know two </connor>
<connor> languages </connor>
<connor> quite formally so that's why and you </connor>
<garnt> know you guys are learning a third right </garnt>
<garnt> so yeah it just puts pressure on me i'm </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> i should learn a third language as well </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's weird because i don't feel </garnt>
<joey> like i ever </joey>
<joey> learned two languages this is the first </joey>
<joey> time i've felt like i've </joey>
<joey> learned trying to actively learn </joey>
<joey> something where rather than just like </joey>
<joey> hey this is i just knew this as a kid </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i didn't really think about it um </joey>
<joey> because you don't think about it in your </joey>
<joey> head when you speak time </joey>
<garnt> because because the thing is it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like it is very much like learning and </garnt>
<garnt> learning an instrument it's just a lot </garnt>
<connor> of it's like muscle memory </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i do not remember how i </connor>
<connor> learned it i don't remember </connor>
<connor> learning it yeah i just know that i've </connor>
<connor> always been able to understand it and </connor>
<joey> speak it that's why i hate it when </joey>
<joey> people ask me like </joey>
<joey> japanese language questions i'm like i </joey>
<connor> don't [ __ ] know how yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's also like when i and also </connor>
<joey> when you learn a language natively i </joey>
<joey> think you learn it wrong </joey>
<joey> you learn it locally and in a native way </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> people ask me some people would ask me </joey>
<joey> questions about welsh and i'd be like i </joey>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] know </garnt>
<garnt> like i i just knew from speaking it yeah </garnt>
<joey> i don't </joey>
<connor> i don't know any of the rules i i </connor>
<connor> couldn't do half of them correctly yeah </connor>
<joey> that's well that's why they say like the </joey>
<joey> best way to learn any language is to </joey>
<connor> live in the country that speaks it right </connor>
<connor> right right it's yeah i i don't know and </connor>
<connor> i i think i get a lot of questions about </connor>
<joey> like oh wait wait which language does </joey>
<joey> kind of speak well it's because like i </joey>
<joey> don't really get much </joey>
<joey> use out of welsh so i don't really show </joey>
<joey> it off right yeah unfortunately because </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> only spoken in uh wales and </joey>
<joey> one part of like south africa south </joey>
<joey> america there's like one small </joey>
<joey> place in somewhere in south america </joey>
<joey> where they speak welsh like a town </joey>
<joey> really weird yeah a bunch of like walsh </joey>
<joey> atlas went there and we're like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it let's just make a list let's </joey>
<garnt> chill here let's just do it </garnt>
<joey> that's a shame because it's such a nice </joey>
<joey> language it sounds [ __ ] lovely </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's so cool it's always fun </joey>
<joey> hearing people pronounce the names of </joey>
<joey> the towns </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah isn't that that </joey>
<joey> buzzfeed video where i pronounce </joey>
<garnt> like all the welsh names and it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] horrible they sound as cool as </garnt>
<connor> they look as well oh yeah yeah because </connor>
<joey> like my </joey>
<joey> my dad can't speak welsh my mom could </joey>
<joey> speak welsh right so my dad </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] butchers that's the the names </joey>
<joey> and i always just correct him </joey>
<joey> yeah i just want to be an ass i'm like </joey>
<connor> oh yeah i do that to my dad with </connor>
<joey> japanese as well </joey>
<connor> i [ __ ] love doing yeah it's the same </connor>
<connor> situation yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like shut up son </joey>
<connor> going back to the whole like trying to </connor>
<connor> fit it around your lifestyle there is </connor>
<connor> such a big part of me that's like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> man i wish i could take a gear off </connor>
<connor> youtube and like </connor>
<connor> do it like perfect a skill but i'd get </connor>
<connor> like just do japanese classes five years </connor>
<garnt> ago </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i've i've like felt that definitely </garnt>
<joey> recently where </joey>
<joey> like my entire life has just revolved </joey>
<joey> around youtube for like the past </joey>
<joey> four or five years and then i kind of </joey>
<joey> realized this last year especially </joey>
<joey> it was just like hey there are other </joey>
<joey> things i can do with my life </joey>
<joey> other than youtube and learning japanese </joey>
<joey> is definitely one of them but </joey>
<joey> i really only have time to you know do </joey>
<joey> one </joey>
<garnt> without making like substantial progress </garnt>
<garnt> on the other or just like making </garnt>
<joey> almost zero progress i mean this this </joey>
<joey> kind of situation definitely hasn't </joey>
<joey> helped considering that's really limited </joey>
<joey> where we can go right because i feel </joey>
<joey> travel as well even if you're traveling </joey>
<joey> with like a bunch of like </joey>
<garnt> english-speaking people in japan </garnt>
<garnt> you just get into you can put yourself </garnt>
<garnt> into situations where you have to </garnt>
<joey> interact with the locals right now yeah </joey>
<garnt> you know just travel is such a nice way </garnt>
<garnt> of just meeting people and like getting </garnt>
<garnt> to use the language as much as possible </garnt>
<connor> because like </connor>
<joey> i feel there's less stress using a </joey>
<connor> language you're trying to learn while </connor>
<connor> you're traveling because </connor>
<joey> at the end of the day yeah you're never </joey>
<joey> gonna meet this person again yeah i </joey>
<connor> would have no qualms about like </connor>
<connor> butchering japanese to an old lady and </connor>
<joey> yeah you get </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nervous as [ __ ] trying to use </joey>
<joey> japanese at your local konbini right </joey>
<joey> because it's like i'm gonna see you </joey>
<connor> again probably tomorrow </connor>
<connor> same time oh my god and i don't want to </connor>
<joey> be remembered as that gaijin who can't </joey>
<joey> speak japanese </joey>
<connor> right as much as there's a party that </connor>
<connor> wants to do that i'm like at the same </connor>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like i'm enjoying youtube now </garnt>
<joey> more than ever oh yeah i'm enjoying </joey>
<garnt> everything about it and </garnt>
<joey> it's going so well that it would make no </joey>
<joey> sense to like </joey>
<joey> stop doing it yeah right like because </joey>
<joey> you know taking a year off youtube </joey>
<joey> although i could probably come back from </joey>
<joey> it i probably could but </joey>
<connor> is it worth the risk like no probably </connor>
<connor> not i can i can always learn japanese </connor>
<connor> later on in life which sucks that </connor>
<connor> i wouldn't have it now and i would </connor>
<garnt> rather have it now yeah but </garnt>
<connor> why not mix the two worlds together i i </connor>
<garnt> i feel like i mean what do you mean by </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> like make some kind of youtube content </garnt>
<connor> about you learning japanese i considered </connor>
<connor> that but i thought that'd be such a big </connor>
<connor> undertaking and i've seen language </connor>
<connor> channels and they had like drama </connor>
<connor> because they would like not end up </connor>
<connor> learning the language </connor>
<connor> no joke like they there was this video </connor>
<joey> where a guy made like an apology video </joey>
<joey> it was like technical drama </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so like oh god cause you know </joey>
<joey> when those videos went around where it </joey>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> dude speaks 15 languages yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you're like well that's just absurd </garnt>
<garnt> but then i i started watching a lot of </garnt>
<joey> those videos and i found like </joey>
<joey> people who were like their whole channel </joey>
<joey> was about them starting from zero </joey>
<joey> and then learning the language yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and there was like drama with this </joey>
<joey> one guy </joey>
<joey> because he was learning two languages at </joey>
<joey> once right i think it was like i </joey>
<joey> remember it was like it was very </joey>
<joey> different languages as well </joey>
<joey> yeah and about halfway through like a </joey>
<joey> year in he's like you know what i'm </joey>
<joey> quitting i'm quitting swedish </joey>
<joey> you know i realized that it's just </joey>
<joey> hampering my progress trying to learn </joey>
<joey> two languages at once right </joey>
<joey> and all that it was like all the </joey>
<joey> comments were like what the [ __ ] man </joey>
<joey> i can't believe i believed in you like </joey>
<joey> your swedish was so good man why'd you </joey>
<joey> like and i was like oh my god anything </joey>
<joey> anything can be drama now and i just </joey>
<joey> thought like </joey>
<garnt> i if anything it would be a thing where </garnt>
<garnt> i would be like okay </garnt>
<garnt> let's see how much i can learn in three </garnt>
<garnt> months doing x a week right yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then i would not announce it not make it </garnt>
<joey> a prop not make it a series just </joey>
<garnt> yeah here we go yeah but at the same </garnt>
<joey> time it also is a lot of pressure that </joey>
<joey> is like </joey>
<joey> okay i gotta worry about making other </joey>
<joey> videos and also actually learning </joey>
<joey> japanese yeah </joey>
<joey> otherwise this video is gonna be a </joey>
<joey> little awkward if it's like three months </joey>
<connor> in </connor>
<connor> i learned nothing but that would be </connor>
<joey> funny right </joey>
<joey> like it would be like a funny conclusion </joey>
<joey> to the video </joey>
<joey> so isn't it like i don't know i just </joey>
<garnt> wasted three months of my life </garnt>
<joey> and uh learned nothing he did it for </joey>
<connor> good content though you did 30 minutes </connor>
<connor> of your life watching this video exactly </connor>
<joey> i don't know </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dude because i was because i had </joey>
<joey> this video idea where it's like because </joey>
<joey> i've always wanted to like </joey>
<joey> improve more of my japanese as well so </joey>
<joey> i'm like i can't just like </joey>
<joey> commit like outside of youtube or like </joey>
<joey> outside of what i do and all these side </joey>
<joey> projects i do because i'm just way too </joey>
<joey> busy </joey>
<joey> now which sucks because i really do want </joey>
<joey> to like you know hone in on my japanese </joey>
<joey> a lot more </joey>
<joey> so i thought about like you know there's </joey>
<joey> like the kanji proficiency test </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and i've got like i got like </joey>
<joey> the third highest on that but like that </joey>
<joey> was back in like high school but i'm </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i wonder if i can like go for the </connor>
<connor> highest one and </connor>
<connor> how many countries you need yeah for the </connor>
<connor> highest one uh i believe </connor>
<connor> it's three thousand and i think only </connor>
<joey> point </joey>
<joey> four percent of the population has it </joey>
<joey> yeah it's very like prestigious </joey>
<joey> yeah um but i thought like what if i did </joey>
<garnt> a video where i </garnt>
<garnt> is there a kanji for cultural </garnt>
<joey> cross-pollination i guarantee you there </joey>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> a big one don't worry </garnt>
<garnt> but i thought to myself like i wonder if </garnt>
<garnt> i did a video where i just like </garnt>
<joey> dedicated like a year </joey>
<joey> to just document myself like learning </joey>
<joey> that and trying to attempt for the test </joey>
<connor> but isn't that scary though because what </connor>
<connor> if you don't make </connor>
<connor> any progress like six months ago that's </connor>
<joey> the only thing that's stopped yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's also like in order for me in </joey>
<joey> order for this video to be successful </joey>
<joey> i've got to [ __ ] grind this [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and </joey>
<joey> if i do this and then the video flops </joey>
<joey> then that's just like </joey>
<joey> cool i wasted a year of my life for a </joey>
<joey> flopped video and a test that i failed </joey>
<connor> i think unlike the actual japanese </connor>
<connor> language i think you actually can like </connor>
<connor> gamify and speed run kanji </connor>
<garnt> like i think kanji is speedrunnable i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know man it is dude totally </garnt>
<garnt> playing </garnt>
<garnt> explain because you can there's there's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> lit apps that will like [ __ ] whip you </garnt>
<connor> if you get it wrong all right </connor>
<connor> so i i've speed learned like a hundred </connor>
<connor> kanji </connor>
<connor> in like a day by doing that and i know </connor>
<joey> all of them now i can use them but if i </joey>
<joey> sat you down and told you to write it </joey>
<connor> out could you </connor>
<connor> write it out some of them right but i'll </connor>
<connor> read them yeah but this i mean japanese </connor>
<joey> read them read them yeah you'll be able </joey>
<joey> to read 100 kanji if i showed you 100 </joey>
<garnt> really 100 percent okay </garnt>
<connor> challenge except i'm tempted to do a </connor>
<joey> live stream we're both </joey>
<connor> and i'll [ __ ] do streaming kanji test </connor>
<connor> on you the basic kanji </connor>
<connor> the hundred countries you know i'll do a </connor>
<garnt> test 100 we'll do it okay okay </garnt>
<connor> okay because that's like a video idea </connor>
<connor> because right you can you can gamify it </connor>
<connor> like and and you can start picking up </connor>
<connor> patents and </connor>
<connor> i feel like the way that you can i don't </connor>
<connor> know like </connor>
<joey> at least when i was when i was learning </joey>
<joey> kanji i could easily pick up </joey>
<joey> kanji like i guess um because especially </joey>
<joey> living in japan right because </joey>
<joey> it wasn't like living in the uk sorry </joey>
<joey> where you learn this kind of g </joey>
<joey> you would leave your house you wouldn't </joey>
<joey> see it yeah you leave your house in </joey>
<joey> japan </joey>
<joey> even if you didn't talk to anyone you </joey>
<joey> see the kanjis everywhere yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> you could keep practicing because you </joey>
<connor> keep seeing them like oh i know that oh </connor>
<joey> i know that </joey>
<joey> yeah you do do that after like every </joey>
<connor> like trash taste session yeah </connor>
<garnt> we'll be catching the train you'll be </garnt>
<garnt> like what's that science say i've seen </garnt>
<garnt> that one before </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah but i feel like that's </garnt>
<joey> how that's the way you got to do it </joey>
<joey> right right right right because that's </joey>
<joey> that's how a kid learns yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> inquisitive yeah </joey>
<garnt> problem is where it starts getting into </garnt>
<joey> like there's four kanjis with four </joey>
<joey> different </joey>
<joey> the same country with like 10 different </joey>
<joey> pronunciations and it's like oh oh which </joey>
<joey> is like 30 </joey>
<joey> of all kanji i love the ones with like </joey>
<joey> two i'm like nice </joey>
<joey> question of you boys uh because we've </joey>
<joey> been living here for a year now what's </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> how long you think you're gonna be </joey>
<joey> staying here for does that mean that's </joey>
<joey> the question i want to ask you too </joey>
<garnt> what's what's what's my five-year plan </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> was a [ __ ] liar chris board said he </connor>
<connor> wasn't gonna live here for like five </connor>
<joey> years and yeah and he's still here </joey>
<garnt> i mean time just moves [ __ ] fast it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't even feel like i've been here a </garnt>
<garnt> year </garnt>
<garnt> i i thought yeah i'll live here for like </garnt>
<garnt> two years max i'm halfway through i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like i've hardly even spent </garnt>
<joey> any time here right now i mean yeah </joey>
<joey> that's the thing like i i always thought </joey>
<joey> to myself i'm like </joey>
<joey> i thought about i was like oh my god </joey>
<joey> i've been for almost five years </joey>
<joey> like yeah like moved out like moved out </joey>
<joey> of my parents and like actually lived in </joey>
<joey> japan on my own i was like </joey>
<joey> it does not feel like five years which </joey>
<joey> is why like which is why like the </joey>
<joey> question of like </joey>
<joey> what do you see yourself doing in five </joey>
<joey> years it's starting to sound less and </joey>
<joey> less absurd to me </joey>
<joey> because back you know when i was in my </joey>
<joey> teenage years and people were like </joey>
<joey> where do you see yourself in five years </joey>
<garnt> five years so far you'd be doing </garnt>
<joey> something [ __ ] different every year </joey>
<joey> yeah back at that age </joey>
<joey> but now it just feels like it's you you </joey>
<joey> can have like a different </joey>
<joey> routine and monotonous now we just sound </joey>
<joey> old </joey>
<joey> i mean we are man we are depending on </joey>
<joey> how long well </joey>
<joey> a big [ __ ] question mark obviously is </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> how long will geeks plus allow us to be </joey>
<joey> here because we </joey>
<joey> yeah mainly yeah melinda i i'm i'm not </joey>
<joey> calling you out right now </joey>
<joey> how long so i'm gonna i'm gonna say that </joey>
<garnt> i'm gonna say this louder so </garnt>
<garnt> it all depends on how how long geeks </garnt>
<garnt> possibly around </garnt>
<garnt> because our visa depends on geeks plus </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<connor> this wow this is why it takes so many </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] sponsors by the way yeah </joey>
<joey> we can give geeks plus money so that we </joey>
<joey> can satiate our [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> lore overlords how many sponsors can we </connor>
<connor> fit ten an episode </connor>
<joey> say no more adorable doable man i mean </joey>
<joey> okay but but i mean like </joey>
<joey> like the question though i think and </joey>
<joey> this is kind of goes back to the root of </joey>
<joey> it all </joey>
<joey> having been here for a year are you guys </joey>
<connor> enjoying it yeah yeah there's been </connor>
<connor> i think i flip-flop a lot in the first </connor>
<connor> six months the first six months i was </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i would have one week or i'm like i hate </joey>
<joey> it i plan to go back in two months </joey>
<joey> yeah you know what i mean like there's </joey>
<joey> some weeks where i think especially </joey>
<joey> where i've i said this in my video about </joey>
<joey> my because i made a video uh about one </joey>
<joey> year living in japan </joey>
<joey> yeah i think the big point i tried to </joey>
<joey> mention was like you have to make </joey>
<joey> like you have to force yourself to like </joey>
<joey> actively go out your way to make friends </joey>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> yeah it is not a country where friends </joey>
<joey> just come along you don't just bump into </joey>
<joey> people and you're like </joey>
<joey> let's hang out it's like you actually </joey>
<joey> you have to go out of your way to do the </joey>
<joey> whole like </joey>
<garnt> when are you free what's your calendar </garnt>
<garnt> like let's make the solid not a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> thing let's do it otherwise </garnt>
<joey> i'm not going to see anyone for two </joey>
<garnt> weeks yeah you guys right yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> like having this podcast has really </garnt>
<joey> helped because </joey>
<joey> before it was like okay we might hang </joey>
<joey> out every day yeah but then we also </joey>
<joey> might not see each other for like a week </joey>
<joey> and a half yeah </joey>
<joey> and then i realized i haven't left the </joey>
<joey> house in four days [ __ ] i'm starting to </joey>
<joey> feel lonely and i live </joey>
<garnt> i live alone and i've never lived like </garnt>
<garnt> alone alone like i've always </garnt>
<garnt> because we've always had a roommate i've </garnt>
<garnt> always had a roommate or something and </garnt>
<joey> and i didn't realize like how much </joey>
<joey> i like relied on that to like kind of </joey>
<joey> keep me a little bit sane </joey>
<joey> yeah um because you know sometimes my </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] roommate uh </garnt>
<garnt> zeno i love you but yeah you drive me up </garnt>
<garnt> the wall right but that's not that's </garnt>
<joey> also that's also not like </joey>
<joey> her fault it was like just a thing of </joey>
<joey> that that comes with just having a </joey>
<joey> roommate </joey>
<joey> eventually you just you live with </joey>
<joey> someone long enough you're like i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hate </joey>
<joey> just the little thing that you do and i </joey>
<joey> have no idea why yeah </joey>
<joey> and i thought i could live alone and </joey>
<connor> then i like one week into living alone </connor>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] it's quiet in here </connor>
<joey> oh yes i was so [ __ ] depressed when i </joey>
<joey> started living alone here </joey>
<joey> right like before like you moved in with </joey>
<joey> me i was like [ __ ] man i've been out of </joey>
<joey> the house in two weeks i'm so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> lonely right now </joey>
<garnt> and like am i am i the only true </garnt>
<garnt> introvert here </garnt>
<garnt> i mean look i like my time alone don't </garnt>
<garnt> get me wrong right like i like my </garnt>
<garnt> timeline but there's only </garnt>
<garnt> so much time i like alone before i'm </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i require the touch of a human oh no i'm </joey>
<garnt> i i i'm the same because i remember </garnt>
<garnt> before i moved to japan i basically </garnt>
<garnt> lived alone for like </garnt>
<garnt> uh like three four months yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> because sydney was in america at the </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> and we were sorting out our visa stuff </garnt>
<garnt> for japan so there was just like </garnt>
<joey> like a fair few month period where my </joey>
<joey> only social life would be when we'd be </joey>
<joey> able to like hang out in london </joey>
<joey> um and i don't know if it's just because </joey>
<joey> i've been in a relationship for like </joey>
<joey> four years </joey>
<joey> it was just like it was just it was just </joey>
<joey> like nice having </joey>
<joey> like just just living alone um and just </joey>
<joey> seeing </joey>
<joey> friends and seeing people when i wanted </joey>
<joey> to um because i guess the big difference </joey>
<joey> between japan and when i was living in </joey>
<connor> england is that </connor>
<connor> i could see someone whenever i wanted to </connor>
<connor> in england if i really wanted to yeah </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> you could just message me let's hang out </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly exactly i feel like if </connor>
<garnt> it was if it was the case of you know i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know when i'm going to see someone </garnt>
<garnt> next then i would be a way more lonely </garnt>
<joey> um well that's why i'm like constantly </joey>
<garnt> just like filling in plans like a head </garnt>
<garnt> up yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like yo you want to hang out you want to </garnt>
<garnt> hang out you want to hang out late </garnt>
<garnt> otherwise </garnt>
<joey> you're going to find yourself in this </joey>
<joey> kind of like dead space </joey>
<joey> of just no interaction whatsoever yeah </joey>
<connor> because like when i first moved here and </connor>
<connor> i didn't really have anything in my </connor>
<joey> house </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah i was just going on tinder </joey>
<joey> dates just because i was lonely yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i didn't </joey>
<garnt> like it sounds so sad but you know what </garnt>
<joey> i didn't </joey>
<joey> do that man i mean and when i didn't </joey>
<joey> have you know anything to do i would </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> go to your your house but then i felt </joey>
<joey> bad you know because i didn't want to go </joey>
<joey> to their house every day and be like hey </joey>
<joey> i know you didn't mind but i also didn't </joey>
<joey> like i felt like i was intruding </joey>
<joey> right so and it was just sad you know </joey>
<joey> and it took me a while to get used to it </joey>
<joey> and getting used to being alone </joey>
<connor> that sounds so sad [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> i mean living alone sorry yeah being </connor>
<joey> alone </joey>
<joey> i just have to get used to just being </joey>
<joey> you know in my soul </joey>
<joey> i figured how to have a healthy balance </joey>
<joey> of everything but it took me a while </joey>
<joey> because i did i wasn't used to it right </joey>
<joey> i always had someone in my house that i </joey>
<joey> could always be like yo you want to </joey>
<joey> watch tv you know </joey>
<joey> so is this your subtle way of asking us </joey>
<joey> to come to your house </joey>
<garnt> please no no no so like okay so we're </garnt>
<joey> going back to our </joey>
<joey> like original [ __ ] topic of this </joey>
<joey> video of like online friends and </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<joey> when did you guys realize that online </joey>
<connor> friends just wasn't </connor>
<connor> enough he couldn't feel that whole that </connor>
<garnt> having real </garnt>
<garnt> physical friends that you can see like </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> after i had like a really healthy friend </joey>
<joey> group i think like </joey>
<joey> irl friend group yeah yeah after you </joey>
<joey> have like an actually good irl friend </joey>
<joey> group that like you just </joey>
<joey> you would rather hang out with more than </joey>
<connor> like anyone um yeah i feel like there's </connor>
<garnt> no going back </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i i feel that as well because </garnt>
<garnt> i found my i found like my first proper </garnt>
<garnt> true friend group </garnt>
<garnt> like at the age of like 23 24 that's </garnt>
<garnt> when it kind of started </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember like my mom had like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up my entire perception </garnt>
<garnt> because my mom had raised me for like </garnt>
<joey> 18 years to be like don't give a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> about your high school friends </joey>
<joey> your real friends for life your actual </joey>
<joey> real friends will come in university </joey>
<joey> so i go to i go to university and i just </joey>
<joey> i'm just there with my like my </joey>
<joey> housemates my coursemates i'm just </joey>
<joey> looking around i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i hate everyone around me i feel like </joey>
<joey> mike wazowski's </joey>
<joey> like where are the friends yeah it's </joey>
<joey> just like where are the friends </joey>
<joey> mum why would you lie to me mum why </joey>
<joey> would you lie to me </joey>
<joey> so yeah i'm i'm not in contact with like </joey>
<joey> anyone from like in my university days </joey>
<garnt> like some more so in my high school days </garnt>
<garnt> where university was </garnt>
<garnt> university was just like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> cesspool right </joey>
<joey> where i was definitely i definitely have </joey>
<joey> more in contact with my high school </joey>
<joey> friends than i do my uni friends </joey>
<joey> yeah like not say i don't have any uni </joey>
<joey> friends like i have you know some of my </joey>
<joey> uni friends are [ __ ] best friends </joey>
<joey> forever but </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i don't know like i think that </joey>
<joey> whole thing of like oh don't worry about </joey>
<joey> high school because there won't be a </joey>
<joey> friends for like </joey>
<connor> i think that's kind of [ __ ] yeah i </connor>
<connor> think you'll you'll know if you've made </connor>
<joey> a friend for life yeah yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<garnt> so i think it's like </garnt>
<garnt> there is no designated time when you </garnt>
<garnt> will make friends for life </garnt>
<garnt> it will happen along the way but i </garnt>
<joey> remember like </joey>
<joey> finding my first friend group and now i </joey>
<joey> was just realizing oh </joey>
<joey> so i don't have to pretend to be someone </joey>
<joey> likeable to be around you guys because </joey>
<joey> you just </joey>
<joey> you guys just kind of like me for the </joey>
<garnt> person i am yeah and that was just like </garnt>
<garnt> so mind-blowing for me what the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<connor> that all about </connor>
<joey> yeah cause it's just like having friends </joey>
<joey> that are like just like you know even </joey>
<connor> though there's like a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of people it's just like </connor>
<connor> everyone's there to help each other like </connor>
<joey> if you're having a low point </joey>
<joey> it's the whole philosophy of god you're </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] but i love you yeah you know </joey>
<joey> it's that yeah you know and just like </joey>
<joey> mates they're just there for you like </joey>
<joey> regardless of like you know what's going </joey>
<joey> on yeah and i i really really really </joey>
<joey> value that </joey>
<joey> yeah and uh it's a shame as well because </joey>
<garnt> i'm i [ __ ] hate texting </garnt>
<garnt> so much i absolutely despise texting </garnt>
<garnt> yeah same here </garnt>
<garnt> and i pretty much the only people i text </garnt>
<garnt> are like people i know </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm going to meet up with that i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like yo when we meet or not what's </garnt>
<garnt> happening you know like oh it's like </garnt>
<joey> business or anything but outside of that </joey>
<joey> i avoid like the plague </joey>
<joey> because i just hate it why do you hate </joey>
<joey> it i just it doesn't feel genuine and it </joey>
<joey> takes so long </joey>
<connor> it's i'm like i'd rather have a 30 </connor>
<connor> minute call than text for like a whole </connor>
<connor> day back and forth </connor>
<garnt> all right yeah yeah same here like i'm i </garnt>
<connor> mean i'm sure you both know i'm [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> all for replying to oh god </connor>
<connor> it's worse bro and that's because like i </connor>
<joey> it takes for me it takes like so much </joey>
<joey> mental energy to like </joey>
<joey> be i get it i can look at notifications </joey>
<joey> that i just i just have to like </joey>
<joey> have a dedicated time when i check </joey>
<joey> messages otherwise one i just get </joey>
<joey> distracted from whatever i'm doing </joey>
<joey> and i i much rather i i value so much </joey>
<garnt> having like a just </garnt>
<garnt> an in person or like an invoice like </garnt>
<garnt> actual communication because </garnt>
<garnt> there's so much that i can't communicate </garnt>
<garnt> when it's just during text that i just </garnt>
<garnt> i just rather talk to people i don't </garnt>
<connor> know i feel like i get that </connor>
<connor> i feel like a lot of you know a lot of </connor>
<joey> context is </joey>
<joey> almost lost as well when you're just </joey>
<joey> texting as well yeah like a lot it can't </joey>
<joey> be </joey>
<joey> like all the emotions can't be like you </joey>
<joey> know portrayed properly yes </joey>
<joey> um yeah and you know i kind of realized </joey>
<joey> as well that the </joey>
<joey> the friends you'll have in life the ones </joey>
<joey> that like i might not text right now </joey>
<joey> yeah like the real friends are the ones </joey>
<joey> where it doesn't matter i don't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> need to text them </joey>
<joey> yeah like even for a year or two i i i </joey>
<connor> go back and then it's exactly yeah it's </connor>
<joey> exactly the same </joey>
<joey> it's exactly the same the way i see is </joey>
<joey> like it's kind of like a family reunion </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean and i didn't i didn't </joey>
<joey> fully understand </joey>
<joey> the term where i was just like friends </joey>
<joey> of the family you choose </joey>
<joey> until i had a proper friend group yeah i </joey>
<joey> was just like i i remember hearing that </joey>
<joey> for like my entire life and thinking </joey>
<connor> that's such a [ __ ] term </connor>
<joey> that's like this like cheesy disney </joey>
<connor> movie </connor>
<joey> that isn't actually real it's a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> urban myth it's a [ __ ] urban legend </garnt>
<joey> you know yeah </joey>
<joey> it wasn't the destination it was the </joey>
<garnt> friends we made along the way </garnt>
<connor> so with that being said yeah back to the </connor>
<joey> the question at hand which was </joey>
<joey> how are you going to stay in japan what </joey>
<joey> do you think what do you think boys </joey>
<joey> because i think </joey>
<joey> right now my main con thing is that like </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day </joey>
<connor> with all my gripes that i had and i i've </connor>
<connor> made them very known as the comments </connor>
<connor> like to point out that they think i </connor>
<connor> despise japan i'm very critical of </connor>
<connor> everything in life yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh at the end of the day japan the </connor>
<connor> standard of living is just much higher </connor>
<connor> at the moment </connor>
<garnt> especially especially when you're </garnt>
<garnt> british you just learn to complain about </garnt>
<connor> all the little yeah yeah a lot of people </connor>
<connor> just think that i i really see a lot of </connor>
<connor> comments like connor's so [ __ ] rude </connor>
<connor> about japan i'm like no i'm just pretty </connor>
<joey> it's just being real bro it's just </joey>
<joey> people just being brilliant </joey>
<joey> we complain about everything yeah okay </joey>
<joey> here's a question to you guys </joey>
<joey> so we all are living in the place that </joey>
<garnt> is not where we were born </garnt>
<garnt> did you always know that you would move </garnt>
<joey> out of your home country and live </joey>
<joey> somewhere else </joey>
<joey> yeah absolutely i like cause like at </joey>
<joey> least for me </joey>
<joey> i moved out of the house that i was born </joey>
<joey> in </joey>
<joey> yeah so i never moved until i moved out </joey>
<joey> of my home so </joey>
<connor> i've been living in that like my parents </connor>
<garnt> house for like 21 </garnt>
<connor> years straight and i was just like yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's home but yeah it's also like </garnt>
<garnt> you know you go home and you just see </garnt>
<connor> the same view out of the window every </connor>
<joey> day right </joey>
<connor> yeah i need i need i need something else </connor>
<joey> i i love my home don't get me wrong yeah </joey>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> i think especially because i was so </garnt>
<garnt> active online from such a young age yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i became so aware </garnt>
<garnt> like globally of other different places </garnt>
<connor> right and then it just made me curious </connor>
<joey> yeah yes </joey>
<joey> i i remember yeah going back to my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] mum </joey>
<joey> it was just i remember like when i was a </joey>
<joey> kid i was just like mom </joey>
<connor> i'm i'm telling you this now love </connor>
<joey> england's but i'm going to move out </joey>
<connor> three-year-old </connor>
<joey> i was like you know between like when i </joey>
<joey> was like going from a kid to a teenager </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] knew that i would like move out </joey>
<joey> of england eventually and i was like mom </joey>
<joey> don't take this personally i'm just </joey>
<joey> gonna move out i'm gonna i'm not gonna </joey>
<joey> be in the country my mum was like </joey>
<joey> sure sure bets </joey>
<joey> okay son whatever you say and i remember </joey>
<joey> when i told her hey mom i'm just gonna </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] move to thailand for a few </joey>
<joey> years she was like surprise pikachu face </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> like nanny you you are actually serious </joey>
<joey> all these years and yeah because </joey>
<joey> like not that i don't love england but i </joey>
<joey> one i wanted to </joey>
<joey> experience like different cultures and </joey>
<joey> everything since i was a [ __ ] kid </joey>
<joey> and two like i i don't know it's </joey>
<joey> i was always in my head i was always </joey>
<joey> thinking that there was this perfect </joey>
<joey> place to live </joey>
<joey> that wasn't the place yet that you were </joey>
<joey> from because everywhere else seemed so </joey>
<joey> exotic right </joey>
<joey> and everything and like the more i move </joey>
<joey> around the less idea i have about where </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> truly want to [ __ ] settle down it's </joey>
<garnt> it's really weird right because you </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you live like stay in the </garnt>
<garnt> place for like any substantial amount of </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> you see all the great things that that </garnt>
<garnt> are there and you also see the bad </garnt>
<garnt> things there's no [ __ ] perfect place </garnt>
<garnt> and the more the more you move around </garnt>
<garnt> the more you realize there is no perfect </garnt>
<garnt> place so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you got to make that decision of </garnt>
<garnt> hey where what is what is actually best </garnt>
<connor> for me you know </connor>
<connor> legit when between the ages of like 12 </connor>
<connor> and 16 i thought america was the perfect </connor>
<garnt> place </garnt>
<garnt> i thought america was i really i really </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to live in america yeah </garnt>
<garnt> all my life until like age and probably </garnt>
<garnt> actually until like i moved to japan i </garnt>
<garnt> still like before that i was like i kind </garnt>
<garnt> of still want to go to america man </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know always since young age i'd </garnt>
<garnt> always been exposed to american culture </garnt>
<garnt> i always spoke with americans online </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i just really loved their style </garnt>
<joey> of doing things </joey>
<connor> yes i love how [ __ ] crazy they are i </connor>
<connor> don't know i think i i think it's </connor>
<joey> because for me it's like i didn't really </joey>
<joey> like interact with any americans </joey>
<connor> i think that's the thing right because </connor>
<garnt> like literally from age 12 i've been </garnt>
<garnt> chatting with people online always voice </garnt>
<garnt> chatting like my parents </garnt>
<connor> for some reason didn't stop me and most </connor>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<connor> and most of the online friends you got </connor>
<connor> were just from america right yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah a lot of a lot of the people you </garnt>
<garnt> were friends with were from america i </garnt>
<connor> was the token british friend most of the </connor>

<connor> country what is this </connor>
<joey> i don't know okay this is like i used to </joey>
<joey> go camping so much so like sitting in a </joey>

<joey> what </joey>
<joey> like if i vacation all i want to do is </joey>
<joey> just relax and just chill out yeah </joey>
<garnt> i don't want to [ __ ] do activities i </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to [ __ ] write it like i </garnt>
<joey> don't want to [ __ ] be uncomfortable </joey>
<joey> everyone everyone has my granddad </joey>
<connor> honestly i'm i'm already accepted that i </connor>
<joey> am </joey>
<connor> like a 60 year old white dude when it </connor>
<joey> comes to like you just don't want to </joey>
<joey> like advice </joey>
<garnt> in another country right i don't either </garnt>
<garnt> i'm 100 with connor in this i'm fine </garnt>
<connor> with doing an activity on a day or two </connor>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> again okay maybe we can hide but i do </garnt>
<connor> not want to [ __ ] do [ __ ] every day </connor>
<connor> i also don't want to have to like i </connor>
<garnt> don't want to have pressure </garnt>
<garnt> that i need to go see something yes if </garnt>
<garnt> i'm in a place and i'm just like you </garnt>
<joey> need to go here you need to go there you </joey>

<joey> that's that's my that's my perfect </joey>
<connor> holiday and it doesn't come from a place </connor>
<connor> maybe it does come from a place of </connor>
<garnt> privilege i don't [ __ ] yeah it probably </garnt>
<garnt> does but </garnt>
<connor> i honestly don't give a [ __ ] i just want </connor>
<garnt> to chill on my heart </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's just cause of like what i </garnt>
<garnt> went through as a kid because when when </garnt>
<garnt> you go on holiday as a kid right </garnt>
<garnt> you got to follow what everyone else is </garnt>
<garnt> right and you i always had i always like </garnt>
<connor> had this [ __ ] especially </connor>
<garnt> if i go into like a big group like the </garnt>
<connor> stacked [ __ ] itinerary </connor>
<connor> well all i wanted to do was just stay in </connor>
<connor> my [ __ ] hotel room and playing my </connor>
<connor> nintendo ds </connor>
<connor> that's all i wanted to [ __ ] do on </connor>
<connor> holidays dude because we used to i used </connor>
<joey> to go camping uh for </joey>
<joey> uh in france like i said every year for </joey>
<joey> three weeks right </joey>
<joey> and i in most years i [ __ ] hated it </joey>
<joey> yeah and my parents thought that i was </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> they thought it you know okay i get it </joey>
<joey> now what they think they're like oh he's </joey>
<connor> just saying he hates it yeah you know </connor>
<joey> what i mean like </joey>
<connor> he's just that's a knitter no no i </connor>
<connor> actually hated it like </connor>
<connor> it was like you were in a tent you were </connor>
<connor> sleeping on the floor it was </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable so it's like three weeks </connor>
<connor> you're eating the same [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> everything okay so everything is grilled </joey>
<joey> on a barbecue i love i love </joey>
<joey> camping don't get me wrong i used like </joey>
<joey> my dad used to take me camping like in </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] australian outback like </joey>
<garnt> all the time but it wasn't for three </garnt>
<connor> weeks it was like tops like five days </connor>
<joey> that's the thing right i think three </joey>
<joey> weeks is way too i think that's what </joey>
<joey> like has completely put me off </joey>
<joey> vacationing in any places that aren't </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> honestly just like relaxing in a nice </joey>
<joey> bed yeah just </joey>
<joey> eating nice food like that kind of like </joey>
<joey> put me off for life because i spent </joey>
<joey> most of my childhood summers just </joey>
<joey> sleeping on the floor </joey>
<joey> eating everything that had to be grilled </joey>
<joey> yeah because that's all you had to cook </joey>
<joey> right it was a grill baguettes non-stop </joey>
<garnt> and then always always those horrible </garnt>
<garnt> public showers that are never clean </garnt>
<garnt> and then sometimes you would see like </garnt>
<joey> piss in the corner and it would always </joey>
<joey> smell and it was just awful </joey>
<joey> like everything was awful and even as a </joey>
<joey> 12 year old i could be like </joey>
<joey> i'm is this some peasant joke i'm too </joey>
<joey> rich to understand right like i i just i </joey>
<joey> don't know like i </joey>
<joey> i really like that that would throw me </joey>
<joey> off i would always be like at home we </joey>
<joey> had a toilet </joey>
<joey> that was nice and it didn't stink of </joey>
<connor> just everything </connor>
<garnt> why does it here i i also wonder how </garnt>
<garnt> different my perceptions of a lot of </garnt>
<connor> these activities would be </connor>
<connor> if i actually went nowadays </connor>
<connor> with my mates because three weeks like </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah part of part of the reason i </joey>
<joey> like look back and dread about it is </joey>
<connor> because you spent it with you were </connor>
<connor> forced to be there </connor>
<connor> with like your family and something you </connor>
<connor> wanted to do something else </connor>
<connor> that your family didn't want to do and i </connor>
<connor> feel like that's just like </connor>
<garnt> that that kind of memory has been </garnt>
<garnt> ingrained into me that i just like </garnt>
<garnt> i hate this activity because i did that </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] as a kid and i hated it yeah </connor>
<connor> because my parents were obsessed with </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> maximizing the [ __ ] out of the day like </garnt>
<joey> i was like yeah </joey>
<garnt> let's let's go if we go in france it's </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah let's just walk around this </garnt>
<garnt> town all day and i'm like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> no i want to go to the arcade all day </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i do not want to walk all day </garnt>
<connor> like i'm starting the age where walking </connor>
<connor> just hurts </connor>
<connor> all day right i don't know like for some </connor>
<connor> reason when you're when you're a kid </connor>
<connor> like walking long distances just doesn't </connor>
<joey> work like </joey>
<joey> were you an active kid 100 like yeah i </joey>
<joey> was doing sports two three times a week </joey>
<joey> oh okay </joey>
<joey> but for some reason just walking when i </joey>
<joey> had to walk all day </joey>
<joey> it was just pain which is pain man </joey>
<garnt> and then when you're a kid right there's </garnt>
<connor> nothing more boring than </connor>
<connor> fishing and i would have to do it that's </connor>
<joey> true and i thought i'm glad my dad </joey>
<joey> never got me into fishing like my dad </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] destroyed something that i could </connor>
<connor> see me enjoying now </connor>
<garnt> with a mate and drinking a friend </garnt>
<garnt> i've actually been fishing for the first </garnt>
<garnt> time recently which is like two years </garnt>
<garnt> ago with uh </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's dad and sydney's uh brother </garnt>
<garnt> took me fishing for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> i actually really [ __ ] enjoyed it </garnt>
<connor> right right as an adult it's one of </connor>
<connor> those things that like as a kid </connor>
<garnt> you're just not wired yeah okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> they're they're it's gonna make me sound </garnt>
<garnt> so bad but there is one big difference </garnt>
<garnt> about why i can enjoy it now versus what </garnt>
<garnt> i could enjoy as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> and that's because alcohol is now on </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> i have never seen a man fish with not a </connor>
<joey> beer in that little pocket yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it just doesn't happen because </joey>
<joey> i mean it's not part of the charm yeah </joey>
<joey> right like </joey>
<joey> going it as a kid it is just like it's </joey>
<joey> the adhd simulator because </joey>
<joey> all you want to do is like why is there </joey>
<joey> enough fish catching on this immediately </joey>
<joey> yeah oh </joey>
<joey> i'm trying to get this [ __ ] thing on </joey>
<joey> the thing on my [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah where's my nintendo ds i need to </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] cook your mama for 20 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> relax </garnt>
<garnt> you're trying to do it and nothing </garnt>
<garnt> happens you get [ __ ] fish and as a kid </garnt>
<joey> you're like let's let's kill it and eat </joey>
<joey> it let's let's do something yeah let's </joey>
<joey> do </joey>
<joey> let's [ __ ] [ __ ] decapitate this </joey>
<joey> fish and then that your dad's like we </joey>
<garnt> throw it back here </garnt>
<garnt> what's the point i want to eat it you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<joey> because you're a kid and you think in </joey>
<joey> every video game i've caught it and i've </joey>
<joey> eat it yeah why are you stopping me down </joey>
<joey> it's the worst activity for a kid </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it doesn't make sense and just </joey>
<connor> the whole thing </connor>
<connor> just completely ruined like doing that </connor>
<connor> kind of stuff for me as an adult now </connor>
<garnt> because i have </garnt>
<garnt> no interest yeah yeah i i would actually </garnt>
<joey> go back fishing with my mates because </joey>
<joey> it was just like a nice mail we should </joey>
<garnt> go fishing we should [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> go fishing with you i haven't been </joey>
<joey> fishing for like five years </joey>
<garnt> i will tell you what because i've had </garnt>
<garnt> this image of what fishing would be like </garnt>
<garnt> my entire life </garnt>
<connor> and because like my only my only </connor>
<connor> experience with fishing </connor>
<connor> my entire life has been through the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] fishing mini games you get in </connor>
<connor> every [ __ ] every [ __ ] zelda game </connor>
<garnt> or every like it's in animal crossing </garnt>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<connor> play for the free controller yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah exactly and i thought to myself </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way it's going to be like </garnt>
<garnt> this and i was [ __ ] surprised at how </garnt>
<garnt> accurate that simulation is </garnt>
<joey> like it literally felt like a controller </joey>
<joey> rumble and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> oh like this is just like the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> video </joey>
<joey> it's like where's the a button yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's it's literally just instead of </garnt>
<joey> tapping the a button you just go </joey>
<garnt> shhh and yeah it's but for some reason </garnt>
<joey> it was just like it was like very </joey>
<joey> therapeutic </joey>
<garnt> and uh if you like fishing fishing mini </garnt>
<garnt> games it's exactly like that and i was </garnt>
<joey> surprised </joey>
<joey> every like fishing enthusiast is just </joey>
<joey> like frothing at the bathroom like how </joey>

<joey> and i was like oh my god </joey>
<joey> did it rain bear in mind this is the </joey>
<joey> three person ten four of us in it </joey>
<joey> and i woke up being like oh my god it </joey>
<joey> must have rained so much i go outside </joey>
<joey> it's completely dry right and i'm like </joey>
<joey> oh it was sweat </joey>
<joey> it was all sweat it was all condensation </joey>

<joey> this isn't for me i </joey>
<joey> i i'm going to go back to sitting on the </joey>
<joey> bed and watching </joey>
<joey> me i think that </joey>
<joey> this isn't for me why why did you even </joey>
<joey> like decide to do it </joey>
<joey> well because it's one of those things </joey>
<joey> where it's like i can do it </joey>
<joey> yeah if you asked me to go hiking for a </joey>
<garnt> week i'll do it i'm very capable of </garnt>
<joey> doing it right yeah i just hate every </joey>
<garnt> second of it well why do you accept it </garnt>
<joey> my parents were like you should do it </joey>
<joey> and i was like fine okay okay </joey>
<joey> and i was doing the other stuff anyway </joey>
<joey> because i was i was teaching kids chess </joey>
<joey> at my old school yeah uh i don't know </joey>
<joey> man like i knew from the get-go when </joey>
<joey> like the </joey>
<joey> the option was brought up off would you </joey>
<joey> like to do duke of edinburgh like would </joey>
<garnt> you like to go hiking </garnt>
<connor> and [ __ ] experience dampness for a </connor>
<joey> week straight i was like yeah </joey>
<connor> of course i don't i think because as </connor>
<connor> well they wanted like the kids who had a </connor>
<joey> lot of experience </joey>
<joey> camping to help the kids who hadn't done </joey>
<joey> any </joey>
<joey> and it was only like there was only like </joey>
<joey> three or four boys and like the boy </joey>
<joey> scouts </joey>
<joey> in like my year and then there was like </joey>
<joey> me who done a lot of camping </joey>
<joey> so it was like okay so you were the </joey>
<garnt> experience i guess yeah to me it was </garnt>
<joey> like connor should help out and you're </joey>
<joey> the boy scout </joey>
<joey> you know i never did anything like map </joey>
<joey> direction or anything like that </joey>
<joey> my parents [ __ ] did all that i might </joey>
<joey> barely help with setting up the tents </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> like you just put the bag down yeah i </joey>
<joey> used to be like i'm going to play with </joey>
<joey> the frisbee </joey>
<joey> so when we did it i do remember this as </joey>
<joey> well like when it came i was like i'll </joey>
<joey> i'll do the cooking you could you can </joey>
<joey> set up the 10 because </joey>
<garnt> and because it was one of the cheap ones </garnt>
<garnt> as well and the cheap ones are like </garnt>
<garnt> connect the 576 poles together and it's </garnt>
<joey> like no </joey>
<joey> none of them can get it right and i'm </joey>
<joey> like i'm gonna cook the bacon that i </joey>
<joey> brought </joey>
<joey> yeah i was yeah i i i i've been down to </joey>
<joey> go camping though in japan i've never </joey>
<connor> been camping in japan </connor>
<connor> we should do glamping yeah camping is </connor>
<garnt> cool i've never gone i've never it's </garnt>
<joey> like camping without all the </joey>
<joey> frustrations it's like camping with </joey>
<joey> privilege it's like coupling with </joey>
<garnt> civilization like if we didn't if we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't want to like </garnt>
<connor> invent all this [ __ ] we wouldn't happen </connor>
<garnt> yeah that might be real i don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> camp without 4g </garnt>
<joey> like what's the point i'm just going to </joey>
<joey> say it right i know it's not the same i </joey>
<joey> don't give a [ __ ] i want 4g </joey>
<connor> i can count without 4g i can cancel this </connor>
<joey> okay you know you know what you know </joey>
<joey> what i need a toilet you're right </joey>
<joey> toilets yeah i i i don't want a [ __ ] in </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] bag or a hole in the ground </joey>
<joey> with there's a reason there's a reason </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] humans evolved </garnt>
<garnt> and invented toilets in civilization </garnt>
<connor> have you ever wiped your ass with a leaf </connor>
<connor> no it just doesn't work but that's all </connor>
<connor> you have </connor>
<connor> what are you gonna do grab a handful of </connor>
<connor> grass no you have to use leaves and hope </connor>
<connor> you can just get most of it out it's </connor>
<joey> awful well that's why like the one thing </joey>
<joey> we always took camping was a </joey>
<connor> like a bunch of toilet rolls damn dude </connor>
<connor> 20 20 man yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah because what you just you go out </connor>
<connor> into the bush you'd wipe yourself i'll </connor>
<connor> put it in a bag and then you throw all </connor>
<connor> of that </connor>
<connor> i must have been as like 12 year old me </connor>
<connor> it was like instant noodles or toilet </connor>
<connor> rolls </connor>
<joey> chicken flavor or poopy butt like oh god </joey>
<connor> it was i do remember when we did it </connor>
<connor> there was awful because like there was a </connor>
<joey> lot of kids that were </joey>
<joey> just not prepared at all yeah and had </joey>
<joey> never even done any hiking at all </joey>
<garnt> right and those those things are heavy </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah and a lot of them just </joey>
<garnt> couldn't do it and you had to stay as a </garnt>
<garnt> team </garnt>
<joey> so it's like every 15 minutes one kid </joey>
<garnt> would have a [ __ ] mental breakdown </garnt>
<joey> yeah and it was like i can't do it i </joey>
<garnt> so the only thing that like puts me off </garnt>
<garnt> camping in japan from what i've seen </garnt>
<garnt> like only only like the pictures and </garnt>
<garnt> everything i've seen is that it looks </garnt>
<connor> very </connor>
<garnt> how can i say it's commercialized </garnt>
<garnt> because it's it's like you have this </garnt>
<garnt> like camping sport and like i see a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of tents there </garnt>
<connor> it's very privileged yeah yeah and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like you're put right next to </connor>
<garnt> someone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and it's just i remember the </garnt>
<garnt> one thing </garnt>
<joey> um i remember about camping is just like </joey>
<joey> how </joey>
<joey> little noise protection you have from </joey>
<joey> one intent to another right </joey>
<joey> you hear everything yeah right and </joey>
<joey> especially </joey>
<joey> the what i you know especially the </joey>
<joey> camping experience i would like to have </joey>
<joey> which is like a bonding mate sesh like i </joey>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you have like a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> japanese people around you with tens and </garnt>
<garnt> everyone values their privacy can you </garnt>
<garnt> imagine how quiet you'd have to be </garnt>
<joey> oh we could just be those like ignorant </joey>
<joey> gaijin just be like </joey>
<joey> you know if no one's making noise at </joey>
<joey> this campsite i think we will like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<connor> what are they gonna say you just hit </connor>
<connor> like 2 a.m just like aggressive uno </connor>
<connor> noises </connor>
<joey> like from drunk people </joey>
<joey> i don't know [ __ ] jojo uno session at </joey>
<connor> two in the morning in a tent </connor>
<connor> should do trash taste hiking special oh </connor>
<joey> i'd be down man i used to go hiking all </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] time actually that's that's </joey>
<connor> the idea what the other worst part is </connor>
<joey> it's actually not a bad idea yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i'd be down there i'd be down </joey>
<garnt> you know it's it's all about i'd be </garnt>
<garnt> willing to do it now is it for content </garnt>
<garnt> okay i'm willing to [ __ ] suffer for </garnt>
<garnt> content whatever i am </garnt>
<joey> i am i am that's that's that's the </joey>
<garnt> tipping point right at least like </garnt>
<joey> i'll do it but is it monetized </joey>
<garnt> yeah all right i'll do it how do we get </garnt>
<connor> on talking about camping </connor>
<connor> i don't know but like uh yeah so yeah </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] we were talking about oh </joey>
<connor> yeah if you're going to stay in japan or </connor>
<connor> not </connor>
<garnt> oh well i mean oh no no no it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> like which country would you visit </garnt>
<garnt> because like is there a country that's </garnt>

<joey> just the culture around i'm like all the </joey>
<joey> places i've seen </joey>

<joey> yeah i really i just want to go to </joey>
<joey> europe mall </joey>
<connor> yeah everything's just super [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> expensive this is just like a travel </garnt>
<connor> wishlist now </connor>
<connor> this is just us fantasizing and covered </connor>
<connor> times yeah i'm just kidding remember </connor>
<garnt> remember before covert existed and we </garnt>
<garnt> could travel to places </garnt>
<joey> yeah i do want to go back home and visit </joey>
<joey> my family because it's weird because </joey>
<joey> this will be like the second </joey>
<joey> christmas in a row where i haven't seen </joey>
<joey> them which is normally would be the </joey>
<joey> thing where it's like okay i'll go back </joey>
<joey> for christmas </joey>
<joey> yeah you know um but yeah i mean that's </joey>
<garnt> that's one big thing but as far as </garnt>
<garnt> living in japan goes and i mentioned on </garnt>
<garnt> like you know the quality of life being </garnt>
<garnt> really good here </garnt>
<garnt> i definitely felt like at least another </garnt>
<connor> two years i want to stay here yeah and i </connor>
<connor> think it'll be a case of </connor>
<connor> in a year i'll know if it's going to be </connor>
<connor> another two years it's one of those </connor>
<connor> things where i i'll just as it goes i'll </connor>
<joey> keep changing that number </joey>
<joey> that's how it is like from like with a </joey>
<joey> lot of my friends who are from overseas </joey>
<joey> who live here or have been living here </joey>
<joey> it's always the case of you know </joey>
<joey> all right we'll give ourselves one more </joey>
<joey> year see how it goes and then usually </joey>
<joey> like 90 of the time after that year ends </joey>
<joey> up it's like </joey>
<joey> another year and then it just keeps </joey>
<joey> going right and it's such a pain to move </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] back it's like </joey>
<connor> it's worth the like i really can't be </connor>
<garnt> bothered with that again but </garnt>
<garnt> do you guys feel this as well i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if you guys feel the same but like </garnt>
<joey> for me this has been the first year </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<joey> what i do actually feels like a career </joey>
<joey> as opposed to just me just being </joey>
<joey> self-employed doing my own [ __ ] job </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> you know i mean i've never been employed </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah once all this point </garnt>
<joey> sorry </joey>
<joey> it just feels good it just feels like </joey>
<garnt> for for the first time this isn't just </garnt>
<garnt> a job it's like my career now yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> um i don't know just you </garnt>
<joey> you you don't think doing like doing </joey>
<joey> like youtube and your job that </joey>
<joey> environment really </joey>
<joey> matters because you can do technically </joey>
<joey> do it anywhere but the more like i've </joey>
<joey> done this and the more i've </joey>
<joey> growing up the more i realized hey </joey>
<joey> environment really [ __ ] matters in </joey>
<joey> in your works oh yeah like i remember </joey>
<joey> going like i remember in university </joey>
<joey> where i'm just like i can do youtube </joey>
<joey> wherever </joey>
<joey> i can do in my in my [ __ ] room you </joey>
<joey> know i can do it next to my bed </joey>
<joey> and then i slowly realize i need my own </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] office i need my own [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> space </joey>
<joey> i i i need to separate you know work </joey>
<joey> and my leisure time because you can you </joey>
<joey> can like you can survive with it and you </joey>
<joey> can do it but </joey>
<joey> you're just there there'll end up be a </joey>
<joey> point where you get </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] depressed and you get tired and </garnt>
<joey> you just it's not healthy </joey>
<joey> you know yeah yeah i mean it definitely </joey>
<joey> completely changed my </joey>
<joey> productivity but also just like my </joey>
<joey> enthusiasm towards my </joey>
<joey> career and i guess like it really </joey>
<joey> cemented the severity </joey>
<joey> of what i do of like this isn't just </joey>
<joey> like a little fun thing that you get </joey>
<joey> paid for like this </joey>
<joey> this is this is your job right now this </joey>
<garnt> is your career like </garnt>
<garnt> putting food on the table is this now </garnt>
<garnt> and everything you do </garnt>
<garnt> revolves around this and definitely you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> like moving to a bigger place and </garnt>
<garnt> getting my own like actual work room has </garnt>
<garnt> like really cemented that like okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this is like yeah i can [ __ ] around </garnt>
<garnt> on camera and be silly and goofy </garnt>
<joey> yeah but it's also my job like i can't i </joey>
<garnt> can't half-ass this [ __ ] like i need to </garnt>
<joey> be serious about it but like </joey>
<joey> that's brought on an entirely different </joey>
<joey> i guess </joey>
<joey> layer of enjoyment that i otherwise </joey>
<joey> would have never experienced </joey>
<joey> and i don't know like i think it's </joey>
<joey> because as well like all the topics that </joey>
<joey> we cover of like you know the kind of </joey>
<joey> otaku </joey>
<joey> kind of stuff and like anime kind of </joey>
<joey> stuff where it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> doing it here as opposed to anywhere </joey>
<joey> else is just </joey>
<garnt> i think completely different oh it </garnt>
<garnt> totally is like one one of the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> things i've like </garnt>
<garnt> realized this year is a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> mystery </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like the mystery and the </garnt>
<garnt> prestige not </garnt>
<garnt> not the prestige like the mystery around </garnt>
<joey> like the anime industry itself </joey>
<joey> has kind of like it's it's i see the </joey>
<joey> anime industry totally different </joey>
<joey> because i remember before like i moved </joey>
<joey> here and you know you know </joey>
<joey> as as a teenager as a kid you think </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe i could like as a dream job </joey>
<joey> i could work in anime once yeah </joey>
<joey> but like you have no [ __ ] clue what </joey>
<joey> steps you need to take </joey>
<joey> like i thought you had to be like </joey>
<joey> incredibly [ __ ] lucky and like the </joey>
<joey> more i meet people who work in this </joey>
<joey> industry </joey>
<joey> the more i realized oh you just need to </joey>
<joey> be here yeah you know what i mean like </joey>
<joey> like you just need to be here and know </joey>
<joey> one person yeah and that's enough </joey>
<joey> and sometimes you could [ __ ] look up </joey>
<joey> a job on craigslist </joey>
<joey> sometimes you you know you just you </joey>
<joey> you're like teaching english or </joey>
<joey> something or something and you just </joey>
<joey> happen to be </joey>
<joey> in person you just happen to stumble </joey>
<garnt> upon someone who has an opportunity it's </garnt>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<garnt> like the biggest advice i can i can give </garnt>
<joey> now if you are interested in working in </joey>
<joey> the japanese anime industry it's just to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] be here because it's like </joey>
<joey> i've been surprised at how like </joey>
<joey> sometimes even how low the bar of entry </joey>
<joey> is because it's like the bar of entry </joey>
<joey> seems to be </joey>
<joey> okay yeah university degree but that's </joey>
<joey> that's like the minimum you have to get </joey>
<joey> a visa but </joey>
<joey> aside from that it's just kind of being </joey>
<joey> here and just hanging around the right </joey>
<joey> definitely notice that </joey>
<joey> and i didn't think i just didn't think </joey>
<joey> it worked that way you know what i mean </joey>
<garnt> i i thought it was just like closed off </garnt>
<garnt> to all kind of foreigners and anyone </garnt>
<joey> else or it took like </joey>
<joey> years and years of building yourself </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and we go </connor>
<connor> you go to those anime studios and you </connor>
<garnt> just meet a guy who's like i'm american </garnt>
<garnt> and then you are so how did you get how </garnt>
<garnt> did you get this job because it was like </garnt>
<garnt> you think you you think they just had </garnt>
<joey> like the craziest [ __ ] journey </joey>
<joey> craigslist yeah yeah i mean yeah most of </joey>
<garnt> the time it's just yeah i was just </garnt>
<garnt> teaching english and i just saw a job </garnt>
<garnt> posting for a random anime job and i </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<garnt> went for the interview and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh wait it was that easy this entire </garnt>
<joey> time </joey>
<garnt> did you even speak english it's </garnt>
<joey> literally the mcdonald's method </joey>
<joey> like i see an ad i'll apply for a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] why not yeah </connor>
<joey> get the job oh yeah oh okay i got the </joey>
<connor> job cool </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know i i i guess totally </connor>
<joey> agree with that in terms of </joey>
<joey> all the mystique around it it's kind of </joey>
<connor> like slowly peeling away right right </connor>
<joey> but yeah i don't know it's it's hard to </joey>
<connor> summarize all my feelings </connor>
<joey> about living here and working here but </joey>
<joey> yeah definitely the structure has been </joey>
<joey> added </joey>
<joey> and i don't know if that's because of </joey>
<joey> japan or because of how we've </joey>
<joey> scheduled and built our work optimized </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> having an agency here uh that works with </joey>
<joey> us and works with anime has been </joey>
<joey> super helpful yeah um and has helped me </joey>
<joey> feel like a lot more </joey>
<joey> like you said structured because before </joey>
<joey> this uh </joey>
<joey> yeah i was just kind of [ __ ] around i </joey>
<joey> think and i was just hoping that the </joey>
<joey> checks kept coming in </joey>
<connor> yeah i was like i'll just keep making </connor>
<connor> stuff that i really enjoy it didn't feel </connor>
<joey> real </joey>
<connor> right yeah no and i assumed that every i </connor>
<connor> assumed that every year could be my last </connor>
<connor> yeah and now i'm starting to think okay </connor>
<garnt> well you know if you know as long as i </garnt>
<connor> don't do </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] anything stupid </connor>
<garnt> as long as none of us get cancelled yeah </garnt>
<connor> you know you know you're probably gonna </connor>
<joey> be around for </joey>
<joey> for a little a little bit right yeah you </joey>
<joey> can normally safely assume i've got a </joey>
<joey> year left in this </joey>
<joey> yeah right like you can probably </joey>
<joey> normally plan a year or two right and </joey>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> you know and and some people like well </garnt>
<garnt> you know like </garnt>
<garnt> damn shouldn't you be working in like a </garnt>
<garnt> proper career and whatnot like what is a </garnt>
<garnt> proper career anymore like </garnt>
<garnt> bro some people like still dr like 50 </garnt>
<garnt> years old driving ubers like is that a </garnt>
<joey> career like yeah </joey>
<joey> why why people got to make a thing about </joey>
<connor> it it's just your prerogative right </connor>
<connor> like whatever makes you happier if </connor>
<joey> you're getting the money and it's making </joey>
<joey> you happy you're not hurting anybody i </joey>
<connor> think that's a proper career yeah </connor>
<connor> the way i see it as well is that like if </connor>
<connor> for some reason youtube falls through </connor>
<connor> you know in a year and i got nothing </connor>
<connor> left like hey man i've got experiences </connor>
<connor> people could like kill for right right </connor>
<joey> all three of us have been smart enough </joey>
<joey> to kind of establish ourselves </joey>
<joey> in you know fields outside of youtube </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> my plan my plan b used to be go back to </garnt>
<joey> the bbc and get like uh go back into </joey>
<joey> engineering </joey>
<joey> and stuff but now like if youtube falls </joey>
<joey> through like i have a </joey>
<joey> like i have other plan b's of like other </joey>
<joey> businesses i could possibly get involved </joey>
<joey> in and that's like </joey>
<joey> it's gave me it's given me like in in a </joey>
<joey> career that really shouldn't have </joey>
<joey> the feeling of any kind of job security </joey>
<joey> i i do feel secure that yeah i do have </joey>
<joey> a specific skill set that working in </joey>
<joey> doing this has given me as opposed to </joey>
<joey> five years ago when i'm just like what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] can you learn doing youtube </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> you know what what the [ __ ] could i </joey>
<joey> actually learn how to edit a video </joey>
<joey> like like like you know when you you </joey>
<garnt> look back and you start doing youtube </garnt>
<garnt> you just think what can i </garnt>
<garnt> possibly put on myself i'm getting </garnt>
<garnt> nothing out of this what can i possibly </garnt>
<garnt> put on my cv </garnt>
<garnt> right and then now you're like if in </garnt>
<joey> terms of social media entertainment and </joey>
<joey> marketing it's like it's it's a big list </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah absolutely yeah i think i </joey>
<joey> think uh </joey>
<joey> you know a lot of people think is uh on </joey>
<joey> most youtubers </joey>
<joey> as uh you know like the [ __ ] dumb </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<joey> dumb college dropouts i mean you do see </joey>
<joey> a lot of them who are like [ __ ] i'm in </joey>
<joey> the same category as him </joey>
<joey> yeah right but i think what people </joey>
<joey> understand </joey>
<joey> is that there are a lot of companies </joey>
<joey> that wish they had people who understood </joey>
<joey> those kind of like because a lot of </joey>
<joey> companies you'll see them man they don't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] understand social media </joey>
<joey> and you know if you know if what if we </joey>
<joey> did lose our job there is a good chance </joey>
<garnt> that we could probably work in </garnt>
<garnt> a company and be ahead of their social </garnt>
<garnt> media department or help with </garnt>
<garnt> strategizing right consulting </garnt>
<joey> anything right i mean it's like dr </joey>
<joey> disrespect right he was an online </joey>
<joey> creator and then he went to work for </joey>
<joey> uh i think activision right or infinity </joey>
<joey> ward and he was the head of their </joey>
<joey> community relations </joey>
<joey> oh really yeah for a while oh wow before </joey>
<garnt> before coming back to streaming yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> before he came back that's what </garnt>
<joey> he left because he was a big cod </joey>
<joey> streamer i believe right right and then </joey>
<joey> he left to go and be there community </joey>
<garnt> related uh community management or </garnt>
<joey> something along social media </joey>
<joey> it speaks to even back then that someone </joey>
<joey> who had just been doing videos online </joey>
<joey> who seems very amateurish </joey>
<joey> yeah you know that knowledge that you </joey>
<joey> gain is so invaluable and companies wish </joey>
<connor> they understood that and they could hire </connor>
<connor> as many teams as they want but </connor>
<connor> right because it's so rare especially </connor>
<connor> for someone like you know disrespect to </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> reach numbers like that right it's not </connor>
<garnt> something that you can like </garnt>
<garnt> it's not something that it's like well i </garnt>
<joey> got a degree in it i studied it </joey>
<joey> therefore i'm gonna get results like </joey>
<connor> that just doesn't happen right </connor>
<connor> you learn a lot through youtube and i </connor>
<connor> think that even if you are doing it as a </connor>
<connor> hobby now </connor>
<connor> uh and you don't see any potential in it </connor>
<connor> i think the skills that you're learning </connor>
<connor> are really really </connor>
<connor> like useful skills i don't think you </connor>
<garnt> realize useful yeah one one thing </garnt>
<garnt> one important skill that i had to learn </garnt>
<garnt> how to do is kind of </garnt>
<garnt> realizing what skills i thought were </garnt>
<garnt> useless and were actually not useless </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> it's actually thinking back to be like </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah i do know how to do this thing </garnt>
<garnt> maybe this is </garnt>
<garnt> this is actually useful in some way </garnt>
<garnt> because it's it's like part of part of </garnt>
<joey> part of making yourself look sellable as </joey>
<joey> a person to any employees </joey>
<joey> what skills have you have you got and </joey>
<joey> what like experience do you have </joey>
<joey> and what like we we grew up in like a </joey>
<joey> generation or at least like </joey>
<joey> especially with asian parents where we </joey>
<joey> were taught hey do well in tests </joey>
<joey> get like your degree go to university </joey>
<joey> and if you don't go to university you're </joey>
<connor> a [ __ ] dropout </connor>
<connor> yeah and you're scum you're not like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> like the older they grow i grew up the </connor>
<connor> more i realized yeah if you have like </connor>
<connor> certain career options </connor>
<connor> and certain like career paths that you </connor>
<garnt> want to go down yes a degree is </garnt>
<garnt> definitely you definitely need that but </garnt>
<garnt> if you kind of don't know what you want </garnt>
<garnt> to do yet that doesn't mean that every </garnt>
<garnt> other skill set you gain </garnt>
<garnt> is invaluable right you don't need a </garnt>
<garnt> degree to make a </garnt>
<garnt> plan b in your life right yeah it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i never i never learned </garnt>
<garnt> anything about like business or </garnt>
<joey> marketing in school like i didn't take </joey>
<joey> any of those like classes i never did </joey>
<joey> any of that </joey>
<joey> yeah and i learned so much about that </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] just from doing youtube </joey>
<joey> yeah and that's like a really valuable </joey>
<joey> skill to have but i didn't need to go to </joey>
<joey> school for it i just had to [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> do it yeah i just had to go through it </connor>
<joey> and experience it because it's the way i </joey>
<joey> see it right i have an engineering </joey>
<joey> degree yeah if you put me in an </joey>
<garnt> engineering workplace </garnt>
<joey> i wouldn't know [ __ ] yeah exactly i </joey>
<joey> don't know what's going on </joey>
<joey> maybe i you know i understand i </joey>
<joey> understand the rough concepts that make </joey>
<joey> up a lot of basic engineering and yeah </joey>
<joey> probably teach me a lot easier but you </joey>
<joey> couldn't just plop me in an office and </joey>
<garnt> be like </garnt>
<joey> do it yeah i would have no clue yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah at all because you have to learn </joey>
<joey> how that that company utilize that skill </joey>
<joey> right right right and and without using </joey>
<garnt> it practically </garnt>
<joey> it's like what am i doing i've just got </joey>
<joey> good at tests like </joey>
<joey> i was [ __ ] and i constantly got </joey>
<joey> frustrated because i never felt like i </joey>
<connor> was learning engineering although i </connor>
<connor> was i was learning the concept i felt </connor>
<connor> like a lot of it was so impractical </connor>
<joey> but i mean you were learning it through </joey>
<joey> your head but not through your body </joey>
<connor> right yeah i think i mean we weren't </connor>
<connor> using it yeah like </connor>
<connor> we learned it's like why this is </connor>
<connor> important they tell you but it's like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like have you guys ever had like </garnt>
<garnt> a proper real job interview </garnt>
<garnt> or anything like that yeah and it was </garnt>
<garnt> rough </garnt>
<garnt> well yeah was yours for mcdonald's </garnt>
<connor> because no no </connor>
<connor> no no no no for like it was like like a </connor>
<joey> real job oh okay so like when i </joey>
<garnt> before i decided to do youtube full-time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh i was actually still applying </garnt>
<garnt> for engineering </garnt>
<garnt> jobs because i was going to do a year in </garnt>
<garnt> placement right which is uh in </garnt>
<joey> in i don't know if they do this in </joey>
<joey> australia you could basically after your </joey>
<garnt> second year in the uk </garnt>
<garnt> oh you have an in industry yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> basically working yeah you get paid to </garnt>
<garnt> work and you normally it's normally </garnt>
<garnt> those kids do really well in third year </garnt>
<garnt> as well because they come into it with a </garnt>
<garnt> lot more like like an internship right </garnt>
<garnt> practical experience yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of like an internship yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah an internship that actually pays </garnt>
<connor> well and </connor>
<connor> you normally get a job after it like out </connor>
<garnt> there normally normally they </garnt>
<garnt> you get the job offer for that's </garnt>
<connor> placement after your like year ends </connor>
<connor> and some of them might even offer to pay </connor>
<connor> for the third year and the masters </connor>
<connor> so it's like it's kind of like no </connor>
<connor> downside to doing it especially </connor>
<garnt> engineering right it's really good the </garnt>
<garnt> hardest part is getting an offer in the </garnt>
<connor> first place </connor>
<connor> it's really hard to get a good place to </connor>
<garnt> take you yeah i remember i did tests for </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> rolls-royce and stuff and they were hard </joey>
<joey> like they were making </joey>
<joey> every single one of them it was so </joey>
<joey> annoying you would apply for it and </joey>
<joey> they'd make you do this in </joey>
<joey> like an hour and a half long test that </joey>
<joey> was hard as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah and eventually you just got to the </joey>
<joey> point where you're like i've done four </joey>
<joey> of these </joey>
<joey> in one day and it took all day and i </joey>
<joey> know i'm not gonna get any of them </joey>
<joey> yeah let's be honest i'm not smart </joey>
<joey> enough to work in rolls-royce's jet </joey>
<joey> engine </joey>
<joey> i'm just gonna be honest dude that ain't </joey>
<joey> me you know and i </joey>
<joey> i had an interview for one and i i just </joey>
<joey> remember them asking me questions and </joey>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i can't even like stomach the lies </joey>
<joey> i i can't even </joey>
<joey> i can't even i don't even have the you </joey>
<joey> didn't even have the business </joey>
<garnt> yeah i care so little about actually </garnt>
<joey> getting this job </joey>
<joey> that i couldn't even sit there and lie </joey>
<connor> to the guy yeah like i would in a normal </connor>
<joey> job interview i would be like of course </joey>
<joey> yeah i i never really like worked any </joey>
<garnt> job </garnt>
<connor> like before youtube became a job i mean </connor>
<garnt> like i told the story of how i tried for </garnt>
<garnt> mcdonald's and failed and then </garnt>
<garnt> i think i did one internship like during </garnt>
<garnt> uni but at that point like </garnt>
<garnt> youtube was kind of becoming more of a </garnt>
<joey> priority that i knew i probably wasn't </joey>
<joey> gonna go into this field </joey>
<joey> anyway yeah but like i'm not gonna say </joey>
<joey> the company name but like </joey>
<joey> last like two years or so i've been </joey>
<joey> approached by this like </joey>
<garnt> relatively big company like yeah </garnt>
<joey> international that like really wanted me </joey>
<garnt> oh okay and that was the first time </garnt>
<garnt> where i went into like an actual like </garnt>
<garnt> proper job interview yeah but i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> do one interview </garnt>
<garnt> i did 17 interviews holy [ __ ] not to </garnt>
<joey> mention </joey>
<joey> i did some here in japan and then i also </joey>
<garnt> did some </garnt>
<garnt> in l.a 18. yeah i can help i did some in </garnt>
<joey> la so like when i was like staying at </joey>
<garnt> aki's place in vegas </garnt>
<garnt> and they like flew me out to la just to </garnt>
<garnt> do like six more interviews oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> well then i had to fly back and uh at </garnt>
<joey> the end of the day </joey>
<joey> i didn't get the job so i was like </joey>
<connor> really fun but like i'd like to think </connor>
<joey> that after the 16th interview they were </joey>
<connor> like you know i don't think so but </connor>
<joey> let's try one more time and it was like </joey>
<garnt> a different person every time </garnt>
<connor> as well yeah so like but but this is </connor>
<garnt> like a pretty big comment like i'm </garnt>
<connor> pretty sure i'm not allowed to say who </connor>
<joey> but like it was a pretty big company </joey>
<joey> yeah and uh </joey>
<joey> and and it was like it was a company as </joey>
<joey> well that i was really interested in as </joey>
<joey> well because it's like oh like if </joey>
<joey> youtube falls through </joey>
<joey> this is a perfect place to work yeah </joey>
<joey> like hell yeah like this is my plan b </joey>
<garnt> and so i was genuinely excited to be </garnt>
<garnt> like maybe i might get this job i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know and then </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but yeah it was just [ __ ] but i </garnt>
<garnt> think that just made it so much more </garnt>
<joey> stressful </joey>
<garnt> yeah i remember oh sorry because it was </garnt>
<joey> like because i was genuinely interested </joey>
<joey> but it's like </joey>
<garnt> how do i like tell that to the person </garnt>
<garnt> without sending like an absolute kiss </garnt>
<garnt> ass </garnt>
<garnt> you know yes i love everything you do of </garnt>
<connor> course i want to work for you if you've </connor>
<joey> got that job would you have quit youtube </joey>
<joey> hard to say wow i can't say now that </joey>
<garnt> with the place you're at on youtube i </garnt>
<garnt> remember </garnt>
<garnt> every person in their youtube careers </garnt>
<garnt> thought maybe i'll get a proper job </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't know when this will fall </garnt>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<joey> it was it was at that point where i was </joey>
<joey> like i give myself a little bit there's </joey>
<connor> a lot of anxiety and a lot of </connor>
<connor> uh what's the word like you you don't </connor>
<garnt> trust it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like you don't think you think it's </garnt>
<garnt> temporary yeah even though you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> not yeah there's always that gut feeling </garnt>
<garnt> and then i think i can understand </garnt>
<joey> sometimes why </joey>
<joey> you know some people youtubers want to </joey>
<joey> move on and want to do something else </joey>
<joey> yeah i understand that </joey>
<joey> i don't have that interest right now and </joey>
<joey> i don't want to move on cause i'm really </joey>
<joey> enjoying it </joey>
<joey> but you know i could i can i'm starting </joey>
<joey> to understand after doing this for like </joey>
<joey> five years </joey>
<joey> i can understand the mindset of why </joey>
<joey> someone wouldn't want to be in that </joey>
<joey> coin flip every day is like well let's </joey>
<joey> see if i've got a job today </joey>
<joey> right yeah it is kind of like it is </joey>
<joey> really stressful to </joey>
<joey> and i think that i've just become used </joey>
<joey> to it yeah but if you put someone in </joey>
<joey> this situation overnight i feel like </joey>
<joey> it's one of those things where it's like </joey>
<joey> oh they wouldn't be able to handle it </joey>
<joey> maybe not handle it but it would </joey>
<joey> definitely it would definitely wear on </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> oh yeah absolutely going back to job </joey>
<garnt> interviews i do have like a story of </garnt>
<joey> like my </joey>
<joey> very first i'd say real job interview </joey>
<joey> because you know i </joey>
<connor> i've had job interviews for like co-op </connor>
<joey> and like call centers and stuff </joey>
<connor> we're talking like they just want to </connor>
<connor> make sure you're not a [ __ ] criminal </connor>
<connor> exactly all you have to do </connor>
<joey> is just be a competent person and </joey>
<joey> somehow joey can couldn't even be that </joey>
<joey> for his mcdonald's interview but </joey>
<joey> that's that's a different story but like </joey>
<joey> we're talking actual like big boy </joey>
<joey> companies okay </joey>
<joey> you're here for a specific skill set so </joey>
<joey> this is like before i got my job at the </joey>
<joey> bbc so </joey>
<joey> as you do as a graduate you apply to </joey>
<joey> about 10 [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> 10 million different companies you just </joey>
<joey> hope one of them sticks yeah so </joey>
<joey> one uh one company that actually um </joey>
<joey> called me back for an interview was a </joey>
<joey> missile company </joey>
<connor> so i would basically be kind of like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like what other missiles are </connor>
<garnt> there joey </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know it just sounded really </garnt>
<garnt> weird it's like a company that makes </garnt>
<garnt> missiles like what sound missiles make </garnt>
<joey> so yeah what would you do yeah i design </joey>
<joey> get down the missiles are coming </joey>
<garnt> but yeah it was a it was a proper </garnt>
<joey> missile company and i was </joey>
<joey> uh applying to be like a systems </joey>
<joey> engineer to like design and make </joey>
<joey> missiles </joey>
<joey> so like obviously i go in the i go in </joey>
<joey> the interview and </joey>
<joey> i'm [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] nailing this </joey>
<joey> interview okay i i i can't i can't </joey>
<joey> remember i can't remember how it is like </joey>
<joey> like the interview was split up into two </joey>
<joey> different segments right like there was </joey>
<joey> the one where like they </joey>
<joey> like into your like personality and i </joey>
<joey> don't know i can't remember what that's </joey>
<connor> called no there's a technical term </connor>
<connor> yeah there's there's there's one whether </connor>
<connor> like they you know they grill you about </connor>
<joey> you know what </joey>
<joey> why why do you why do you think you'd be </joey>
<joey> a good fit for this company </joey>
<connor> you say you're a [ __ ] team player </connor>
<joey> yeah you're a perfectionist to uh </joey>
<joey> one of my weaknesses oh well you know i </joey>
<joey> just uh i'm i just </joey>
<joey> um i love money i love money i i am a </joey>
<joey> perfectionist and you can't [ __ ] say </joey>
<joey> look i just need money </joey>
<joey> and i need to pay off my [ __ ] student </joey>
<joey> loan why are you asking me questions </joey>
<joey> that you know the [ __ ] answer to okay </joey>
<joey> so but like i i breeze through that and </joey>
<joey> i know i know </joey>
<joey> they've i know i'm doing a good [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> job right and then i get to the </joey>
<joey> technical interview </joey>
<joey> and the technical interview i actually </joey>
<joey> prepared for this right because </joey>
<joey> you know i'm working for a [ __ ] i'm </joey>
<garnt> applying to be a [ __ ] missile </garnt>
<garnt> designer so i should probably know the </garnt>
<garnt> basics of how </garnt>
<garnt> a missile works right and sure enough i </garnt>
<garnt> get to the technical interview </garnt>
<garnt> and they ask me um so can you explain </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<garnt> broad basics about how a missile works </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and so they go </garnt>
<garnt> no so um i've mentioned this before but </garnt>
<garnt> my degree is in electronic and </garnt>
<joey> electrical engineering so </joey>
<joey> i was um so basically this this was this </joey>
<joey> was going to be a breeze for me i know </joey>
<joey> how a missile works so </joey>
<joey> i've done my research yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> um i start so there's two interviewers </connor>
<connor> there's one </connor>
<connor> older serious guy and then there's one </connor>
<joey> like younger not exactly a grad </joey>
<joey> graduate he's been there a few years but </joey>
<joey> he's like he's like at the time he was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> late 20s early 30s yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly so </joey>
<joey> i start like i start explaining how this </joey>
<joey> missile works so there's like a </joey>
<joey> whiteboard </joey>
<joey> and like so i draw i draw the missile </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> and and i'm like i'm like explaining </joey>
<joey> explaining explaining everything i'm </joey>
<joey> like yeah together this system does this </joey>
<joey> this isn't on this </joey>
<joey> and so my final year degree project </joey>
<joey> my thesis story was on like object real </joey>
<joey> time object tracking and everything like </joey>
<joey> that so perfect perfect for what i need </joey>
<joey> to </joey>
<joey> explain here so i start explaining how </joey>
<joey> this missile </joey>
<joey> like tracks different objects so i draw </joey>
<joey> this rectangle </joey>
<joey> and i label that target and then i draw </joey>
<joey> a dotted line </joey>
<joey> from the target to like this missile </joey>
<joey> that i've drawn </joey>
<joey> right and so i started explaining okay </joey>
<joey> this is how the tracking system works </joey>
<joey> and the tracking system is in the front </joey>
<joey> of this missile and so i cordoned off </joey>
<joey> the front of this missile </joey>
<joey> right and i'm [ __ ] getting into this </joey>
<joey> i'm like okay so this is this is how </joey>
<joey> this is how my experience with my </joey>
<joey> tracking degree can can like </joey>
<joey> help with how i can explain like how i'm </joey>
<joey> missing myself right yeah i'm [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> telling myself </joey>
<joey> i'm getting into it and then i look over </joey>
<joey> and then </joey>
<garnt> like the older serious guy was just like </garnt>
<garnt> hmm yes variance where and then the </garnt>
<garnt> younger guy </garnt>
<garnt> was like trying to hold his laughter he </garnt>
<connor> was just like </connor>
<connor> oh no what did you draw on the rocket </connor>
<garnt> gone </garnt>
<garnt> and and then and then i look over i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like and i'm thinking to myself like </garnt>
<garnt> why are you laughing at what i'm doing </garnt>
<garnt> i'm on i'm killing this </garnt>
<garnt> i'm [ __ ] killing this my career is on </garnt>
<garnt> the line here </garnt>
<garnt> i just want to get a job what he what </garnt>
<garnt> could you possibly be laughing at </garnt>
<garnt> and then i look at what i've drawn i've </garnt>
<connor> drawn a penis </connor>
<connor> how how did you draw a piece i've i've </connor>
<connor> drawn a big </connor>
<connor> girthy penis pissing on a rectangle </connor>
<connor> and how how did you do that i've </connor>
<connor> actually i've actually got a picture </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> i've i've got to show you this i was </garnt>
<joey> really hoping this story's climax would </joey>
<joey> be a bad opinion yeah i was i was </joey>
<connor> thinking when he was like </connor>
<connor> drawing on him yeah this this this is </connor>
<connor> but like i didn't realize how much it </connor>
<connor> looked like a [ __ ] penis </connor>
<connor> until that's a straight up johnny </connor>
<joey> it is a [ __ ] girthy face </joey>
<joey> as soon as i saw that as soon as i saw </joey>
<joey> that right </joey>
<joey> i knew i failed not because not because </joey>
<joey> i was doing a bad job </joey>
<joey> but you know when you're in the zone and </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> and like there's not there's nothing </joey>
<joey> that could take me out of the zone </joey>
<joey> knowing that i've just drawn a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> penis into in front of two examinees </joey>
<joey> and then after that i just start </joey>
<joey> stumbling and i forget everything i </joey>
<joey> prepared </joey>
<joey> right you failed that time yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> you didn't get it i didn't get it </joey>
<joey> they specifically said that i did super </joey>
<joey> super well on my like the personality </joey>
<joey> side of things </joey>
<joey> but uh the technical side was lacking </joey>
<connor> i had totally blocked out of my mind </connor>
<connor> that there was a they ask you technical </connor>
<joey> questions </joey>
<joey> because i think i was so [ __ ] bad at </joey>
<joey> it right yeah because i remember i </joey>
<joey> had a question uh and it was asking me </joey>
<joey> like they were asking me like how </joey>
<joey> turbines work i knew how they worked </joey>
<joey> yeah but you know when you're in a room </joey>
<joey> with like two really old men who've been </joey>
<connor> doing this for years and they ask it </connor>
<connor> like they're like </connor>
<connor> how do you [ __ ] tell me how you [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> describe how you [ __ ] what </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like i know how to shoot </connor>
<connor> but when they're looking at me like that </connor>
<connor> and they're asking me that way i'm like </connor>
<garnt> ah </garnt>
<garnt> so um yeah the blades uh take the oxygen </garnt>
<garnt> in and they mix it with </garnt>
<garnt> am i right is this right this is right </garnt>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] you know i remember i just </joey>
<joey> butchered it yeah </joey>
<garnt> but also did you ever do video </garnt>
<garnt> interviews but you did but there's no </garnt>
<joey> one to talk to </joey>
<garnt> what video interviews well i got skype </garnt>
<garnt> so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so if you passed the test right uh the </garnt>
<garnt> math test </garnt>
<connor> and personality right they would say </connor>
<connor> that you wouldn't get an interview </connor>
<connor> you got a video video interview where </connor>
<joey> all you could see is yourself </joey>
<joey> yeah oh no i never had that but that </joey>
<joey> sounds horrible i i've never had that i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<garnt> i was like three times three times right </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> it was like so basically what it was is </garnt>
<garnt> that would be </garnt>
<garnt> uh it [ __ ] felt like a mario [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> party quick time event </joey>
<joey> it would be there would be a slide right </joey>
<joey> where you could see yourself and it </joey>
<joey> would cut to a question </joey>
<joey> and then it would be like five four and </joey>
<garnt> then you have to answer it and they will </garnt>
<joey> film it </joey>
<joey> it was terrifying like one of them was </joey>
<joey> like so </joey>
<joey> stupid it was like so it you know it's </joey>
<joey> going and it's like you know </joey>
<connor> okay and then it was like who's your </connor>
<connor> biggest engineering inspiration and i'm </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> i don't [ __ ] know my engineering idol </connor>
<joey> i'm like i just did this for the degree </joey>
<joey> i don't think about this [ __ ] i'm trying </joey>
<joey> to play card like what do you mean </joey>
<connor> like and so i was like [ __ ] [ __ ] uh uh </connor>
<connor> uh uh i said like einstein or something </connor>
<connor> and i'm not </connor>
<connor> i'm like basic [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i'm not kidding right i said einstein </connor>
<joey> right i finished that question and </joey>
<joey> that's the the </joey>
<joey> the next [ __ ] thing is two of seven </joey>
<garnt> questions the next thing i just [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> all f4 i'm like </connor>
<garnt> i haven't got this einstein </garnt>
<connor> i was the most famous engineer in the </connor>
<garnt> world </garnt>
<joey> you might have heard of him because i </joey>
<joey> was like there's no way i'm getting it </joey>
<joey> with an answer like that </joey>
<joey> but that's asking what's your favorite </joey>
<joey> meal white bread i love it </joey>
