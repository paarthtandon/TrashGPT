<joey> we live baby </joey>
<garnt> everybody shut up we're making art are </garnt>
<garnt> you enjoying this content right now is </garnt>
<joey> that what you say before you start </joey>
<connor> recording content i shouldn't even </connor>
<connor> notice what you're doing it's so weak </connor>
<joey> we're in a new studio you can shout gone </joey>
<joey> can you give us an example content oh my </joey>
<joey> god </joey>
<joey> hello gamers welcome back to another </joey>
<joey> episode of the trash taste podcast i am </joey>
<joey> boy with boys you guys know us by now </joey>
<joey> and we have a themed episode as you can </joey>
<joey> tell </joey>
<garnt> we've never done this we've never done </garnt>
<joey> this like like imagine this what if we </joey>
<garnt> make a three by three guys never done </garnt>
<joey> that before before have you heard of an </joey>
<joey> episode that will not go on a tangent </joey>
<connor> i'm just kidding we will go well i think </connor>
<connor> because we're me and gartner plans to go </connor>
<connor> out to the uk for a bit so we need to </connor>
<garnt> record a little more epic episodes in </garnt>
<garnt> advance so our solution to that is </garnt>
<garnt> themed episodes so that we don't have we </garnt>
<connor> don't run out of stuff to talk about we </connor>
<joey> don't run ourselves but i like the three </joey>
<garnt> by three episodes right because it's </garnt>
<joey> just it's just a good excuse to talk </joey>
<garnt> about [ __ ] that maybe we're not gonna </garnt>
<joey> ever tangent towards it's just hilarious </joey>
<joey> that we kind of brought back the three </joey>
<joey> by three like not the three of us i </joey>
<connor> didn't even i didn't even know it was a </connor>
<connor> thing yeah right i don't even know if </connor>
<connor> it's people haven't done since like 2010 </connor>
<connor> but anyway we've done a couple of three </connor>
<joey> by three episodes in the past we did one </joey>
<garnt> on anime yeah uh we've done one on games </garnt>
<joey> yep and i think this will be the third </joey>
<joey> one now we're gonna talk about </joey>
<garnt> movies not anime movies yeah actual </garnt>
<garnt> live-action movies with real people </garnt>
<connor> people because i feel like we don't have </connor>
<joey> to [ __ ] specify we watch real movies </joey>
<joey> well yeah of course because to some </joey>
<joey> people it's like oh so so so nine ghibli </joey>
<garnt> films is that is that gonna be honestly </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't i don't get to talk about </garnt>
<garnt> live-action movies a lot even though i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like i've watched a hell of a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of live-action movies but yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest problem i had when making this </garnt>
<garnt> three by three was i don't remember what </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] i've watched well if you've </connor>
<connor> been watching movies god knows how long </connor>
<garnt> my entire life there's no like my movie </garnt>
<connor> listening yeah i feel like when you </connor>
<joey> got into anime specifically it was </joey>
<garnt> probably a point where you really like </garnt>
<garnt> cared about it a lot yeah yeah what i </garnt>
<joey> mean so you made note of what you're </joey>
<garnt> watching yeah yeah yeah you've been </garnt>
<joey> watching movies your whole goddamn life </joey>
<joey> because this is what you do well didn't </joey>
<joey> you go through like the imdb top 200 or </joey>
<connor> whatever i went through to remind myself </connor>
<joey> all right what have i seen okay i know </joey>
<connor> yeah i like that that one's good but </connor>
<joey> it's on my face i literally had to go </joey>
<joey> down that list to remind myself what </joey>
<garnt> i've seen and what yes okay so what like </garnt>
<garnt> what logic did you guys use to choose </garnt>
<joey> your three by threes okay so in my head </joey>
<joey> i always have like a top three movies </joey>
<joey> ready because you know yeah you're </joey>
<joey> always going to be asking hey what's </joey>
<joey> your favorite movies i always have like </joey>
<joey> a top three but three by three you need </joey>
<joey> nine movies right so i'm like all right </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> all right i'll fill in the rest of the </garnt>
<garnt> six with like movies that i thought were </garnt>
<garnt> really good that i want to recommend to </garnt>
<garnt> people yeah or movies that i know i've </garnt>
<joey> seen multiple times and i'll keep </joey>
<garnt> watching multiple times yeah my mine </garnt>
<garnt> were not recommendations at all i was </garnt>
<garnt> thinking uh maybe i'll just make the </garnt>
<garnt> ones where like the movies i really </garnt>
<garnt> really like and then i just like i just </garnt>
<garnt> i just went through like my list of </garnt>
<garnt> movies i really liked and i just like </garnt>
<garnt> too many [ __ ] movies yeah right i </garnt>
<garnt> literally could not narrow it down it it </garnt>
<garnt> needs to be like a [ __ ] top 50 list </garnt>
<joey> like i've seen most of the imdb top 100 </joey>
<garnt> i was like this isn't not helping it </garnt>
<garnt> would just literally just be like the </garnt>
<garnt> imdb top 200 most of the time so like i </garnt>
<garnt> just went [ __ ] that what are the movies </garnt>
<garnt> that i've just seen the most and like if </garnt>
<garnt> it's if it's on tv i'm just like i got </garnt>
<connor> time to watch this movie i don't know i </connor>
<garnt> just i just pick movies with me think of </garnt>
<joey> something </joey>
<garnt> feel feel things i don't know an aurora </garnt>
<joey> movie that gave me an experience yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean i i feel that i because yeah i feel </joey>
<garnt> like the problem with that for me is </garnt>
<garnt> that too many movies do that for me so </garnt>
<connor> it's like you're out here like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> having an emotional breakdown every </connor>
<garnt> movie you watch i like movies i like </garnt>
<joey> movies i always just i also it's really </joey>
<joey> hard also to like get rid of recency </joey>
<joey> bias as well yeah like immediately i </joey>
<garnt> thought of like the last 10 movies i </garnt>
<garnt> watched and i'm like were they as </garnt>
<joey> memorable yeah as these other movies </joey>
<joey> that i probably haven't seen in like </joey>
<garnt> five ten years i must say there's some </garnt>
<connor> movies on my list that i haven't seen in </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] years and i've put them on just </joey>
<joey> because i can't i wasn't sure about </joey>
<connor> movies </connor>
<joey> i was like i was like obsessed with them </joey>
<joey> as a kid yeah yeah so some of those are </joey>
<garnt> on the my list so the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> teletubbies movie </connor>
<garnt> how far back we talking here pretty far </garnt>
<garnt> back you'll see so let's see if our </garnt>
<joey> movie tastes are as pretentious as our </joey>
<joey> anime tastes yeah uh but we're gonna </joey>
<joey> decide as always with trash box [ __ ] to </joey>
<joey> see who goes first </joey>
<joey> that was a genuine bit all right who </joey>
<joey> wants to pick who goes first i'll go </joey>
<connor> first </connor>
<connor> i hope it's not me you gave i really </connor>
<connor> don't want to go first </connor>
<garnt> oh thank god it's gone </garnt>
<joey> thank god it's gone oh [ __ ] i didn't </joey>
<joey> want to go first bring up guards 3x3 </joey>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> so your logic for your three by three </joey>
<joey> was </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> this is why i didn't want to go first </garnt>
<garnt> because i got it </garnt>
<garnt> i've gotta [ __ ] defend this [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> okay there are some there are some there </joey>
<joey> where i'm like okay okay genuinely good </joey>
<garnt> movies and then there's uh </garnt>
<garnt> okay so so this this is split into two </garnt>
<connor> parts i just have our space jams in the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] middle yeah like it's like okay </joey>
<garnt> this is my movie as a [ __ ] kid walk </garnt>
<garnt> like as a kid who grew up in the 90s </garnt>
<joey> that everyone went through a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> space jam face this is a classic okay </joey>
<joey> it's a [ __ ] classic i mean i didn't </joey>
<joey> as a kid i didn't watch the [ __ ] nba </joey>
<joey> didn't even watch the [ __ ] looney </joey>
<garnt> tunes and even as the as a kid i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> watch this so many times every time it </garnt>
<garnt> was on tv i've rewatched this [ __ ] so </garnt>
<connor> much space jam's amazing it's a good </connor>
<connor> movie it's not like a kid trying to </connor>
<connor> justify you [ __ ] on the bed </connor>
<garnt> like your parents </garnt>
<garnt> do you want to go through your list all </garnt>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> so kung fu hustle </garnt>
<garnt> all right that's good </garnt>
<garnt> that's a good movie that's great movie </garnt>
<garnt> rush hour </garnt>
<garnt> yo i [ __ ] love rush hour yeah </garnt>
<joey> uh memento yeah scott pilgrim versus the </joey>
<connor> world feeling you're gonna put memento </connor>
<connor> over something i don't know why yeah i </connor>
<joey> don't know because i was that close to </joey>
<connor> putting momentum </connor>
<joey> like this i feel god's gonna put memento </joey>
<garnt> i don't know why </garnt>
<joey> um space jam of course the matrix first </joey>
<joey> matrix right yeah the first match okay </joey>
<connor> good the four year old version </connor>
<garnt> uh snatch and confessions so this is </garnt>
<garnt> very much split up into my childhood </garnt>
<garnt> obsession movies and then some movies </garnt>
<garnt> that i just want people to watch and </garnt>
<garnt> recommend and that's why i've just </garnt>
<connor> watched it so many times okay so before </connor>
<connor> we i guess which movies have you seen </connor>
<joey> joey here i've seen all of them except </joey>
<joey> for kung fu hustle and confessions i've </joey>
<connor> not seen snatch sounds so familiar </connor>
<joey> snatch the one where this one where he </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] is like a boxer right yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> not just a guy rich movie it's a good </garnt>
<connor> movie i think i think it's i think it's </connor>
<connor> guy richie's best movie like by far it's </connor>
<garnt> that and lock stock and i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about putting a quentin tarantino movie </garnt>
<joey> on but i'm surprised there is no quentin </joey>
<garnt> tarantino </garnt>
<garnt> okay i had a feeling someone else was </garnt>
<joey> going to put it on okay so that's why uh </joey>
<joey> that's why i put on snatch instead of </joey>
<joey> quentin tarantino because it's like </joey>
<joey> snatch and like reservoir dogs which is </joey>
<joey> like my quentin tarantino move your </joey>
<joey> choice it's kind of like it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like the same kind of field for me yeah </joey>
<joey> and i feel like more people have know </joey>
<joey> about quentin tarantino which is why i </joey>
<joey> wanted to put snatch which is kind of </joey>
<joey> like if you want kind of a british </joey>
<joey> quentin tarantino kind of movie where </joey>
<joey> it's just it's just like it's just got </joey>
<joey> amazing dialogue and i love i love the </joey>
<joey> concept of a lot of different characters </joey>
<joey> have that's nothing to do with uh that </joey>
<garnt> has nothing to do with each other just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like merging in into one </garnt>
<garnt> coherent storyline and uh there's just </garnt>
<garnt> bands there's the banter in this is so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] good that i still quote this to </garnt>
<garnt> this day like so many of the lines i </garnt>
<garnt> come up with just comes from snatch </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> it's just got great writing great </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] humor wow geek literally </joey>
<connor> stealing from snapchat yeah i haven't </connor>
<joey> seen confessions oh me neither i've </joey>
<garnt> never even heard confessions is actually </garnt>
<garnt> a japanese movie right </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<joey> i know and it's </joey>
<joey> it's the one movie </joey>
<connor> i've read </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah okay um i didn't </connor>
<connor> know it was even based on the book but </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> probably my favorite revenge movie of </connor>
<joey> all time i think it's a miyabi book is </joey>
<joey> the one where it's like set in high </joey>
<joey> school yeah with like two girls </joey>
<joey> kind of kind of think so </joey>
<connor> so the concept of this movie um is uh </connor>
<connor> the main character's a teacher right </connor>
<connor> yeah and she used to teach </connor>
<connor> uh teacher class right and </connor>
<connor> so these two students from these class </connor>
<joey> or i i think it's like two or three </joey>
<joey> students from this class they basically </joey>
<joey> uh they basically murder her </joey>
<joey> uh her daughter yeah um but because of </joey>
<joey> japanese laws if you're like a miner </joey>
<joey> then you can't be charged even if you've </joey>
<joey> technically like killed somebody right </joey>
<joey> we're just [ __ ] yeah yeah which of </joey>
<joey> which is [ __ ] and that's like the </joey>
<joey> whole premise of this movie yeah and the </joey>
<joey> premise of this movie is just her </joey>
<garnt> basically playing [ __ ] 5d chess </garnt>
<garnt> against these high schoolers and just </garnt>
<garnt> coming up with a very unique like </garnt>
<garnt> revenge scheme against these kids right </garnt>
<garnt> and it's kind of it's kind of like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> similar to old boy if you've seen old </garnt>
<connor> boy but maybe just maybe just not as </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah i think uh i i think that's </joey>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] up yeah old boys pretty </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and my problem with old boy is </joey>
<joey> that i'm surprised old boy isn't on your </joey>
<garnt> three by the way well my problem with </garnt>
<garnt> old boys i really liked it but there are </garnt>
<garnt> definitely some parts of old boy that </garnt>
<garnt> really push your suspension of disbelief </garnt>
<joey> like like uh without spoiling like </joey>
<joey> without spoiling the ending of old boy </joey>
<connor> or something there's some plot elements </connor>
<joey> where you're just like final twist yeah </joey>
<joey> like the final twist where you're just </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> the final twist where you just like </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> can the human mind be tricked into doing </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah that's like kind of pushing it </garnt>
<connor> what i like about confessions is that </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like the same kind of deal </connor>
<connor> where it's one person look uh </connor>
<connor> getting revenge over people yeah but </connor>
<connor> it's just it's kind of like she's kind </connor>
<connor> of like a light yagami lelouch kind of </connor>
<joey> character where she it's it's a very </joey>
<joey> it's a very intricate revenge </joey>
<joey> but it's believable yeah and it's it's i </joey>
<joey> mean it's believable because the whole </joey>
<joey> premise is [ __ ] to begin with because </joey>
<joey> this is real like you know japanese </joey>
<joey> miners cannot be charged even if they </joey>
<joey> kill somebody and that's that's like the </joey>
<garnt> premise of the movie but um the way it </garnt>
<garnt> unravels </garnt>
<garnt> is really really interesting and um for </garnt>
<garnt> a japanese movie as well one of the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest things i remember when watching </garnt>
<garnt> this movie for the first time is that </garnt>
<garnt> out of nowhere they start playing </garnt>
<joey> radiohead </joey>
<garnt> hell yeah and i'm just like is that </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] radiohead i'm listening to now </joey>
<joey> and so radiohead is </joey>
<joey> like literally one of the best parts of </joey>
<joey> this movie was just like you know like </joey>
<garnt> the the song for like the epic reveal </garnt>
<garnt> where she reveals everything yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] radiohead and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is the best reveal i've </garnt>
<joey> ever seen in the movie wait which </joey>
<joey> radiohead song is it um i i can't </joey>
<connor> remember it's oh yeah yeah yeah it's </connor>
<joey> it's not a face remember the emotions i </joey>
<connor> just remember the emotions man it's not </connor>
<connor> it's not the most famous radiohead songs </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> yeah it's it's it's the one movie that i </connor>
<connor> think is like really underground because </connor>
<connor> it's a japanese movie uh and i everyone </connor>
<connor> who's watched it so far has been really </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] impressed and i don't see </connor>
<connor> many people talking about this movie </connor>
<connor> because yeah i feel like japanese cinema </connor>
<garnt> uh japanese cinema in general just gets </garnt>
<garnt> looked over a lot but i feel like </garnt>
<connor> because they tackle very japanese things </connor>
<garnt> more often than not yeah the way they go </garnt>
<garnt> about things is very japanese and like </garnt>
<connor> kind of like doesn't really make well </connor>
<garnt> not that doesn't make sense but kind of </garnt>
<joey> odd yeah there's a lot of like cultural </joey>
<garnt> elements and like things that they throw </garnt>
<joey> back to that where other people feel </joey>
<joey> like oh that doesn't happen in my school </joey>
<connor> yeah you have to kind of like just look </connor>
<connor> past a lot of things i think when you </connor>
<joey> watch japanese movies or foreign </joey>
<joey> yeah because like i've i've definitely </joey>
<joey> read this book before and i really </joey>
<joey> really enjoyed like back in like high </joey>
<joey> school as well i think it's quite an old </joey>
<joey> book but um </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean for one i didn't even know </joey>
<connor> that this was like a movie first of all </connor>
<joey> yeah i didn't even know it was available </joey>
<joey> in english because like a lot of </joey>
<joey> japanese cinema doesn't make it outside </joey>
<connor> of japan but like there's always </connor>
<connor> translations online oh yeah of course </connor>
<joey> but it's like i don't know i i just </joey>
<garnt> wasn't expecting this yeah yeah like i i </garnt>
<garnt> recommend a lot of movies from this </garnt>
<connor> director i can't remember his name but </connor>
<connor> confession is my favorite one the </connor>
<connor> posters memories memories of matsuko is </connor>
<connor> another movie that this director made </connor>
<connor> that is like really underground even for </connor>
<connor> like japanese cinema but it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing okay um but yeah just </connor>
<connor> like if you if you're gonna take </connor>
<connor> anything out of my 3x3 watch confessions </connor>
<connor> because more people need to know about </connor>
<connor> confessions kokuhaku um it's an amazing </connor>
<garnt> movie it's one of the few japanese </garnt>
<garnt> movies that i think is just easily </garnt>
<garnt> accessible to like anyone you don't </garnt>
<garnt> really need to know about japanese </garnt>
<garnt> culture um it's just a good revenge plot </garnt>
<garnt> and it kind of if you like old boy or </garnt>
<garnt> you know a lot of korean movies you're </garnt>
<joey> probably gonna like confessions yeah </joey>
<joey> miyabi miyuki i think is is the original </joey>
<joey> woman who wrote kokaku right like all of </joey>
<connor> her books kind of like deal with this </connor>
<connor> kind of like yeah it's kind of like </connor>
<connor> criticizing [ __ ] up parts of japan and </connor>
<joey> like using it as like an advantage right </joey>
<connor> yeah it's really good yeah the book </connor>
<garnt> sounds really really good yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> might actually watch it yeah um the best </garnt>
<garnt> movie on there is the 40 year old yeah </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely i think so honestly i think </garnt>
<garnt> i think i've out of because i wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> put a comedy movie on i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> what comedy movie can i infinitely </garnt>
<joey> rewatch you've got like three on yeah </joey>
<joey> you've got scott piller and versus the </joey>
<joey> world space jam rush hour he's like all </joey>
<garnt> all called pilgrim is a comedy scott </garnt>
<connor> pilgrim's kidding me yeah i guess it's </connor>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] it's a comedy it's </garnt>
<garnt> non-stop jokes i mean it's okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's just best with visual </garnt>
<garnt> comedy yeah it's okay it is definitely a </garnt>
<connor> it's it's a comedy movie but it's not </connor>
<garnt> just girl comedy in there because i love </garnt>
<connor> like i mean like i've 40-year old virgin </connor>
<connor> it's great story of a man you know </connor>
<joey> coming to losing virginity yeah of </joey>
<connor> course it's a great coming of age </connor>
<connor> yeah and i was thinking like what </connor>
<garnt> because i feel like recently comedy </garnt>
<garnt> movies have kind of just died i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if that's the thing what's what's </garnt>
<garnt> well i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's like it's like they're </garnt>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] will ferrell movies and </garnt>
<garnt> uh all the modern adam sandler films </garnt>
<garnt> outside of uncut gems yeah i've just </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] made it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's literally only it yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> also the adam sadler movies do extremely </garnt>
<connor> well on netflix and not really some of </connor>
<connor> the most watched things on netflix the </connor>
<joey> ones that they bought off i think i've </joey>
<joey> seen an adam sandler movie since because </joey>
<connor> they're all so mediocre yeah and the </connor>
<garnt> only one that he he was amazing in which </garnt>
<garnt> was uncut gems is absolutely [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing yeah um it wasn't even his movie </garnt>
<connor> it was some he was just he's the main </connor>
<garnt> actor yeah i've heard </garnt>
<garnt> is that a comedy movie or is that just a </garnt>
<connor> movie it's a it's like a pretty pretty </connor>
<garnt> uh brutal movie looking really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> good though yeah </garnt>
<connor> all i've seen from that is the clip when </connor>
<connor> he goes oh my god i'm gonna come </connor>
<connor> if you haven't it's i think it's his </connor>
<garnt> best role yeah but yeah 40 year old </garnt>
<garnt> virgin is like to me the infinitely </garnt>
<connor> rewatchable comedy movie for me that </connor>
<connor> used to play on british television i </connor>
<garnt> think like once a [ __ ] week no that's </garnt>
<garnt> why i've watched it so many times </garnt>
<connor> everyone in the uk has watched it </connor>
<garnt> because you used to play on like </garnt>
<joey> all the [ __ ] time this is also one of </joey>
<joey> those movies that never leaves the </joey>
<joey> airplane like exactly always playing </joey>
<joey> like if you look up movies on an </joey>
<connor> airplane like the old classics genre </connor>
<connor> it's always interesting so many famous </connor>
<connor> scenes in that movie like the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> tit scene where they talk about feeling </joey>
<joey> a boob okay it's like a sandbag </joey>
<connor> and the [ __ ] waxing scene as well </connor>
<joey> it's iconic it's iconic and i feel like </joey>
<connor> this gets talked about less than maybe </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> at least at least when it first came out </garnt>
<garnt> because the iconic was that one of his </garnt>
<connor> like most famous like is that one of the </connor>
<connor> roles that i blew him up this was when i </connor>
<garnt> first started first started to know </garnt>
<garnt> steve carell because i didn't know about </garnt>
<joey> him before because i think before that </joey>
<joey> the only thing i've seen him in was like </joey>
<joey> bruce or micey yeah but he had like one </joey>
<joey> iconic scene he wasn't the main </joey>
<connor> character he wasn't the main character i </connor>
<connor> mean it was jim carrey yeah um but i </connor>
<joey> feel like this was his first movie where </joey>
<connor> i was just like damn this guy is funny </connor>
<joey> this is a funny [ __ ] movie yeah </joey>
<connor> probably but i remember back when this </connor>
<garnt> came out um the iconic comedy movie when </garnt>
<garnt> this first came out was super bad </garnt>
<joey> classic everyone was like 2 000's humor </joey>
<joey> like that was yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah everyone </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone was quoting super bad and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like kind of i kind of think the </garnt>
<garnt> four-year-old virgin's funnier that was </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> just me back then i thought super bad </joey>
<joey> was funny for like </joey>
<joey> two months no no when you're in high </joey>
<joey> school superbad is like the funniest </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] oh yeah it's like it's like you're </connor>
<joey> just going through it like when you've </joey>
<joey> heard of like the the you know </joey>
<joey> thousandth mclovin joke you're just like </joey>
<garnt> all right yeah i get it i get it it's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of same with borat right yeah </garnt>
<connor> i mean </connor>
<garnt> actually it's so fun um like uh sydney </garnt>
<garnt> had never seen borat before right so </garnt>
<connor> so she watched boar app for the first </connor>
<connor> time in 2021 about like about like a </connor>
<connor> month ago okay </connor>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> like me someone who's like been quoted </garnt>
<garnt> more at throughout my entire high school </garnt>
<garnt> it's been quoted to death right </garnt>
<connor> um i i i you know it's hard to find it </connor>
<connor> funny anymore because it's just been </connor>
<connor> like everyone's just it's so ingrained </connor>
<connor> it's so ingrains that i just ceased to </connor>
<garnt> find it funny anymore she still found it </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hilarious oh it's so funny </garnt>
<connor> like when i watch that movie all i think </connor>
<joey> is like god damn he's such a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> amazing actor yeah </joey>
<joey> he is there's app there's no movie that </joey>
<connor> even comes close to like that kind of </connor>
<joey> experience </joey>
<joey> it's crazy admittedly you know like i i </joey>
<joey> could probably quote most of that movie </joey>
<joey> but i'd be lying if i said every time i </joey>
<joey> heard bora go my wife like </joey>
<joey> i'm like that's just hilarious </joey>
<garnt> because more i said my wife said you </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] lost it and i was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] this was funny at the point i </garnt>
<garnt> forgot that this was legitimately funny </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah the genius of [ __ ] bar </connor>
<garnt> it like made you on a surface level you </garnt>
<garnt> think that oh this is just funny movie </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> but it was really just a really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> intelligent way of showing how racist </joey>
<joey> america yeah exactly and that's how good </joey>
<joey> and the best part was is that those </joey>
<joey> people were the ones quoting it yeah it </joey>
<joey> came out exactly but it's like a genius </joey>
<joey> way of showing it in a way that like he </joey>
<garnt> made a he showed like how like i guess </garnt>
<garnt> there was like racist problems in </garnt>
<connor> america before it was like you know </connor>
<garnt> talked about wildly today yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and still it was massively marketed </garnt>
<connor> towards the audience and i didn't even </connor>
<connor> know that that's what he's poking fun at </connor>
<joey> well that's what well that's what i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loved about ali g back in the </joey>
<joey> day oh my god that's a name i haven't </joey>
<connor> heard anything like that there's a movie </connor>
<joey> as well </joey>
<joey> yeah like that oh my god like the first </joey>
<joey> time i watched that like i thought </joey>
<joey> everything was scripted and like a lot </joey>
<joey> of it is but like some of the interview </joey>
<joey> scenes stuff like that it's all </joey>
<joey> non-scripted i'm like how the [ __ ] does </joey>
<connor> he do that he's just a genius like being </connor>
<connor> able to turn a situation and like </connor>
<connor> make them look stupid yeah without </connor>
<connor> having to like make them think that he's </connor>
<garnt> playing a character yeah yeah he's so </garnt>
<garnt> good at that yeah like he yeah he is </garnt>
<garnt> actually like like a social genius </garnt>
<garnt> because he knows how to work people so </garnt>
<garnt> well yeah and the thing is like </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> i just he gets so invested in his </garnt>
<garnt> character </garnt>
<connor> it's actually insane nightmare being </connor>
<joey> married to him </joey>
<joey> which character are you tonight honey </joey>
<joey> like because i remember like re-watching </joey>
<joey> borat with sydney there was this one </joey>
<joey> scene where he gets drunk with a bunch </joey>
<connor> of american frat boys and at first i was </connor>
<connor> like there's no way this is real this </connor>
<connor> must be scripted right and so we looked </connor>
<connor> into it and uh it's totally real to the </connor>
<connor> point got drunk with them yeah to the </connor>
<connor> point where he got like blackout drunk </connor>
<garnt> with them and just was able to stay in </garnt>
<joey> character this entire [ __ ] time </joey>
<joey> that's [ __ ] dedication man it's </joey>
<connor> insane like so big i think by the time </connor>
<joey> he goes to do these characters it's so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] baked in his head yeah he's this </joey>
<garnt> character that he doesn't even think i i </garnt>
<joey> oh i'm doing an act he's just yeah he </joey>
<garnt> just that's just him he just thinks this </garnt>
<garnt> is me yeah she's insane i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's such an insane maybe you </garnt>
<garnt> shouldn't put more out yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't put bar on my i wish i did now </garnt>
<garnt> because i just like the whole i find it </garnt>
<connor> all so fascinating and like what is </connor>
<connor> america is so [ __ ] funny as well like </connor>
<connor> oh he's just so funny yeah he's very </connor>
<garnt> very good absolutely [ __ ] genius yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um so aside from that i guess what else </garnt>
<joey> haven't you seen jerry i've seen </joey>
<joey> everything oh come through hustle i </joey>
<garnt> haven't seen kung fu arsenal [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> that's that's that stuff's good that's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] banger i mean it looks [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> awesome it's like i i to me it's like </joey>
<joey> one of the closest you could possibly </joey>
<joey> get to real life anime right </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's somehow wacky </joey>
<garnt> uh it's a wacky live-action kind of </garnt>
<garnt> slapstick what it does is that it it </garnt>
<garnt> does to parody martial arts movies yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it just makes a martial arts movie that </garnt>
<garnt> is just an anime right right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> all the characters are like i have this </garnt>
<garnt> power and then they do like all weird </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] spells and [ __ ] yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> like say like the premise of this movie </garnt>
<garnt> is like there's like this like </garnt>
<garnt> axe gang right this very famous gang and </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason they invade this very </garnt>
<connor> very small village </connor>
<connor> that nobody's heard of and it's just </connor>
<connor> like this secret village where </connor>
<connor> coincidentally a lot of martial arts </connor>
<connor> masters have just like it's all situated </connor>
<connor> in this one city </connor>
<connor> so what happens is firstly they find </connor>
<connor> three martial arts masters who just </connor>
<connor> happened to live in the city they didn't </connor>
<connor> know they lived in the city like one </connor>
<connor> person was just like the i think like a </connor>
<garnt> barber or something or so </garnt>
<connor> it's been so long yeah but the uh </connor>
<garnt> store oh yeah one was the noodle store </garnt>
<garnt> guy the taylor oh the taylor yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the laborer damn you remember the </garnt>
<garnt> story you remember this better than me </garnt>
<garnt> ashley </garnt>
<garnt> and so after they find out these three </garnt>
<garnt> martial arts masters are in this uh </garnt>
<garnt> village they were like well we got to </garnt>
<garnt> send assassins to assassinate them right </garnt>
<garnt> so they send assassins to to like get </garnt>
<connor> rid of these three martial arts masters </connor>
<connor> and then it turns out that there are </connor>
<joey> even more like higher up martial arts </joey>
<joey> masters just living in here just living </joey>
<joey> in there </joey>
<joey> hierarchy hierarchy pyramid </joey>
<joey> and so like </joey>
<garnt> they just find out like more op people </garnt>
<garnt> just keep [ __ ] invading this village </garnt>
<garnt> and they keep like more opie heroes just </garnt>
<garnt> keep coming out of the woodworks it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] great it's just literally just </garnt>
<joey> escalation yeah it sounds so good it's </joey>
<garnt> such a funny thing i've never heard of </garnt>
<garnt> this movie it's it's really if you watch </garnt>
<joey> martial arts movies yeah which i don't </joey>
<connor> like i used to yeah you'll know about </connor>
<connor> this just like it's well that's the </connor>
<garnt> thing like during high school i had like </garnt>
<garnt> a massive like spree of just watching </garnt>
<garnt> every bruce lee and jack chan movie yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and like all the martial arts movies i </garnt>
<joey> could think of same yeah </joey>
<garnt> but i never heard of this one for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason yeah i mean i feel like if you </garnt>
<garnt> did go through that martial arts phase </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is like one of the peak of </garnt>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> it's it knows the genre so well that it </connor>
<connor> kind of parodies itself right but at the </connor>
<connor> same time takes itself 100 seriously </connor>
<joey> right right </joey>
<joey> it's it's just one of the best </joey>
<joey> that's the best kind of movie yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly it does everything well for </connor>
<connor> martial arts movie um and that's why i </connor>
<connor> love it it's got the wacky fight and </connor>
<garnt> it's got like the really well </garnt>
<garnt> choreographed fights as well right um </garnt>
<garnt> but speaking of martial arts fights that </garnt>
<garnt> defines my childhood </garnt>
<joey> rush hour </joey>
<garnt> yeah speaking of jackie chan there he is </garnt>
<connor> right there what can you say </connor>
<connor> i i wish there was more russia </connor>
<garnt> i need the dynamic </garnt>
<garnt> i really think that the rush hour series </garnt>
<garnt> was what got me into the whole martial </garnt>
<garnt> arts genre to begin with </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean honestly maybe same i don't </connor>
<connor> know it was so funny my friend showed me </connor>
<connor> it when i was like really young and i </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] fell in love with it it was </connor>
<garnt> so fun yeah yeah i mean it's it's a like </garnt>
<connor> jackie chan and chris tucker was is a </connor>
<connor> dynamic that on paper should never work </connor>
<connor> they should never have the chemistry </connor>
<connor> that they do but they have such good </connor>
<connor> chemistry and the amount of times i've </connor>
<connor> rewatched rush hour one and two </connor>
<garnt> especially in my childhood it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like uncountable i actually don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how much how many times i've rewatched </garnt>
<garnt> it because it's like it like defined </garnt>
<garnt> like a good like five year period of my </garnt>
<garnt> life because that was what started my </garnt>
<garnt> martial arts phase where i just watched </garnt>
<connor> so many different martial arts movies </connor>
<connor> chan is </connor>
<joey> very very funny yeah oh yeah </joey>
<joey> he's one of the most charismatic actors </joey>
<connor> i feel like in that that's carried by </connor>
<connor> jackie chan like how good he is at </connor>
<connor> playing like dumb yeah yeah yeah he's so </connor>
<garnt> good in this yeah him playing off chris </garnt>
<connor> tucker it's just yeah it's just it's </connor>
<joey> christmas chris yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> he's just funny by himself yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> jackie chan is also like funny by </joey>
<joey> himself for like a completely different </joey>
<joey> reason it's a completely clash of styles </joey>
<connor> but like i remember when i was doing uh </connor>
<connor> during the uh not the anime awards the </connor>
<connor> trash taste awards when uh i was doing </connor>
<garnt> the uh pizza crust i have a dream speech </garnt>
<connor> right yeah people were just like wow </connor>
<garnt> ghan's really uh god's really parodies </garnt>
<garnt> martin luther king really well and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like i actually just took that </garnt>
<garnt> speech from rush hour too when chris </garnt>
<connor> tucker did it </connor>
<joey> all of your [ __ ] uh jokes and </joey>
<joey> everything come from [ __ ] movies yeah </joey>
<joey> everything you hear on giger is just </joey>
<garnt> movie quotes </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like this is the secret coming </garnt>
<garnt> out right when i'm just like these are </garnt>
<garnt> the movies i've rewatched so many times </garnt>
<garnt> that they're just ingrained in my mind </garnt>
<connor> was rush hour two the best one i think </connor>
<garnt> it was what what was the plot of rush </garnt>
<garnt> hour two the paris one no that was rush </garnt>
<garnt> hour three that was that was that </garnt>
<joey> rush hour i love how he just immediately </joey>
<joey> knows it's like yeah that's russia i </joey>
<connor> can't remember a distinction between any </connor>
<joey> of them they're all just all of the rush </joey>
<joey> hours kind of just blend together yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah um i remember rush hour one and two </joey>
<garnt> were the good ones um </garnt>
<joey> i think three was average three was kind </joey>
<garnt> of like the continuous i mean i mean </garnt>
<garnt> jackie chan was getting like a little </garnt>
<garnt> bit old when rush hour three happens so </garnt>
<joey> he like you could tell that he couldn't </joey>
<joey> do as many stunts as he could do rush </joey>
<joey> hour one and two i feel like was jackie </joey>
<joey> chan more like he he could get away </joey>
<garnt> um but yeah i remember i don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> but i remember as a kid i slightly </garnt>
<garnt> preferred rush hour too i think that was </garnt>
<garnt> the slightly better movie but i mean </garnt>
<garnt> rush hour one is still [ __ ] brilliant </garnt>
<joey> as well i mean can we also just talk </joey>
<joey> about the fact that i fully expected you </joey>
<joey> to put memento in your three places yeah </joey>
<joey> why why it just seems like have i ever </joey>
<connor> talked about no no it just seems like i </connor>
<connor> can't i can picture the gig video he's </connor>
<connor> like it's like guys what if i told you </connor>
<connor> you could go back and get pictures or </connor>
<connor> something i just i feel like i i would </connor>
<connor> hear i was here like </connor>
<connor> i could i feel like i i can see you </connor>
<connor> making a video about memento even though </connor>
<joey> you never have made a movie it just </joey>
<joey> feels like a gig yeah if i can imagine </joey>
<joey> anyone making a memento video it's </joey>
<joey> either you or john </joey>
<connor> like super i've actually </connor>
<joey> just seems like the kind of thing you </joey>
<joey> would talk about it's just like a very </joey>
<joey> like artsy film i mean it's a really </joey>
<joey> good film isn't it an artsy film i think </joey>
<joey> it's an rc film it's a bitter i mean </joey>
<joey> it's like christopher nolan being </joey>
<connor> christopher nolan but being like i have </connor>
<joey> 500 iq watch me try to present my 500 iq </joey>
<connor> on film and it's just like memento is </connor>
<joey> one of the few like films i think he's </joey>
<garnt> made that actually it's just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was no long that was </garnt>
<joey> pretty smart i i got it </joey>
<joey> memento actually was written by his </joey>
<connor> brother </connor>
<joey> okay yeah it's it's based off like it's </joey>
<connor> based off like a four-page novella </connor>
<connor> written by jonathan nolan yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> christopher was like you have four pages </joey>
<joey> let me turn that into 400 and get guy </joey>
<garnt> pierce in it yeah because i remember </garnt>
<garnt> this was one of his first movies and </garnt>
<garnt> they actually i think this was i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> know it was based on a novella because i </garnt>
<garnt> know that they made a short film around </garnt>
<garnt> this which i've actually seen and that's </garnt>
<connor> also really good and they expanded on </connor>
<connor> this idea um and it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's just like nolan with no budget like </connor>
<connor> but still doing the same kind of nolan </connor>
<garnt> ideas like before he had a budget and uh </garnt>
<connor> lieutenant right </connor>
<joey> it's tenant without a budget </joey>
<garnt> and then tenant happens and then he </garnt>
<garnt> forgot that he had to write like </garnt>
<connor> characters and a plot and just like </connor>
<connor> to go along with the cool ideas </connor>
<joey> but like i feel like this and inception </joey>
<connor> i mean inception's been meme to [ __ ] to </connor>
<connor> like hell and back right yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> but i i remember the first time i saw </garnt>
<joey> inception i thought it was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> amazing of course yeah i mean like i i </joey>
<joey> will always give nolan a chance just </joey>
<connor> because his peak he always just </connor>
<connor> something interesting yeah yeah like he </connor>
<connor> always </connor>
<connor> you know even if he doesn't make uh the </connor>
<connor> best movie he always has interesting </connor>
<connor> ideas and he always tries something new </connor>
<connor> which is what i can respect </connor>
<connor> not everything hits the mark </connor>
<garnt> but it's nolan you can expect that he's </garnt>
<garnt> not going to stay in his comfort zone i </garnt>
<joey> mean memento is definitely one of those </joey>
<joey> movies that like or a you have to watch </joey>
<joey> more than once to fully understand but b </joey>
<joey> even after multiple watches it's like </joey>
<garnt> i don't get it yeah so to explain </garnt>
<garnt> memento to anyone who hasn't seen it uh </garnt>
<garnt> this is yeah it's gonna sound so weird </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a movie that plays in reverse </garnt>
<garnt> kind of kind of yeah because it's about </garnt>
<garnt> this guy who has a condition that gives </garnt>
<garnt> him short-term memory loss </garnt>
<garnt> so he can only remember at most like </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes </garnt>
<garnt> something like like what a horrible </garnt>
<connor> existence yeah yeah someone like that in </connor>
<joey> real life i think actually yeah i think </joey>
<garnt> so yeah i mean this this is an actual </garnt>
<connor> real condition that exists right somehow </connor>
<connor> they made it into a real thing </connor>
<connor> oh you can't believe it oh my god i </connor>
<garnt> can't believe you got the same condition </garnt>
<garnt> as that guy from memento yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but uh so because of this you only </garnt>
<garnt> presented like five minutes of this </garnt>
<garnt> movie at a time and it's a movie that </garnt>
<garnt> plays in reverse and it's about this guy </garnt>
<garnt> who has this condition and uh is trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get revenge for the person who </garnt>
<garnt> murdered his wife which uh which you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's uh </garnt>
<garnt> combine uh five minute memory uh five </garnt>
<garnt> minute short term memory uh with uh long </garnt>
<joey> term revenge plot um things uh that's uh </joey>
<joey> the thing's about to get confused and </joey>
<garnt> things are gonna get confusing </garnt>
<garnt> especially for the main character i </garnt>
<joey> watched this movie i don't know it's the </joey>
<joey> one where like every time he comes to </joey>
<joey> again he looks at his body because he </joey>
<connor> tattoos all his memories </connor>
<connor> i think i've heard so much about this </connor>
<joey> movie that i think i've seen it but i </joey>
<joey> don't actually think i've ever seen it </joey>
<joey> oh really right everything i have </joey>
<joey> actually it's very good yeah but i know </joey>
<joey> the plot and i know what happened yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's just everyone knows the </joey>
<garnt> thoughts because everyone you know what </garnt>
<connor> happens yeah okay so you know the </connor>
<joey> twister i believe i do yeah yeah yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean we're not </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah but i think i know </connor>
<garnt> what the twist is yeah yeah but like i </garnt>
<connor> just remember the first time i've </connor>
<connor> watched this movie and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> damn this is </connor>
<garnt> legit like really clever 500 iq meme </garnt>
<garnt> aside you know you you don't have to </garnt>
<joey> have a high iq to enjoy this movie it's </joey>
<joey> a very well made movie for such a </joey>
<garnt> confusing concept yeah because at the </garnt>
<garnt> beginning you're just like how how am i </garnt>
<garnt> supposed to follow along when the </garnt>
<garnt> movie's playing in backwards how am i </garnt>
<garnt> supposed to like how is anything </garnt>
<joey> supposed to be surprising to me and um </joey>
<joey> he finds a way to keep it interesting </joey>
<joey> throughout the entire run of the movie </joey>
<joey> and then the ending kind of just like </joey>
<connor> slaps you in the face you're like oh oh </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] i did not see that coming yeah okay </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah and then i've and then uh </joey>
<garnt> this kind of launched his career and i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like this is one of his best works </garnt>

<garnt> so have you watched scott pilgrim of </garnt>
<connor> course yeah i like scott pilgrim i </connor>
<garnt> really like scott it's a good movie yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's a good movie it's a good movie i </joey>
<joey> think it's a really good movie um i mean </joey>
<garnt> i'm a huge fan of edgar wright edgar </garnt>
<garnt> wright's the other director where i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like whatever you make i'll [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> watch it edgar wright is like the master </joey>
<garnt> of visual comedy yeah where like he he </garnt>
<garnt> manages to cut something in a way or </garnt>
<joey> just like edit something in a way that </joey>
<joey> just makes it like whoa that i wasn't </joey>
<joey> expecting out of that but that's </joey>
<garnt> hilarious yeah it's just he's one of the </garnt>
<garnt> few people who whatever genre he takes </garnt>
<garnt> on he'll put his own spin on the genre </garnt>
<connor> yeah like it's it's so </connor>
<connor> rare to find someone who you can just </connor>
<connor> watch a movie not and you can just tell </connor>
<connor> this edgar wright through the editing </connor>
<connor> itself because it's such a snappiness </connor>
<joey> yeah it's just like the unique and the </joey>
<joey> the snappiness and the like it's very </joey>
<garnt> it's very rhythmic isn't it yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> is this your favorite egg right film i </joey>
<connor> think it is i think mine is still shawn </connor>
<joey> of the dead because i was debating </joey>
<joey> putting sean of the dead on hot fuzz i i </joey>
<joey> like fuzz that's a great hot fuzz is </joey>
<garnt> good i just feel like the first half was </garnt>
<garnt> like a little bit boring </garnt>
<garnt> um that's why i don't think it's as </garnt>
<garnt> strong as uh sean of the dead um and </garnt>
<garnt> scott pilgrim i feel like is the most </garnt>
<joey> edgar wright film there is i feel i feel </joey>
<joey> scott pilgrim couldn't be made by any </joey>
<garnt> other no no that's that's the thing </garnt>
<joey> right i feel sean on the dead sean penn </joey>
<joey> uh is that his name sean pan yeah sean </joey>
<joey> penn and uh nick </joey>
<garnt> cannon no i was about to say nick fury </garnt>
<garnt> then i was like wait that's that's not </garnt>
<garnt> nick nick frost nick </garnt>
<joey> the one that dies in every movie yeah </joey>
<joey> sean penn is the one that always dies in </joey>
<joey> every movie </joey>
<garnt> why is there so many shows </garnt>
<connor> sean penn is uh who's sean </connor>
<garnt> who the [ __ ] is that </garnt>
<connor> whatever now we've got a [ __ ] living </connor>
<garnt> imdb page right here </garnt>
<garnt> she was she played uh kevin spacey's </garnt>
<joey> wife in house of cards </joey>
<joey> i haven't seen house i haven't seen him </joey>
<garnt> i've seen house of cards okay but going </garnt>
<garnt> back to scorpion the reason i put this </garnt>
<garnt> on is because like i do do really really </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like sean of the dead um but i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like scott pilgrim is just the most </garnt>
<joey> edgar wright movie to exist at the </joey>
<joey> moment it's him on like his best form </joey>
<joey> and i feel like it's </joey>
<joey> this this movie kind of like i feel like </joey>
<joey> defined a whole generation of nerds </joey>
<joey> like you you've seen so many people who </joey>
<joey> just based their entire [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> personality on this one movie you know </joey>
<joey> who you are you know who you [ __ ] are </joey>
<joey> like you meet you me you meet that </joey>
<joey> person that like you meet one person </joey>
<joey> like that and like every anime </joey>
<joey> convention you go to of course yeah </joey>
<joey> it's um but well i mean i think the </joey>
<joey> reason why it works so well is because </joey>
<garnt> like again edgar wright's like way of </garnt>
<garnt> directing is very like over exaggerated </garnt>
<garnt> and like very not rooted in valley and </garnt>
<garnt> that works perfectly with scott pilgrim </garnt>
<joey> because scotland was based off a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> comic book series all right so i know </connor>
<connor> i'm a very complicated was it the first </connor>
<garnt> echo right film you watched oh sean of </garnt>
<connor> the show like i literally watched his </connor>
<connor> movies </connor>
<connor> i feel like it's out of like the </connor>
<connor> cornetto trilogy it's like the </connor>
<garnt> like the middle favorite for me it's </garnt>
<garnt> like sean of the dead hot fuzz then i </garnt>
<garnt> can't remember the third one they made </garnt>
<garnt> balls in </garnt>
<connor> world's end that's it also i think hot </connor>
<connor> fuzz is like that's like where i grew up </connor>
<connor> those kind of towns yeah oh yeah </connor>
<joey> oh [ __ ] that's right it's very much like </joey>
<joey> if you're not like </joey>
<joey> familiar with british like yeah it's </joey>
<connor> literally just like they ripped my town </connor>
<connor> oh i noticed they didn't but that's very </connor>
<garnt> much similar to like yeah i feel like </garnt>
<joey> that was the vibe they were going for </joey>
<joey> that's why hot fuzz like barely made it </joey>
<joey> big in the u.s because like you know a </joey>
<joey> lot of the references just americans i </joey>
<garnt> mean i i feel like sean of the dead and </garnt>
<joey> hot fuzz were both very much cold hits </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah um because they're very much </joey>
<joey> ingrained in you know british humor and </joey>
<connor> british culture you know you you watch </connor>
<connor> hot fuzz and you probably can get a vibe </connor>
<connor> of what the place like he grew up in </connor>
<connor> which is like nothing that happened to </connor>
<connor> you yeah yeah it's just like not </connor>
<garnt> something you can say for many other </garnt>
<garnt> british films even yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean people when when people think </garnt>
<joey> british films they or british culture </joey>
<joey> they're like oh it's like harry potter </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> everything's like harry potter over </joey>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> everyone's just whizzing yeah but i </joey>
<joey> think another thing that's been lost </joey>
<joey> through time was just how [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> unpopular this was when this first came </joey>
<joey> out because now like it's like now it's </joey>
<connor> just like nerd culture haha mainstream </connor>
<connor> nerd culture hi i'm uh i'm a nerd guys </connor>
<joey> i identify as a nerd but i remember when </joey>
<joey> i first saw this um in theaters i saw </joey>
<joey> this by myself </joey>
<garnt> in a completely empty theater in </garnt>
<garnt> brighton right wow really because nobody </garnt>
<connor> wanted to see this [ __ ] movie </connor>
<connor> nobody is it a marketing issue huh was </connor>
<joey> it a marketing issue </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe the nerds just didn't want </joey>
<joey> to expose themselves right except for </joey>
<connor> guys </connor>
<connor> normally you know it's normally a </connor>
<connor> marketing issue especially if it's a </connor>
<garnt> good movie </garnt>
<garnt> i mean this movie this movie [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> bombed in the cinemas it was it was only </connor>
<joey> after definitely definitely cult yeah it </joey>
<connor> definitely became a cult movie that got </connor>
<connor> picked up and more people watched as </connor>
<connor> like nerd culture became more mainstream </connor>
<connor> but i remember the first time watching </connor>
<connor> this it blew my [ __ ] mind how good </connor>
<connor> this was and i couldn't tell anyone </connor>
<connor> about it because nobody was interested </connor>
<connor> in watching it like </connor>
<joey> how did i sell this how did you sell </joey>
<connor> this to someone yeah like go back go </connor>
<joey> back 20 years how do you sell this to </joey>
<garnt> someone to like one of your mates or </garnt>
<connor> something this time is really good you </connor>
<connor> want to watch it again </connor>
<connor> what's it like what's like tell me i'll </connor>
<joey> i'll just take you just shut up shut up </joey>
<joey> and i'll take you don't expect anything </joey>
<joey> watch the popcorn have a good time is it </joey>
<garnt> like the three it's like the food </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] off </joey>
<connor> there's good music space jam you already </connor>
<joey> mentioned that you grew up with that </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> what about matrix though the matrix i </garnt>
<garnt> mean do you really feel that strongly </garnt>
<garnt> about the matrix honestly as a kid yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i did as a kid yeah i i feel like it's </garnt>
<garnt> one of those things where i i just care </garnt>
<garnt> about it it's like referential like it's </garnt>
<garnt> so famous and so referenced yeah but now </garnt>
<garnt> i don't really give a [ __ ] about the </garnt>
<joey> matrix yeah i don't really give about </joey>
<garnt> the i don't really give a revolutionary </garnt>
<garnt> when it came out yeah it was like whoa </garnt>
<joey> you can do that i was surprised like </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] scene where they put the </joey>
<connor> thing inside of it the stomach gave me </connor>
<connor> nightmares oh i mean i've already talked </connor>
<garnt> about that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that [ __ ] gave me nightmares i will </garnt>
<garnt> say </garnt>
<joey> um i don't think the matrix has aged </joey>
<joey> very well oh no definitely i've </joey>
<joey> definitely especially the first one i've </joey>
<connor> definitely rewatched it and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like oh god i thought this was really </connor>
<connor> cool i thought this was like the coolest </connor>
<garnt> thing when it came out because that's </garnt>
<joey> that's why it's kind of [ __ ] it's kind </joey>
<joey> of [ __ ] it definitely has an age wall no </joey>
<garnt> it definitely has no age but that's </garnt>
<joey> because there's been since the matrix </joey>
<joey> there's been a million matrix yeah i </joey>
<garnt> just shot better but i mean like i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like part of the big reason i got into </garnt>
<garnt> anime was because of the matrix as well </garnt>
<connor> because i'm just like i see this and </connor>
<connor> then this was like my anime taste for a </connor>
<connor> long time because i thought this was </connor>
<connor> cool as [ __ ] and i wanted to find more </connor>
<connor> things like this iconic as [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> it's iconic as [ __ ] and </connor>
<joey> i remember i think the first time i saw </joey>
<joey> this when did this come out in 1999 97 i </joey>
<joey> think okay i think i was like nine or </joey>
<connor> ten when i first saw it it's way too </connor>
<connor> young to be seeing this yeah yeah um but </connor>
<joey> i remember thinking this was like the </joey>
<connor> coolest thing which it was it was for </connor>
<connor> the time right </connor>
<connor> for the time showing your age there </connor>
<joey> when he like pulls the red and blue </joey>
<joey> pillow </joey>
<connor> yeah which one is he gonna be but by my </connor>
<connor> my age when i was old enough to be able </connor>
<connor> to appreciate it it kind of fallen out </connor>
<connor> oh definitely because it was like what </connor>
<connor> like 16 so </connor>
<joey> yeah at that time right there'd already </joey>
<joey> been a million coins of matrix </joey>
<garnt> by the time it came up for you like you </garnt>
<garnt> people are dressed like people in the </garnt>
<garnt> matrix are like neck beards with holding </garnt>
<garnt> a katana with like a fedora right this </garnt>
<garnt> is like you think you if the matrix was </garnt>
<garnt> made nowadays it's just like the person </garnt>
<garnt> who's just learned the way of the blade </garnt>
<connor> yeah i didn't really watch many like </connor>
<joey> nerd movies though growing up like i </joey>
<joey> never what defines a nerd yeah what </joey>
<joey> defines a nerd movie star wars i've </joey>
<joey> still yet to watch the original star </joey>

<joey> yeah maybe we should watch it together </joey>

<joey> don't have to watch the director's cut </joey>
<joey> and [ __ ] like we can we can watch the </joey>
<joey> normal ones which is still like 10 hours </joey>
<connor> but still </connor>
<connor> the director's cut can only really be </connor>
<connor> appreciated after you've loved the first </connor>
<joey> card yeah because you want the bonus </joey>
<connor> stuff yeah exactly you need to make sure </connor>
<connor> you love it first okay i'm speaking </connor>
<joey> you've begun to watch lord of the rings </joey>
<connor> i'm sitting you down </connor>
<garnt> no no no no no i don't think you do i </garnt>
<garnt> don't feel like starting unnecessary </garnt>
<connor> honestly honestly i'm i'm i'm uh okay </connor>
<joey> i've pissed off lord of the rings fans </joey>
<garnt> let me piss off star wars say it all </garnt>
<connor> right say </connor>
<connor> i know the plot to the uh the original </connor>
<connor> trilogy yeah like darth vader i just </connor>
<connor> think darth vader looks [ __ ] boring </connor>
<connor> i've played the lego games so </connor>
<joey> i know the story so i basically know </joey>
<joey> star wars guys i know the story and i </joey>
<joey> just think that like darth maul [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> badass okay to be fair general grievous </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> only the coolest [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> general grievous is the the coolest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] uh star wars character i guess </connor>
<joey> he is to be fair to be fair </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> star wars i'm just gonna say i think </garnt>
<garnt> episode one is actually really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> good i think it's well obviously because </garnt>
<garnt> i prefer the pretty small fight and the </garnt>
<joey> pod racing is like the two greatest </joey>
<garnt> scenes in star wars honestly like </garnt>
<garnt> because the reason i prefer the prequels </garnt>
<garnt> to defend myself is okay </garnt>
<joey> number one i really don't give a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> about star wars i like </garnt>
<joey> it it's fair it's just not something i'm </joey>
<joey> interested i'm not passionate about star </joey>
<connor> wars either yeah yeah the lego games are </connor>
<connor> just banging </connor>
<connor> they were just great sure and it's just </connor>
<connor> like i remember watching i've actually </connor>
<connor> seen the original trilogy a lot of times </connor>
<connor> because someone's always got it on in </connor>
<connor> the background someone's always watching </connor>
<connor> it at some [ __ ] family um family </connor>
<connor> gathering or something was like playing </connor>
<connor> at christmas i don't know why but </connor>
<connor> someone's always watching this i've seen </connor>
<connor> it so many [ __ ] times and i i kind of </connor>
<connor> find it like just boring i don't </connor>
<garnt> it's just a very </garnt>
<garnt> standard movie with like it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> just uh </garnt>
<garnt> what's original about star wars nowadays </garnt>
<joey> well nowadays it's not because again </joey>
<joey> like very much like matrix it's just </joey>
<garnt> being copied to [ __ ] it's kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> like the matrix to me where it's just it </garnt>
<garnt> to me it's just boring now it's just a </garnt>
<garnt> very normal standard movie and she's </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> luke goes on the hero's journey and </garnt>
<garnt> darth vader is the villain and yadda </garnt>
<joey> yadda yeah that's why that wasn't really </joey>
<joey> interesting that's why i never like </joey>
<joey> cared to watch episodes seven eight and </joey>
<connor> nine because in my mind i'm just like </connor>
<connor> it's not really like a fantasy to like </connor>
<joey> i think so yeah </joey>
<joey> episode seven was the only one where </joey>
<garnt> people were like it was pretty good yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but like to me there are so many like </garnt>
<garnt> scenes in the in the prequels that just </garnt>
<joey> stand out to me like that [ __ ] jewel </joey>
<joey> with darth maul and like okay [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> gin i know everyone holy [ __ ] that is </joey>
<garnt> iconic to this day still is the best </garnt>
<joey> spicy styles and it has the best theme </joey>
<connor> oh my god the ball theme dude yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> dolphin was terrifying as well darth </connor>
<joey> maul was [ __ ] tough [ __ ] darth vader </joey>
<connor> yeah like like what's what's what's </connor>
<connor> scary about someone having asthma </connor>
<connor> i have asthma does that make me [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> scary no also in the prequels we didn't </connor>
<connor> get to see anna can kill the kids yeah i </connor>
<connor> like that part </connor>
<joey> i like are you kidding me like like the </joey>
<connor> first time you see like um count dooku </connor>
<garnt> fight yoda holy [ __ ] man that was that </garnt>
<joey> church for me to me that was like by far </joey>
<joey> the one star wars the only thing that i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> the only thing that hurts me about the </joey>
<joey> the original three episodes is that </joey>
<joey> jonah is literally in all of them yoda </joey>
<joey> is literally a puppet people love that </joey>
<joey> though yeah i know but i said i don't </joey>
<joey> get that i prefer when he's like you </joey>
<joey> know has a motion initially yeah yeah no </joey>
<garnt> i i liked him when he was [ __ ] sharp </garnt>
<garnt> yeah when he was like flipping in the </garnt>
<joey> air when he brings out the light saber </joey>
<garnt> he starts like doing [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> gymnastics and all this [ __ ] i love </garnt>
<connor> samuel jackson bro yeah samuel jackson </connor>
<joey> like samuel jackson is the only thing </joey>
<joey> that made the clone wars bearable yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah when he pulls out the purple </joey>
<joey> lights and i was like my man let's go </joey>
<garnt> because like the coolest the only thing </garnt>
<garnt> i actually gave a [ __ ] about star wars </garnt>
<garnt> was the jedi's and what's not in the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] like what's hardly in the </joey>
<joey> original trilogy and like the sequels </joey>
<joey> it's the jedi's that's what i wanted i </joey>
<joey> want to see cool jedi's fights i want to </joey>
<connor> see cool lightsaber fights also all the </connor>
<connor> best memes come from the prequels yeah </connor>
<joey> that's just which is like yeah it did </joey>
<garnt> get meme to [ __ ] yeah definitely so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i i'm i'm i'm sticking by my gun i </garnt>
<garnt> prefer the star wars prequels come at me </garnt>
<joey> star wars i won't have any dislikes this </joey>
<joey> clip's gonna happen </joey>
<joey> i just yeah star wars is kind of boring </joey>
<connor> you know i mean it's kind of weird </connor>
<joey> i'm not going to sit here and pretend </joey>
<joey> like it's the greatest fantasy story </joey>
<garnt> ever but i mean you know it's decent i </garnt>
<garnt> mean that's the biggest thing i'm more </garnt>
<garnt> passionate about not caring about star </garnt>
<garnt> wars and like lord of the rings i've </garnt>
<garnt> seen some of like the action scenes </garnt>
<garnt> there i'm like i could probably get into </garnt>
<joey> it there's just the battles bro the </joey>
<connor> battles are [ __ ] happening </connor>
<connor> helms deep bro got me acting up so good </connor>
<joey> battles are so good all the </joey>
<connor> rings yeah we still haven't had battles </connor>
<connor> as good as lord of the rings it's been </connor>
<joey> like 20 years and no nothing has come </joey>
<joey> close dude give me another hour and a </joey>
<joey> half long fight scene man it's insane </joey>
<connor> bro that guy literally pitched that and </connor>

<joey> you want the fight scene to be howling </joey>
<connor> yeah and they [ __ ] did it but they </connor>
<connor> did it </connor>
<connor> it's an hour and a half </connor>
<joey> like battle scene okay and it just </joey>
<joey> doesn't that doesn't cut away amazing </joey>
<garnt> it's literally an hour and a half </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing all right i guess you've </garnt>
<connor> sold me i i guess they still build </connor>
<connor> character and story yeah in the in a </connor>
<joey> battle without like [ __ ] disbelief </joey>
<garnt> of what's going on is everything it's </garnt>
<joey> like literally they're like in the </joey>
<garnt> middle of [ __ ] they're literally </garnt>
<joey> monologuing as they're fighting because </joey>
<garnt> i actually remember why i stopped </garnt>
<connor> watching lord of the rings </connor>
<connor> because i was actually watching it with </connor>
<connor> my cousin </connor>

<joey> gold member gladiator and kamera </joey>
<garnt> tomorrow </garnt>
<garnt> okay i've seen every english speaking </garnt>
<connor> movie this one i had a feeling you'd put </connor>
<connor> two japanese japanese </connor>
<joey> what are these nihongo movies i say that </joey>
<joey> as i put one on youtube </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> yeah so which ones have you guys seen </joey>
<connor> and not seen uh </connor>
<connor> all of these except for poc i don't </connor>
<connor> think i've seen apocalypse now oh you've </connor>
<joey> never seen apocalypse now i haven't seen </joey>
<garnt> apocalypse </garnt>
<connor> the two japanese films okay so like as i </connor>
<joey> was saying earlier like i always have </joey>
<joey> that like top three movies in case </joey>
<joey> anyone in like a panel always asks yeah </joey>
<joey> and my top three that i always bring up </joey>
<joey> is apocalypse now pulp fiction and </joey>
<garnt> goodfellas </garnt>
<garnt> i mean those are all [ __ ] bangers </garnt>
<joey> obviously i mean this isn't this top top </joey>
<joey> uh 10 imdb films </joey>
<connor> i feel like goodfellas and pulp fiction </connor>
<joey> are definitely like oh yeah good fellas </joey>
<joey> and pulp fiction are definitely up there </joey>
<connor> i've never wait no i haven't watched </connor>
<joey> goodfellas oh you've never seen </joey>
<joey> goodfellas i've never watched a </joey>
<joey> godfather or goodfellas oh really yeah </joey>
<joey> have you not you know it you know how </joey>
<garnt> you said like sometimes you just save a </garnt>
<garnt> movie that you just know you're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> love </garnt>
<connor> you know i don't need to watch it right </connor>
<joey> now but i know i will and i know i'll </joey>
<joey> enjoy it yeah i mean like i feel like if </joey>
<connor> we're going through like that imdb thing </connor>
<connor> right like most people are like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> godfather like the godfather trilogy </connor>
<connor> yeah that's definitely one of those and </connor>
<connor> it's like the godfather trilogy is good </connor>
<joey> and like oh i like a lot of mods </joey>
<joey> scorsese films but i think out of all of </joey>
<joey> them goodfellas it's a tie for me </joey>
<garnt> between goodfellas and casino </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like cena is so underrated yeah </garnt>
<garnt> casino feels very underrated man </garnt>
<joey> scorsese film but i put good fellas </joey>
<joey> there because it was like it's the </joey>
<joey> classic it's the classic it's it's it </joey>
<garnt> was the first like </garnt>
<garnt> score safe is what i'm seeing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's it was the first monster scorsese </garnt>
<garnt> like gangster film i ever watched yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um and then like you know and then </garnt>
<joey> obviously i went back after that and was </joey>
<joey> like oh watch godfather and taxi driver </joey>
<garnt> and like all those i think the thing </garnt>
<joey> about godfather is that i i obviously </joey>
<joey> recognize it as a good movie but there's </joey>
<joey> there's there's a difference between me </joey>
<joey> being like oh this is a really good </joey>
<joey> movie too this is a movie that i really </joey>
<joey> personally enjoy and for me godfather is </joey>
<joey> like something that i could recognize </joey>
<joey> was really good it was just a bit slow </joey>
<joey> sometimes </joey>
<joey> i feel like martin's called lazy </joey>
<joey> gangster films it's just godfather but </joey>
<garnt> just a bit more condensed a bit more a </garnt>
<garnt> bit more snappy you know i mean i mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like uh martin scorsese did the do </garnt>
<joey> you departed yeah they did the party </joey>
<connor> that's probably one of my favorite </connor>
<connor> that's a fantastic [ __ ] i mean again </connor>
<joey> everything he's made like wolf of wall </joey>
<joey> street as well was fantastic yeah </joey>
<joey> martial says he's just amazing he's just </joey>
<garnt> a great </garnt>
<garnt> he's just a really really good filmmaker </garnt>
<connor> yeah consistent raging ball as well was </connor>
<garnt> another one oh yeah yeah yeah basically </garnt>
<joey> every movie you can think of that has </joey>
<joey> robert de niro in it it's probably a </joey>
<garnt> scorsese film honestly they're like </garnt>
<garnt> robert de niro and joe pesci is just </garnt>
<garnt> like one of the best duos like you you </garnt>
<garnt> see them together and you know it's </garnt>
<joey> going to be a banger film </joey>
<joey> the part that killed me though was like </joey>
<connor> i remember because i was i was telling </connor>
<connor> aki about this good good movie because </connor>
<connor> she'd never seen her before and she was </connor>
<connor> like who's in it and i was like oh uh </connor>
<joey> you know robert de niro and like joe </joey>
<joey> passion is like yeah i know and then i </joey>
<joey> was like oh and ray leota's in it as </joey>
<joey> well and she's like oh yeah i know that </joey>
<joey> guy from b-movie </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> how does she know that because she loves </connor>
<garnt> b-movie and i'm like you're dead to me </garnt>
<joey> oh that poor man that's it ray leona's </joey>
<joey> legacy is literally goodfellas and </joey>
<joey> b-movie </joey>
<joey> because i did ask i can't think of </joey>
<joey> another ray leona movie i'm sure he's </joey>
<garnt> been in a bunch of other movies i know </garnt>
<garnt> i've seen him in other things i just </garnt>
<joey> can't think of it at the top of my head </joey>
<joey> but i mean like i don't really have to </joey>
<connor> explain pulp fiction it's like one of </connor>
<connor> the most like i am normie cult classic </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> place i like cinema </connor>
<garnt> it's it's it's like i i swear to god it </garnt>
<garnt> was like either perfect or if if you </garnt>
<joey> want to look like you have a personality </joey>
<garnt> in university you put a quentin </garnt>
<joey> tarantino poster on your wall right yeah </joey>
<joey> it's either a pulp fiction poster or a </joey>
<joey> reservoir yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> i put a tarantino film on my list so i </connor>
<joey> guess we can debate it when we get to </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<connor> which one is the truth i mean i've seen </connor>
<garnt> everything by tarantino he's like one of </garnt>
<connor> my favorite directors but i still think </connor>
<joey> to this day pulp fiction is </joey>
<joey> in my personal opinion it's my favorite </joey>
<joey> it's really close between pulp fiction </joey>
<garnt> and reservoir i i still put reservoir </garnt>
<connor> dogs i'll save money </connor>
<garnt> we will say we'll save we'll save that </garnt>
<joey> we'll save the quantity uh and then </joey>
<joey> apocalypse now is my favorite war film </joey>
<garnt> okay so what's the apocalypse what's it </garnt>
<joey> even about apocalypse now is based on </joey>
<garnt> the vietnam war yeah that's all i know </garnt>
<garnt> about it like basically the uh it's it's </garnt>
<connor> told from the american side where like </connor>
<connor> american troops are told so uh </connor>
<connor> martin sheen is the main character </connor>
<connor> and he is like set on a mission to go </connor>
<joey> and pick up a soldier from like he's </joey>
<joey> like he's like a vet who's the director </joey>
<garnt> from the vin uh francis ford coppola </garnt>
<garnt> it's the same person who made godfather </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah so francois koppler like this is </joey>
<joey> like one of his most famous films i </joey>
<connor> think did you know francis ford coupler </connor>
<joey> is actually the uncle to nicholas cage </joey>
<garnt> random fact that i found out at the end </garnt>
<joey> of the day okay but anyway so basically </joey>
<garnt> it's said where like martin sheen's </garnt>
<garnt> character's team has to go into the </garnt>
<garnt> vietnam forest to go and look for this </garnt>
<garnt> like vet who holds a lot of information </garnt>
<garnt> about the vietnam war yeah basically </garnt>
<garnt> he's kind of gone insane and is living </garnt>
<garnt> in the vietnam war because it's marlon </garnt>
<garnt> brando </garnt>
<garnt> basically it's it's uh yeah so marlon </garnt>
<connor> brando's character is this like viet </connor>
<connor> like soldier vet who like holds a lot of </connor>
<connor> information and like he needs to be </connor>
<connor> brought back to the us army basically </connor>
<garnt> martin sheen's character goes in tries </garnt>
<garnt> to fight off all the the viet cong and </garnt>
<garnt> you know tries to get him back basically </garnt>
<garnt> but as </garnt>
<garnt> manchin's character is going through all </garnt>
<connor> of these like life and death situations </connor>
<connor> stuff like that he too also slowly </connor>
<connor> starts to lose his mind and then </connor>
<connor> eventually and then you know that poster </connor>
<connor> there's pretty much [ __ ] awesome </connor>
<connor> poster yeah pretty much sums up like </connor>
<connor> that scene where he like comes out of </connor>
<connor> the pool as there's like fighting </connor>
<connor> happening is one of the coolest [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> scenes in cinema i'm gonna watch that </connor>
<joey> now that sounds cool like marlon brando </joey>
<garnt> is like fantastic is it a thinking movie </garnt>
<joey> i don't know what do i have to think </joey>
<joey> during this movie well okay so </joey>
<joey> apocalypse now </joey>
<connor> has like a a director's cut called </connor>
<connor> apocalypse now redux which is like three </connor>
<connor> and a half hours long because how long </connor>
<connor> is the original three hours oh yeah so </connor>
<garnt> it's all along okay okay because here's </garnt>
<garnt> the thing about apocalypse now because </garnt>
<garnt> everything you described i already kind </garnt>
<garnt> of knew about because i knew like the </garnt>
<garnt> basic plot description and everything </garnt>
<joey> like that yeah what makes it good </joey>
<joey> okay so in my opinion what makes it </joey>
<joey> really good is just the fact well first </joey>
<garnt> of all it's like the music choice in </garnt>
<garnt> that movie is [ __ ] brilliant it's </garnt>
<garnt> like everything i [ __ ] love like in </garnt>
<garnt> my opinion apocalypse now still has one </garnt>
<connor> of the greatest openings i've seen like </connor>
<connor> any movie very iconic yeah um but i </connor>
<connor> don't know it's also just like again </connor>
<connor> it's like it takes that like kind of war </connor>
<connor> element and weirdly enough it's a </connor>
<garnt> vietnam war film that doesn't really </garnt>
<garnt> have a whole lot of fighting yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> really the most amount of like fighting </garnt>
<garnt> between the us army and vietnam really </garnt>
<garnt> happens in like the first like maybe 20 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes right and then the rest of the </garnt>
<garnt> movie is literally just you're inside </garnt>
<garnt> the mind of manchin's character as he's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> slowly venturing closer and closer to </garnt>
<connor> his target and he's slowly like losing </connor>
<connor> his mind as a result of war and it's </connor>
<connor> like a very like i don't know it's like </connor>
<connor> a really weird like psychological twist </connor>
<joey> on a war movie that you don't really </joey>
<joey> like because when you think of war movie </joey>
<joey> right you think of like saving private </joey>
<joey> ryan whereas like yeah there's obviously </joey>
<garnt> a lot of like you know </garnt>
<garnt> soldiers getting [ __ ] up in the war </garnt>
<garnt> scenes right but like there's also a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of like fighting scenes </garnt>
<garnt> right like gunfighting scenes or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the [ __ ] it is whereas </garnt>
<garnt> apocalypse now doesn't really have a </garnt>
<garnt> whole lot of that it's like it's almost </garnt>
<garnt> like a psychological horror set during </garnt>
<garnt> the vietnam war okay and i think that's </garnt>
<joey> what personally that's what makes it </joey>
<garnt> really interesting to me yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> it's cool because the thing is i think i </garnt>
<joey> know more about apocalypse now than the </joey>
<joey> actual than actually seeing the movie </joey>
<joey> itself yeah yeah because i i know like i </joey>
<joey> think this has like a really interesting </joey>
<joey> story behind how it was made yeah uh </joey>
<joey> because like i i think uh </joey>
<joey> the director himself i think almost went </joey>
<joey> bankrupt making this movie or something </joey>
<joey> like that yeah uh because he had to like </joey>
<joey> convince the studio that he owned or </joey>
<joey> something to like lend him the money to </joey>
<garnt> make this movie and he was out there for </garnt>
<garnt> like months and months shooting this </garnt>
<garnt> movie it almost wasn't made and i think </garnt>
<garnt> like marlon brando just refused to read </garnt>
<joey> the script yeah </joey>
<connor> refused to remember his lines yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah he's been notorious for that though </connor>
<connor> yeah he isn't here but this was the </connor>
<garnt> first movie where he started to become </garnt>
<connor> like this and then the godfather i think </connor>
<garnt> happened after apocalypse now which like </garnt>
<joey> then or was it the other way around i </joey>
<joey> think it was the other way it might have </joey>
<joey> been the other way around yeah basically </joey>
<joey> yeah marlon brando doesn't appear in </joey>
<joey> this movie until maybe about two and a </joey>
<garnt> half hours yeah i thought i think like </garnt>
<garnt> most of his lines are just like </garnt>
<garnt> ad-libbed because he just refused to </garnt>
<joey> remember his line so i'm just like how </joey>
<connor> does that work how does that look like </connor>
<connor> i've ever seen any any of the movies </connor>
<joey> that he's in but i know that he's like </joey>
<joey> notorious for being awful to work with </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean you know like during </joey>
<connor> his prime obviously he was a fantastic </connor>
<connor> and you know he's still a fantastic </connor>
<connor> actor in this movie as well but it's </connor>
<connor> like it's very clear that he's not like </connor>
<connor> at his peak but i feel like martin </connor>
<connor> sheen's performance in this movie is </connor>
<connor> just so goddamn good yeah that like he </connor>
<connor> does such an amazing job of like </connor>
<connor> really like progressively showing </connor>
<connor> someone going inside yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<joey> don't know it's funny might be a </joey>
<connor> fantastic movie i remember i think it </connor>
<joey> was on joe rogan i think um </joey>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<joey> no no no no um robert downey jr was </joey>
<garnt> talking about sometimes he didn't </garnt>
<connor> remember lines yeah like i think when he </connor>
<connor> did </connor>
<connor> which i think sherlock he remembered all </connor>
<connor> his lines for but other movies he was </connor>
<connor> like just put put an earpiece in just </connor>
<connor> feeding their lives well honestly like </connor>
<connor> especially when he's like iron man he's </connor>
<connor> just acting robert downey jr </connor>
<connor> he was saying you know some films don't </connor>
<connor> require me to get that deep into the </connor>
<connor> character so there's no point in </connor>
<connor> spending all this time learning the </connor>
<connor> lines but like i think for like sherlock </connor>
<connor> it was like quite difficult some of the </connor>
<connor> lines in the way that he was doing it so </connor>
<connor> he wanted to learn it yeah he's like </connor>
<connor> yeah it depends on the movie but the way </connor>
<connor> he's he made it sound made it seem like </connor>
<joey> oh that makes sense then when you hear </joey>
<joey> about like the third party accounts of </joey>
<joey> marlon brando yeah this sounds like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hell yeah right and i bet like </joey>
<joey> you know because there's a lot of big </joey>
<joey> actors in this name like um harrison </joey>
<connor> ford's in this movie as well yeah just </connor>
<connor> before he's angry at everything this is </connor>
<joey> before he's angry </joey>
<joey> yeah but like i don't know just really </joey>
<joey> really good movie in my opinion um </joey>
<joey> king's speech all right okay i was </joey>
<garnt> surprised that that came out of nowhere </garnt>
<garnt> i never i've never heard jerry mentioned </garnt>
<joey> this film ever okay to be fair this is </joey>
<joey> probably the most recent film i watched </joey>
<joey> that really made like a massive impact </joey>
<connor> on me because like because he's obsessed </connor>
<connor> with the royal family no it's because </connor>
<joey> aoki is obsessed with biopics </joey>
<connor> so before i met archaea i'd never really </connor>
<connor> cared to watch a lot of like biopics </connor>
<connor> biopics are like movies based off real </connor>
<connor> people's lives so essentially um and so </connor>
<connor> i watched a shitload of biopics with aki </connor>
<garnt> so like imitation game was another one i </garnt>
<garnt> was thinking about </garnt>
<connor> um good movie theory of everything is </connor>
<connor> another great movie but i don't know </connor>
<connor> something about king speech i mean </connor>
<joey> firstly i [ __ ] love jeffrey rush yeah </joey>
<connor> he's like one of my favorite actors like </connor>
<joey> everything that he had and he's done </joey>
<joey> such a [ __ ] good job in this movie as </joey>
<joey> well and i don't know it's just like </joey>
<connor> it's a really simple movie but it's just </connor>
<joey> the acting in this is just so goddamn </joey>
<connor> believable yeah it's just so good </connor>
<connor> i've never actually watched it but i </connor>
<joey> also um when i was </joey>
<joey> growing up my best mate for like my </joey>
<joey> whole childhood had like a really bad </joey>
<connor> stutter yeah so i always had to order </connor>
<connor> from at things and everything yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh yeah i don't know this movie came </connor>
<connor> out and i think it was a big deal yeah </connor>
<garnt> i mean i think it won best picture at </garnt>
<connor> the oscars yeah it did yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean like i i the reason i knew a lot </connor>
<connor> about stuttering because again my best </connor>
<connor> mate had it and he had to go to a bunch </connor>
<connor> of like uh therapy and stuff to try and </connor>
<connor> get it because he was like you know like </connor>
<joey> even like at like 16 17 18 yeah couldn't </joey>
<joey> like you know order at places right </joey>
<joey> right and so i i just got used to doing </joey>
<joey> it yeah um </joey>
<connor> and then yeah it was really interesting </connor>
<connor> because i think in the movie they kind </connor>
<garnt> of like gloss over it but like in real </garnt>
<garnt> life the way that you like get like you </garnt>
<garnt> can solve it there's like with so many </garnt>
<connor> different methods yeah my mate had to </connor>
<garnt> wear like uh a belt </garnt>
<connor> like a big belt around his chest to make </connor>
<connor> his breathing different oh wow </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean the movie </joey>
<connor> actually does go through like all the </connor>
<connor> actual steps that oh okay </connor>
<joey> that the king actually had to go through </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that and </connor>
<joey> yeah it's really interesting as well and </joey>
<garnt> it's just cool to think that like a lot </garnt>
<connor> of this stuff actually happened yeah </connor>
<garnt> and at the end like king </garnt>
<connor> george was his name i can't remember i </connor>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> what whatever the king's name was like </connor>
<connor> actually got over a stutter in real life </connor>
<connor> as a result of this dude who just you </connor>
<connor> know solved it and i don't know it's </connor>
<connor> just like it's very like </connor>
<garnt> because you like meticulously watched </garnt>
<garnt> through like every single step and every </garnt>
<garnt> failure of the game trying to get over a </garnt>
<garnt> starter yeah it's just like the ending </garnt>
<garnt> speech is just really powerful and like </garnt>
<joey> really rewarding being like [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> dude you nailed that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> my man let's go i mean i saw it a while </joey>
<garnt> ago and i just remember it was it was a </garnt>
<garnt> good movie um </garnt>
<garnt> i think this movie got me into biopics </garnt>
<garnt> oh okay yeah okay like after i was like </garnt>
<joey> okay you know what i thinks might be </joey>
<connor> kind of cool i'm glad you guys didn't </connor>
<connor> put any like documentaries or anything i </connor>
<connor> was like we have to say that for another </connor>
<joey> time oh yeah we'll save that from yeah </joey>
<garnt> we'll say that for another time </garnt>
<garnt> connor would do like a [ __ ] 10 bites </garnt>
<connor> um and then obviously bruce almighty </connor>
<joey> were talking about like </joey>
<garnt> who hasn't seen bruce i mean it's it's </garnt>
<connor> like morgan freeman is god i still think </connor>
<garnt> of morgan freeman as god morgan just </garnt>
<garnt> because of bruce almighty yeah it's like </garnt>
<joey> the most 2000s film ever yeah it is like </joey>
<joey> 2000 </joey>
<joey> might come out 90s but yeah i think this </joey>
<joey> is like this encapsulates the feeling of </joey>
<joey> the 2000s exactly like everyone in it is </joey>
<joey> amazing it's still funny to this day </joey>
<garnt> yeah basically </garnt>
<garnt> like because of this movie if i die and </garnt>
<garnt> i don't see morgan freeman at the pearly </garnt>
<joey> gates i'll just want to refund on life </joey>
<joey> like take me to hell </joey>
<connor> i explicitly died with the expectation </connor>
<joey> that morgan freeman </joey>
<joey> um and then what's another obvious one i </joey>
<joey> mean austin powell's gold members before </joey>
<garnt> you get to these ones yeah explain </garnt>
<garnt> explain the japanese films the japanese </garnt>
<joey> okay explain the hong kong wait which </joey>
<garnt> one do you want to hear about the first </garnt>
<joey> one the top one the top one okay so </joey>
<joey> darshan </joey>
<joey> so this was during a time this was </joey>
<joey> during like a very uh </joey>
<joey> i guess pretentious period of my high </joey>
<joey> school life where i was like i want to </joey>
<joey> watch a lot of really old films okay so </joey>
<joey> darshan is one uh it's done by this guy </joey>
<joey> called akira kurosawa oh it's an akira </joey>
<joey> creation </joey>
<joey> film who's known as one of the greatest </joey>
<garnt> film directors hello i'm a film buff </garnt>
<joey> mention one name hello i'm a filmmaker </joey>
<joey> i'm a pretentious film boss so i sat </joey>
<connor> down and watched every akira kurosawa </connor>
<connor> film and </connor>
<connor> is one of them and it's essentially it's </connor>
<joey> really hard to kind of explain but </joey>
<joey> basically i think this movie was made in </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> 1950 i think yeah yeah black and white </joey>
<joey> film but basically it revolves around </joey>
<joey> this like one murder case that happens </joey>
<joey> in like edo period japan and it's and </joey>
<joey> the same uh i guess murder is told from </joey>
<joey> different perspectives and different </joey>
<joey> characters so like it kind of plays </joey>
<joey> around i don't know if it was the first </joey>
<joey> movie to ever do but it kind of plays </joey>
<joey> around with the whole like unreliable </joey>
<joey> narrator like logic that a lot of movies </joey>
<joey> use now and it's just like </joey>
<joey> i don't know the cinematography in it is </joey>
<joey> like it's hard to believe this movie was </joey>
<garnt> made 70 years ago yeah i mean that's why </garnt>
<garnt> every [ __ ] big director in their big </garnt>
<joey> film buff still says his name </joey>
<garnt> is your favorite director's favorite </garnt>
<garnt> director yeah yeah yeah yeah basically </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then like i i feel that darshan </garnt>
<garnt> was one of those movies that like took </garnt>
<garnt> everything that akira curacao was like </garnt>
<garnt> really good at in terms of filmmaking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just like crushed it into like an </garnt>
<garnt> hour 30 minutes like solid movie and </garnt>
<garnt> like mifune toshiro is like the guy in </garnt>
<garnt> the poster who's in like basically every </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] akira kurosawa movie but like </garnt>
<garnt> he's one of my favorite japanese actors </garnt>
<garnt> just because like i don't know </garnt>
<connor> he he kind of you know there's that like </connor>
<connor> weird stigma of japanese acting where </connor>
<connor> it's like way over the top and like </connor>
<garnt> really unrealistic yeah we've talked </garnt>
<garnt> about it which we talked about like </garnt>
<joey> mifune toshiro in my opinion like kind </joey>
<joey> of took that and almost made it his own </joey>
<joey> yeah cause like every mufune toshiro </joey>
<joey> character is like so over exaggerated in </joey>
<joey> terms of like emotion and like movement </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that like i'd be very </joey>
<connor> surprised if he didn't do like theater </connor>
<connor> training yeah and [ __ ] like that but </connor>
<connor> like i don't know it's over exaggerated </connor>
<connor> but it's still like </connor>
<connor> believable if that makes sense okay and </connor>
<joey> it's like it becomes really like kind of </joey>
<joey> i don't know what the right word for it </joey>
<joey> is i know i sound very pretentious right </joey>
<joey> now but </joey>
<joey> but it's a real go ahead </joey>
<joey> but like in my opinion </joey>
<joey> like there's lots of really good </joey>
<garnt> accuracy movies yeah i think the only </garnt>
<garnt> one i've seen is seven samurai seven </garnt>
<garnt> samurais it was like the classic yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's that's the one where that like </connor>
<garnt> fight scene goes on for so goddamn long </garnt>
<joey> that might be the i mean there's a lot </joey>
<connor> of like that was a really weird sure </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of fight scenes </connor>
<garnt> the other the other seven samurai did </garnt>
<joey> they have a remake </joey>
<joey> there was a western arena yeah there was </joey>
<garnt> a western remake also the magnificent </garnt>
<garnt> seven is the western version of that </garnt>
<connor> film uh which is also a classic i think </connor>
<connor> maybe i'll watch what are they called 13 </connor>
<connor> assassins that's a remake right of uh </connor>
<joey> that's </joey>
<joey> i don't know actually </joey>
<connor> i think that's the first story is it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah is that a really really long </connor>
<joey> fight in seven sam right uh i don't know </joey>
<joey> about seven samurai but like the one </joey>
<joey> that i can think of as a really long </joey>
<joey> fight is probably iran </joey>
<garnt> i don't know </garnt>
<joey> you've probably seen seven samurai if </joey>
<joey> you've gone through if you went through </joey>
<joey> the phrase of going through like the </joey>
<joey> imdb top you've probably seen it you've </joey>
<connor> probably seen about five because like </connor>
<connor> i've watched a movie called seven </connor>
<connor> samurai that was in black and white and </connor>
<connor> there was a there was a fight scene yeah </connor>
<connor> that was like two hours long and i was </connor>
<connor> just like sitting there like what is </connor>
<joey> when is it gonna end i don't know about </joey>
<joey> i don't think seven samurai was even two </joey>
<garnt> hours long yeah no it was it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> like three and a half hours </garnt>
<connor> yeah is there a long fight scene in </connor>
<garnt> seven sounds </garnt>
<garnt> that was just a very long movie </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's probably the scene it's </garnt>
<joey> probably the film you're thinking i want </joey>
<joey> to know if i've watched it you've </joey>
<garnt> probably seen it it's it's it's a </garnt>
<joey> classic like it's definitely on the imdb </joey>
<joey> like there's probably about five </joey>
<joey> accuracy films if you go through the </joey>
<joey> imdb it's actually only one it's only </joey>
<joey> seven samurai i was about to say </joey>
<joey> um because that's the only one here </joey>
<joey> that's on the imdb top 250. so that's </joey>
<garnt> the only one that most people have only </garnt>
<garnt> seen probably even though he has like </garnt>
<joey> such a wealth of work yeah i mean ron </joey>
<joey> was i think his first color film and </joey>
<joey> that was also [ __ ] fantastic i think </joey>
<connor> i think the stigma is that a lot of </connor>
<connor> akira kurosawa films are like based </connor>
<connor> around like samurai and [ __ ] like that </connor>
<connor> yeah when like later on in his career he </connor>
<connor> did a lot of like kind of </connor>
<connor> rooted more in like modern day stuff </connor>
<connor> there's there's another film that i </connor>
<connor> thought about putting up there called </connor>
<connor> ikiru which means to live yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> essentially this like kind of </connor>
<connor> coming-of-age story of this old man who </connor>
<connor> realizes that he's like about to die and </connor>
<connor> basically like you know the movie the </connor>
<connor> bucket list with [ __ ] yeah like </connor>
<connor> morgan jackman jack nicholson i feel </connor>
<connor> that completely ripped off of the cure </connor>
<connor> because it's it's almost like because </connor>
<connor> the concept is exactly the same it's </connor>
<garnt> like an old guy wanting to like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> rediscover his life and like really like </garnt>
<garnt> give meaning to his life on his deathbed </garnt>
<garnt> okay but like told him like a really </garnt>
<garnt> like cool artistic acura kurosawa esque </garnt>
<garnt> right um </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know yeah i mean he he's a </garnt>
<joey> legend for reading oh he's allegedly in </joey>
<joey> the film industry if you're a movie buff </joey>
<joey> please watch akira kurosawa what's this </joey>
<garnt> i've never okay kameron </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so basically it's this movie have </garnt>
<joey> you seen it yeah </joey>
<joey> it's okay i was not expecting anything </joey>
<joey> out of this movie so i actually watched </joey>
<connor> this film when did it come up </connor>
<joey> it very it's quite quite recently it's </joey>
<connor> like a couple years ago yeah so i </connor>
<connor> thought it was just gonna be like okay </connor>
<connor> so the reason why i think this movie is </connor>
<connor> genius is the way that it was marketed </connor>
<connor> so the way that it's marketed you look </connor>
<connor> at this poster and you think oh it's a </connor>
<connor> zombie film yeah like a b grade zombie </connor>
<connor> film kind of thing okay it's completely </connor>
<connor> not it basically takes the zombie film </connor>
<connor> thing and turns it super [ __ ] meta so </connor>
<connor> basically what it is it's like i don't </connor>
<joey> want to give too much away but basically </joey>
<joey> the movie opens with this </joey>
<joey> 15-20 minute one cut zombie film okay </joey>
<joey> like there's no cuts in it whatsoever </joey>
<joey> and then you think oh the credits roll </joey>
<joey> and that's it but then what happens is </joey>
<joey> it goes back and it shows you how that </joey>
<joey> one cut movie is made but told in a </joey>
<joey> fictional way </joey>
<joey> it's really difficult it's really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] meta it's basically that sounds </joey>
<garnt> cool it's basically a movie </garnt>
<joey> on and there's like all sorts of like </joey>
<joey> weird like it's actually a comedy </joey>
<joey> there's also like there's all these like </joey>
<joey> weird comedic shenanigans that happen </joey>
<garnt> behind the scenes of them shooting that </garnt>
<joey> one-shot 20-minute zombie film yeah so </joey>
<garnt> the movie is about the making of that </garnt>
<garnt> movie </garnt>
<garnt> that honestly sounds like it's right up </garnt>
<joey> my alley yeah and it's i think you'd </joey>
<garnt> you'd like that i'm just like this is </garnt>
<connor> this that's a goddamn </connor>
<garnt> i'll make a [ __ ] video on this i was </garnt>
<joey> i was not expecting this movie to be </joey>
<connor> good at all but it was one it's really </connor>
<joey> really funny and two again like the </joey>
<connor> whole meta aesthetic of it i was like </connor>
<connor> whoa i've never and what it gets even </connor>
<garnt> more meta because during the credit </garnt>
<garnt> scenes then there's a behind-the-scenes </garnt>
<garnt> camera of that camera okay so it's like </garnt>
<garnt> a movie within a movie within a movie </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like i love it i just love like </garnt>
<garnt> the whole meta aesthetic of it but like </garnt>
<garnt> i put this on there because like for one </garnt>
<joey> i barely know anyone who's seen it i've </joey>
<connor> never even heard of it yeah you'd like </connor>
<garnt> yeah i guess people will know yeah the </garnt>
<connor> english title is uh one cut of the dead </connor>
<garnt> one of the dead yeah that sounds so </garnt>
<garnt> cliche </garnt>
<joey> but that's exactly it right like it </joey>
<connor> plays to the strengths of zombie film </connor>
<garnt> cliches and just completely flips it on </garnt>
<garnt> its head and just turns it into like </garnt>
<joey> this wacky slapstick comedy </joey>
<garnt> yeah and it's really really cool it </garnt>
<joey> sounds like an episode of harahi or </joey>
<joey> something right yeah honestly </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean i feel like the last </garnt>
<connor> zombie movie that i watched that i </connor>
<joey> really [ __ ] enjoyed was trained to </joey>
<joey> busan oh that's good </joey>
<joey> fantastic movie so good and like i i </joey>
<joey> can't explain why it's really good </joey>
<connor> because it's just like a very like it </connor>
<connor> it has like the same beats as just a </connor>
<connor> standard zombie movie but it's just just </connor>
<connor> just a really good movie it's a solid </connor>
<joey> movie this is a solid movie even though </joey>
<joey> even if like you think you're bored of </joey>
<connor> the zombie genre </connor>
<connor> like i think i am somebody yeah because </connor>
<joey> i thought okay if you're bored of the </joey>
<connor> zombie genre you need to watch that and </connor>
<connor> then i gotta watch twenty percent </connor>
<garnt> they're gonna watch other [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> no but like one cut of the dead it was </garnt>
<garnt> that was the time yeah one cut of the </garnt>
<garnt> day like yeah like i feel if there's any </garnt>
<joey> movie i can recommend on my three by </joey>
<joey> three it's probably that one just </joey>
<garnt> because it's like it comes like both put </garnt>
<garnt> it in the bottom right as well like the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom left sorry like it completely </garnt>
<joey> destroys what you think about movies </joey>
<garnt> yeah in a way that's like really fun and </garnt>
<joey> also like just again it's just meta as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] if you want that whole meta thing </joey>
<joey> like you'd love that yeah okay um and </joey>
<connor> then i put gladiator on there just </connor>
<joey> because i probably would have put </joey>
<joey> gladiator too it's a good film </joey>
<garnt> uh yeah it's just good it's just very </garnt>
<joey> it's just good yeah just like there's no </joey>
<joey> complaint like i don't have any like </joey>
<connor> special memories with the movie i just i </connor>
<connor> just think it's really good clean story </connor>
<joey> just clean that's i like history </joey>
<garnt> it's not it's not even history right i </garnt>
<connor> like tournament arcs </connor>
<joey> yes that's basically it right radiator </joey>
<connor> is just a tournament russell crow he's </connor>
<joey> funny yeah </joey>
<joey> is a great actor i just realized yeah </joey>
<garnt> this is basically just a [ __ ] shonen </garnt>
<garnt> anime yeah set in rome and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> condensed down into a movie dude </garnt>
<joey> tournament arc revenge story yeah it's </joey>
<joey> everything i want russell crowe it's </joey>
<garnt> everything i want yeah and i feel like </garnt>
<joey> it's this and i i was like really close </joey>
<connor> to putting 300 on mine oh yeah because i </connor>
<garnt> think i like 300. i feel like gladiator </garnt>
<connor> is the better film but i think 300 made </connor>
<joey> a more of an impression 300 is the more </joey>
<joey> entertaining variety yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> before before like zack snyder thought </garnt>
<garnt> like before zack snyder thought i could </garnt>
<joey> put slo-mo in everything </joey>
<garnt> what if what if i just do it use it for </garnt>
<joey> everything like i remember 300 is so </joey>
<joey> good not gonna lie man the slow motion </joey>
<joey> fight scenes in 300 still [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> slapped to this day i i feel i i still </garnt>
<garnt> think it's zack snyder's best feeling i </garnt>
<joey> was 100 agree like he just he just </joey>
<joey> peaked with that and he was just like </joey>
<joey> how do i recapture this </joey>
<joey> how do i same thing with all my other </joey>
<connor> films it's such a fun film it is a good </connor>
<joey> film it's such a quotable just fun like </joey>
<joey> bloody gory film such a cool story too </joey>
<joey> yeah it's just it's just like facebook </joey>
<joey> yeah it's [ __ ] awesome </joey>
<joey> as much as this one yeah </joey>
<garnt> i mean somewhat yeah you cannot like </garnt>
<garnt> watch 300 and not just come out just </garnt>
<joey> hyped as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> punch someone the funniest thing about </joey>
<joey> 300 in my opinion is just how they made </joey>
<joey> xerxes into this like nine foot tall </joey>
<joey> like brick [ __ ] house when i think in </joey>
<joey> real life xerxes was like four feet tall </joey>
<joey> like he was actually a [ __ ] never like </joey>
<joey> zacks i was like no no let's let's get </joey>
<joey> the biggest chad in the movie film </joey>
<garnt> industry and just make him play cersei </garnt>
<garnt> because i i think have you been have you </garnt>
<joey> been in a like movie theater where </joey>
<joey> they've literally just gasped </joey>
<joey> yes yeah because like 300 is the only </joey>
<joey> experience i've had in a movie theater </joey>
<joey> where like the whole [ __ ] movie </joey>
<joey> theater just gasped </joey>
<joey> um and that was the scene that was like </joey>
<joey> the very final scene where he throws the </joey>
<joey> spear oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> that was such a good scene yeah </garnt>
<joey> god that's such a god i want to watch </joey>
<connor> 300 again </connor>
<connor> it's such a good film you can't not be </connor>
<joey> happy watching that's just so [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> such a quotable movie i mean like all of </connor>
<garnt> these films like there's there's at </garnt>
<garnt> least one quote i can easily one or two </garnt>
<joey> quotes </joey>
<connor> yeah let's get into this austin powell's </connor>
<connor> why </connor>
<joey> it's gold member what's up with that i </joey>
<joey> don't know i think it's the best austin </joey>
<connor> powers movie i don't really like austin </connor>
<connor> powell you know like austin powers </connor>
<connor> i watched i re-watched gold member again </connor>
<joey> just because like one of my friends came </joey>
<joey> over to my house and was like </joey>
<joey> i feel like watching gold member and i </joey>
<joey> was like and i was like i haven't seen </joey>
<joey> that movie in like 10 years but let's </joey>
<joey> let's do is that movie still funny now i </joey>
<connor> feel like it's not funny i think it's </connor>
<joey> still funny do you think it's funny </joey>
<garnt> anymore i didn't find it funny when it </garnt>
<joey> first came out i'll be honest yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know it's uh </joey>
<joey> it's again it's like that whole like </joey>
<joey> it's it's the meta thing right it's like </joey>
<garnt> the fact that austin powers as a </garnt>
<garnt> character is it's just like james bond </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah it's just so aware of what he </garnt>
<garnt> is that yeah it's it's the potty humor </garnt>
<joey> poo poo pee pee humor right </joey>
<joey> it really is it kind of </joey>
<connor> i i like that humor i don't know why i </connor>
<connor> didn't like this movie like uh the </connor>
<connor> golden i've seen uh sorry the austin </connor>
<connor> power series i think i've seen all of </connor>
<joey> them and i just thought like yeah that's </joey>
<joey> all right it's i don't know it's like </joey>
<joey> for me it's just like comfort food to </joey>
<joey> just go back to </joey>
<joey> it's just like it's either that or bruce </joey>
<joey> almighty in terms of comedy films right </joey>
<garnt> i'm like yeah this is still funny i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i i think it's just like the peepee hoop </garnt>
<connor> yeah i feel like </connor>
<garnt> it was a bit bit too in your face yeah </garnt>
<connor> when i think of austin powers i just </connor>
<garnt> feel like i i like recall and discuss </garnt>
<connor> bit i think you know what it is there's </connor>
<connor> so many gross scenes in that film </connor>
<connor> you know what it is about gold member in </connor>
<connor> particular i think it's like the same </connor>
<connor> concept as like when you see like you </connor>
<joey> know a troll face comic </joey>
<connor> on twitter right where it's like it's so </connor>
<garnt> not funny that it's just funny again </garnt>
<garnt> it's just ancient music </garnt>
<garnt> the second one this is the third one </garnt>
<garnt> third one this is one </garnt>
<garnt> bastard yeah this is the last one oh </garnt>
<garnt> gosh yeah </garnt>
<connor> and like gold member is also played by </connor>
<joey> uh mike myers where he's like the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] dutch guys like i love gold like </connor>
<joey> that characters like it's so dumb that </joey>
<garnt> it's like it's funny i just i just feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i put it in like the same category </garnt>
<joey> as scary movie and do you remember scary </joey>
<joey> movie see i didn't find scary movies </joey>
<garnt> funny at all i didn't find it funny at </garnt>
<connor> all yeah and it's it's the 16 year old </connor>
<connor> me love scary movie yeah and then when i </connor>
<garnt> watched it again i was like oh </garnt>
<connor> it's it's the same kind of like </connor>
<joey> this is a parody kind of humor and i </joey>
<connor> just like i </connor>
<connor> i never found that too funny i mean i i </connor>
<garnt> love pee pee poo poo humor jokes but it </garnt>
<garnt> was just a bit </garnt>
<connor> too in your face right right yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't know yeah maybe i i i swear i </connor>
<connor> probably got a few laughs out of it here </connor>
<connor> and there but i don't know maybe i don't </connor>
<joey> know why i think i'm kind of just like </joey>
<joey> numb to comedy movies now just because </joey>
<connor> like the past five years of comedy </connor>
<connor> movies have just all been really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mediocre in mind yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> many many good comedy like i'm trying to </connor>
<garnt> think of like the last good comedy movie </garnt>
<joey> and like i genuinely four year old </joey>
<garnt> virgin i genuinely think it might be </garnt>
<joey> cold </joey>
<joey> like i </joey>
<garnt> that was like nearly as fun pretty sure </garnt>
<connor> superbad came off of this yeah right as </connor>
<connor> a white guy i'm obliged to say step </connor>
<connor> brothers even though i don't really feel </connor>
<connor> that way </connor>
<joey> since we're all doing hot takes on </joey>
<joey> movies i don't think i don't think i've </joey>
<joey> ever laughed at a well-feral movie no i </joey>
<joey> mean there isn't a single will for a lot </joey>
<connor> i don't think well i don't actually </connor>
<connor> think stepbrothers is freaking out </connor>
<joey> there's one scene in step brothers that </joey>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> what if there's like 15 </connor>
<joey> like filmography to to see if to see if </joey>
<joey> i actually because like step brothers </joey>
<joey> was like okay i thought blazer glory was </joey>
<joey> not funny at all </joey>
<connor> they were just like they were the most </connor>
<connor> six to seven out of ten films yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah what's his most </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<joey> man i don't know anchorman is just like </joey>

<connor> like had the borah </connor>
<connor> is pretty good i like alf the alpha's </connor>
<joey> overrate as [ __ ] i think i think else </joey>
<joey> the the thing that i don't understand </joey>
<joey> about elf is that like </joey>
<joey> like it gained like a cult classic </joey>
<connor> following after like all this time of </connor>
<connor> being ignored i like talladega night </connor>
<connor> silence </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm just looking at this and i'm </joey>
<joey> just like it's okay everything's </joey>
<joey> everything's okay yeah like anchorman i </joey>
<joey> feel like i watched anchorman past when </joey>
<garnt> like it's already it was already memes </garnt>
<garnt> to death </garnt>
<garnt> um and i feel like the best part of hank </garnt>
<garnt> man was steve carell oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of late night shows listed as </garnt>
<garnt> filmography i don't know </garnt>

<connor> i [ __ ] love jim carrey in all the </connor>
<connor> series yeah seriously like the other one </connor>

<garnt> there just because it's like the comedy </garnt>
<garnt> movie i can go back to it's like classic </garnt>
<garnt> but like if i didn't put a bruce on my </garnt>
<garnt> didn't put bruce almighty or any jim </garnt>
<garnt> carrey comedy i would have put uh you </garnt>

<joey> show was such a [ __ ] yeah german show </joey>
<joey> was good yeah yeah i don't know </joey>
<garnt> something about the number 23 was like </garnt>
<garnt> it was so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] edgy that it just became </garnt>
<garnt> entertaining again you know what i mean </garnt>
<garnt> we're like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like a point of ageiness </garnt>
<joey> where it's like it just comes back </joey>
<garnt> around wasn't that like destroyed by </garnt>
<joey> critics for like it was just pretentious </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> wow </joey>

<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> joey's like ah yes i don't understand </connor>
<joey> perfect i think the fact that i put in </joey>
<joey> the kira kurosawa film goes to show that </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty i'm a pretty [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pretentious movie creator </joey>
<garnt> wow what do you guys think of while </garnt>
<garnt> we're on the topic of comedy movies uh </garnt>
<garnt> seth rogen films how do we feel about </garnt>
<joey> that kind of the same same thing i feel </joey>
<connor> about willful movies </connor>
<joey> i'm just like expressed he's okay he's </joey>
<joey> like ha ha he smells weird </joey>
<garnt> i feel like </garnt>
<joey> i feel like if it's not like purely just </joey>
<garnt> seth rogen being a stoner then it's a </garnt>
<garnt> pretty funny film i like seth rogen as a </garnt>
<garnt> person yeah you know </garnt>
<joey> i like like the stoner actor seth rogen </joey>
<joey> but like seth rogen in films i'm just </joey>
<connor> kind of just like i like his movies you </connor>
<connor> just turn your brain off and uh it's an </connor>
<connor> easy movie you know you know yeah </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's just hard movies to watch </connor>
<joey> i can't even think of like sometimes you </joey>
<connor> just want movies </connor>
<joey> our films are not the kind of thing i </joey>
<connor> can just put on oh no no no of course </connor>
<joey> it's like some he you know you always </joey>
<connor> get just a film you can watch yeah </connor>
<joey> you wanna you want to know how [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pretentious i am as a former critic </joey>
<joey> instead of gold member i was going to </joey>
<joey> put 2001 a space in my god </joey>
<connor> i would have actually i would have </connor>
<connor> actually been like actually [ __ ] off </connor>
<garnt> yeah i actually get the [ __ ] out sorry </garnt>
<joey> who are you trying to please joey </joey>
<joey> i'm trying to please myself all right </joey>
<joey> i'm surprised one thing i'm surprised </joey>
<garnt> that's not on here yeah is uh </garnt>
<garnt> trainspotting because you've talked </garnt>
<joey> about that a bunch [ __ ] you know what i </joey>
<joey> completely forgot about it </joey>
<joey> actually yeah can we can we get rid of </joey>
<joey> gold member and put train sporting no no </joey>
<joey> no no </joey>
<connor> someone criticized me because they said </connor>
<connor> when someone they asked me what my </connor>
<connor> favorite video game or whatever was and </connor>
<connor> i said different from what i put on my </connor>
<connor> three i think we make off three by </connor>
<joey> threes in like 10 minutes this is not </joey>
<joey> like the end all of our actual exactly </joey>
<connor> exactly which try to make it interesting </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah they're fine </garnt>
<garnt> i'm thinking oh i've really enjoyed this </garnt>
<connor> is the end by uh a seth rogen film oh </connor>
<connor> what yeah and uh what is uh 50 50 was </connor>
<joey> really good oh 50 50 was great i haven't </joey>
<joey> seen any of these </joey>
<connor> the ones where like the joke isn't just </connor>
<connor> him being a stoner right </connor>
<connor> and that's why is that even possible </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah wow all right </connor>
<joey> okay yeah he does because i think i </joey>
<joey> think with seth rogen like i watched one </joey>
<joey> film with seth rogen in it and i was </joey>
<joey> like was it pineapple express </joey>
<connor> it might have been that's and i was like </connor>
<connor> and i was like i </connor>
<connor> percent understand this actor in this </connor>
<joey> character she's probably like that in </joey>
<joey> every other movie yeah yeah i don't know </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> oh my god [ __ ] can i talk about </joey>
<joey> transporting okay okay sorry sorry sorry </joey>
<joey> it's so good </joey>
<joey> okay have you guys seen it </joey>
<connor> i have not you haven't seen it okay so </connor>
<joey> trainspotting is this like oh god how do </joey>
<connor> you how the [ __ ] to explain train </connor>
<connor> sporting i know that it's not about </connor>
<joey> spotting trains it is not about spotting </joey>
<connor> trees so the term train spotting comes </connor>
<garnt> from heroin addicts where they try to uh </garnt>
<garnt> inject the heroin into their veins so </garnt>
<garnt> they have to spot the veins and that is </garnt>
<garnt> referred to as train spotting </garnt>
<joey> yeah so basically it's a it's a drug </joey>
<garnt> film uh set in scotland </garnt>
<joey> uh played uh mainly by euro mcgregor </joey>
<joey> yeah who is in his natural habitat he's </joey>
<joey> in his natural uh accent so you know </joey>
<joey> it's going to be good uh very very young </joey>
<joey> ewan mcgregor yeah i think this is </joey>
<garnt> before star wars i think i think the one </garnt>
<joey> scene i remember from train spotting </joey>
<joey> apart from the baby scene yeah uh </joey>
<joey> was just toilet scene yeah just you </joey>
<garnt> mcgregor emerges from the toilet yeah </garnt>
<connor> i've heard about this yeah i've heard of </connor>
<joey> the scenes in trains yeah so very famous </joey>
<joey> scene is where your mcgregor needs to go </joey>
<joey> you know do a hit and he's at a pub and </joey>
<garnt> he goes into the closest no no that's </garnt>
<garnt> right no he uh he gets the runs i think </garnt>
<garnt> from something yeah and he runs into a </garnt>
<connor> pub and goes into the probably the most </connor>
<connor> disgusting looking toilet imaginable </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's it's like it's actually </connor>
<connor> foul and he drops his drugs into the </connor>
<connor> toilet oh and because he's a desperate </connor>
<connor> junkie and he took a shot beforehand he </connor>
<connor> starts hallucinating as he reaches into </connor>
<connor> the toilet and just goes into the toilet </connor>
<connor> and starts swimming into the inside the </connor>
<joey> toilet emerges out of the toilet with </joey>
<connor> the drugs oh my god it's a very very </connor>
<joey> bizarre movie but </joey>
<joey> i uh </joey>
<joey> i showed trainspotting to aki right and </joey>
<joey> she was she stopped it after five </joey>
<joey> minutes and she's like can we put </joey>
<joey> subtitles on because i can't understand </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] they're saying </joey>
<joey> to be fair </joey>
<joey> it's a very heavy scottish accent like </joey>
<joey> there are some scenes where even i'm </joey>
<connor> like oh i didn't quite catch what he </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] said there so like </connor>
<joey> americans this is what i'm saying </joey>
<connor> probably best to put subtitles being </connor>
<connor> from the uk is like your english level </connor>
<connor> is op yeah i understand any any form of </connor>
<joey> the only reason why the only reason why </joey>
<joey> i understand train sporting is because i </joey>
<joey> like watched it like over 10 times </joey>
<connor> i just remember what they say but uh </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know it's just like it's </connor>
<connor> very brutal film but also it's like </connor>
<connor> again like the music choices like yeah </connor>
<joey> if with mute with movies if it's got a </joey>
<garnt> great music choice i'm all for it yeah </garnt>
<joey> same with my anime right if the ost is </joey>
<joey> good it's a great movie i'd say if </joey>
<garnt> there's like two like drug like films </garnt>
<connor> kind of like what how do i how do i </connor>
<connor> describe this </connor>
<joey> is that a category </joey>
<joey> yeah drug movie drug movie like because </joey>
<joey> like i don't really know how to describe </joey>
<connor> train spotting it's just a movie about a </connor>
<connor> bunch of characters and that's sold on </connor>
<connor> it to be fair i like how their lives </connor>
<joey> revolve around drugs and like </joey>
<joey> trainspotting is one of them and the </joey>
<joey> other one is requiem for a dream yeah </joey>
<joey> which is not a film i think like people </joey>
<joey> should watch to enjoy but i think people </joey>
<garnt> should just watch it at least once yeah </garnt>
<joey> like realize wow i just just never want </joey>
<garnt> to try heroin you know i just that's </garnt>
<joey> that's just a bad thing well i mean </joey>
<joey> train sporting was definitely one where </joey>
<joey> i was like oh never touching that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah in my life [ __ ] that [ __ ] that </joey>
<connor> you know i was 50 50 but uh </connor>
<joey> if you ever have a friend who's like </joey>
<joey> maybe i might try heroin just show them </joey>
<garnt> train spawn they'll probably be like </garnt>
<garnt> nope never drink him for a dream or </garnt>
<garnt> recreate for a dream i think i just got </garnt>
<garnt> full on [ __ ] depression for a week </garnt>
<joey> after watching that film i mean </joey>
<joey> trainspotting is definitely another film </joey>
<joey> that is not watched for entertainment </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah probably more entertaining </joey>
<joey> than recording for a dream i i would </joey>
<garnt> like to say like tradespotting isn't a </garnt>
<joey> happy movie but it's like less bleak </joey>
<joey> than wrecking for a dream </joey>
<joey> there's a lot there's a lot of great </joey>
<joey> scenes and it's like i don't know just </joey>
<joey> again the acting's really good and it's </joey>
<joey> just very it's a very raw film yeah </joey>
<connor> requiem for a dream just sounds like </connor>
<connor> something you'd give an oscar to based </connor>
<connor> on the title </connor>
<joey> to be fair there's some great [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> scenes </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] that's awesome yeah the thing </connor>
<connor> i can say about rec room for a dream is </connor>
<connor> that it's just </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] powerful movie and it's like </connor>
<connor> it's makes you feel emotions that it's </connor>
<garnt> not pleasant feeling yeah but it's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] powerful [ __ ] man speaking of </connor>
<connor> powerful should we uh get onto my list </connor>
<joey> go on </joey>
<garnt> is it powerful </garnt>
<connor> it's going to be powerful i actually did </connor>
<connor> put no country for old men oh wow </connor>
<garnt> what's interesting is off camera this is </garnt>
<garnt> mine </garnt>
<connor> yeah yes this one off camera uh she was </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah i wouldn't put her no </connor>
<garnt> control honestly i was so close to </garnt>
<joey> putting some of these on mine i know you </joey>
<connor> were gonna put that oh okay okay because </connor>
<garnt> i was like i was like maybe someone else </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna put it man but that was so </garnt>
<garnt> close to coming on my way this is a </garnt>
<connor> powerful list i think gentlemen i think </connor>
<joey> you know what </joey>
<joey> the only one </joey>
<joey> that i probably have like a little bit </joey>
<connor> of qualms with is uh tokyo no </connor>
<joey> absolutely not this isn't a masterpiece </joey>
<joey> if we're talking about overrated films </joey>
<connor> tokyo drift uh it is not overrated </connor>
<connor> listen the main actor you know his </connor>
<joey> entire fast and furious franchise i've </joey>
<connor> ever written he's actually i said he's </connor>
<joey> he's an impeccable character actor the </joey>
<joey> main actor in tokyo drift you know i </joey>
<joey> don't know if you're being serious he </joey>
<joey> he he enveloped like he nothing is </joey>
<joey> mimicked living in japan quite like </joey>
<joey> tokyo drew you're right you're right </joey>
<joey> when i went to school and some and you </joey>
<joey> know i love all one japanese actors in </joey>
<connor> this you know </connor>
<connor> you know when i was in school in japan </connor>
<joey> with my black friend from america um </joey>
<joey> we dreamed of going to japan one day and </joey>
<joey> we were like what is the closest we can </joey>
<connor> get to it </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> i think every every single point of </connor>
<connor> tokyo drift is a master class in </connor>
<connor> filmmaking frankly uh from the very </connor>
<connor> start you know in the american high </connor>
<connor> school scene it's very very much like </connor>
<connor> how to still be in america yeah and </connor>
<connor> naturally i race my cars and uh i cause </connor>
<connor> a lot of damage and don't get arrested </connor>
<connor> and get exiled which i don't think is a </connor>
<connor> punishment that you see </connor>
<connor> you know a lot of movies they would just </connor>
<connor> arrest him yeah and i think he was </connor>
<joey> really genius well you know like </joey>
<joey> excellent full speed drifting through a </joey>
<joey> parking lot which is just you know if </joey>
<joey> you've ever been to a parking lot in any </joey>
<connor> country it's just impossible there's not </connor>
<connor> enough movies that use exile as a as a </connor>
<connor> good way of </connor>
<connor> conveying the story </connor>
<joey> name a movie with exile in it i'll wait </joey>
<connor> there we go </connor>
<joey> for good reason it's a medieval concept </joey>
<joey> that it hasn't been introduced in modern </joey>
<joey> films you know </joey>
<joey> exile exile he was exiled from arkansas </joey>
<garnt> some i don't know where the [ __ ] he was </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know some hick town yeah and you </garnt>
<connor> know his accent is just amazing i love i </connor>
<connor> love this guy's accent so so much i love </connor>
<joey> the accent i don't think i've ever felt </joey>
<joey> physical pain while watching a movie </joey>
<garnt> before until i launched youtube i'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be honest i have not seen a single </garnt>
<garnt> fast and furious film uh i've only seen </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo drift and i you know because i </garnt>
<joey> didn't wanna i didn't wanna be annoyed </joey>
<connor> because we'd already found the best fast </connor>
<joey> and furious film so why watching i must </joey>
<connor> say you are not missing out on it no no </connor>
<connor> tokyo have you watched your drift i i </connor>
<joey> literally just said five seconds ago </joey>
<joey> literally five seconds i think it was a </joey>
<garnt> fast and furious film no i don't count </garnt>
<joey> this as a foster future it's a cinema </joey>
<joey> experience it's a totally different it's </joey>
<joey> somehow worse no it's </joey>
<joey> it's if you add up all the imdb scores </joey>
<joey> of the fast and furious films it's still </joey>
<connor> not as high as tokyo direct like </connor>
<connor> yeah because like zero zero zero </connor>
<joey> there's not much </joey>
<joey> tokyo drift is a great film uh that is </joey>
<joey> close to my heart um in many ways uh not </joey>
<garnt> only did it get me into uh donkey kong </garnt>
<garnt> uh because of the dk oh yeah of course </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is the monkey origin story </garnt>
<connor> there was </connor>
<connor> you know it's almost </connor>
<joey> it's just there's nothing quite as uh </joey>
<joey> groundbreaking as this film quite </joey>
<joey> frankly </joey>
<joey> so what what's your favorite scene uh i </joey>
<joey> like the scene </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<joey> he breaks his ipod and then he still </joey>
<joey> manages to sell the ipod broken and then </joey>
<joey> he doesn't check to he doesn't check to </joey>
<joey> to check the ipod before buying it uh i </joey>
<connor> believe this is what happens and then he </connor>
<connor> purchased the ipod then gets annoyed </connor>
<connor> that it was broken yeah but he never </connor>
<connor> once thought i should check this ipod </connor>
<connor> before buying it uh class and that's </connor>
<connor> just a great i thought that was a really </connor>
<connor> intelligent scene because that's how </connor>
<garnt> they made conflict through a broken ipod </garnt>
<garnt> what i want to know is um how there's so </garnt>
<connor> many fast and the furious films uh well </connor>
<connor> you this actually saved the fast and </connor>
<connor> furious franchise </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<garnt> when you hear of someone saying fast and </garnt>
<garnt> furious i think of tokyo drift yeah </garnt>
<joey> they're right most people i think think </joey>
<garnt> of tokyo drift and i'm like why like do </garnt>
<garnt> the other fast and furious films even </garnt>
<joey> have names how does it like </joey>
<connor> how does such a [ __ ] film become so </connor>
<connor> iconic like that's what i wanted like </connor>
<connor> just like it is </connor>
<connor> it is terrible by every single metric of </connor>
<joey> the english word but i love this film to </joey>
<joey> death it's like the room right </joey>
<connor> it's like the room of fast and furious </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<joey> it's just it's just got the coolest name </joey>
<connor> i mean tokyo drift right it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cool last one so literally i know we </connor>
<connor> spoke about this before but like it was </connor>
<joey> kind of like a gateway for me to japan </joey>
<joey> like yeah it goes actually it kind of </joey>
<connor> legit got me into japan in many ways i'm </connor>
<connor> sorry it was it was better </connor>
<joey> it's great because then i got to learn </joey>
<connor> actual [ __ ] all right </connor>
<joey> also it was the very first dvd i ever </joey>
<connor> owned uh it was totally fair enough yeah </connor>
<joey> it's in a glass cabinet as you can </joey>
<joey> imagine i think that i think i think the </joey>
<joey> vacuum sealed yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah mint condition has been graded </connor>
<joey> obviously </joey>
<joey> i think the first dvd i ever owned was </joey>
<connor> shrek </connor>
<connor> well honestly okay so tokyo drift is a </connor>
<garnt> terrible but amazing movie and i can </garnt>
<joey> watch it and enjoy it because you can </joey>
<joey> just laugh at it now it's amazing to </joey>
<joey> laugh at oh yeah </joey>
<joey> there's some of the dialogue that they </joey>
<joey> that those poor actors have to actually </joey>
<joey> like say it's just hilarious yeah and </joey>
<joey> then it gets just not not fun at all </joey>
<joey> towards the end right and then it </joey>
<garnt> becomes two different okay </garnt>
<garnt> then it becomes too soon let me ask you </garnt>
<joey> one thing all right why shrek two over </joey>
<joey> strike one two is the most straight </joey>
<joey> straight two stretch two is the best </joey>
<connor> really it is dude two is the best bro </connor>
<joey> shrek two is the best like like shrek </joey>
<joey> run set the rules and then what is your </joey>
<joey> friend your english shrek one set the </joey>
<garnt> rules and then shrek two perfected </garnt>
<joey> everything yeah </joey>
<joey> okay look i'm not gonna go against the </joey>
<joey> fact that shrek two is a good movie </joey>
<joey> strike two is the best bro but prince </joey>
<connor> charming is [ __ ] amazing i still </connor>
<joey> think shrek 1 is battle </joey>
<connor> shrek 1 is just an encapsulated </connor>
<joey> experience that is fantastic i think the </joey>
<joey> problem with shrek 1 is that no one can </joey>
<garnt> watch it seriously anymore because it's </garnt>
<garnt> being memed to the ends of the earth not </garnt>
<joey> enough not enough scenes in shrek to </joey>
<joey> have been memed and i think that's why </joey>
<garnt> two is just like i actually disagree </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like shrek is one of the </garnt>
<connor> few franchises where the memes have only </connor>
<garnt> like put it into legendary status i am </garnt>
<joey> never going to forget shrek anymore yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i can't like that's why </connor>
<joey> smash mouth can like retire because </joey>
<garnt> they've already been immortalized yeah </garnt>
<connor> through shrek memes strength is an </connor>
<garnt> amazing film that you can watch anytime </garnt>
<joey> but i think people forget how [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> amazing shrek 2 is yeah </connor>
<connor> obviously so much better than track one </connor>
<joey> watch it in my opinion like shrek one </joey>
<connor> just inches strike is an 8.5 and shrek </connor>
<connor> is a nine point two in my head trick two </connor>
<garnt> sorry two there's a nine point five and </garnt>
<garnt> shrek one is uh eight point five sorry </garnt>
<garnt> honestly </garnt>
<garnt> every single character they oh two it's </garnt>
<garnt> not even worth watching every single </garnt>
<garnt> character they introduce in shrek 2 is a </garnt>
<connor> banger character true they all like help </connor>
<connor> the story so much and then they they </connor>
<connor> build on the the one-off characters in </connor>
<connor> shrek 1 that you thought were a joke </connor>
<connor> yeah they bring them back they're like </connor>
<connor> hold up hold up you know there's a </connor>
<connor> reason why the wharf is cross-dressing </connor>
<garnt> let's find out let's just see </garnt>
<garnt> gingerbread man in pinocchio also uh </garnt>
<joey> they use uh the soundtrack uh in very </joey>
<garnt> intelligent ways you know they do they </garnt>
<joey> do the soundtrack's banging yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's true </garnt>
<garnt> the condition of i need a hero was yeah </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> standalone movie was terrible </joey>
<joey> but there's a reason why he was so </joey>
<joey> lovable it's also amazing to think like </joey>
<joey> how many [ __ ] high-profile actors are </joey>
<joey> in shrek 2. honestly isn't it isn't the </joey>
<joey> very godmother played by julie andrews i </joey>
<connor> think so i think yeah if you're if you </connor>
<connor> want your career made you're in shrek </connor>
<connor> too yeah every coincidence that every </connor>
<connor> single shrek 2 actor is a goddess </connor>
<joey> antonio banderas was the cat right yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly right </connor>
<connor> why did mike myers do another like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah yeah austin powers film </connor>
<joey> when he was in shrek yeah this is why i </joey>
<joey> even tried yeah why why why joey </joey>
<joey> the best minecraft shrek 100 because </joey>
<joey> mike myers has like two good films and </joey>
<garnt> uh it's shrek </garnt>
<connor> shrek </connor>
<connor> wayne's world is overrated track one and </connor>
<connor> two is only good role i agree i'll agree </connor>
<joey> wayne's world is over right now yeah </joey>
<connor> okay uh but let's talk about the the </connor>
<connor> quentin tarantino choice you put yes </connor>
<garnt> kill bill i i think volume one really </garnt>
<garnt> okay i like volume really </garnt>
<joey> i i actually won number one </joey>
<joey> i know volume is great volume 2 is rated </joey>
<connor> higher and it's a crime we didn't get </connor>
<joey> another one it's a legit crime we didn't </joey>
<joey> get a volume 3. uh i just think </joey>
<joey> i think in the entire like filmography </joey>
<joey> of queen tarantino </joey>
<connor> kill bill is just one that i just forget </connor>
<connor> see the thing for me is like pulp </connor>
<joey> fiction isn't even like my top five </joey>
<joey> quentin tarantino really yeah i think </joey>
<connor> that like glorious bastards django is </connor>
<connor> better um </connor>
<joey> is better than pulp fiction and what </joey>
<joey> else has he done that's bad what about </joey>
<joey> like jackie brown look look look </joey>
<garnt> maybe </garnt>
<garnt> django would have been like one of his </garnt>
<garnt> best films if not for jamie foxx i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like jamie foxx was so [ __ ] dry do </garnt>
<joey> you know who was originally casting </joey>
<joey> smith will smith they got wilson's for </joey>
<joey> that movie </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> yeah christoph waltz had to do the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah yeah exactly everyone is </connor>
<garnt> i think jimmy fox is great in that movie </garnt>
<garnt> what do you remember after the big scene </garnt>
<connor> in the middle uh i think i actually </connor>
<connor> can't remember much that's that's the </connor>
<joey> point </joey>
<garnt> because after that it's jamie foxx who </garnt>
<connor> has to carry the film and he just </connor>
<joey> doesn't well i think one of the actually </joey>
<joey> one jamie foxx tries when the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> deck is samuel jackson what i was gonna </connor>
<connor> say because i was gonna say like </connor>
<joey> actually like you know everyone focused </joey>
<joey> on christoph waltz he did amazing and so </joey>
<joey> did uh uh leonardo dicaprio yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but like samuel jackson is like probably </joey>
<connor> one of the my favorite things in that </connor>
<joey> film he's he's so [ __ ] good he's good </joey>
<joey> evil yeah he's good don't get me wrong </joey>
<joey> but it's not the best samuel jackson </joey>
<joey> role </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] role he does is amazing like </connor>
<joey> samuel jackson kills it and everything </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i get that but like i think </joey>
<joey> his role in like jackie brown was 100 </joey>
<joey> times better </joey>
<joey> i just i just think i had more fun </joey>
<joey> watching one like jackie brown and like </joey>
<connor> even kill bill over django </connor>
<connor> i i just i don't think pulp fiction was </connor>
<joey> that good </joey>
<joey> how dare you </joey>
<connor> wow yeah i think it was fine there was </connor>
<garnt> just like there was too many scenes </garnt>
<garnt> where i was actually bored during pulp </garnt>
<garnt> fiction </garnt>
<garnt> like i the scene when they're at the </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant just talking it was i was </garnt>
<garnt> bored out of my mind what you mean the </garnt>
<garnt> one at the end no no in the start and </garnt>
<garnt> the start </garnt>
<garnt> not right not the diner the restaurant </garnt>
<joey> where they're like uh were they doing </joey>
<joey> like milkshakes with john travolta oh </joey>
<joey> jack rabbits yeah i can't [ __ ] that </joey>
<joey> seems [ __ ] great i just think john </joey>
<connor> travolta is like not a good actor i i </connor>
<joey> think he's not good i mean i don't know </joey>
<connor> if one of these mistakes though no john </connor>
<joey> is a badass no no okay john travolta is </joey>
<connor> very much samuel jackson carries like </connor>
<connor> you it's so obvious because when samuel </connor>
<joey> jackson isn't withdrawn to walter </joey>
<garnt> johnsonville sucks okay in my opinion </garnt>
<garnt> john scenes were there without those two </garnt>
<joey> together yeah well there weren't many </joey>
<joey> like one or two but like and he was </joey>
<joey> terrible i think john travolta is </joey>
<connor> terrible but john travolta is one of </connor>
<joey> those actors where like </joey>
<garnt> i feel have you seen his recent movies </garnt>
<garnt> no but that's because okay the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why recent john travolta movies he's </garnt>
<garnt> clearly like has just been type casted </garnt>
<garnt> as the bad guy because of pulp fiction </garnt>
<joey> because before pulp fiction </joey>
<joey> john travolta just did all the grease </joey>
<joey> lightning movies right so he literally </joey>
<joey> went further he was in greece he </joey>
<joey> literally went from this like sing-songy </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> so suddenly playing as this like badass </joey>
<joey> gangster right and because of the </joey>
<joey> success of pulp fiction all the movie </joey>
<joey> industry was like we need a bad guy </joey>
<joey> who's also like kind of quirky and </joey>
<joey> charming on the surface but is actually </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up on the inside john travolta i </joey>
<garnt> mean like pulp fiction isn't my favorite </garnt>
<joey> tarantino movie </joey>
<joey> i mean i put it on his reservoir </joey>
<garnt> like i i still would put like i i really </garnt>
<connor> love glorious bastards yeah um would you </connor>
<connor> saying glorious masters is better than </connor>
<garnt> pulp fiction do you do you </garnt>
<garnt> i'd say it's about the same </garnt>
<joey> i think glorious bastards is good it's </joey>
<joey> better than pulp fiction but for </joey>
<garnt> different reasons yeah i i do agree with </garnt>
<garnt> you where there are some parts of pulp </garnt>
<joey> fiction that did drag but when like i </joey>
<connor> feel like the highs of pulp fiction are </connor>
<joey> just they're like the best tarantino can </joey>
<garnt> do yeah uh kill bill is i feel like one </garnt>
<garnt> of his most i love different movies yeah </garnt>
<joey> kill build is clearly the movie where </joey>
<joey> tarantino was like i like anime by the </joey>
<joey> way yeah i love it </joey>
<connor> i really like anime i really like japan </connor>
<connor> it's so cool i just love it everything </connor>
<joey> about the movie is just so fun i mean </joey>
<joey> like yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> is [ __ ] awesome </connor>
<joey> i love the scene with uh uh what's the </joey>
<joey> name kuriyama who did gogo hibari with </joey>
<joey> like the chain thing that's so good i </joey>
<joey> love that i just love [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> when like um </garnt>
<joey> goku kibara comes out like swinging the </joey>
<garnt> the that sucks and then turns around </garnt>
<joey> she's like go go danny </joey>
<joey> that scene [ __ ] kills me every time </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i feel like on an aesthetic </garnt>
<garnt> level there's a few that are as iconic </garnt>
<connor> as kill builds </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and also uh the restaurant is </connor>
<joey> still like open in tokyo yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> like going there and like seeing it and </joey>
<joey> be like [ __ ] yeah it's so cool when </joey>
<joey> you go to that restaurant you're also </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] how did they make this happen </connor>
<joey> it's definitely like a culturally </joey>
<garnt> significant movie i mean i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> for the record all of quinton tarantino </garnt>
<garnt> movies are [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> uh i just feel like kill bill is like </garnt>
<garnt> the most different i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> especially in terms of tarantino movies </garnt>
<garnt> volume two was felt me way more like a </garnt>
<joey> tarantino movie either i dead ass don't </joey>
<joey> even remember what happens in volume two </joey>
<garnt> she [ __ ] kills bill joey </garnt>
<joey> joey how do you spoil joey i can't </joey>
<garnt> believe it's spoiled kill bill it's </garnt>
<connor> literally literally there in the title </connor>
<joey> i've re-watched the first one so many </joey>
<connor> times i've barely watched the second one </connor>
<joey> i don't know why i don't know it's just </joey>
<joey> like i've definitely seen kill bill </joey>
<joey> volume 2 a couple of times i just don't </joey>
<joey> remember what happened other than the </joey>
<garnt> titular i mean i would say that the only </garnt>
<garnt> film i mean the only seeing out kill </garnt>
<garnt> bill that really sticks out to my mind </garnt>
<connor> is the one at the end of kill bill </connor>
<connor> volume one which is her against that's </connor>
<connor> oh lucy lou right </connor>
<connor> no not lucy liu the one with her against </connor>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] what the name of the uh </garnt>
<garnt> gang that she fights </garnt>
<connor> that's not the end the crazy 88 yeah </connor>
<connor> that's like in the middle no that's like </connor>
<garnt> right before the end right before the </garnt>
<connor> end is when she he she fights lucy liu </connor>
<garnt> yeah that's the ending yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah so the one so she fights the </connor>
<connor> crazy 88 before she </connor>
<connor> to me that is like the iconic scene of </connor>
<connor> the kill build </connor>
<joey> but i feel like overall i feel like the </joey>
<connor> second film was just a little bit better </connor>
<joey> um i felt like i have to rewatch it </joey>
<joey> honestly yeah i have to i think so what </joey>
<garnt> why is this your favorite tarantino </garnt>
<connor> movie then i don't know again i think </connor>
<connor> it's just how unique it is and how </connor>
<connor> stylized like this i don't you don't </connor>
<joey> really get a movie like it anymore i </joey>
<connor> don't know yeah definitely not it's just </connor>
<joey> such a good movie i feel i feel like </joey>
<joey> this is the only successful live-action </joey>
<joey> anima adaptation you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> where it's like this feels like it was </joey>
<garnt> based off of i know you had actual </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] anime in it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> by production yeah yeah that's [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> badass yeah </garnt>
<joey> the whole law when they build it up yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah oh my god it's just so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<joey> everything about that film is just like </joey>
<connor> him just like just saying hey guys i'm a </connor>
<connor> weeb and like you said but yeah but but </connor>
<connor> in a good way yeah in a way that you're </connor>
<joey> like okay it's definitely done from like </joey>
<garnt> a place of like respect yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's just it's just like you you watch </joey>
<joey> this and you just feel like this is just </joey>
<joey> fun yeah it's great this is just a </joey>
<garnt> director having [ __ ] things it's </garnt>
<joey> definitely the most like turn your brain </joey>
<joey> off type of time but it's the best kind </joey>
<joey> it's the best </joey>
<joey> because you don't need to turn your </joey>
<joey> brain off to appreciate this movement </joey>
<joey> yeah but at the same time it's that it </joey>
<connor> follows that kind of same style yeah </connor>
<joey> where you don't have to think much but </joey>
<garnt> everything about this just has impact </garnt>
<garnt> yeah absolutely right impact impacts i </garnt>
<joey> definitely agree kill bills </joey>
<connor> i just want to re-watch it now honestly </connor>
<garnt> it's been a while um </garnt>
<garnt> boys honestly honestly i i know you put </garnt>
<garnt> this on because you thought that we i </garnt>
<garnt> was going to like </garnt>
<garnt> rub or just [ __ ] destroy you for it </garnt>
<garnt> but i'm glad someone put adam sandler </garnt>
<joey> listen click i love okay 100 percent </joey>
<connor> easily the best adam sandler film okay </connor>
<joey> okay like a film made by adam sat this </joey>
<joey> is made by him right like i think so </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah dude click is so good clink is </joey>
<joey> a really </joey>
<garnt> really good movie </garnt>
<garnt> i still cry at the end of click every </garnt>
<garnt> single goddamn actually i was like </garnt>
<garnt> family </garnt>
<joey> that's all i can remember i was really </joey>
<garnt> really close to putting uh 50 first </garnt>
<garnt> dates on my own </garnt>
<joey> no click is actually good </joey>
<connor> click is one of those movies that gets </connor>
<joey> so much bad rap but like i actually </joey>
<joey> think it's like come on it's pretty it's </joey>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] it's a very it's handler </joey>
<connor> has a bad rap but of course there's some </connor>
<connor> there's some scenes in there you're like </connor>
<connor> all right adam come on yeah but then </connor>
<connor> there's also so many moments you're like </connor>
<joey> holy [ __ ] this is actually like a a </joey>
<connor> really good [ __ ] take on </connor>
<joey> your life and and missing out on yeah </joey>
<connor> especially the second half where it </connor>
<connor> starts to get really serious i'm just </connor>
<connor> like oh my god this is not the direction </connor>
<joey> i was expecting it to go so good yeah </joey>
<joey> like it shows that like when adam </joey>
<joey> sandler wants to [ __ ] act he brings </joey>
<joey> his [ __ ] name i was like wow he </joey>
<joey> he can act </joey>
<joey> again this is like why watching uncut </joey>
<connor> gems is like all the [ __ ] parts of click </connor>
<connor> are like not there right and just just </connor>
<connor> great [ __ ] acting from adam sandler </connor>
<garnt> and like it's just it's amazing </garnt>
<garnt> i just feel like people forget that i </garnt>
<joey> think adam sandler actually made good </joey>
<joey> films i i i like a lot like like i feel </joey>
<connor> like click was might might be his like </connor>
<connor> last great film or last good film </connor>
<garnt> because i remember he just like fell off </garnt>
<connor> a cliff after a certain point but </connor>
<connor> now he just makes he's openly admitted </connor>
<garnt> that he makes movies on um basically if </garnt>
<garnt> he can go to a vacation on the </garnt>
<connor> place because his production what a </connor>
<connor> powerful thing because the movies that </connor>
<joey> he makes his production companies yeah </joey>
<connor> so he just picks places he can go on </connor>
<garnt> vacation </garnt>
<garnt> i think there's a lot of good adam </garnt>
<garnt> sandler movies that i really enjoy like </garnt>
<joey> uh has anyone seen anger management yeah </joey>
<joey> i've really really enjoyed something </joey>
<joey> jack nicholson </joey>
<joey> oh my god that's such a good film that's </joey>
<joey> a great one like he has such a bad rep </joey>
<joey> but i [ __ ] these like his films </joey>
<joey> defined a lot of like the early 2000s </joey>
<joey> comedy i </joey>
<connor> so [ __ ] stupid like in a bed bath </connor>
<joey> beyond he gets </joey>
<joey> like he's like yeah he's like a security </joey>
<connor> guard bed bath and beyonce there's so </connor>
<connor> many [ __ ] childish jokes like when he </connor>
<connor> farts on the guy and stuff and then fast </connor>
<connor> forwards in the room like that's just so </connor>
<connor> dumb because like they actually hit so </connor>
<connor> many good [ __ ] emotional notes </connor>
<connor> i wish they didn't [ __ ] sully with </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] but it's actually a good movie </connor>
<connor> i love it it's so good although to be </connor>
<joey> fair the scene where he like smacks the </joey>
<joey> boss in the face and then plays and </joey>
<joey> there's like whoa i just had a massive </joey>
<joey> headache like that scene is still really </joey>
<joey> funny yeah yeah there's some good moves </joey>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> i have never seen catch me if you can </joey>
<garnt> you haven't no oh my god it's a movie </garnt>
<joey> it's so good it's a movie i've heard so </joey>
<connor> many times i think it is the best lean </connor>
<joey> out of the capri film yeah that's all </joey>
<garnt> i've heard from people and then there's </garnt>
<connor> tom hanks in it as well i mean i mean </connor>
<garnt> tom hanks is just a [ __ ] delight yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i feel like it's </garnt>
<connor> what do you think is when you think </connor>
<connor> leonardo dicaprio what movie comes to </connor>
<garnt> your mind i i don't think i'll catch me </garnt>
<garnt> if you can no </garnt>
<garnt> i think tom hanks for this one yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think of him for it but then also </garnt>
<garnt> when i think of it it uses like </garnt>
<joey> everything that leonardo dicaprio </joey>
<connor> especially at that point in his life </connor>
<garnt> actually what movie do you think of when </garnt>
<garnt> you say leonardo dicaprio probably now </garnt>
<joey> wolf of wall street yeah i think </joey>
<joey> now oh really i think it's shutter </joey>
<connor> yeah i feel like leonardo dicaprio has </connor>
<connor> evolved quite a lot during his time </connor>
<garnt> because he's been acting since like </garnt>
<garnt> remember when he remember when he was </garnt>
<garnt> the titanic boy yeah right nobody knew </garnt>
<connor> him for anything else but titanic but </connor>
<connor> like i feel like when he did this movie </connor>
<connor> it like perfectly </connor>
<joey> captured at that age what he was best at </joey>
<joey> doing was playing like the sexy young </joey>
<joey> guy yeah and he's so [ __ ] good in </joey>
<joey> this movie and i love it </joey>
<connor> i could if you need to watch this movie </connor>
<joey> it's no no i do it's this is one of </joey>
<joey> those movies that i've heard people </joey>
<connor> talking about for years now yeah and </connor>
<connor> i've just never found and it's based on </connor>
<connor> a true story i like the guy the guy the </connor>
<connor> biopic and the guy is the guy who is </connor>
<garnt> actually based on has done like google </garnt>
<garnt> talks now and about how he i think he's </garnt>
<connor> done work he said he did like work for </connor>
<connor> the fbi afterwards </connor>
<garnt> i think he was in this movie or at least </garnt>
<joey> he was a producer yeah because like i </joey>
<joey> have i've purposely like not looked into </joey>
<joey> this film because i feel like i just </joey>
<joey> want to go into a blind yeah just watch </joey>
<joey> it they got it's such a good story and </joey>
<connor> although obviously it's dramatized it is </connor>
<joey> based on a real event and it's so good </joey>
<garnt> because like if i was to actually do a </garnt>
<garnt> three by three with like my top favorite </garnt>
<garnt> movies of all time there would </garnt>
<joey> definitely also be a tom hanks movie in </joey>
<joey> there oh dude my castaway would be like </joey>
<garnt> i i had only seen castaway recently and </garnt>
<garnt> it it was one of the few movies </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i only saw it recently right um but </garnt>
<garnt> it was one of the few movies where </garnt>
<garnt> despite how much hype had gone into it </garnt>
<connor> yeah i thought it was as good yeah it </connor>
<garnt> lived up to everything it's i thought it </garnt>
<connor> was an amazing [ __ ] film amazing if </connor>
<connor> you can is more of a leonardo dicaprio </connor>
<connor> film than a tom hanks film i feel like </connor>
<joey> it's half and half </joey>
<joey> to me it's two big names yeah it's two </joey>
<connor> very big names and i feel like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it is leonardo dicaprio he he does do </connor>
<connor> really well in it and i feel like it </connor>
<connor> just him and tom hanks it's it's both of </connor>
<joey> them in that film where with castaways </joey>
<joey> tom hanks and uh what's the other </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] massive tom tom hanks film that </joey>
<joey> green mile not green mile green mile's </joey>
<joey> also good </joey>
<joey> mom yeah he plays the main security </joey>
<joey> guard he's incredible </joey>
<joey> uh forrest gump oh [ __ ] what a what </joey>
<garnt> an amazing film no that would probably </garnt>
<joey> be like in my heart also saving private </joey>
<joey> ryan as well yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> he's everything he's in he's good toy </garnt>
<garnt> story hello anything </garnt>
<garnt> anything that man is in is a good film </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i just feel like he's the world's </joey>
<joey> dad i don't know like so </joey>
<garnt> tom hanks this is daddy [ __ ] kidding </garnt>
<connor> me oh my god i feel like we should </connor>
<connor> explain some of the plots of these stars </connor>
<garnt> i'm sure i just feel like these are such </garnt>
<garnt> like big movies there everyone should </garnt>
<connor> know them </connor>
<connor> if you can if you haven't seen it uh </connor>
<garnt> it's about a guy who uh pretends to be a </garnt>
<connor> pilot </connor>
<garnt> and that's it that's literally it and </garnt>
<garnt> the about a detective trying to find him </garnt>
<joey> that's not what it's about oh it's kind </joey>
<joey> of it it's what i don't want to i don't </joey>
<joey> want to spoil too much yeah yeah don't </joey>
<connor> go too into i don't want to give you </connor>
<joey> more information i just know it's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing film and i need to watch </joey>
<connor> it that's like i mean it's that but it's </connor>
<connor> not but just watch it like it's that's </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<joey> that's like that's like saying like </joey>
<joey> sixth sense is about a divorce </joey>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<joey> it's it's about it's the real life story </joey>
<garnt> of a con artist right that's pretty much </garnt>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> okay and then okay i appreciate the fact </joey>
<joey> that you put willy wonka in the </joey>
<joey> chocolate factory but the og one yeah </joey>
<connor> the og one the new one sucks yeah the </connor>
<joey> new one i think it's got its 50th </joey>
<joey> anniversary this year yeah damn already </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] i just love this movie i can </joey>
<joey> want like as a from a young age to now </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] gene wilder is like such a </garnt>
<garnt> goddamn good actor holy [ __ ] this </garnt>
<garnt> movie's good i mean it's it's also [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> his granddad bro [ __ ] his granddad </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's a classic movie for a reason </garnt>
<connor> right i mean um i've already mentioned </connor>
<connor> the truman show as well which is </connor>
<connor> my favorite jim carrey movie as well why </connor>
<garnt> are there so many </garnt>
<garnt> like what are so many comedy actors like </garnt>
<garnt> that are just like actual just really </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] good actors understand emotions </connor>
<connor> well to be </connor>
<joey> like funny i think but jim carr is such </joey>
<connor> a [ __ ] good actor when he decides to </connor>
<joey> act sorry i feel sorry for that man he </joey>
<garnt> seems like he has a lot of problems yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah but i feel like comedy actors </connor>
<garnt> normally do have that problem i really i </garnt>
<garnt> really want to re-watch the truman show </garnt>
<connor> now because i want to because the whole </connor>
<connor> the entire premise of the truman show is </connor>
<connor> that it's just </connor>
<connor> is it a twist can i spoil it i think </connor>
<connor> everyone knows what it is okay well you </connor>
<connor> don't want the twisters you should know </connor>
<connor> what the twist is yeah so it follows the </connor>
<garnt> story of this guy whose entire life has </garnt>
<garnt> just been broadcasted it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just his life is a reality they've </garnt>
<connor> made a world around this man yeah to </connor>
<joey> make a tv show this was a black mirror </joey>
<joey> episode before black mirror was a thing </joey>
<garnt> basically yeah yeah this is basically </garnt>
<garnt> just irl twitch before irl twitch was a </garnt>
<connor> thing and now it is a thing but like </connor>
<connor> except that in the movie he doesn't want </connor>
<connor> to be filmed yeah but i will twitch </connor>
<garnt> people like yeah let's do it okay so so </garnt>
<garnt> you you remember ludwig uh ludwig's </garnt>
<connor> subathon just imagine that from like </connor>
<connor> birth but he didn't know yeah but he did </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> um but that's the truman show and it's </garnt>
<connor> just a [ __ ] amazing great movie i'd </connor>
<connor> love to see the truman show except where </connor>
<connor> truman is just a horrible person because </connor>
<connor> truman is this is a nice guy yeah what </connor>
<joey> if truman did things that got him </joey>
<joey> canceled all the time you know would </joey>
<joey> people still watch the show with the </joey>
<joey> raiders go down how would they fix the </joey>
<joey> ratings if truman was going around just </joey>
<joey> gets canceled yeah just getting canceled </joey>
<connor> they're like [ __ ] we gotta we gotta </connor>
<joey> interfere we're gonna we gotta really </joey>
<connor> um and then we joked about no country </connor>
<connor> for old man yeah i [ __ ] love this </connor>
<joey> film it's a great film it's just one of </joey>
<joey> those films that's like yes i'm a movie </joey>
<connor> critic wow i think it's based on my list </connor>
<connor> that you could say that about me but i </connor>
<connor> do think that no country forward man was </connor>
<connor> the first film where i was like wait you </connor>
<connor> can just like make things this ambiguous </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i mean like </joey>
<joey> it's also not easy as [ __ ] yeah i do </joey>
<joey> like my very uh kind of open-ended </joey>
<joey> ambiguous films you know memento was one </joey>
<connor> of them </connor>
<connor> you know you don't really have a film </connor>
<connor> where you follow the main character </connor>
<connor> often that that acts behaves in this </connor>
<joey> cold way yeah that you're also like </joey>
<joey> you're like come on tell me something </joey>
<connor> yeah and they just don't tell you </connor>
<joey> anything i just let you follow the other </joey>
<joey> film that's even remotely like that is </joey>
<joey> maybe like american psycho maybe yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah but every single like you know </connor>
<joey> when you re-watch this movie so many </joey>
<joey> times and then you go and watch like </joey>
<joey> people watched it a lot yeah i've cause </joey>
<garnt> it used to be on channel four all the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] tv yeah i did didn't know so i </garnt>
<garnt> used to watch it all the [ __ ] time </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 ad breaks in between yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> like you know you'd watch this movie and </garnt>
<joey> then you'd read about it yeah and you'd </joey>
<garnt> be like oh that's what that was about </garnt>
<joey> and then you go back and go and watch it </joey>
<joey> yeah oh [ __ ] i was exactly the same with </joey>
<joey> and i was debating when to put it on but </joey>
<garnt> i was like no my three by three is </garnt>
<garnt> already pretentious </garnt>
<garnt> i was i was gonna put multiple and drive </garnt>
<joey> oh my god oh my [ __ ] great film buddy </joey>
<joey> great film great films </joey>
<garnt> david lynch is one of my favorite </garnt>
<joey> directors i was like i don't want this </joey>
<connor> to be more pretentious that's what i was </connor>
<garnt> thinking as well there's so many things </garnt>
<garnt> in no country for all men that i just </garnt>
<garnt> love so much this day like the fact that </garnt>
<connor> he just decides sometimes to flip a coin </connor>
<garnt> no i was i was to kill them yeah and he </garnt>
<connor> went through with it like if it if he </connor>
<connor> genuinely went heads he wouldn't like it </connor>
<connor> wouldn't kill them and it's like holy </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] this man is insane yeah like i i've </garnt>
<garnt> gone through this like recent phase of </garnt>
<connor> just like instead of watching movies </connor>
<joey> again i just rewatch clips from movies </joey>
<connor> and for some reason like because i watch </connor>
<joey> one another iconic clip gets recommended </joey>
<joey> and like i remember just re-watching the </joey>
<connor> gas station scene </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] what a good scene i think out </connor>
<garnt> of like the entire history of movies in </garnt>
<garnt> terms of like tension i can't think of a </garnt>
<connor> better scene than that i mean just such </connor>
<connor> a good actor as well i can't remember </connor>
<connor> the main man because he's done oh he did </connor>
<connor> he was the one of the villain in the </connor>
<connor> bond movies yeah yeah yeah but he's </connor>
<connor> terrifying yeah he's so good in this </connor>
<garnt> eyes man i know right yes </garnt>
<garnt> cold-blooded eyes </garnt>
<garnt> every single </garnt>
<connor> dialogue moment that he has with anyone </connor>
<connor> is just like oh my god it's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> terrifying that's funny that's funny you </joey>
<joey> say you go back and like watch movie </joey>
<connor> clips of like iconic movies because i </connor>
<joey> have that exact thing with uh the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] court scene and there will be </joey>
<connor> blood </connor>
<joey> where like daniel day lewis is like </joey>
<connor> doing that like insane monologue at the </connor>
<joey> courtroom and i'm like holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i need to go back and watch this movie </joey>
<joey> but i can't be [ __ ] again i've </joey>
<garnt> actually actually like there's there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's been the phase now where because </garnt>
<garnt> i've been watching a lot of movie clips </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i just watch clips from movies </garnt>
<connor> i haven't seen yeah yeah and then i end </connor>
<connor> up just psychopath huh psychopath </connor>
<connor> no because like it gets recommended and </connor>
<connor> like it's a good clickbait title i'm </connor>
<connor> like damn that was a good scene and then </connor>
<connor> i watched another clip and another clip </connor>
<connor> and i feel like there's a lot of people </connor>
<connor> doing this now because i go to the </connor>
<connor> comments section </connor>
<connor> i go to the comment section and it's </connor>
<garnt> just like i feel like it's the person </garnt>
<garnt> it's people who have gone through the </garnt>
<garnt> exact same algorithm journey as me </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember going through the </garnt>
<garnt> comment section and it's just i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i've watched this entire movie now </garnt>
<joey> just through clips and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> that's just that's exactly what i did </joey>
<connor> those poor cinema directors yeah right </connor>
<connor> pour their heart out to make a cohesive </connor>
<connor> story that's well paid and you </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] go on youtube and watch </connor>
<connor> clips we're literally </connor>
<connor> yeah i [ __ ] love that movie like i </connor>
<garnt> can re-watch it as many times yeah i </garnt>
<joey> mean watch no country old man it's a </joey>
<garnt> very good that's a great film or just </garnt>
<garnt> watch the gas station scene on youtube </garnt>
<joey> no don't do that with the zero context </joey>
<joey> and just be very confused and be very </joey>
<garnt> confused why this guy is asking this </garnt>
<garnt> other guy to flip a coin it's still a </garnt>
<joey> great just it's still a great scene even </joey>
<connor> after the [ __ ] dialogue he asks </connor>
<connor> people is like the things he asks people </connor>
<garnt> are so creepy the thing that stands out </garnt>
<connor> to me in that film wasn't the dialogue </connor>
<connor> but it's when he puts down the candy </connor>
<connor> wrapper yeah and it just like expands </connor>
<connor> for like a little bit too long and i've </connor>
<garnt> never i've never been so tense hearing </garnt>
<garnt> just a candy wrapper expand i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] man it's also the </garnt>
<connor> coolest weapon ever used in a movie yeah </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah oh [ __ ] gas canisters yeah so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] cool because you're like oh this </connor>
<connor> is badass but [ __ ] he's terrifying but </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah this is cool though really </joey>
<joey> scary i forgot tommy lee jones in that </joey>
<connor> movie as well yeah he's the main um guy </connor>
<connor> trying to get him right yeah yeah stuff </connor>
<connor> like the detective or police guy </connor>
<connor> whatever the sheriff yeah the sheriff </connor>
<garnt> that's right yeah so then of course last </garnt>
<garnt> of all we've got uh ip man </garnt>
<joey> one of the best if not the best martial </joey>
<joey> arts movie especially in the past yeah i </joey>
<joey> can agree with that yeah there's a lot </joey>
<joey> of i mean you know i'm sure a lot of </joey>
<joey> people who are massive martial arts buff </joey>
<connor> would argue there's a lot of the earlier </connor>
<connor> films like some of the gently early </connor>
<connor> stuff some of jackie chan's earlier </connor>
<connor> stuff this happened to gently he just </connor>
<joey> kind of disappeared she's kind of jetted </joey>
<joey> so far as far as i know </joey>
<garnt> as far as the [ __ ] out so as far as i </garnt>
<garnt> know what happened with jet li is that </garnt>
<garnt> after fearless which was the 2008 yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which which i thought was a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing like he's supposed to be his </garnt>
<garnt> last that was supposed to be his last </garnt>
<garnt> like epic right um martial arts film and </garnt>
<connor> uh it was kind of well received it was </connor>
<connor> it was it's like a very seven six out of </connor>
<garnt> ten film all right i thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> really good i was it was actually like i </garnt>
<garnt> think it's really underrated for a </garnt>
<garnt> gentleman i mean his his older stuff is </garnt>
<connor> just way better yeah i know </connor>
<garnt> but in terms of modern stuff you know </garnt>
<garnt> and that was supposed to be his last one </garnt>
<joey> and then what ended up happening was </joey>
<joey> that the expendables were like money um </joey>
<joey> so that was actually like that's right </joey>
<joey> so that was like that was like his last </joey>
<joey> action film and since then he kind of </joey>
<garnt> said that as far as i know he kind of </garnt>
<garnt> quit doing uh big uh big martial arts </garnt>
<garnt> films yeah because i think it's just too </garnt>
<garnt> intense like it's a lot because you have </garnt>
<connor> to remember those scenes like </connor>
<connor> choreograph is that insane </connor>
<joey> i just i just remember the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> expendables movie like yeah i was like </connor>
<joey> talk about the most like wanker-ish </joey>
<joey> movie it's like let's just get as many </joey>
<joey> big people yeah </joey>
<joey> i actually watched it not too long ago </joey>
<connor> because you recommend yeah did you like </connor>
<joey> it yeah it's really [ __ ] good i mean </joey>
<connor> i love gently it's got one of my </connor>
<connor> favorite fight scenes there's any uh the </connor>
<connor> fighting the japanese and the karate </connor>
<connor> like ten of them and he's like back to </connor>
<garnt> that scene i think it's like the best </garnt>
<garnt> one of the best [ __ ] martial art </garnt>
<garnt> scenes of all time </garnt>
<garnt> talking about clips you can rewatch on </garnt>
<connor> youtube rewatched that yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> okay to be fair all right yeah that's </connor>
<joey> fair enough you can watch kung fu fights </joey>
<joey> but like you can't watch that scene for </joey>
<connor> no questions </connor>
<joey> it's so good it's just like so the story </joey>
<garnt> of it man is uh it's about when uh japan </garnt>
<garnt> is invading uh china um way back and </garnt>
<garnt> then </garnt>
<garnt> i think there's a there's a scene where </garnt>
<garnt> uh but once they've invaded they're like </garnt>
<connor> oh well you know japanese karate or </connor>
<garnt> something is the superior so bring your </garnt>
<joey> bring your chinese uh people to practice </joey>
<joey> with yeah </joey>
<joey> that's literally what it is it's like if </joey>
<joey> you win you get a bag of rice or </joey>
<joey> something yeah and he's like i'll take </joey>
<joey> on ten of you and okay it's kind of </joey>
<connor> cheesy but it is epic but it's so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] epic and they like snaps their </connor>
<joey> legs doing it it's insane i feel that i </joey>
<joey> feel that that kind of cheesiness though </joey>
<joey> in martial arts films is what makes a </joey>
<garnt> martial art yeah it totally is i feel </garnt>
<connor> like it set this that scene alone it set </connor>
<joey> the stakes perfectly where it's just </joey>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] i'm ready to see him [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] up yeah and he just takes on ten </garnt>
<garnt> black belts </garnt>
<connor> that's not even like the end of the film </connor>
<connor> though it's like halfway through yeah </connor>
<garnt> but unless it's but it's the best fight </garnt>
<garnt> it's the best fight of the franchise </garnt>
<joey> right because i remember when uh because </joey>
<joey> the previous guy he fought like three </joey>
<joey> black belts and he's like [ __ ] i'll take </joey>
<joey> on all of you and it's just it's just </joey>
<joey> one of the few moments in film where </joey>
<connor> you're just like </connor>
<connor> i'm ready for this man i i know this </connor>
<garnt> would never happen yeah i i don't care </garnt>
<connor> how cheesy this is </connor>
<connor> especially like when you're like </connor>
<connor> uh would you so when i was like 16 when </connor>
<connor> i was watching all these movies i just i </connor>
<connor> legitimately thought like martial arts </connor>
<connor> like badass and i'm like dude this is </connor>
<connor> epic but obviously now with all the you </connor>
<connor> know the mma fighters that like fought </connor>
<connor> them and yeah now it's not so epic </connor>
<connor> because you're like okay the mma </connor>
<connor> fighters should kill these guys but when </connor>
<garnt> you're like 16 you think like oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> this is like the superior way of </joey>
<connor> fighting yeah yeah like this is epic oh </connor>
<joey> my god like it's so cool you strengthen </joey>
<connor> your speed and now yeah it's so [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> cool right </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah no not so much </garnt>
<garnt> but back then you're like oh my god this </garnt>
<garnt> is amazing yeah yeah there's a lot of </garnt>
<connor> martial like uh gently uh gently's </connor>
<connor> earlier staff is amazing obviously </connor>
<joey> jackie chan's earlier cinema </joey>
<connor> cinemagraphy is amazing as well love </connor>
<joey> like drunken master and stuff like that </joey>
<garnt> yeah such a good film </garnt>
<garnt> um what are some really good what's that </garnt>
<garnt> i forgot what jetley's high street film </garnt>
<connor> is called it's this </connor>
<connor> 1980s film it's really highly rated </connor>
<connor> uh is it fisted the dragon is it or </connor>
<garnt> enter the end of the dragon or something </garnt>
<joey> enter the dragons the bruce lee will oh </joey>
<connor> no sorry it's the </connor>
<joey> that's like his his like i think it has </joey>
<connor> like 100 percent of rotten tomatoes yeah </connor>
<joey> i say fist of fury but i'm pretty sure </joey>
<garnt> it's bruce lee that's pissed </garnt>
<garnt> with uh jetley is a really good one but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> it depends if you like martial arts film </garnt>
<garnt> where they use like wires like some </garnt>
<garnt> people don't like it when they do that </garnt>
<garnt> uh it's kind of up to you </garnt>
<connor> right yeah yeah i kind of prefer it when </connor>
<garnt> they're just like beating the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> genre </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i know it has a name it's like a </garnt>
<connor> firework why why why </connor>
<connor> it's not really martial arts but it is </connor>
<connor> martial arts yeah it's really good 2006. </connor>
<connor> i really liked hiro which had uh donnie </connor>
<connor> yen in it as well </connor>
<garnt> yeah anjali the story's so [ __ ] cool </garnt>
<joey> yeah i i think that story i feel like i </joey>
<joey> haven't really sat down and watched like </joey>
<connor> a lot of jet li films his stuff is </connor>
<connor> actually like really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> because daddy and donald uh hasn't have </connor>
<garnt> oh another one i think it's called uh it </garnt>
<garnt> might be called war or like warrior or </garnt>
<garnt> something it's like uh it's about like </garnt>
<joey> the three kingdoms or something in china </joey>
<joey> way back oh yeah like sangokshi warrior </joey>
<connor> yeah what is it called i think it's </connor>
<connor> called warrior might be called what just </connor>
<connor> warrior </connor>
<connor> and it's such a good fight </connor>
<garnt> yeah jetta is the main character and uh </garnt>
<garnt> it's like this uh </garnt>
<garnt> about how like a general uh got like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to spoil it but you should </garnt>
<connor> watch it it's really fun </connor>
<garnt> really really [ __ ] good and i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like um because i i didn't want to put </garnt>
<garnt> another martial arts film on uh </garnt>
<garnt> my three by three but i feel like one of </garnt>
<garnt> the few things southeast asians can be </garnt>
<connor> proud about are our [ __ ] martial arts </connor>
<connor> films because you know like the raid </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah pretty pretty much the only thing </connor>
<connor> of thai culture that's ever been like </connor>
<connor> popularized outside you know </connor>
<connor> um but yeah like i like i was you know </connor>
<connor> really happy to see like the </connor>
<connor> the wrong light is this </connor>
<joey> martial art films you know </joey>
<connor> you think of like you know it man it's </connor>
<connor> more like very clean the raid's really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good raids </connor>
<garnt> indonesian right yeah it's indonesia but </garnt>
<connor> directed by a welsh guy oh really it's a </connor>
<connor> wash guy who directs oh [ __ ] right yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's that the raid one or raid two i </garnt>
<garnt> think because i know you've donated raid </garnt>
<connor> to raid </connor>
<connor> who directed right one and two can you </connor>
<connor> check real quick i swear that's another </connor>
<joey> thing i've heard of that i've never seen </joey>
<garnt> the raid </garnt>
<connor> the raid one is like such a good premise </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah just get to the top of an </garnt>
<garnt> apartment building yeah that's it it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's basically just a fighting game </garnt>
<joey> it's basically just like double dragon </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's just double dragon just </garnt>
<connor> like the fighting's like the </connor>
<garnt> choreography is insane yeah gareth evans </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> the most welsh name on it </connor>
<connor> literally two welsh names got off the </connor>
<connor> name </connor>
<connor> fair enough it's like it's so bizarre </connor>
<connor> there's a welsh guy directing an </connor>
<joey> indonesian film oh yeah i do but it's </joey>
<joey> just like awesome like it's such a good </joey>
<joey> fight some cross-cultural pollination </joey>
<joey> look at us ty and while she here too </joey>
<garnt> but yeah i mean i yeah i [ __ ] love </garnt>
<garnt> fighting uh martial arts movies yeah </garnt>
<connor> i've watched nearly all of gently's </connor>
<connor> films i think i've watched most of them </connor>
<connor> i couldn't watch some of the older ones </connor>
<connor> because they were impossible to find </connor>
<garnt> online right um and i've watched i think </garnt>
<connor> all of donnie yen's films pre-ap man </connor>
<garnt> i haven't watched it man four i heard it </garnt>
<connor> was okay i've really liked it band four </connor>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<connor> yeah i actually it's my second favorite </connor>
<connor> maybe i'll watch it tonight because uh </connor>
<connor> because i feel like ip man four is just </connor>
<connor> three was the worst yeah i feel like if </connor>
<connor> man four was just it man two done better </connor>
<connor> yeah because my problem with it man two </connor>
<connor> is that the villain is just so comical </connor>
<connor> that i just couldn't take him seriously </connor>
<connor> let's characterize this character so the </connor>
<connor> whole selling point to like a western </connor>
<garnt> audience of uh ipman was just that it's </garnt>
<garnt> the guy who trained bruce lee yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's literally the selling point of </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah fair enough but he's supposed </garnt>
<connor> to be like a master or something yeah i </connor>
<joey> don't know i i mean that is a cool like </joey>
<joey> catch to be i mean that's </joey>
<connor> again i don't know how how true it is </connor>
<garnt> but it's an interesting </garnt>
<connor> made-up story maybe if it is i don't </connor>
<garnt> know if it's real or not </garnt>
<garnt> it's true it's a real character but the </garnt>
<garnt> events are fictional yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's normally how it goes yeah with </connor>
<joey> martial arts people it's kind of hard to </joey>
<connor> survive some of the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> but i mean like i'm sure they fought all </joey>
<joey> those people but they probably died </joey>
<joey> halfway through yeah i mean i don't i </joey>
<garnt> don't think you did fight 10 black belts </garnt>
<garnt> no no that's uh that's yeah probably uh </garnt>
<joey> probably dramatized unless he's like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] super saiyan but yeah there's </joey>
<connor> another donnie yen film that's actually </connor>
<connor> really good where he's like a detective </connor>
<connor> in a small town </connor>
<connor> uh i think in a village </connor>
<connor> and it's really good because it's like a </connor>
<connor> mystery of the martial arts and it's </connor>
<connor> just yeah it's pretty good i've got what </connor>
<connor> it's called again i've watched these </connor>
<connor> movies so long ago yeah it came after it </connor>
<garnt> man same with jackie chan as well some </garnt>
<connor> of his best works are when he was young </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] police story </garnt>
<joey> story is fantastic is that the scene </joey>
<garnt> where he jumps on the wire yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah it is completely real what's it </joey>
<joey> called what do you think about </joey>
<joey> flashpoint might be flashpoint yeah </joey>
<joey> i think it's flashpoint what's the po is </joey>
<connor> it yellow the poster the yellow one is </connor>
<joey> oh uh </joey>
<joey> oh wait uh we have the </joey>
<garnt> chinese name it's the one where he's a </garnt>
<garnt> teacher right </garnt>
<connor> maybe again i might have remembered it </connor>
<garnt> incorrectly because it's been so much </garnt>
<connor> big brother i have to go back to the </connor>
<connor> thing and watch it i might be </connor>
<garnt> misremembering i feel like one </garnt>
<garnt> underrated donnie yen film is i think is </garnt>
<garnt> spx or something like that what's he </garnt>
<garnt> what's the plot i i honestly i do not </garnt>
<joey> remember but i the only reason sps just </joey>
<joey> sounds like a law firm </joey>
<connor> let me let me because what happened was </connor>
<joey> that all right you're jack you're bruce </joey>
<connor> lee then you heard jackie chan and then </connor>
<connor> when jackie chan was getting older jet </connor>
<connor> li was making films yeah and then when </connor>
<connor> jetley was getting all that donnie yen </connor>
<connor> came in but i don't really know who it </connor>
<connor> is now who's like the main martial arts </connor>
<connor> guy </connor>
<connor> who is the main like face of martial </connor>
<connor> arts i don't even know him </connor>
<garnt> but he's supposed to retire yeah i think </garnt>
<garnt> he still is done again because he's in </garnt>
<garnt> the the new marvel film yeah but they </garnt>
<connor> also don't really utilize him much i </connor>
<garnt> mean he's the i mean he's the villain </garnt>
<joey> isn't it i feel like i feel just like </joey>
<joey> martial films of kind of just like a </joey>
<garnt> little bit of a dying breed almost in </garnt>
<garnt> like especially in the west i feel like </garnt>
<joey> i'm sure like you know if you go to asia </joey>
<connor> and south east asia they're still making </connor>
<connor> well i mean the past well the past like </connor>
<connor> 20 years have all been from china like </connor>
<connor> right it manages from uh china right </connor>
<connor> yeah um and then donnie yen is in rogue </connor>
<connor> one uh from star wars but again when i </connor>
<connor> was watching that movie and you could </connor>
<joey> see what donnie yen does yeah i'm kind </joey>
<joey> of disappointed because you're like </joey>
<joey> donnie ann is such a was so [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> and they barely use him he just swings a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] thing around yeah oh cool he's </joey>
<joey> blind </joey>
<joey> yeah a lot of people could have done </joey>
<joey> what donaian did in that film and i feel </joey>
<connor> like why if you're getting donnie yen </connor>
<connor> and he did he doesn't really speak much </connor>
<connor> in the film right because he i don't </connor>
<garnt> think he can speak much english yeah so </garnt>
<connor> all i'm saying is there hasn't been a </connor>
<garnt> rush hour or two yet there hasn't been a </garnt>
<joey> modern rush hour with johnny yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> honestly [ __ ] yeah and i i i i ice cube </garnt>
<joey> stupid </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> movie industry we just gave you a </joey>
<joey> million dollar idea donny in an ice cube </joey>
<joey> in rush hour </joey>
<joey> seven or whatever the next one is </joey>
<joey> oh my god i was thinking about what's sp </joey>
<connor> spl what that's the plot of that movie </connor>
<joey> can you tell me the plot spl well </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> yeah but i um there's one fight scene in </garnt>
<garnt> spl in sbl which is like completely just </garnt>
<connor> improvised yeah okay is it in the street </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's in the street </garnt>
<garnt> and it's such a [ __ ] good fight scene </garnt>
<garnt> and you and then because </garnt>
<garnt> the whole premise around this the whole </garnt>
<garnt> background around this fight scene is </garnt>
<garnt> that they train together these two these </garnt>
<joey> two actors uh donnie yen and i'm not </joey>
<joey> sure what the other person is but they </joey>
<joey> train together and because they were so </joey>
<joey> familiar with each other's fighting </joey>
<joey> style they literally just improvised </joey>
<joey> this fight scene with just so cool with </joey>
<joey> just this basic okay here's what's meant </joey>
<garnt> to happen but let's just try to kill </garnt>
<garnt> each other and then let's just get it on </garnt>
<garnt> film </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's so cool it's such a good </garnt>
<garnt> film as well </garnt>
<connor> it prepares a police detective who's </connor>
<connor> suffering from cancer and about to </connor>
<connor> retire resorts to illegal means in order </connor>
<connor> to capture ruthless tribes </connor>
<garnt> all i remember was there was a police </garnt>
<joey> detective in it i'm just like </joey>
<joey> that's that's like it's it's either like </joey>
<garnt> traditional like historical setting or </garnt>
<garnt> they're a police officer </garnt>
<joey> of course like a neo-noir crime drama </joey>
<garnt> um but i mean yeah like oh god how do </garnt>
<garnt> you like describe this three by three </garnt>
<garnt> it's like how did you describe any how </garnt>
<joey> did you describe any three by three </joey>
<connor> you could describe mine pretentious film </connor>
<connor> creature yeah pretentious pretentious </connor>
<joey> full </joey>
<garnt> oh love guilty pleasure </garnt>
<connor> something with wood with p </connor>
<garnt> yeah p </garnt>
<joey> y p because </joey>
<connor> uh pretentious potential powerful </connor>
<connor> uh poop pouring yeah </connor>
<garnt> um but yeah i guess those are our three </garnt>
<connor> by threes i hope you uh get to watch </connor>
<joey> some interesting movies if you haven't </joey>
<joey> seen some of these uh yeah please go and </joey>
<joey> watch all the movies i have some movie </joey>
<connor> recommendations that i will be watching </connor>
<connor> i guess now yeah i've honestly come out </connor>
<joey> with this with some movie </joey>
<connor> recommendations and this was actually </connor>
<joey> obviously i i always always got time we </joey>
<joey> know what we're doing after this </joey>
<joey> remember </joey>
<joey> sit down </joey>
<joey> but no i mean like i it feels good to be </joey>
<joey> able to talk about movies because i feel </joey>
<joey> like i don't get to talk about movies a </joey>
<joey> lot even though like i've i kind of </joey>
<garnt> realized whenever i talk about movies </garnt>
<garnt> i've seen a lot of movies and i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like you guys have seen a lot of movies </garnt>
<garnt> as well and we even like off camera we </garnt>
<garnt> don't really talk about movies in </garnt>
<joey> general i think i think it just has to </joey>
<joey> do with the fact that we haven't really </joey>
<joey> had time to just sit down and watch </joey>
<connor> something i've not watched movies in a </connor>
<connor> while yeah it's gotten i feel like i </connor>
<connor> don't know i feel like people don't </connor>
<connor> watch as many movies anymore yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> like if it's not on netflix then i </garnt>
<connor> probably haven't seen it but i'd say i </connor>
<connor> watched like 90 of the films i've seen </connor>
<connor> in like between the ages of like um </connor>
<joey> 18 and 14. yeah </joey>
<joey> i think that's usually like the period </joey>
<joey> in your life i'm gonna watch a lot of </joey>
<connor> movies when i discovered you could </connor>
<connor> google the movies and i was like holy </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> yeah i mean my dad used to collect like </joey>
<garnt> a shitload of dvds when like blockbuster </garnt>
<joey> was still a thing so like i just watched </joey>
<garnt> a lot of the movies with my dad yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i watch a lot less movies than i </garnt>
<garnt> do </garnt>
<connor> than i did before as well because now </connor>
<connor> it's just all been replaced by anime </connor>
<connor> right and uh a lot of anime movies </connor>
<connor> and youtube as well yeah but if you're </connor>
<connor> on youtube but i feel like if there's a </connor>
<connor> big enough movie then i probably have </connor>
<connor> seen it like i'm surprised no one put </connor>
<garnt> any marvel movies here uh </garnt>
<garnt> who's [ __ ] cares about marvel i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> care about marvel i i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> marvel's that one franchise where i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like hello i'm a normal yeah it's </connor>
<connor> fun but it's not like i never like i'm </connor>
<garnt> never like [ __ ] dude that made me think </garnt>
<connor> something that made me like yeah if i'm </connor>
<garnt> gonna watch it if i'm gonna watch this i </garnt>
<joey> know i was like really [ __ ] invested </joey>
<garnt> in infinity war end game i'll say that i </garnt>
<connor> didn't i didn't even watch those two </connor>
<garnt> end game was good but again it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> like i thought it was amazing but it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like sent that maybe like when i </garnt>
<connor> left the cinema </connor>
<connor> like a week later i don't think about </connor>
<garnt> endgame well so i'm surprised no one put </garnt>
<joey> john wick as well because i i thought i </joey>
<joey> was close </joey>
<joey> someone was going to put john wick on </joey>
<joey> john was just another one of those like </joey>
<joey> it's fun turn your brains out no no no </joey>
<garnt> no no it's it's [ __ ] no oh no i'm not </garnt>
<connor> saying it's a bad movie yeah john rick </connor>
<joey> is probably like my favorite action </joey>
<garnt> series it's it's like in in the west </garnt>
<connor> they have uh john wick and in the east </connor>
<connor> they have it man that's that's like </connor>
<garnt> it man is just like the uh asian </garnt>
<connor> equivalent of john wick dude man i just </connor>
<connor> i'm not man so i i it's holds a very </connor>
<garnt> dear place in my heart when i except </garnt>
<garnt> i've watched all the john wick movies in </garnt>
<garnt> cinema yeah and like i've watched the </garnt>
<garnt> last one that came out alone and it was </garnt>
<joey> the cinema was empty and i had like such </joey>
<joey> an amazing time watching that it was </joey>
<joey> like the last </joey>

<joey> up on the chair in front of me i had all </joey>
<connor> my popcorn and i just got to enjoy it </connor>
