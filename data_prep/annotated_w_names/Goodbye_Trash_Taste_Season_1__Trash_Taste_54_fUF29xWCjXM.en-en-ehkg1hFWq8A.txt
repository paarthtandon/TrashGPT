<garnt> - Can't believe "manoeuvre" has an O in it. </garnt>
<garnt> Who decided that? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> - Can't believe "manoeuvre" has an O in it. </connor>
<connor> Who decided that? </connor>
<connor> - Manoeuvre! </connor>
<joey> - I'm still reeling over this. </joey>
<joey> - I've deadass never seen that. </joey>
<joey> - I stopped trying to learn language a long time ago. </joey>
<garnt> (chill music plays) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another episode of "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<connor> And this is, this is I'd say a special one, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's the last episode you're gonna see </connor>
<connor> in this studio. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Chris's thing fell as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> Anyway. - Anyway. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - We definitely didn't script that bit. </joey>
<joey> - I'm your host for today, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> And with me are Joey and Connor. </joey>
<garnt> And, yeah, boys. </garnt>
<garnt> How are you doing? </garnt>
<connor> Sad to be moving out? </connor>
<garnt> - A little. </garnt>
<garnt> A little sad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just a very busy time right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've got so much to do with the new studio. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, all right, we gotta record one </garnt>
<connor> before we start the studio down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - We're probably gonna film a short little vlog </joey>
<joey> for "After Dark" as well, </joey>
<joey> which will hopefully be up by this time? </joey>
<joey> - It'll probably be out before this. </joey>
<joey> - So, go check out "After Dark." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> we are literally moving out tomorrow </garnt>
<garnt> after we film this today. </garnt>
<garnt> So, by the time this comes out, </garnt>
<garnt> this will probably be like four, three, four weeks after. </garnt>
<joey> - It still hasn't sunken in that we're moving out tomorrow. </joey>
<garnt> - It hasn't sunk in for me yet either. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just dreading having to redo everything </joey>
<connor> and set everything up. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, you know, we have a setup that works here </connor>
<connor> and everyone's like, "Why are you moving? </connor>
<garnt> "Why are you moving?" </garnt>
<connor> But you gotta mix it up. </connor>
<connor> You know, you gotta keep it fresh. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also, you'll see why we want to move </connor>
<connor> if you watch the "After Dark" vlog </connor>
<connor> because we have no fucking space in here. </connor>
<connor> I'm glad that I don't have to, like, </connor>
<connor> I dread whenever I'm the host </connor>
<garnt> 'cause people don't know the fucking obstacle course </garnt>
<garnt> you have to go around to get to this host chair. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel literally bad for every guest that comes </joey>
<garnt> to our show. - Yeah, we do have a- </garnt>
<joey> - Who has to like perform parkour to get to their seat. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of tripping hazards and yeah, </joey>
<joey> Ladybeard nearly tested the limits of our set </joey>
<connor> in multiple ways, not just the shelf behind you, </connor>
<connor> but all the wires and stuff. </connor>
<connor> That man was too large and in charge for those wires. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't imagine how the guest feels having to sit here </garnt>
<garnt> and having like, </garnt>
<garnt> what if you need to go to the toilet, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the reason, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> the reason I hate going on flights </garnt>
<garnt> and sitting on the window seat is I hate not being able </garnt>
<garnt> to access the toilet under my own will. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I, dude, I know now my limits of my own bladder. </joey>
<joey> So, now whenever I'm on a long flight, I'm like, aisle seat. </joey>
<garnt> Give me the aisle seat immediately. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have to look at the view. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen, I know what the outside of a plane looks like. </garnt>
<joey> - I know what sky looks like. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to look at sky. </joey>
<joey> I know what a city looks like from above. </joey>
<connor> - I will sacrifice, I will- </connor>
<garnt> - All right, hold up. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, this is gonna be our first topic for fun. </garnt>
<connor> Listen, okay, I am a firm window seat fan. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - I'll tell you why. </connor>
<connor> Because, right. </connor>
<connor> What's the biggest downside of being </connor>
<garnt> in the aisle, gentlemen? </garnt>
<garnt> What is it? Come on, there's gotta be one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Downside? </garnt>
<garnt> - There isn't. </garnt>
<garnt> That you don't see the view? </garnt>
<garnt> - There is one glaring gigantic annoying issue, </garnt>
<connor> and that is motherfucking people in the window </connor>
<connor> and middle seat wanting to get out. </connor>
<connor> And God forbid, they're fucking clumsy as shit </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "Oh!" </connor>
<joey> Like, fucking falling over everything, </joey>
<joey> and then they've got like 10 shit </joey>
<joey> that they got on their lap. </joey>
<joey> They got like the whole fucking family buffet and shit. </joey>
<joey> They got like 10 headphones, portable charger. </joey>
<joey> It's like, for fuck's sake, put it in your fucking bag. </joey>
<connor> They're trying to shimmy around. </connor>
<connor> Like, get that shit away from me. I want to go to the window </connor>
<connor> 'cause I want to sleep and I don't want to be disturbed. </connor>
<joey> - But you're okay with disturbing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> That just shows like the difference in mentality </connor>
<connor> 'cause I would rather, I'm fine with being disturbed. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Go to the toilet, man. </connor>
<garnt> "I know you need to." </garnt>
<connor> - His voice with that, "I'm fine with being disturbed." </connor>
<connor> Listen, I don't, okay. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if everyone else sees it the same way as I do </connor>
<connor> 'cause I know that I get annoyed by minor things. </connor>
<connor> My house could burn down and I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "That's fucking really inconvenient, now isn't it?" </connor>
<connor> But someone moves in the aisle seat, "For fuck's sake!" </connor>
<garnt> - No, because for me there's like a counter. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because I know how much I piss. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I'm glad that I don't need to worry </joey>
<joey> how much I piss on "Trash Taste" </joey>
<joey> 'cause I piss a lot on "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> But in the confines of an airplane, you are stuck there. </joey>
<connor> And you ask to go to the toilet once. </connor>
<connor> All right, that's reasonable, right? </connor>
<connor> Everyone has, everyone knows everyone needs to go </connor>
<connor> to the toilet. </connor>
<connor> But twice. </connor>
<connor> Okay, that's kinda pushing it, you know? </connor>
<garnt> What if I need to go three times when everyone's sleeping? </garnt>
<garnt> What if that just happens? </garnt>
<connor> - You're more worried about pissing them off? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm more worried about pissing them off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Picture it, you're on the aisle, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> What is the limit before you start to get annoyed </garnt>
<joey> with how many times people will get up to go and pee? </joey>
<joey> We're on a 12 hour flight. - For me, it doesn't matter </joey>
<connor> because no matter what, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna be pissing more than these two people combined. </joey>
<garnt> - For me, I never get pissed off </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, "I get it, man. </joey>
<connor> "I know the pain you're in. </connor>
<garnt> "I know the trouble you're in. </garnt>
<connor> "I got you, brother." </connor>
<connor> - That's my mentality, right? </connor>
<connor> The aisle people, </connor>
<garnt> the aisle chumps are used to being annoyed. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my theory, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So, I don't really feel bad about disturbing in the aisle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm fucking zen on the aisle, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - The middle seat you just lose. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, they already knew they lost. </garnt>
<garnt> - The middle seat is just the loser seat. </garnt>
<garnt> No one ever wants to sit in the middle seat. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that you're a fucking psychopath </garnt>
<garnt> if you actually choose to sit in the middle seat. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like, okay, well. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> the only time I don't give a about middle seat is </connor>
<joey> if we're on like an hour or two flight. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, that's fine. </joey>
<connor> - Literally I watch one Jason Statham movie and I'm there. </connor>
<connor> But, I mean, I do care on a 12 hour flight. </connor>
<joey> But you've already lost at that point, </joey>
<joey> and you should have pre-booked. </joey>
<joey> That's your fault. </joey>
<joey> - Right, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But do you ever do that gamble where you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I want the whole row to myself. </joey>
<joey> "This plane looks just empty enough </joey>
<garnt> "where I think I can pull this off." </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm gonna book just the middle seat </garnt>
<garnt> "in a clean row of three." </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I never. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do that. </garnt>
<garnt> I like to live life on the edge </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I know that, </garnt>
<garnt> what sick fuck is gonna wanna sit next to a madman </garnt>
<connor> that would willingly choose the aisle seat </connor>
<connor> in a row of three? </connor>
<connor> That should be like a danger sign. </connor>
<joey> - No, because what I do is that I get the safe seat </joey>
<joey> of just an aisle seat 'cause I know that no matter what, </joey>
<joey> even if that aisle was full, I get the extra leg room. </joey>
<joey> I get immediate access to the toilet. </joey>
<joey> I don't disturb anybody. </joey>
<joey> It's a win win. </joey>
<connor> But then the moment I get on the plane and I see, oh. </connor>
<connor> Not a lot of people waiting in this waiting room right now. </connor>
<joey> Then that's when I go like, </joey>
<joey> "So how many aisles are open today? </joey>
<joey> "How many aisles? "Can I sneak into one of those?" </joey>
<connor> And like I just ask, </connor>
<joey> and a lot of the times they're just like, "Yeah." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's when it's empty. </joey>
<connor> That's when it's empty. And also I don't ask, I just go. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - The moment the plane, like, the seatbelt things come on, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "That's a free aisle. </joey>
<joey> "That's mine." I could see other people on the plane. </joey>
<joey> I see their eyes looking at the free seats. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, it's mine." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - "Out of the way!" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - "Get down!" </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's the other benefit of being </connor>
<joey> in the aisle, right? </joey>
<connor> You immediately just go "Go now!" </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, I mean, it's rare that I'm on a plane </garnt>
<connor> where it's like, where there's an aisle there. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure the gamble you're making is </connor>
<connor> like fucking gacha odds, you know? </connor>
<connor> - I am talking about when the plane is like, </connor>
<joey> basically like 70 to 80% full. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Because, again like I said, no one... </joey>
<joey> If you were on the booking page of the plane, </joey>
<joey> you get to see the layout as you do, </joey>
<connor> you're not gonna sit next to the guy </connor>
<connor> who picked willingly the middle </connor>
<connor> because that's a bad sign. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't do that. </connor>
<connor> If I saw someone in the middle, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "He's a psychopath. </connor>
<connor> "That's a psychopath." </connor>
<joey> - He wants to "socialize" on the plane. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm like, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I'm not falling for this. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I'm not here to fucking socialize. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to join a cult today. </joey>
<garnt> I'm sure there'll be some cult. </garnt>
<connor> But then I don't mind going on the, </connor>
<connor> okay, so, again I'll do that gamble. </connor>
<connor> If it doesn't work out, I might (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I might go to like whoever's next to me like, </connor>
<connor> "You wanna swap? </connor>
<connor> "Wanna swap?" </connor>
<connor> - Do you actually? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Listen, I'm gonna sleep. </connor>
<connor> "Do you wanna swap?" </connor>
<connor> And then they're like, "Yeah." </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, how easily do you sleep on planes? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I remember when I was like- </joey>
<joey> - With great difficulty. </joey>
<joey> - With great difficulty? </joey>
<joey> So like for me, </joey>
<joey> sleeping on the window seat is actually less comfortable </joey>
<joey> than sleeping on the aisle seat as well. </joey>
<joey> Because- </joey>
<joey> - No, what? </joey>
<joey> - Because for some reason like you, </joey>
<joey> like, you know, your nature is, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can lean on the wall part, right? </joey>
<connor> But the wall of the plane is, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why it's just tilted at such an angle </connor>
<connor> where you can never get a comfortable leaning on that wall. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - This is why you bring a pillow. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what engineer designed it to make planes, </connor>
<connor> especially on the window seat, </connor>
<garnt> the most uncomfortable angle to lean your head by. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that is true. </joey>
<garnt> - It is so weird because I have no trouble sleeping on cars. </garnt>
<garnt> Cars, trains, any other kind of moving vehicle, </garnt>
<garnt> I sleep like a fucking baby. </garnt>
<garnt> Put me on a plane, and I'm like insomnia. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, insomnia speed runner. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just... </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I normally wear a hoodie and a jacket </connor>
<joey> no matter what the weather. </joey>
<connor> I'll use them as padding. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because it also gets fucking cold on the plane. </connor>
<joey> - Like, I need to be, </joey>
<joey> I need my head to be at least like a 45 degree angle. </joey>
<garnt> - That's called privilege. - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> Like, like, like- </joey>
<garnt> - How does sleeping in the aisle make this solution better? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I can't tilt my neck enough that it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's almost like horizontal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's how, I kind of go like the wall is here </garnt>
<garnt> and the seat is here. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of nestle into this corner. </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of like go in like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like for me, like I said, </garnt>
<garnt> my head needs to be like at at least a 45 degree angle. </garnt>
<garnt> So not, you know, not my entire body, </garnt>
<garnt> but at least my head, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> So, it feels at least like I'm lying down </garnt>
<garnt> even though I wake up, </garnt>
<garnt> I get fucking neck cramps or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - Just go business. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Like, at that point just go business. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly I have no problem just sleeping, </joey>
<connor> like, I just put my head down </connor>
<connor> and just sleep on my arms on my lap. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I can't do that. - I can do that. </joey>
<garnt> - I have attempted to do that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm too tall. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That sounds like a short person solution to me. </garnt>
<connor> - This is what happens when you're lower than 6', Garnt. </connor>
<joey> Just the world opens up to you. </joey>
<connor> It's like fucking origami. </connor>
<connor> - The 5'11" club over here. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly every time I go on a plane, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Damn, man, I wish I was a bit shorter." </garnt>
<connor> "I wish I was the 5'11" club." </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off. </connor>
<connor> "How's it feel to be short?" </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's the other benefit to being in the aisle seat, </joey>
<joey> right, is that you can stick your legs out </joey>
<connor> and actually stretch them out. </connor>
<joey> - No, you can't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can. </joey>
<joey> - You can do 10 minutes and the woman comes over, </joey>
<connor> she's like, "Hey, put your fucking legs in." </connor>
<connor> Or the cart comes by, and you're legs get fucking cut off. </connor>
<joey> - No, I'm like fucking right up against the seat though, </joey>
<connor> so it just slides past. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I don't know, man. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a Jackie Chan film. </joey>
<joey> Just past. </joey>
<joey> - But I also, I don't know if I can do this now </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's been like two years </joey>
<joey> since I've been on a long flight. </joey>
<connor> - It's been awhile. </connor>
<garnt> - It's been like two years, </garnt>
<connor> but I used to stay up all night working, </connor>
<garnt> and then my flight would be at like what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, maybe mid day if I was lucky. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe 8:00 AM if I was even luckier. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I'd stay up all night working, </garnt>
<garnt> and then right before I got on the plane, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just take one of those over the counter, </garnt>
<garnt> really cheap week sleeping pills you can get. </garnt>
<garnt> - The UK ones. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're super, they're not- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, melatonin? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Melatonin's the good shit. </joey>
<joey> That's illegal in the UK, </joey>
<garnt> or you need a prescription to get melatonin. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh really? - I think the one that you get </connor>
<joey> from the store is like similar to hayfever medicine, </joey>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like drowsy medicine. </joey>
<garnt> - I swear to God, that's just sugar pills. </garnt>
<connor> I swear to God. </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't actually do much, </connor>
<connor> but it's enough to like kind of get your head going </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "All right, I'm already sleep deprived. </connor>
<connor> "I stayed up all night working, </connor>
<connor> "and now I'm gonna go to bed." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like when I would, when, what was it? </connor>
<connor> Two and a half years ago, maybe, </connor>
<joey> the last con season I actually did before pandemic. </joey>
<joey> I went back and forth from America like four times </joey>
<joey> in one month to the UK. </joey>
<connor> And the only way I could do it was by sleeping. </connor>
<joey> - I just like, </joey>
<joey> if I need to sleep on a plane </joey>
<connor> and I don't have like melatonin or like sleeping pills- </connor>
<connor> - I've never taken melatonin. </connor>
<connor> - I just go like, "Just give me like two gin and tonics." </connor>
<garnt> Just down that shit and zonk out. </garnt>
<connor> - Alcohol doesn't work on me to make me sleep. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - To me, I never drink alcohol on planes </connor>
<connor> because alcohol just makes the fluids run </connor>
<connor> through my body faster, so I just gotta pee more. </connor>
<connor> So that just adds an extra layer of stress for me </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, I gotta pee more now I'm on this plane." </connor>
<garnt> - I can not pee. </garnt>
<connor> I can hold the pee. </connor>
<garnt> - "I can not pee." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's an out of context clip. </connor>
<joey> I can hold the pee for like the whole 12 hours. </joey>
<joey> - You're a mad man. </joey>
<connor> - I unload before I get on the plane. </connor>
<garnt> - "Unload!" </garnt>
<garnt> - I fully unleash it and I drink minimal water on the plane. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure I unload as much as I possibly can. </garnt>
<garnt> I go to pee like five times before I get on the plane </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I sit down immediately- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the problem. </garnt>
<connor> You're peeing five times before you get on the plane. </connor>
<connor> Your bladder already sounds like it's failed you </connor>
<connor> before you even got to the gate. I'm only peeing like once. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know what it is though. </joey>
<joey> It's like a Pavlovian effect </joey>
<connor> where like the moment you hear the "ding" </connor>
<connor> of like the seatbelt sign, it's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh fuck, I have to pee." </joey>
<connor> Every time. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's what I can hold it. </connor>
<connor> And I can sleep. </connor>
<connor> So, I'm like, I tell the people next to me, </connor>
<connor> like if they seem nice. </connor>
<garnt> If they don't seem nice, </garnt>
<garnt> I won't even say anything 'cause. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tell them what? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "If the food comes, don't wake me up. </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't care about the food. </garnt>
<garnt> "Don't wake me up for anything." </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were gonna say, "Don't worry. </garnt>
<garnt> "Don't worry if you have to pee 'cause I'm all for it, man." </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause sometimes if you're gonna sleep </connor>
<garnt> and they ask you, "Do you want food?" </garnt>
<connor> And they think that you're like actually like conked out </connor>
<joey> like completely, they might think like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh my God, he's like, he's fainted," or something or like. </connor>
<joey> - No, I've just, if I'm on a plane- </joey>
<joey> - If you don't wake up. If you don't wake up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if I'm on a plane </connor>
<joey> and I'm asleep while the food goes past, </joey>
<joey> like I've never been woken up for food. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, I've had people wake me up so many times. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - I hate that actually. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, "Do you know how hard I worked?" </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly! </garnt>
<garnt> - For those five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> I waited two hours to get to sleep for five fucking minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> so you could wake me up? </garnt>
<connor> This is why I also don't want to sit in the fucking, </connor>
<joey> in the aisle because the moment I fall asleep, </joey>
<joey> some person's gonna be like, "Excuse me. </joey>
<connor> "Can I go to the toilet?" </connor>
<connor> You literally waited. </connor>
<connor> You waited until I fell asleep. </connor>
<connor> Fucking piece of shit. </connor>
<connor> I hate you. </connor>
<connor> You're a scum of the earth. </connor>
<connor> I will watch the moment I see them about to fall asleep, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'm gonna pee. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm like I wanna give you some time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, there's only one thing that annoys me more </garnt>
<garnt> about getting woken up just to eat, you know, on a plane, </garnt>
<garnt> which I wasn't even hungry in the first place, </garnt>
<garnt> and that is babies on a plane. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, man... </garnt>
<garnt> Crying babies on a plane just triggers something in me, man. </garnt>
<joey> I think it should be legally allowed- </joey>
<connor> - Do you have noise-canceling headphones? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't. </garnt>
<joey> - They're a lifesaver. </joey>
<connor> - Literally the, what are they called? </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, I feel like a baby's cry pierces any kind of- </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Dude, those Sony WX 4,000, whatever the fuck they are. </connor>
<connor> The stupidest name they ever picked for them. </connor>
<connor> There's amazing noise-canceling headphones. </connor>
<connor> You won't hear a fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I've, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't usually use noise-canceling headphones. </connor>
<connor> That might be my problem </connor>
<connor> because right now I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I think it should be legally allowed to punch babies </connor>
<connor> if they cry on a plane. </connor>
<connor> Like, that's, can we all just agree on that? </connor>
<garnt> - "Shut up!" </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like they might cry more, Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how the parents would feel about this. </joey>
<joey> - You have to hit them just right. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it's like "Mad Max" when the baby starts crying. </connor>
<connor> Parents are like fucking... </connor>
<garnt> - All right man, problem solved. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never thought I needed- </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Like, "Austin Powers" judo chop. </garnt>
<garnt> Judo chop! </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<connor> I never thought I needed noise-canceling headphones </connor>
<connor> until I had them. </connor>
<connor> And then I can't, </connor>
<connor> I literally go everywhere with them. </connor>
<connor> Like, you see me. </connor>
<connor> I do not go anywhere without my noise-canceling headphones. </connor>
<garnt> - I would only use noise-canceling headphones </garnt>
<joey> for the airplane. </joey>
<joey> - That's what you think. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, in what other like situations? </garnt>
<connor> - It's so nice on the train or any form of transport, </connor>
<connor> walking around, just getting isolated </connor>
<connor> and hearing your music and just the music. </connor>
<connor> And if you want, you can hear some background noise. </connor>
<joey> It doesn't really matter. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, it's like living through an AMV. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking awesome. </joey>
<joey> - It's great. </joey>
<joey> I want to hear Philip DeFranco </joey>
<joey> when I'm walking downtown going, </joey>
<joey> "What's up, beautiful bastards?" in my ear. </joey>
<joey> - Right in my, it's like ASMR. </joey>
<garnt> - Right in my ear. </garnt>
<garnt> All I want to hear is Phil in my ear. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I zone out enough as it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need noise-canceling headphones. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'd literally just walk in front of a truck or something </connor>
<connor> if I had noise-canceling headphones on. </connor>
<connor> - No, you kinda, you learn to adapt. (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - You become more wary. </joey>
<joey> - I look around a lot more now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which is a good thing. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of like Daredevil, right? </connor>
<connor> You take out one sense, </connor>
<garnt> so you gotta compensate for it with your other sense </garnt>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Just buy them. </garnt>
<joey> You'll see, you'll see. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're great. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I always thought like expensive headphones, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "I don't need more than 20 bucks </garnt>
<connor> "or 50 bucks headphones. </connor>
<joey> "What a scam." And then I bought them and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "I'm such a fool. </connor>
<connor> "I was so wrong the whole time." </connor>
<joey> - The beeps and boops sound even better now. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, they are amazing. </connor>
<connor> Changes everything. </connor>
<connor> - I did used to have like really, really good headphones, </connor>
<connor> but they were just a real hassle. </connor>
<connor> - Beats by Dre. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - They were just like a real hassle to just lug around. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I stopped using them. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why mine, mine are like, </connor>
<connor> they fold into themselves. </connor>
<connor> Pretty easy to put in a coat pocket or something. </connor>
<garnt> - I just use the AirPods. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's why I like using like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> earbuds whenever it's daily life. </joey>
<garnt> If it's on a plane, yeah, I'll bring the headphones. </garnt>
<connor> - I wear the headphones everywhere. </connor>
<joey> - See like especially this time, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't mind the headphones either, </joey>
<joey> but like this time of year when it gets hot as shit- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I hate having headphones around my neck. </joey>
<connor> - I need something to distract me from the heat, </connor>
<joey> so I just blast some audio. </joey>
<joey> - So what? </joey>
<joey> Add more heat? </joey>
<joey> - Take one, take one- </joey>
<garnt> - Add more insulation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Take one of the senses away from me, </garnt>
<connor> so I can just go to another world. </connor>
<connor> I don't have to fuckin' pay attention to Japan anymore. </connor>
<joey> - No, I hate that because I start sweating here, </joey>
<joey> like on my ears, and then when I take it off, it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Well, you have a lot of hair though, so that might be why. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't really have like that much hair around here. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's probably it. </connor>
<joey> You're like muffling all the hair in there. </joey>
<joey> You're like fucking making- </joey>
<joey> - I have to like fucking like raise it up like this </joey>
<joey> to like hear anything. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt will be fine then. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're good. </joey>
<joey> You two are fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we're fine. - I'll be good, I'll be good. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Soon I'll have no hair then they'll be no problem. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Then you'll just have like a sunburn mark. </joey>
<garnt> - Looking forward to getting sunburned on your head, Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - Just gonna become a hat guy. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Beanie guy. </connor>
<connor> - You already are starting to become a hat guy. </connor>
<connor> Every time I see you in the summer. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, 'cause I realized that like it fucking hurts </connor>
<connor> to not wear a hat. </connor>
<connor> - It hurts? </connor>
<connor> - The sun hurts so much. </connor>
<connor> I think that's what the biggest thing that changed to me. </connor>
<connor> I was walking today to the train and I was like, </connor>
<connor> when did I just like hate seeing the sun? </connor>
<joey> Like, when did that happen? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember I didn't mind being outside. </joey>
<joey> But now I hate the thought of having the sun </joey>
<connor> on my skin at all. </connor>
<garnt> - Sounds like the most British thing </garnt>
<connor> I've ever heard honestly. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't used to be this way. I don't know what happened! </connor>
<garnt> - "I just hate the sun." </garnt>
<joey> - Literally- </joey>
<joey> - Wait, can you tan? </joey>
<joey> - No, I just burn. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But now I actually like, if I stay in the sun too long, </joey>
<joey> I feel like nauseous real fast </joey>
<joey> without like a hat or anything. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel that's like a different- </joey>
<joey> - Is it just because it's too hot? </joey>
<joey> - I think maybe here, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think it's just way harder than I'm used to. </joey>
<joey> - It's also because of the humidity, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the humidity. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like you're just, it's more, it's not the sun. </garnt>
<connor> It's just the heat because- </connor>
<connor> - It's both, it's both. </connor>
<joey> - In like England, the sun fucking tickles you, you know? </joey>
<connor> You don't feel anything. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, I feel like they play off each other. </garnt>
<garnt> So, the sun makes the humidity worse, </garnt>
<garnt> then the humidity makes the sun worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<joey> - Because when the sun's beaming on you </joey>
<joey> in like LA or whatever, it's not too bad. </joey>
<joey> Obviously I don't wanna stand- </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> It hurts. - I don't know about that. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. - It hurts. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying it's great, </joey>
<joey> but I mean, it's better than it is in Japan </joey>
<joey> just 'cause the humidity makes it feel 10 times worse. </joey>
<joey> - I mean- </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if there's some like ray bullshit, </connor>
<connor> like mimic, like, you know, going in the water droplets </connor>
<connor> in the air fucking, </connor>
<connor> the frogs they're making the- </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I don't know if there's some shit going on there. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Some conspiracy theory shit. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> There's probably someone smarter than me </connor>
<connor> who can figure it out. </connor>
<joey> - It's honestly, I think it's just like a preference thing, </joey>
<joey> right? </joey>
<joey> Like, some people are like, "Yeah, humidity's whatever." </joey>
<garnt> And then there are others who are like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh yeah, my skin is like physically burning." </joey>
<garnt> - I like a little bit of humidity. </garnt>
<connor> Japanese humidity is like way too much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Last summer I could like only survive by going around </connor>
<joey> with like a fucking UV umbrella. </joey>
<joey> Felt like an old woman. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's right. - I felt like an old woman. </joey>
<joey> I would just go around with like this foldable umbrella </joey>
<joey> that I would just go around. </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, "Don't talk to me." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I can't. </connor>
<joey> - The first time I saw you with that, I thought... </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Are you waiting for me to like say a joke or?" </joey>
<joey> - Because I realized it's not enough </joey>
<joey> to just protect my head. </joey>
<joey> - "Is this a bit?" </joey>
<connor> - It started, like, even the hat didn't really help </connor>
<connor> that much, and I needed to cover like my neck </connor>
<connor> and like my arms and shoulders. </connor>
<joey> - You need to get those like visors that- </joey>
<connor> - I'm one, yeah, I'm one step away </connor>
<connor> from being the old woman at the supermarket </connor>
<connor> because they wear like sleeves. </connor>
<connor> Like, shade sleeves and like a full like neck thing </connor>
<garnt> for the sun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shout out to those of us who've never been sunburned </garnt>
<connor> in our lives. </connor>
<connor> Is this a white man problem that I just don't get? </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> I think I'm aging rapidly. </connor>
<garnt> - Imagine sunburning. </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine sunburning, oh God. </connor>
<garnt> Imagine being hurt by this natural occurring thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's existed since the beginning of our planet. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like my body didn't age </connor>
<connor> and then it decided that everything would just kick </connor>
<connor> into overdrive and start aging rapidly from age like 23. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what happened. </connor>
<connor> We went to Japan and it just made me feel old. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> So now- </joey>
<joey> - Literally the youngest man in the room. </joey>
<joey> - My UV umbrella broke and shit. </joey>
<joey> It snapped. </joey>
<joey> - It broke? </joey>
<joey> - It broke. I don't know how it broke. </joey>
<connor> - Did the sun snap it? - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - The rays were too heavy. </joey>
<connor> - I like to- </connor>
<garnt> - How did it break? </garnt>
<garnt> - How the fuck did it break? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know when you pull it out? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was one of the foldable ones. </garnt>
<garnt> So, you can fit it into a small bag. </garnt>
<joey> It just like when I pulled it out one time, </joey>
<garnt> it just fucking came off. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh." </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess no sun protection for the day then. </garnt>
<connor> - No, so now I need to buy a new one. </connor>
<connor> I've been looking on Amazon, </connor>
<connor> but one hasn't caught my fancy yet, so we'll see. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I'm very picky. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this a fashion statement or something as well? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I just wanted one that wouldn't break, you know? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've been burned once, </connor>
<connor> twice now, from the sun and from the umbrella. </connor>
<garnt> - Just buy a more sturdy one surely. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh thanks, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - It's an umbrella! </connor>
<connor> It's a fucking, </connor>
<connor> it's a fucking umbrella. </connor>
<connor> How wrong can an umbrella be? </connor>
<garnt> Does it protect you? </garnt>
<garnt> Does it give you shade? </garnt>
<garnt> That's all it needs to do surely. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I mean, you know, 'cause- </connor>
<connor> - Then why the fuck you worried about like the design? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I already look like a clown using it. </connor>
<connor> I want to at least not make it too bad and get like a, </connor>
<garnt> if I get a pink one, it'd look pretty bad. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I want to try and get like somewhat- </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing wrong with pink. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could rock it. </garnt>
<connor> I just don't want to have to justify why I'm rocking it. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Why are you like trying to prove a point? </joey>
<joey> - I could own it. </joey>
<connor> I just don't want to. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> I have no qualms with having a pink umbrella </joey>
<connor> if that's what you're wondering. </connor>
<connor> - That was the most like roundabout way of saying, </connor>
<connor> "Yes, but also no." </connor>
<connor> - I'll get a pink umbrella, fine. </connor>
<connor> I'll buy a pink umbrella. - Yeah, get it. </connor>
<joey> Do it for the bit. </joey>
<joey> - Fine, fine. </joey>
<joey> No one's gonna see it. </joey>
<joey> It's literally- </joey>
<connor> - We'll put it on Twitter, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> - It's for the bit. </connor>
<connor> My daily life. </connor>
<connor> My daily life is a joke. - We'll put it on the Twitter. </connor>
<joey> Don't worry. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> Subreddit will go ham on that, don't worry. </joey>
<connor> - Let's fucking talk about something serious. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> (Connor speaks Japanese) </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt speaks Japanese) </garnt>
<joey> (Joey speaks Japanese) </joey>
<garnt> - Shut the fuck up, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>

<connor> (Connor speaks Japanese) </connor>
<garnt> (Joey speaks Japanese) </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck you, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Script reading, big brain. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, in other news, there's something happened. </garnt>
<joey> - There is something less light-hearted </joey>
<garnt> and more serious that has happened recently. </garnt>
<joey> - I was trying to find a little like downtime </joey>
<garnt> before we go onto that. </garnt>
<joey> I guess we'll go straight into it. </joey>
<joey> - Let's just go straight into depression, so... </joey>
<joey> How can we say this, boys? </joey>
<joey> One of the greatest manga artists- </joey>
<joey> - One of my fucking heroes just died. </joey>
<joey> - One of the greatest manga artists of all time </joey>
<connor> just passed away recently. </connor>
<connor> - Old news by the time this comes out. </connor>
<connor> - By the time this comes out, </connor>
<connor> this will be like a month old news now. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, Kentaro Miura, author of "Berserk" has passed away </joey>
<joey> and- </joey>
<joey> - Age 54, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, age 54. </joey>
<garnt> Of like, what did he die of? </garnt>
<joey> - I forgot the scientific name of it, </joey>
<joey> but it's like one of his like main arteries </joey>
<joey> in his heart just like exploded. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Essentially. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically it's a heart attack. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, but yeah, it's a fucking horrible way to die. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll tell you honestly, after hearing about this news, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm never gonna make fun of a hiatus ever again. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<joey> No, like legit. </joey>
<garnt> Like, it's scary, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because... </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, because, you know, obviously no one really knew </joey>
<joey> as to why he was on hiatus, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no one knew. </joey>
<connor> - They normally don't usually give reasons. </connor>
<joey> They just like- </joey>
<connor> - People are extremely versatile. </connor>
<connor> - "He/she is on hiatus, just deal with it." </connor>
<connor> But, yeah, apparently, I guess. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Was he sick or was it just completely sudden? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> At the time of recording, </joey>
<connor> I haven't read enough about what happened </connor>
<connor> to know if it was like a reoccurring health problem </connor>
<joey> or if it was just a sudden thing. </joey>
<joey> But man, like we all know </joey>
<joey> how much pressure manga artists get put through anyway </joey>
<joey> and how much work they have to do on a weekly basis. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's crazy to think </joey>
<joey> that most of the big manga artists we know about, </joey>
<joey> you know, working shonen jump or whatever, </joey>
<joey> get like two weeks off. </joey>
<joey> No, less than two weeks off every year, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like golden week and then like one extra week. </joey>
<connor> - I doubt they take it as well. I doubt they take it. </connor>
<connor> - And they don't really, I doubt they take it off as well. </connor>
<connor> It's just one week where they are forced </connor>
<garnt> to take a break, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I wasn't too familiar with "Berserk." </connor>
<garnt> I'd only watched the 90s anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's familiar enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - I really enjoyed. </garnt>
<garnt> It was very good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> it's just kind of sad hearing like a legend of the industry </connor>
<connor> who's kind of influenced a lot of things that we've done. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember we were filming another project </garnt>
<joey> when the news broke to us, </joey>
<joey> and it didn't hit me immediately </joey>
<joey> because I was in like work mode, I was in filming mode, </joey>
<joey> so I was like, "Okay, I gotta do this, this, this." </joey>
<connor> And then it got home, listened to Guts' theme once, </connor>
<connor> and it just played continuously for like the entire night. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just sitting there just like fucking, </connor>
<garnt> like part of my soul had died. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I literally went home and I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "I'm gonna reread 'Berserk.'" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like everyone did. </garnt>
<connor> - I started reading it. </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't get past volume one without feeling like, </joey>
<joey> this fucking wave of like, oh fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like I always know </garnt>
<garnt> that "Berserk" is one of the greatest manga </garnt>
<garnt> that has ever been made. </garnt>
<garnt> And then going back home and realizing, </garnt>
<garnt> just remembering everything that was in this story </garnt>
<garnt> and in this manga, it just hit even fucking harder </garnt>
<garnt> because I just had forgotten how good it was </garnt>
<garnt> before I really took the time to remember </garnt>
<garnt> what it had achieved and some of its greatest moments. </garnt>
<garnt> If you hadn't read "Berserk," </garnt>
<garnt> there's always a perfect time to read "Berserk" </garnt>
<garnt> because anytime is the perfect time to read "Berserk." </garnt>
<garnt> So, please read fucking "Berserk." </garnt>
<garnt> It's amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean the manga single-handedly </joey>
<joey> inspired the Dark Souls series. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it inspired a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't just Dark Souls. </garnt>
<joey> A lot of things wouldn't exist right now </joey>
<joey> if not for "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I don't know what it is about "Berserk," </joey>
<joey> but it's literally like, </joey>
<joey> it's literally the one show, or not even one show, </joey>
<joey> the one story or the one manga </joey>
<garnt> that seems to be like no matter how tough this person is, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how like detached they are from the world </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, "Berserk" seems to be that one story </garnt>
<garnt> that seems to be able to affect anyone who reads it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because like fundamentally, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's like this whole like dark fantasy thing </joey>
<connor> with these like mythical creatures </connor>
<connor> and it's bloody, gory and, you know, epic. </connor>
<connor> But like the main themes mostly are just like, </connor>
<connor> you know, one person trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> what the fuck they want to do in life. </connor>
<connor> And like that's a theme </connor>
<connor> that literally anyone can get behind, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm kind of in this world, shit's happening around me, </connor>
<connor> I don't really know what my purpose is in life. </connor>
<connor> - I forgot how brutal it was. </connor>
<joey> - It's brutal. </joey>
<connor> - Again, I watched all the 90s anime. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, holy shit. </connor>
<joey> - The 90s anime is brutal as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Oh my God." </joey>
<garnt> Like, it's just like, fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> It just hurts to read. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It does. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so uncomfortable at times. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I think it's incredible </garnt>
<garnt> because it is really, really fucking brutal. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some like, </garnt>
<garnt> like his art, obviously we haven't talked about his art yet. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like some of the best art to ever exist </garnt>
<garnt> in the world of manga. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, some of the horrific imagery he managed to conjure up </garnt>
<garnt> and some of like the creature designs </garnt>
<garnt> and everything were just something straight </garnt>
<garnt> out of a nightmare, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a brutal show and it's an action packed show </garnt>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Guts is like one of the biggest badasses in anime and manga. </garnt>
<garnt> And yet having said all that, </garnt>
<garnt> the moments that people remember are </garnt>
<garnt> like the really intimate moments, </garnt>
<garnt> which isn't what you think </garnt>
<garnt> if you looked at "Berserk" on a surface level, right? </garnt>
<joey> You look at "Berserk" you see these horrific creatures, </joey>
<joey> you see Guts with a massive sword tearing shit up, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, "Yeah! </joey>
<joey> "This is a manly man show." </joey>
<joey> And you read it and you're just like fucking crying inside </joey>
<connor> because, you know, you see, </connor>
<connor> trying to see Guts like get through his trauma </connor>
<connor> and find his journey and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's the real intimate moments </connor>
<connor> that always stand out, </connor>
<connor> and it's the real serene moments that always stand out. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's what really sets "Berserk" apart </connor>
<joey> from like so many other series </joey>
<joey> where it's the serene moments juxtaposed </joey>
<joey> against all like the horrific moments </joey>
<joey> that make it one of, to me, </joey>
<joey> like it's one of my favorite pieces of fiction </joey>
<joey> that's ever been made. </joey>
<connor> I got reminded of that after remembering everything </connor>
<garnt> that "Berserk" did. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like if the fucking Doom guy had like a wife </connor>
<connor> and family and he just went home sometimes. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> You get reminded like, "Oh shit, this is a guy." </connor>
<joey> Because when you're- </joey>
<joey> - Doom guy's like, "Why am I killing these?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> "What is my purpose?" </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I was really, I, you know, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I don't know why someone compared it on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> I thought, I guess so, but then I read "Berserk." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> But it is kind of like, you do forget </connor>
<connor> 'cause sometimes like you're reading it, </connor>
<joey> you're like, this is like so Doom-esque </joey>
<joey> where he's just literally just beheading horses. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Oh, this is like Doom." </joey>
<joey> And then it's like really sad and you're like, </joey>
<garnt> "This isn't like Doom." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally that meme where the girls were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can't believe he didn't cry during Titanic. </garnt>
<connor> "Do boys even have feelings?" </connor>
<connor> And then like there's just the boys crying over Guts' theme, </connor>
<connor> which was literally what I was doing that night. </connor>
<connor> Just Guts' theme was playing </connor>
<joey> and I was just like crying in bed. </joey>
<garnt> Just like, oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's just, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like, every time I re-read it, it's just because. you know, </joey>
<connor> every time a new volume came out </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was so much time </connor>
<connor> in between like the later volumes, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Well, fuck. </connor>
<connor> "I guess I have to read it from scratch again." </connor>
<connor> And so I would keep reading it from scratch over </connor>
<connor> and over again. </connor>
<connor> And it's one of those shows where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> how does this not get like stale? </connor>
<connor> Because I probably read it, like the first 30 volumes, </connor>
<joey> probably like a good, like maybe 10, 20 times. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, how does this keep just getting better? </joey>
<joey> Like, how do I keep finding new things in this? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you guys know me. </connor>
<joey> I don't fucking rewatch anything. </joey>
<joey> I refuse to rewatch. </joey>
<joey> But even just rereading the first, </joey>
<garnt> what is the first one called? </garnt>
<garnt> - "The Golden Age." </garnt>
<garnt> - "The Golden Age," that. </garnt>
<garnt> Just rereading that again, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Holy shit, this was so good." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, even though I've seen this, I've read it earlier. </connor>
<connor> Like, I tried to read it again ages ago for some reason now- </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes when I'm bored, </joey>
<connor> I just like go to the eclipse arc and just look at the art. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, how can one person think of this? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know- </garnt>
<garnt> - And the dude was like 15 as well </garnt>
<joey> when he like first came up with the concept of the zone. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you see the manga he made before "Berserk" </garnt>
<joey> when he was actually 15? - He was like 15 or 16. </joey>
<joey> - It's better than most modern manga artists. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, this is not the art skill of a 15-year-old. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And like he paired that talent </joey>
<connor> and he just kept improving on it to the point </connor>
<connor> where literally, I dunno, there's only like a few people </connor>
<garnt> in the world who I think can even match, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the talent that he puts into the panels that he did. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I saw this like really interesting interview </joey>
<joey> with him like after, you know, his death was announced </joey>
<connor> where like apparently one of the big reasons </connor>
<connor> as to why he was on hiatus was because he got so infatuated </connor>
<connor> with detail that it would literally get to the point </connor>
<connor> where he would zoom in </connor>
<connor> and like actually edit every fucking pixel. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - And like he- </joey>
<connor> - Sounds like a prison, that's perfection. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and he kept, you know, </joey>
<joey> getting like on hiatus over and over again. </joey>
<joey> And his, you know, editors would be like, </joey>
<joey> "You can't even see this detail on paper. </joey>
<joey> "So like just stop." </joey>
<joey> And he was just like, "No. </joey>
<joey> "I have to get this right. </joey>
<joey> "I have to get this perfect." </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, like some of the panels he's done belongs </garnt>
<joey> in a museum, you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like the reason for that is </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just remember like that night when I went back, </joey>
<joey> I just like went to look at some of the panels </joey>
<joey> and I just remember staring at them for such a long time </joey>
<joey> because you know when you're reading a story, </joey>
<joey> sometimes, you know, you wanna see what happens next. </joey>
<joey> So you don't read it. </joey>
<joey> You don't appreciate the art at the moment </joey>
<joey> when you first read it. </joey>
<joey> But I went back to look at some of the panels, </joey>
<joey> and I just, the amount of work and amount of detail </joey>
<joey> and the amount of vision that was put </joey>
<joey> into these panels were fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> I did not appreciate it fully the first time </joey>
<joey> even though I could tell these were amazing. </joey>
<joey> I didn't take the time to fully appreciate </joey>
<joey> how fucking amazing some of these panels are </joey>
<joey> 'cause they are incredible. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] 100%. </joey>
<joey> - They, you know, they are just basically the same </joey>
<garnt> as any other painting or any other art. </garnt>
<joey> - I really want to know if they have </joey>
<connor> like a "Berserk" art book of some kind </connor>
<joey> because I would fucking purchase that in a heartbeat, dude. </joey>
<connor> - I can imagine </connor>
<connor> that they'll probably end up doing something soon </connor>
<joey> to celebrate the legacy. </joey>
<joey> - I hope they do like open up an exhibit or something. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause that would be absolutely amazing </connor>
<connor> 'cause if there's one, you know, one manga </connor>
<connor> that deserves an exhibit, </connor>
<garnt> that deserves the artwork to be plastered on the wall. </garnt>
<connor> - It's Miura, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's fucking "Berserk." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 100%. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was kind of sad to see that a lot of people were </garnt>
<connor> just like, "Well, what's gonna happen to the story?" </connor>
<connor> And it's like- </connor>
<joey> - Those aren't fans of "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - It's frustrating </joey>
<connor> 'cause when I saw the announcement on Twitter </connor>
<joey> there were so many people being like, </joey>
<connor> "Does this mean it's not gonna finish?" </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yes, no shit. </connor>
<joey> - To me, it's just so, it's like, </joey>
<joey> how about you just give them a chance to like grieve </joey>
<joey> before you ask these questions. </joey>
<connor> - If anything I'm kind of- </connor>
<connor> - The answer's probably gonna be no. </connor>
<joey> - Because there were a lot of people as well being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, but you know, </joey>
<joey> "they can probably just get like Miura's assistants </joey>
<joey> "to finish it." </joey>
<joey> And like, no, no. </joey>
<joey> I would rather it just be where it is. </joey>
<garnt> Just end it. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm fine with it being an unfinished masterpiece, </joey>
<joey> you know? </joey>
<joey> That's fine. </joey>
<connor> That's fine for me. </connor>
<connor> It's "Berserk"- </connor>
<connor> - Was it realistically ever gonna finish, do you think? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I don't think, </joey>
<joey> like, not a single one of like the, you know, </joey>
<joey> the Kings were killed. </joey>
<connor> I think only one of them was killed. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I think one of them was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> So, there was a long, long way to go. </joey>
<garnt> - We were so early in the story </garnt>
<garnt> and the pace that the story was progressing, </garnt>
<connor> I doubt it would have finished in our lifetime or, you know, </connor>
<connor> I think it was always going to be unfinished. </connor>
<connor> But I think "Berserk" has already achieved enough </connor>
<garnt> that it doesn't need to be finished. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like what I said </connor>
<connor> when we talked about last time we spoke about reading manga </connor>
<connor> where I just get to, </connor>
<connor> I often get to a point when I'm reading manga I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm satisfied. </connor>
<connor> "I genuinely, it'd be cool if this ends nicely, </connor>
<connor> "but I've read up to a point </connor>
<connor> "where I feel like I'm happy with what I've been given." </connor>
<garnt> And I feel like "Berserk" has definitely done that. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's been plenty of moments in "Berserk" </garnt>
<joey> that have felt like a resolution moment, </joey>
<joey> like a big resolution moment. </joey>
<joey> Even though not every plot detail was resolved, </joey>
<joey> even though not every loose end was tied up, </joey>
<connor> I feel like it's resolved enough in my heart </connor>
<connor> to make it like impact me this much already, you know? </connor>
<connor> And I think "Berserk," you know, </connor>
<connor> the journey of Guts is already amazing enough as it is. </connor>
<connor> And some journeys, you know, </connor>
<connor> some journeys don't need to come to an end on paper, </connor>
<connor> you know? </connor>
<joey> I've seen enough of the journey where I'm satisfied. </joey>
<joey> It's... </joey>
<joey> - Just knowing that he's out there somewhere still. </joey>
<connor> Looking for the end, right? </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - With the biggest fucking sword. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Fat fucking sword. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly I don't know what else to say. </joey>
<garnt> It was just, it's a story that has impacted me. </garnt>
<joey> - If there's anything we can say </joey>
<joey> on this "Trash Taste" episode, </joey>
<garnt> it's please go read "Berserk." </garnt>
<garnt> Give it a go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pay respect to the king. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, he is a king. </garnt>
<joey> - He's the fucking GOAT, man. </joey>
<garnt> - I hope, you know, if we find out more about the details </garnt>
<connor> of, you know, what might've caused his early death, </connor>
<connor> that if it is something to do with being overworked </connor>
<joey> or anything, the lifestyle, </joey>
<joey> that I hope it does make a change, if it is. </joey>
<joey> We don't know that, obviously. </joey>
<joey> We might never know. </joey>
<connor> But if we do find out more details, </connor>
<joey> and it becomes publicly available, and we, you know, </joey>
<joey> we know that maybe being overworked is- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think it would be good to at least, you know, </joey>
<joey> kind of put into the public discussion. </joey>
<connor> - Because, you know, even if you are, </connor>
<connor> you know, you have, 'cause normally with heart problems </connor>
<connor> and this kind of blood stuff, </connor>
<connor> it's normally there is some hereditary stuff at play. </connor>
<connor> But I mean still at 54 is young. </connor>
<joey> Like, that... </joey>
<connor> Lifestyle would have to have an effect. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I just want mangas to not have so much stress </connor>
<connor> on their body where it fails, you know? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad, man. </garnt>
<connor> It makes me feel shitty. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it sucks because like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> there's not really much I can add to that </garnt>
<connor> because manga artists work a hell of a- </connor>
<connor> - We know, we know- </connor>
<garnt> - We know they work way too hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whether voluntarily or not, </garnt>
<garnt> the deadlines that they set themselves </garnt>
<garnt> or are set on them are too much. </garnt>
<connor> And it doesn't help that fans are so demanding. </connor>
<joey> And that for some fucking reason, </joey>
<joey> the first question that some fans have </joey>
<joey> when an author dies is what happens to the story. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I mean, it feels so selfish, </joey>
<joey> and it feels, you know, </joey>
<connor> because we as fans also have something where we're selfish. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, like surprisingly, from what I saw, </joey>
<connor> there weren't as many of those comments. </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't that bad. </connor>
<connor> It just sours your taste when you see even one. </connor>
<connor> - Every now and then I saw it and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, clearly you don't really give a shit." </joey>
<connor> - I mean, none of them said offensive. </connor>
<joey> - There were just some of the insensitive ones. </joey>
<garnt> - It reminds me of a- </garnt>
<connor> - But it's like when there's earthquakes and stuff, right, </connor>
<garnt> but people are always just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, the manga it's delayed 'cause of an earthquake?" </garnt>
<joey> And it's like, what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> Like, people like people die. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Like, earthquakes are no fucking joke. </connor>
<connor> And it's like the people that most, I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> obviously with this situation is very sensitive, you know, </connor>
<connor> and it was very fresh and a lot of people care. </connor>
<connor> But I noticed, especially with like earthquakes and stuff, </connor>
<connor> that people are very quick to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, who gives a shit? </connor>
<connor> "It's just an earthquake." </connor>
<connor> - "It happens all the time." </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, </connor>
<connor> I think it plays into the overall sentiment </connor>
<connor> of that a lot of anime fans </connor>
<connor> and manga fans are very demanding for the stuff </connor>
<connor> that they want. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like we as fans need to chill out a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they care about the product, </joey>
<joey> but not so much about the person making it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like we as fans generally need to chill out </connor>
<connor> about our passion for anime and manga. </connor>
<connor> - I'd say that. </connor>
<connor> - External things happen. </connor>
<connor> They happen. </connor>
<connor> It is what it is. </connor>
<joey> - Remember that some actual person is making your product. </joey>
<connor> - Whether it be an earthquake or personal stress, </connor>
<joey> they're all valid reasons for work to be delayed. </joey>
<joey> - Give them some respect. </joey>
<connor> - I just want creators to be able to create the shit </connor>
<garnt> to the best of their ability and not have to worry. </garnt>
<garnt> I hope that's not controversial for me to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a hot take! </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Respect staff members. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just feel like when you say this shit- </connor>
<connor> - There's people behind the work. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm sure everyone can agree on it. </connor>
<connor> It's just more, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure 99% of people watching this don't do that. </connor>
<connor> It's just that 1%. </connor>
<connor> It's always that 1%. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember, </connor>
<connor> this reminds me of like the "Game of Thrones" thing </connor>
<connor> with JRR Martin where I remember like seeing an interview </connor>
<connor> with him and he said that he got annoyed </connor>
<connor> that some people were worried about his health </connor>
<connor> not because they were worried about his health, </connor>
<connor> but they're worried if he would be alive </connor>
<connor> to finish "Game of Thrones." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, yeah, that's pretty fucked up </connor>
<connor> that like fans are saying that to you, aren't they. </connor>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - And even if they didn't say it, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure he knows that people are probably thinking it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he can read between the lines. </joey>
<joey> - People only care about his well-being </joey>
<joey> in terms of the book. </joey>
<connor> Like, he's being fucking held hostage by the story. </connor>
<joey> Like, you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> You can't fucking do anything. </connor>
<joey> - If anyone knows the intention of "Game of Thrones" fans, </joey>
<connor> it's the guy who made "Game of Thrones." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's just sad, it's just sad. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Like, this makes me sad for like many reasons, you know? </connor>
<connor> There's just so much at play. </connor>
<garnt> - This is well, I mean, it's a sad topic unfortunately. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all about the respect. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all it is. </garnt>
<connor> Respect the creators, respect the artists. </connor>
<joey> Give them some space if they're feeling sick </joey>
<joey> or need a break. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Moving on to lighter topics though. </garnt>
<connor> I heard you've been watching anime recently, Connor. </connor>
<connor> - Kinda yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is a rare feat. </connor>
<connor> - I remember I used to do that. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - The anime man. </garnt>
<garnt> What happened? </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you guys watch "Castlevania," the new season? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have not. - Not season four. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, it's so- </connor>
<joey> - But we haven't talked about "Castlevania" yet, have we? </joey>
<garnt> - It's so good, it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean with how, </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I've watched up to season three. </joey>
<joey> If there's one anime I have like kind of caught up to, </joey>
<connor> it's "Castlevania." </connor>
<joey> But like- </joey>
<connor> - Where did you get up to in "Castlevania?" </connor>
<connor> - I got up to season three. </connor>
<joey> So, I haven't finished season three. </joey>
<joey> I'm about halfway through season three. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, it's just been for me, </joey>
<connor> it's been getting better and better every season </connor>
<connor> as it's been going on </connor>
<connor> and I just haven't had time to binge it yet. </connor>
<garnt> So... </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> Everything about that anime, especially the past season, </connor>
<connor> just blew it out the water. </connor>
<connor> - What's so good about it? </connor>
<joey> - Like, I feel like everything that was good </joey>
<joey> in previous seasons was at its best this season. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - The story was the best. </joey>
<joey> The animation was just insane. </joey>
<joey> Like, some of the fights. </joey>
<joey> Even though in season three, </joey>
<joey> the fights like the final fight was so good. </joey>
<connor> - Even season one had some crazy animation. </connor>
<connor> - It just feels like they've stepped it up. </connor>
<connor> Like again, like I think one of the strongest points </connor>
<connor> of "Castlevania" has been the voice acting. </connor>
<connor> The English voice acting- </connor>
<joey> - The English voice acting is fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - Insane. </joey>
<joey> - It's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the fact that they have like all the accents </joey>
<connor> on point, none of the accents feel silly. </connor>
<connor> Every single accent that the characters have </connor>
<connor> it feels genuine. </connor>
<connor> Every single British accent is on point. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, holy shit. </connor>
<joey> How do they do this? </joey>
<joey> This never happens in anime. </joey>
<joey> How did they get an actual accent? </joey>
<joey> - It's like they hired British actors. </joey>
<joey> - I love the fact that for example the JoJo </joey>
<connor> in the dub like tried to do the accent, </connor>
<joey> but I wish they'd got the native people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like in "JoJo Part One," </joey>
<garnt> it's Johnny Yong Bosch doing in a British accent, </garnt>
<garnt> which isn't bad. - Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which isn't bad. </garnt>
<joey> But I know there's no shortage of native English, </joey>
<joey> British accents that can work in LA. </joey>
<garnt> You know, like... </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels like the voice actors they hired </garnt>
<connor> for "Castlevania" were just outside of your </connor>
<connor> usual anime voice actors. </connor>
<connor> - They were just general actors. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they felt like general actors </joey>
<garnt> that would act in like a TV series </garnt>
<garnt> or like a live action movie. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah, because they have like, </connor>
<connor> they have such a good variation of British accents. </connor>
<connor> Like, they have like the whole spectrum, </connor>
<connor> and they've chosen it like the character's given the accent </connor>
<connor> based very specifically on like what it would be in the UK. </connor>
<joey> Like, where you were born, your wealth, </joey>
<joey> your socioeconomic background. </joey>
<joey> It sounds like, it's so stupid, </joey>
<joey> but it fits every single character. </joey>
<joey> And it's just insane 'cause I mean, </joey>
<joey> we can't appreciate, I mean, </joey>
<joey> we can't appreciate that in the Japanese one </joey>
<joey> where they might get regional accents on point </joey>
<joey> within their own show. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you get like the subtitles </joey>
<connor> where they're supposed to be a bit more like Osaka dialect </connor>
<connor> or a bit rough. </connor>
<connor> But I can't really appreciate that. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly I've been appreciating Japanese voice acting </connor>
<connor> a lot more recently. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I've actually started to watch anime </connor>
<connor> without subtitles on. </connor>
<joey> So, I'm like properly forced to like listen. </joey>
<joey> - Wow, you are like level 100 weeb right now. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You're at the final stage before you graduate. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - The final test. </joey>
<joey> - So, I'm like trying to pick up more of my Japanese, </joey>
<connor> and part of the exercise I've been putting myself through is </connor>
<connor> like everything I watch now, not subtitled. </connor>
<connor> Like, my enjoyment has definitely of anime gone down, </connor>
<connor> but it's like- </connor>
<connor> - It helps. </connor>
<connor> - It helps so much more. </connor>
<connor> It's a night and day watching with subtitles on </connor>
<garnt> and without subtitles on. </garnt>
<connor> - When you don't understand something that's being said, </connor>
<connor> how do you, do you go back and turn the subtitles on then? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so normally I watch anime on Crunchyroll or Netflix. </garnt>
<garnt> So Crunchyroll will have the opportunity </garnt>
<garnt> to select no subtitles, so I can select no subtitles. </garnt>
<connor> If there's something that I really, really want to know </connor>
<connor> what they said, I just rewind a bit, turn on subtitles. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, okay, that's what he said." </connor>
<connor> And then move on. </connor>
<connor> Same thing with Netflix as well. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it turns anime </connor>
<connor> to not just like a passive watching thing </connor>
<connor> and you're just like actively watching- </connor>
<connor> - Study material. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is study material. </connor>
<connor> But if you're gonna have study material, </connor>
<connor> at least have study material you can enjoy. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] True, true, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a different kind of watching in my eyes. </connor>
<connor> But since then, I, like, </connor>
<connor> I remember recently I've been watching "Nagatoro" </connor>
<connor> without subtitles, </connor>
<joey> and I had like my first emotional response </joey>
<joey> to watching an anime without having subtitles on. </joey>
<joey> It just, it felt nice 'cause I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I get what's going on. </joey>
<joey> "I'm getting emotionally invested." </joey>
<joey> - "Is this what these Japanese people feel like?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's exactly what I felt! </joey>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, I'm feeling some stuff now. </connor>
<connor> "Is this how the Japanese people feel?" </connor>
<garnt> I'm not reading the subtitles and getting feelings. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm actually hearing it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually listening to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how to quite describe it </garnt>
<garnt> because it was a new feeling for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, Garnt, I do the same thing just with hentai </connor>
<connor> because they don't have subtitles most of the time, </connor>
<connor> so I just watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - I feel big brain when I (speaks Japanese) </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I got that one. </joey>
<joey> I understand that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> I understand most of it actually. </joey>
<joey> Just feels weird that I'm doing it with hentai </joey>
<connor> and not fucking anime! </connor>
<garnt> - I have actually learned one word from hentai </garnt>
<connor> and that was naka. </connor>
<connor> I remember going through my Japanese classes, </connor>
<connor> and like I was like, oh, so naka means inside. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Where have I heard the term naka?" </connor>
<connor> Yeah, inside. </connor>
<joey> "Oh, that's where I've heard that before." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - That's a word you'll hear quite often </joey>
<joey> in many different contexts. </joey>
<joey> - That's the word I've learned from hentai </joey>
<garnt> that I can also use in daily life. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can already see the meme. It's like the fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt drinking with the fucking coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> watching anime with no subtitles, </garnt>
<connor> watching hentai with no subtitles. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I can already see the meme. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, yeah, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, the voice acting is just fucking stellar, man. </connor>
<joey> If every voice acting was like "Castlevania," </joey>
<connor> we would only be watching dubbed anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you think it played a massive part to, </garnt>
<connor> I assume it's a big part of it is because it was dubbed </connor>
<connor> first in English rather than- </connor>
<connor> - 100%, 100%. </connor>
<garnt> - Rather than dubbed from Japanese to English. </garnt>
<joey> - Is there a Japanese dub for it? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure there must be. </garnt>
<joey> - I've never seen it in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> I don't know if I'll be able to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - When you watch the dub, it's so Goddamn good. </connor>
<connor> It's actually a shame to watch it in any other language. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe this is how Japanese people feel. </connor>
<connor> We don't have a choice. </connor>
<connor> But when we have a choice, </connor>
<connor> why would you, you know, pick the one that is best, right? </connor>
<connor> This is definitely one of those shows where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> it's not even a competition. </joey>
<joey> - Because like- </joey>
<connor> - But then obviously it was, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because when I watched season one, </connor>
<connor> I was like, all right, well, the default is in English </connor>
<connor> because it's an English production. </connor>
<joey> I'll watch episode one. </joey>
<joey> "If the voice acting is kind of subpar, </joey>
<joey> "then whatever, I'll change it." </joey>
<joey> But, literally first five minutes, I was like. </joey>
<joey> "All right, English it is then." </joey>
<connor> It's fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - It's like an anime that is written </connor>
<connor> with kind of pretty fucking good American, </connor>
<joey> I would say it's American writers, right? </joey>
<joey> So, I feel like it's a lot easier for the actors </joey>
<joey> to act the script. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the dialogue is like very witty and sarcastic. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking funny. </joey>
<joey> - Because you hear the dialogue, </joey>
<joey> and it doesn't feel like anime dialogue. </joey>
<joey> - It's so fucking funny. </joey>
<joey> It's good. </joey>
<garnt> - Very, very witty and like facetious. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh shit. </joey>
<garnt> Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like, it's so rare to find an anime dub </garnt>
<connor> where people actually swear. </connor>
<connor> Like, I can count them on one hand. </connor>
<connor> - "For fuck's sake." </connor>
<connor> - When someone says fuck or shit, I'm like, "Oh! </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, this dub's going hard." </garnt>
<garnt> - "We not in Japan anymore." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) - I love it, I love it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so like hearing it just like said so naturally, </connor>
<connor> you know, like talk to any other Brit or Aussie, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's something that's like just ingrained into our speech. </connor>
<connor> If you listen to "Trash Taste," </connor>
<garnt> you fucking know that. </garnt>
<joey> - It's great too because it doesn't feel forced. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no, no. </garnt>
<joey> - Because there's a lot of times where they're like, </joey>
<connor> we're going to be a little explicit just to, you know, </connor>
<connor> be like, ooh, edgy and everything. </connor>
<connor> But like in "Castlevania," it's like, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, I can imagine that. </garnt>
<joey> They would totally say that. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like when you hear it in an anime </joey>
<joey> or like an anime video game, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I remember the most recent example I can think </connor>
<connor> of is playing Persona 5 dubbed and hearing Ryuji say shit, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Ryuji, wash your mouth, sir!" </garnt>
<garnt> - "You are but a child!" </garnt>
<connor> - "Excuse me!" </connor>
<connor> - When Trevor Belmont's like, "Oh, for fuck's sake," </connor>
<connor> you're like, "Oh, that's nice. </connor>
<joey> "Say it again. </joey>
<joey> "Say it again louder." </joey>
<connor> - Say it again. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's so good, dude. </joey>
<joey> I fucking, like everything about that I feel like, </joey>
<connor> even though it gets a lot of good, </connor>
<connor> people say it's very good, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it should be way bigger than it is. </connor>
<connor> It's genuinely like one of my favorite animes </connor>
<joey> that I've watched in like the past like year. </joey>
<joey> - I would agree with that. </joey>
<joey> - It's really up there. </joey>
<joey> - It's really, yeah, it's up there. </joey>
<joey> - I can't wait 'til you watch season four fully. </joey>
<garnt> - I really need to. </garnt>
<connor> - You're gonna be like, "All right, okay, hold on." </connor>
<connor> - I mean, for me right now, </connor>
<joey> it doesn't even feel like an anime, you know? </joey>
<joey> It's an American production, obviously, but- </joey>
<connor> - It's kind of like- </connor>
<connor> - We're about to get into that topic. </connor>
<joey> - It feels in the same area as "Avatar." </joey>
<joey> - "Avatar," yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I also consider "Avatar" anime. </joey>
<connor> I mean, Japanese people consider it anime, it's anime. </connor>
<joey> Like, who gives a fuck? </joey>
<connor> - I did not consider it anime </connor>
<joey> until I actually watched all of "Avatar" </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, okay, I can see </joey>
<joey> where this argument never ends. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we're getting into semantics, you know. </garnt>
<joey> It's whatever because the only thing I will say is that- </joey>
<joey> - Anime or not, it's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, anime or not, it's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> But I don't give a shit if you think it's an anime or not. </joey>
<joey> It's just a fantastic show in general. </joey>
<garnt> All I was trying to say is like, I don't think people, </garnt>
<garnt> more people in the anime community are talking about it. </garnt>
<connor> It's just 'cause it feels different. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Let me give you an anecdotal story. </connor>
<joey> I was talking to a guy and I asked him, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, what animes do you like?" </joey>
<joey> And he goes, "One anime that I watched recently </joey>
<joey> "that I really liked," this is all in Japanese, like, </joey>
<joey> "I recently watched 'Despicable Me 2.' </joey>
<joey> "It was one of my favorite animes of recent." </joey>
<joey> And I was like... </joey>
<joey> That completely- </joey>
<joey> - Hold up. </joey>
<joey> - It made me realign this whole argument of like, </joey>
<joey> is this anime, is this not? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, listen, this guy deadass, </joey>
<joey> this Otaku, self-proclaimed Otaku just told me, </joey>
<joey> "Despicable Me" is a good anime. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, you know what, why are we arguing? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's a stupid argument as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a clown argument. </garnt>
<joey> This man just killed the argument. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally just like the west versus the west. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - We made this argument out of nothing. </joey>
<joey> - The Japanese are like, "We're not part of this argument." </joey>
<garnt> - It's that Simpsons picture where like the people are </garnt>
<connor> surrounding the two monkeys fighting. </connor>
<connor> That's the Japanese watching anime fans argue </connor>
<garnt> about if this is anime or not. </garnt>
<connor> - It just felt like we were like, </connor>
<garnt> this is how all religious fighting started way back </garnt>
<garnt> in like the 100th century. </garnt>
<joey> We just made an argument out of nothing. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Because yeah, because I mean, fucking, </joey>
<joey> you ask a Japanese person, "Monsters Inc," "Shrek," </joey>
<connor> it's all anime. </connor>
<connor> - It's just crazy to me. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause in Japan anime just means animation. </connor>
<joey> - I've never just had like fucking, I got hit by a truck </joey>
<joey> when he said "Despicable Me" was an anime. </joey>
<joey> It hit me, man. </joey>
<joey> It hit me real. </joey>
<connor> Like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "This man's built different saying that </connor>
<connor> "like deadass." </connor>
<joey> - It would be a different story if it was like, </joey>
<connor> "The minions are my waifu." </connor>
<connor> Like, that would have been different. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why they're obsessed with minions here! </garnt>
<garnt> - They're obsessed with minions in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, we visited Joey's new apartment like last week, </garnt>
<joey> and Joey's- </joey>
<joey> - Slight detour. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, slight detour. </joey>
<joey> It will get back on topic because he was showing us around, </joey>
<joey> and he shows us into the last room and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, do you guys want a free gift? </joey>
<joey> "I was given a free gift from the moving department. </joey>
<joey> "Do you guys want it?" </joey>
<joey> And we're like, "Sure, Joey, what is it?" </joey>
<joey> Deadass just brings out this massive minions mini fridge </joey>
<joey> and expects us to take it. </joey>
<joey> And he takes this thing out, </joey>
<joey> and we're just looking at Joey being like, </joey>
<joey> "Joey, what do we want to do with this? </joey>
<joey> "What are we gonna do with this?" </joey>
<joey> And he was like, </joey>
<joey> "Maybe we can put it in the Trash Taste studio." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "Joey, the Trash Taste studio isn't </garnt>
<garnt> "your dumping ground." </garnt>
<joey> - "I have a gift" is roughly translated </joey>
<joey> to "I need to get rid of my trash." (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> "Please, please take it. </joey>
<joey> "I will pay money." </joey>
<garnt> - I guarantee that's what they did to Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> They're all like, "Joey, I know we're moving all the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> "for you, but here, have a free gift. </garnt>
<garnt> "Have a minions mini-fridge." </garnt>
<garnt> - And they're like, </garnt>
<joey> "Thank God, we finally got rid of that shit." </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It was despicable. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> Break time. </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Vessi. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] You're probably wondering what is Vessi? </connor>
<connor> Well, I'm glad to answer that question. </connor>
<connor> It's a comfortable, stylish, everyday sneaker </connor>
<connor> that you can wear even in winter. </connor>
<connor> And the best part about it is that it's waterproof. </connor>
<connor> - 100% waterproof shoes? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - And one of the best parts about Vessi is </connor>
<connor> that it is super easy to clean. </connor>
<connor> Just toss on some water to it </connor>
<connor> or throw it in the washing machine, and it'll be brand new. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Vessi shoes are made via Dyma-tex, </garnt>
<garnt> a dual climate knit that keeps you cool in the summer </garnt>
<garnt> and warm in the winter. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't feel like it should be waterproof at all. </garnt>
<connor> - And one of the best things about Vessi is </connor>
<connor> that it just looks like an everyday sneaker, </connor>
<connor> so you can just wear it every single day. </connor>
<connor> And I'm very lazy </connor>
<connor> and only like to have like one pair of shoes to wear, </connor>
<connor> so this is perfect for me. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Plus Vessi shoes are sustainably made </joey>
<joey> with less material waste, less water waste, </joey>
<joey> and no animal byproducts. </joey>
<joey> So, vegans can enjoy these as well. </joey>
<connor> - Also personally and I know the boys can relate, </connor>
<connor> it's rainy season right now in Japan </connor>
<connor> and having a shoe that's waterproof is very nice </connor>
<joey> because you don't have to worry </joey>
<joey> about those Goddamn massive deceptive puddles </joey>
<joey> getting your shoes and socks wet. </joey>

<connor> - Look at these boys. </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of another anime </connor>
<garnt> that has like really unique voice actors in their cast, </garnt>
<garnt> are you guys excited for "Eden?" </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I am actually. </joey>
<garnt> That is like one that I saw little bits and pieces of it. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I knew of it because our boy Kev- </garnt>
<garnt> - Our boy Kevin is doing the soundtrack. </garnt>
<garnt> - My boy Kevin is doing the soundtrack. </garnt>
<joey> - Shout out to our boy! </joey>
<connor> - Hey! </connor>
<connor> - Now we're just simping, all right. </connor>
<garnt> I'm pretty excited for it. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's one of those things that wasn't really </garnt>
<garnt> on my radar massively. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like, I know Kevin's doing the soundtrack. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm probably gonna watch so I can be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Great job, Kevin." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I wasn't excited until I saw the clips </garnt>
<garnt> that we were shown, </garnt>
<garnt> which is by the time this podcast comes out, </garnt>
<garnt> the entire series would have already been released. </garnt>
<garnt> But from the clips that we were shown, </garnt>
<garnt> I was genuinely like surprised how excited for this I was. </garnt>
<garnt> I wasn't that excited before </garnt>
<joey> because I didn't really know what it was about </joey>
<joey> or how good it was gonna be. </joey>
<joey> All I know were the names involved and what stood out </joey>
<joey> to me was of course Kevin doing the soundtrack, </joey>
<joey> so of course I was always going to watch it, </joey>
<joey> but then the cast list got released, </joey>
<joey> and people like David Tenant are in it, </joey>
<joey> Neil Patrick Harris. </joey>
<joey> I was like, what is going on? </joey>
<garnt> - I loved them in "Smurfs." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Sorry. </connor>
<joey> - My favorite movie. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it looks really good. </connor>
<connor> I mean, the clips we saw as well, </connor>
<connor> the animation looked really fucking good for that. </connor>
<connor> Like, the way they matched the 3D </connor>
<garnt> with the amazing 2D backgrounds. </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And again, the music was fucking banging. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what else to say. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of want to just wait until I watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna get too hype for it just in case. </garnt>
<garnt> But it looked good. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's literally out this week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it really? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it's gonna be a seven out of 10 for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel, I get that vibe. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe, maybe. </connor>
<connor> It depends because it depends if it's, </connor>
<connor> like how it's going to play out, </connor>
<connor> whether it's going to be one long series </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's a four episode series. </garnt>
<garnt> So is it going to be only four episodes </garnt>
<garnt> or is it gonna be like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a movie mini series kind of thing? </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I want to know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm hoping it fucks me up, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Makes me very emotional. </garnt>
<garnt> But I have a feeling they're gonna play it very safe </garnt>
<garnt> and it's gonna be quite like a safe story. </garnt>
<garnt> I just got that vibe from the clips we watched. </garnt>
<garnt> So, we'll see. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to be pleasantly surprised. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got the vibes that I was gonna feel things </garnt>
<connor> by the end of it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the same way I did in the end of "Monsters Inc." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's- - What are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - When they finally, you know, </connor>
<garnt> they got rid of Randall, that rascal. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they say goodbye to Boo. </garnt>
<connor> - They say goodbye. </connor>
<connor> It's very emotional. </connor>
<connor> - "Monsters Inc." is a great movie. </connor>
<connor> - That was a terrible example. </connor>
<connor> - I cried my eyes out. </connor>
<garnt> - I was just like, if it's anything like "Monsters Inc." </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna be happy as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - I'm only thinking of great movies right now. </connor>
<garnt> I was about to say "The Incredibles." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, no, that's fantastic. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I feel like these are the movies </connor>
<connor> that have just been memed so much that you forget- </connor>
<connor> - That they're actually bangers. </connor>
<connor> - That they're actually really good movies. </connor>
<garnt> - Why is this so hard to think of subpar movies? </garnt>
<joey> - Like the ending of "Mulan 2." </joey>
<garnt> Straight to DVD. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did not even watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't watched it either. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't even know there was a "Mulan 2." </garnt>
<joey> - There's a "Mulan 2" straight to DVD movie. </joey>
<joey> But the point is that I feel like it, </joey>
<garnt> again, I want it to be a super emotional fucks me up, </garnt>
<connor> but I just kinda got the feeling it looked pretty safe. </connor>
<connor> But again, I hope it does. </connor>
<garnt> I will watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just wondering because it was a Netflix adaptation, </garnt>
<garnt> was it cast first in English </garnt>
<garnt> or was it dubbed first in English? 'Cause that's what- </garnt>
<joey> - I thought it was an original story? </joey>
<joey> - I have a feeling it might've been cast first in English. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because these are some big fucking names </garnt>
<garnt> to put behind an anime, </garnt>
<connor> and you don't normally see these names </connor>
<connor> unless it's like a Ghibli movie </connor>
<connor> where Disney is dubbing it. </connor>
<connor> So, that's what I'm most interested about. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we talked about how, you know, </connor>
<garnt> in which order gets dubbed really does I feel affects </garnt>
<garnt> how a dub feels. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it depends, </garnt>
<connor> well, what language is the script written in? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the big question. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can't really write two scripts simultaneously </garnt>
<connor> that are like one-to-one. </connor>
<connor> So, it's... </connor>
<connor> - Oh, especially when it comes to like English and Japanese </connor>
<connor> where it's like fundamentally different. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, where the sentence structure's opposite at times. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the more I learned Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> the more I appreciate what translators have to do. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially when it comes to localization the dub. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, the more I understand Japanese, </garnt>
<joey> the more I'm just like, man, this just doesn't give, </joey>
<joey> like I get the localization thing, </joey>
<joey> but it's just sometimes a sentence </joey>
<joey> just doesn't give me the same feeling </joey>
<connor> when I'm reading in English versus hearing it in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think this is why when you first start out </connor>
<connor> as an anime fan, you really start to get into it. </connor>
<connor> You've got this thing where you're like, </connor>
<connor> "I only want pure 100% translation. </connor>
<connor> "That's all I want. </connor>
<connor> "Don't fucking, </connor>
<connor> "don't you dare change any of the meanings of the words." </connor>
<connor> I think when you get into it more </connor>
<connor> and you start watching a lot more anime </connor>
<connor> and then it becomes a bit tedious to watch anime </connor>
<connor> and you just kinda want to watch it dubbed, </connor>
<connor> you kind of start to appreciate </connor>
<connor> when they just localize it and they do it well. </connor>
<joey> - It's also the fact that sometimes there are just some, </joey>
<connor> you know, phrases and like, you know, </connor>
<joey> meanings that just don't translate at all. </joey>
<connor> - Right, again, I mean like one of the best dubs </connor>
<connor> of all time "Baccano," </connor>
<connor> like there's a lot of sentences </connor>
<joey> that were just like changed to an extent </joey>
<joey> where it's not even remotely what the guy said, </joey>
<joey> but it's the same- </joey>
<joey> - It makes sense contextually. </joey>
<joey> - It's the same kind of feeling, </joey>
<joey> but they've instead of playing it super safe, </joey>
<joey> they were like, "No, no. </joey>
<joey> "We think we could improve this for an English audience." </joey>
<joey> Which is a bold thing to do, you know? </joey>
<joey> And we've had a lot of failures. </joey>
<joey> We've had a lot of things that have gone wrong. </joey>
<garnt> - A lot of questionable ones. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I do really appreciate when it's done right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I appreciate it more so than a attempted translation </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like the actors have a way harder time </garnt>
<joey> delivering Japanese dialogue essentially. </joey>
<connor> I mean, that's what that is. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's really hard to also perform </connor>
<connor> directly translated to Japanese dialogue </connor>
<connor> to make it sound natural in English </connor>
<connor> because there's just some times where it's like, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't sound like something someone would say </connor>
<connor> in English, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like, I especially felt that more when I, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like when I did like a bit of translation work </connor>
<connor> during like school and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> and I like learned linguistics and stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, that's where I was like, </connor>
<connor> because I also used to be like, "How hard could it be? </connor>
<connor> "Just like direct translate it, you know, </connor>
<connor> "to get the meaning across." </connor>
<connor> But then when I actually started doing it, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh no, you just can't." </connor>
<connor> Like, it's not a matter of like preference </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> It's just like you physically can't. </connor>
<connor> There were just some Japanese like ways of saying things </connor>
<joey> that where you just like, if I did directly translate it, </joey>
<joey> it would just be a bunch of words that don't mean anything. </joey>
<connor> - I think, 'cause I don't know if, </connor>
<connor> even though I spoke two languages from birth, </connor>
<connor> I always thought as languages as like, </connor>
<connor> they're all just the same thing </connor>
<connor> just said in different ways. </connor>
<garnt> But then like if that makes sense </garnt>
<garnt> where everything can be one-to-one translated. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, I get what you mean. </garnt>
<joey> - Every meaning can be expressed in another language. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I think 'cause we've been spoiled 'cause things have been, </joey>
<garnt> our whole life we've just had things </garnt>
<garnt> that have been translated. </garnt>
<garnt> - So we've never known what the other side is like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's English, it's been translated for us. </garnt>
<garnt> And even again, even though I spoke two languages, </garnt>
<joey> I could never wrap my head around this concept </joey>
<joey> until I started learning Japanese </joey>
<joey> where I was like, oh, it's just like, </joey>
<connor> it's like another planet </connor>
<connor> where it hasn't even touched anything. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to describe this like mental- </connor>
<garnt> - It's so hard to describe </garnt>
<garnt> for someone who only speaks one language. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember the first time I noticed this was </garnt>
<garnt> I was watching a Thai film with Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> and I, you know, she obviously had English subtitles on, </garnt>
<joey> and as someone who speaks both Thai and can read English, </joey>
<joey> it was really distracting; </joey>
<joey> one, because it felt like I was hearing something </joey>
<joey> and seeing something and they both meant the same thing </joey>
<joey> but they felt different for me. </joey>
<connor> It's this language dissonance that I can't quite describe. </connor>
<connor> But it's something that I feel like having now trying </connor>
<connor> to learn the language that, you know, </connor>
<connor> part of a culture and part of like an entire country's, </connor>
<connor> you know, way of thinking and culture is just ingrained </connor>
<connor> into a language. </connor>
<connor> It's just so much deeper than just, </connor>
<connor> I say one thing, it means another thing. </connor>
<connor> Like, I would say that depending on what language I speak, </connor>
<connor> my personality kind of shifts as well </connor>
<connor> because it's a different kind of way of thinking </connor>
<connor> when you're speaking another language. </connor>
<garnt> It's so hard to describe </garnt>
<garnt> for anyone who only speaks one language, </garnt>
<garnt> but anyone who does speak two languages will </garnt>
<garnt> probably understand that you probably have </garnt>
<garnt> a slightly different personality speaking one language </garnt>
<joey> compared to another. </joey>
<joey> - I apparently have a completely different personality </joey>
<connor> when I speak Japanese compared to English. </connor>
<connor> - You're a lot softer. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you're a lot softer. - What in English or Japanese? </garnt>
<garnt> - Japanese. - Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - I always thought it was the opposite. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I think that's just surface level. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like I also realized as well, </connor>
<connor> 'cause, you know, sometimes you're in class or whatever, </connor>
<joey> you're asking, "Oh, how do I say this in Japanese?" </joey>
<joey> Like, no, you can't say that Japanese. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't exist in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> It's not a concept. </joey>
<joey> They've never thought of that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, oh God, you just fucking, </joey>
<joey> like flashback to me in school. </joey>
<connor> Everyone being like, "How do you say fuck in Japanese?" </connor>
<joey> I'm like, how do I explain that doesn't exist? </joey>
<connor> - And then I realized because Welsh and English, </connor>
<connor> because although they are entirely different languages, </connor>
<joey> everyone thinks, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, well Welsh is just another version of English." </joey>
<joey> It's like completely different. </joey>
<joey> It's, you know- </joey>
<joey> - But you're in the UK. </joey>
<joey> You're in the same country. </joey>
<joey> - Like, German is closer to English than Welsh is. </joey>
<joey> And it's the reason why I think </joey>
<connor> that I never had this realization before was </connor>
<connor> because it's the culture that you grew up in. </connor>
<connor> Because the countries have a similar culture </connor>
<garnt> now at least in the modern day. </garnt>
<garnt> The concepts do sort of translate </garnt>
<connor> because we've made them translate. </connor>
<connor> Like, we've made the concept felt by both. </connor>
<connor> And so that- </connor>
<joey> - There isn't like the cultural gap. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> Because the cultural gap is like inherently, </joey>
<joey> there's just sayings and stuff </joey>
<connor> that will never, ever have a meaning </connor>
<connor> no matter how much you try and translate them </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just an inherent, </connor>
<connor> it's a feeling. And it's a, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> This is just a weird concept that we're going down, </connor>
<connor> and it seems so obvious- </connor>
<garnt> - None of us are linguists. </garnt>
<connor> This is all just our thoughts </connor>
<connor> from learning a different language </connor>
<connor> and from speaking multiple languages. </connor>
<connor> But I think the best thought experiment I can think of is </connor>
<connor> like anyone who speaks English, </connor>
<connor> like how would you explain the concept of the word fuck </connor>
<connor> to someone who doesn't speak English </connor>
<connor> and somebody who didn't grow up here? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's like, it's, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know where I would begin to start, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like, if you don't know, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you didn't grow up in the culture, </connor>
<connor> if you didn't grow up with people saying it around you, </connor>
<garnt> hearing that word everywhere, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> how do I explain the right way to use the word fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I literally made a video </joey>
<joey> 'cause they made an entire textbook purely </joey>
<garnt> for the word fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've seen this. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a 70 page textbook </joey>
<connor> that goes through all the different ways you can use fuck. </connor>
<garnt> And like, I thought it was a gag at first when I bought it. </garnt>
<garnt> But then when I actually started reading, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> okay, that's how you explain it. </joey>
<joey> Apparently there is a way to explain it. </joey>
<joey> It just takes 70 pages. </joey>
<garnt> - And the fact that it takes 70 pages </garnt>
<garnt> just shows how complicated it is </garnt>
<garnt> even though for us it's just second nature </garnt>
<garnt> and it just makes sense, right? </garnt>
<joey> - And like the opposite can be said </joey>
<joey> for like Japanese to English, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, how do you explain to an English speaker </joey>
<joey> what (speaks Japanese) means? </joey>
<joey> Because like it's a purely cultural thing. </joey>
<joey> They're like, it makes complete sense in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> But then every time, like every time in anime </joey>
<joey> they say like (speaks Japanese) </joey>
<joey> There's always a different way that someone's translated. </joey>
<joey> - It's a different way to translate </joey>
<garnt> depending on the context of the scene </garnt>
<garnt> or the context of what he's saying it in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, saying, I guess so. </garnt>
<connor> Like, oh, I guess so. </connor>
<connor> It's like it's not a thing in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Can't translate it. </connor>
<connor> It's not even even in Welsh. </connor>
<connor> It's such an English thing that, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause none of the words mean what they mean altogether. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a weird concept that we just make up. </garnt>
<joey> We do that with a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I find that shit fascinating, dude. </joey>
<connor> - Bussin'. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, bussin'. </garnt>
<joey> - Bussin'. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - The fuck is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally just learned that word today. </garnt>
<garnt> Man, I couldn't even keep up with my own language. </garnt>
<garnt> How the fuck are Japanese people meant </garnt>
<garnt> to keep up with my language? </garnt>
<connor> - But going back to anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, going back to anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I appreciate voice acting so much more. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if you, </garnt>
<connor> I watched like two episodes of "Yasuke." </connor>
<connor> That was pretty good. </connor>
<joey> The voice acting I really enjoyed. </joey>
<joey> - I need to watch that as well. </joey>
<connor> - From two episodes, I wasn't really sold on the story. </connor>
<connor> Again, I knew about the, if you don't know about "Yasuke," </connor>
<connor> the plot is essentially Nobunaga </connor>
<connor> way back in the Oda period had- </connor>
<connor> - Sengoku period. </connor>
<connor> - Sengoku period, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Sengoku period had just met a black guy at a market </connor>
<connor> and was like, "I want him to fight for me." </connor>
<joey> - Based on a real person as well. </joey>
<connor> - Was one of his closest like allies, I guess. </connor>
<connor> And the story kind of expands on it. </connor>
<connor> But I saw a bunch of this on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> I thought this would be a fucking badass anime. </connor>
<connor> Shit you not like two weeks later got announced. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, I guess I should start wishing for things." </connor>
<connor> I highly encourage you to go read up about it. </connor>
<connor> It's super interesting and you wouldn't expect it. </connor>
<joey> - It's also done by LeSean Thomas. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, done by LeSean Thomas. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know who the animation studio is. </garnt>
<connor> - MAPPA. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, is it MAPPA? </garnt>
<connor> - But I do think that if you want to learn, </connor>
<connor> this is not like the best of explaining, </connor>
<garnt> at least from the first two episodes, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is wildly different from-" </garnt>
<garnt> - You said there was like magic. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's magic, there's mechs and stuff. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like- </connor>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure that didn't exist in feudal Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well yeah, I mean- </garnt>
<joey> - That was literally LeSean Thomas going, "fuck it." </joey>
<connor> - I get it, you're an anime- </connor>
<connor> - Throw everything in. </connor>
<joey> - Go crazy with it. </joey>
<joey> But in some aspects I'm also like, </joey>
<connor> this is such a fucking badass story by itself </connor>
<connor> that it doesn't need anything added. </connor>
<connor> It's so Goddamn, like the best parts of like, </connor>
<connor> again I've only watched two out of six, </connor>
<connor> the best parts of the first two episodes </connor>
<connor> where the parts were like pre, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's a time skip, </connor>
<connor> pre-time skip where there's like no magic or shit </connor>
<connor> where he's just fighting sword to sword. </connor>
<garnt> Man to man combat, it's so Goddamn good. </garnt>
<garnt> And the story and it builds on all the, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously back then there'd be a lot of issues with race. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<joey> Of course. </joey>
<joey> - They weren't too happy about it when Nobunaga was like, </joey>
<connor> "This is my best friend." </connor>
<connor> You know, and building on that was so interesting. </connor>
<connor> And I thought like the best parts of the anime were that. </connor>
<connor> And again, yeah, the story is just so cool. </connor>
<joey> Like, go read up about it. </joey>
<connor> There's tons of YouTube videos about it. </connor>
<joey> - I actually like went and like fucking researched. </joey>
<connor> - It's so fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> - The real life Yasuke just </connor>
<joey> 'cause like I had no fucking idea. </joey>
<connor> - It's a badass story. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, it's fucking badass. </garnt>
<connor> It's like it's so bizarre that it could be fictional. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you feel like the mech and magic aspects added </garnt>
<garnt> to that story or do you think it felt out of place? </garnt>
<connor> - For me personally I didn't really enjoy it. </connor>
<garnt> I was hoping- </garnt>
<garnt> - You just wanted- </garnt>
<garnt> - The story of Yasuke, that's what I wanted. </garnt>
<connor> - You wanted like a "Samurai Champloo" style like story. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of, I mean, but then again, like- </connor>
<joey> - Is that historically accurate? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Breakdancing samurai. </connor>
<connor> - There weren't magic and mechs. </connor>
<garnt> - The music in the first two episodes </garnt>
<joey> is pretty fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's really good. </joey>
<joey> The voice acting, top fucking notch. </joey>
<joey> Even the Japanese is really good. </joey>
<joey> And like, you know, even in the Japanese, </joey>
<connor> Yasuke is played by a black Japanese guy, </connor>
<connor> which is insane to see. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] That's awesome. </connor>
<connor> - It's normally not on the priority list. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, it's really cool seeing that, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> Why wouldn't you want that? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, everything else about it, I was digging. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything. </garnt>
<connor> You know, I haven't really been motivated </connor>
<connor> to watch the rest of it. </connor>
<connor> But I think that's 'cause the mechs thing's kinda put me off </connor>
<connor> and the magic and stuff. </connor>
<joey> Oh man. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, the short clips I watched of it was, </joey>
<joey> like I didn't realize it was like gonna be </joey>
<joey> that fucking bloody and gory as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, dude, it's good. </joey>
<joey> - Like, some of the scenes like reminded me </joey>
<connor> of like a 90s OVA, like "Ninja Scroll" level. </connor>
<connor> - Feels like "Kill Bill" at some points. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like "Kill Bill," "Ninja Scroll" </connor>
<joey> like levels of like, ooh! </joey>
<joey> Ooh, that's brutal! </joey>
<garnt> - It's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I still haven't seen it, but I- </garnt>
<connor> - Check it out. </connor>
<connor> - I will, I will definitely check it out. </connor>
<connor> - You'll know if it's for you in the first two episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Because like I really like LeSean Thomas' work anyway, </connor>
<connor> so I was gonna watch it. </connor>
<connor> It's just hard to find time with all the fucking anime </connor>
<connor> in the season and everything </connor>
<connor> which you two don't know about. </connor>
<connor> - Can't relate. </connor>
<connor> - I've been meaning to watch a bunch. </connor>
<connor> I've been meaning to watch "86." </connor>
<connor> - "86" is actually really good. </connor>
<connor> I probably say that's my favorite. </connor>
<connor> Oh, I can't say favorite. </connor>
<connor> It's hard. </connor>
<connor> It's definitely top three of my favorite anime </connor>
<connor> out this season right now. </connor>
<connor> And it just feels good to have an original mecha show </connor>
<connor> that just gives me the same feeling </connor>
<connor> as like some of the OG mecha shows </connor>
<connor> that made me really, really like the genre. </connor>
<connor> Because it feels like it's been so long </connor>
<connor> since we've just had a non-Gundam, non-Code Geass, </connor>
<connor> or non-big franchise mecha show </connor>
<connor> that has actually been really, really good. </connor>
<connor> Because most of the mecha shows I remember </connor>
<connor> that's been coming out recently have either been </connor>
<garnt> like "Darling in the Franxx" where I get invested </garnt>
<garnt> and it kind of does shit that falls flat, </garnt>
<garnt> or like I've really enjoyed- </garnt>
<joey> - And then triggers like let me introduce. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - And then you've had things like "SSSS Gridman" </garnt>
<garnt> which fucking amazing show, </garnt>
<joey> but it's like, it's a mecha show, </joey>
<joey> but it's also a bit tokusatsu. </joey>
<joey> So, it's not like, it's like- </joey>
<joey> - It's not like a vanilla mecha show, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Vanilla. </joey>
<joey> - Vanilla mecha where it's just mecha and that's it. </joey>
<joey> - But "86," you know, gives me the same feelings </joey>
<joey> of when I first watched "Code Geass" </joey>
<joey> or the mechs that I watched in the mid-2000s </joey>
<joey> that really made me love the fucking genre. </joey>
<connor> It's still early days. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if it's gonna be like 24 episodes </garnt>
<garnt> or 12 episodes where there's gonna be a complete story. </garnt>
<connor> I'm really hoping so. </connor>
<garnt> But it's just really, really good. </garnt>
<connor> - Fair enough. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, do you know the story of it at all? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want to know anything. </garnt>
<garnt> All I've heard that it's good. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm gonna watch it. </connor>
<joey> - Just go into it blind is the best way I think. </joey>
<garnt> - I watched "The Way of the Husband" on Netflix as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - "The Way of the Househusband." </garnt>
<garnt> - That's it, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I enjoyed it a lot. </garnt>
<joey> I thought it was very funny. </joey>
<joey> I haven't had an anime </joey>
<joey> that made me laugh out loud constantly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - For like two hours. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I thought it was gonna be </connor>
<connor> like 10 episodes, 24 minutes, </connor>
<connor> but it's like five episodes of like 12, 15 minutes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I only saw three episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I got the rest of the season to binge. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't know it was only five episodes. </connor>
<connor> - It's five episodes. </connor>
<connor> It kinda sucked that it literally just like, it just ended. </connor>
<connor> It was like, there's the last skit. </connor>
<connor> It's done. </connor>
<connor> Bye bye. </connor>
<connor> And then it was like, there was no ending or anything. </connor>
<joey> It wasn't like, "See ya next time" or anything. </joey>
<joey> It was just like, "Okay, skit over. </joey>
<connor> "Go the fuck home, get outta here." </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause each of the chapters in the manga are really, </joey>
<joey> really short, like maybe like five, six pages like max. </joey>
<connor> - I thought the pacing was fantastic. </connor>
<joey> I knew obviously it caused a lot of controversy </joey>
<garnt> with the animation. </garnt>
<garnt> I saw a lot of people complaining on Twitter. </garnt>
<connor> I couldn't decide. </connor>
<connor> I flip-flopped. </connor>
<connor> There was some sketches where I felt they did really good. </connor>
<connor> And there was some where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Holy fuck, this was so lazily done." </connor>
<connor> And it depended on the sketch. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I think it just went down to the classification </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I think we've briefly talked about this </connor>
<connor> on "Trash Taste After Dark" where like my opinion of it was </connor>
<connor> that it's not so much an anime in the traditional sense </connor>
<garnt> where it's basically just a motion comic. </garnt>
<connor> It is just a motion- </connor>
<garnt> - I wish it was labeled that and advertised as that </garnt>
<garnt> instead of anime adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel if you've labeled it </garnt>
<garnt> as "motion comic adaptation," </garnt>
<connor> then I think less people would have been interested in it, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately. </connor>
<garnt> - True, but then also you set this expectation </garnt>
<connor> that this is gonna be a thing that might happen. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I feel like it was that </garnt>
<garnt> and it being on Netflix as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Netflix really picking this up, </garnt>
<connor> which gave it like people preconceived expectations. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause to me, I watched it, I thought it was funny as fuck. </connor>
<connor> I thought the animation worked for some of the jokes. </connor>
<connor> - Again, like, it's up there with, like, </connor>
<garnt> I thought it was just as funny as like "Sakamoto" for me, </garnt>
<garnt> if not funnier. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it was so Goddamn funny, </garnt>
<garnt> and it scratched that itch </garnt>
<garnt> that I didn't know I was longing for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every single episode I was fucking cackling, </garnt>
<connor> laughing out loud alone. </connor>
<joey> - It's like that weird like surrealist comedy. </joey>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - You just don't know what he's gonna say next, </connor>
<connor> what's gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> - Every time you feel like you figured out how absurd he is, </connor>
<joey> he just does something else. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, this is fucking funny. </joey>
<garnt> If you haven't watched it, please go watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just about like a Yakuza member who gets married </garnt>
<garnt> and straightens out </garnt>
<connor> and has become a housewife, househusband. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, it's just really funny. </connor>
<connor> But it would have been at like, </connor>
<connor> it would have been a nine or a 10 for me if, </connor>
<connor> again, like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't really like the add of the motion comic style. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you think it would have been funnier </garnt>
<connor> with say just mediocre adaptation? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Mediocre animation. </garnt>
<connor> - Genuinely, yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there was so little animation on anyway </connor>
<connor> and there's just times I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I wish they just did a little bit on this </connor>
<connor> just to help sell the joke. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the lack of animation helps sell some jokes </connor>
<connor> if anything. </connor>
<connor> - I agree, I agree. </connor>
<joey> - Just some of them. </joey>
<joey> Just because some of it just looks ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> And that to me just made it more funny. </garnt>
<connor> - But imagine this anime in like "Nichijou" style. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like name another comedy anime </garnt>
<garnt> that's on "Nichijou" level. </garnt>
<connor> - There isn't, but I'm just saying like, </connor>
<connor> if you had the choice. </connor>
<garnt> - No, if I had the choice between that, </garnt>
<connor> I'd always go for fucking "Nichijou" animation </connor>
<connor> even like "KonoSuba" animation. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause "KonoSuba," I think a lot of people underestimate </connor>
<connor> how good the character animation in "KonoSuba" is. </connor>
<connor> That really sold so much of the voice acting performance </connor>
<connor> where a lot of other comedy anime I feel have fallen flat </connor>
<connor> because you have amazing voice acting performance, </connor>
<connor> you have amazing source material, </connor>
<connor> and the animation is just like- </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - The most okay animation. </connor>
<connor> It really does nothing to enhance the source material. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe I'm being too hard on it. I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I think I was just shocked at how little there was. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas with "Way of the Househusband," </garnt>
<garnt> it had amazing voice acting obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> had amazing source material, </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like because they didn't try, </garnt>
<garnt> it kind of like suited that comedy style perfectly. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like to me, </garnt>
<garnt> if you couldn't have amazing animation, </garnt>
<garnt> I would have preferred to have it have like just, </garnt>
<garnt> not even like bad animation, </garnt>
<garnt> just like a very unique style of limited animation </garnt>
<garnt> that really helps sell some of the weirder </garnt>
<garnt> and more ridiculous parts of the manga </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it is a ridiculous manga, </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like the animation style helped accentuate </garnt>
<garnt> some of the ridiculous moments to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, there's some moments where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, okay, this joke works with this animation." </connor>
<connor> There's others where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "This really needed more to help sell some of this joke." </connor>
<connor> I don't know, personally. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like maybe a mix could have </connor>
<garnt> like really, really propelled it. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you seen clips of the, </connor>
<garnt> there's a Japanese live action adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you seen this? - [Garnt] I have not. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen it, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so bad! </connor>
<connor> It's so funny! </connor>
<garnt> It's like (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's tragic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, what's that? </garnt>
<garnt> Describe it to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like, okay, the main guy, </garnt>
<joey> it looks like a cosplay. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't look- </joey>
<joey> - It is a cosplay! </joey>
<joey> - Like, it looks like a cosplay, not like an actual actor. </joey>
<connor> Like, the guy isn't like built enough. </connor>
<joey> - It is like "Full Metal Alchemist" live action level. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - And then his friend in the anime </joey>
<connor> who was really young and supposed to be </connor>
<connor> like the young gang member looks really fucking old </connor>
<connor> and like- </connor>
<joey> - I didn't watch it like fully. </joey>
<connor> I only watched like clips of it on YouTube, </connor>
<joey> and I was just like, "Oh no." </joey>
<connor> - It's bad. </connor>
<connor> I watched the same skit, both of them and compared. </connor>
<connor> The humor wasn't nearly as good in the live action. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I feel like they didn't like, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause with animation you can really sell the absurdity </garnt>
<garnt> and the live action one- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the point, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it didn't work very well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Also Japanese acting in TV shows, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how they are so bad, </garnt>
<garnt> but I've never seen Japanese acting in a TV show </garnt>
<garnt> and been like, "That's fantastic." </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless it's like Ken Watanabe. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally, it's like he's the only one. </connor>
<connor> I feel bad saying that </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like that's such a broad statement, </connor>
<connor> but I've watched so much Japanese TV </connor>
<connor> and all the drama acting is appalling. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's not good. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in like the live action. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, especially when a live action anime adaptation </garnt>
<connor> of a Japanese TV show or a Japanese anime, </connor>
<connor> it's always, it's so weird seeing live action actors try </connor>
<connor> to act like anime characters </connor>
<garnt> or doing like the anime style acting. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you watch like Korean dramas </connor>
<connor> and Korean adaptations and stuff, and it's so much better. </connor>
<connor> I watched like "Sweet Home," </connor>
<joey> the web tune adaptation into Netflix, </joey>
<joey> and the actors were fucking amazing in it. </joey>
<joey> - There's a live action adaptation? </joey>
<joey> - Live action. - Oh shit, I gotta watch that. </joey>
<joey> - And the acting was really fucking good. </joey>
<joey> Like, every single time I've watched a Korean movie </joey>
<joey> or Korean drama, I'm always so impressed </joey>
<joey> at how fucking good, not to say that the actors are bad. </joey>
<joey> But I just thought for some reason, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I've seen Japanese acting. </joey>
<garnt> It's gonna be over the top dramatic all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like, especially in recent years, </garnt>
<connor> Korean movies and Korean dramas and shows have just like, </connor>
<connor> they are like, </connor>
<garnt> they are way ahead of like Japanese J dramas and J movies. </garnt>
<connor> - So many movies where I'm like fucking compared to English, </connor>
<connor> it like shits on them. </connor>
<connor> Like, some of the, </connor>
<connor> like "Old Boy," like I love that movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking. </garnt>
<connor> And that's actually based on a manga, did you know? </connor>
<joey> - I didn't know that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, "Old Boy" was originally a manga. </joey>
<connor> It got adapted into a Korean movie. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's cool. </connor>
<connor> - That movie is like one of my favorite movies </connor>
<joey> of all time. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - The acting is so Goddamn good in that movie. </joey>
<joey> - The cinematography is fantastic. </joey>
<garnt> - That's one of the greatest foreign films of all time, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's, you know, it's up there with like "Parasite" </garnt>
<garnt> as like, to me, as one of the best Korean movies I've seen. </garnt>
<connor> There are so many good Korean movies, right? </connor>
<connor> And I feel like people are now just figuring out </connor>
<connor> that man, Koreans make good movies. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, they're very good. </connor>
<connor> - "Train to Busan" as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's a fantastic movie. </connor>
<connor> - I remember first time watching "Train to Busan" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I've seen zombie movies. </connor>
<connor> "I know how this works." </connor>
<connor> And for some reason it didn't do like, </connor>
<connor> on like, you know, on paper, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't do that much different </connor>
<garnt> to every other zombie movie. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's just so fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't pinpoint why it was so good, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just... </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know what it is, like when I watch Japanese TV, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's like a pantomime. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It does feel like that level of acting where it's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Is there somebody behind me? </garnt>
<garnt> "I better not look." </garnt>
<garnt> And then, "Whoa!" </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like with Japanese acting, </connor>
<connor> it's very reminiscent to anime, anime acting, </connor>
<connor> which anime acting works for anime, </connor>
<garnt> but it doesn't work for live action acting at all. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, well I was asking some friends, I'm like, oh, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was watching with them, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Are they famous? </connor>
<connor> "Are they famous?" </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Oh yeah, they're a famous voice actor." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, when you're a famous voice actor, </connor>
<joey> you can get roles in TV shows. </joey>
<joey> And it's kind of strange </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's normally the other way around </joey>
<joey> with, you know, western stuff. </joey>
<joey> It's just odd to think. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like as someone who does voice acting, </joey>
<joey> it does not translate to the IRL acting. </joey>
<joey> Like- </joey>
<joey> - It's a completely different skillset. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, you understand the fundamentals of acting, </joey>
<joey> but you know, can you hit the mark? </joey>
<joey> You know, you're not being told how to walk. </joey>
<joey> You're not being told how to act physically. </joey>
<joey> That's what you do have to learn. </joey>
<garnt> That is separate. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a lot you don't think about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wonder why? </garnt>
<garnt> I sit there and I'm just confused. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, why is Japanese acting like generally not as good? </connor>
<connor> Not saying that there's zero Japanese good actors, </connor>
<connor> just saying in general the TV production is </connor>
<connor> pretty lackluster. </connor>
<joey> - I think maybe it's because like they don't really think of </joey>
<connor> like outside of Japan movie industry </connor>
<connor> as much of a competition. </connor>
<connor> Like, they might think it's like, </connor>
<connor> because you know, with like, you know, Hollywood films, </connor>
<connor> like English speaking films, </connor>
<connor> like, you're not only competing with Hollywood, </connor>
<connor> but you're competing </connor>
<connor> with literally every other English speaking country, </connor>
<connor> every other English speaking production. </connor>
<connor> Whereas I feel the Japanese film industry is kind of </connor>
<joey> in its own bubble. </joey>
<joey> They're kind of just like- </joey>
<connor> - No driving force. </connor>
<joey> - There's no like driving force or like threat </joey>
<joey> to make them be like, "We gotta step up our game." </joey>
<joey> Or like, or maybe the fact that like, </joey>
<joey> they're probably like just unaware. </joey>
<joey> They probably just think like, "Well, you know, </joey>
<joey> "English speaking productions and like other productions </joey>
<joey> "that aren't Japanese do this in this way, </joey>
<joey> "but for us, this works with our type of audience." </joey>
<joey> So, there's no like they probably don't even think </joey>
<joey> this is bad acting. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm sure people are gonna comment and be like, </connor>
<connor> "There are so many good Japanese films." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there are. </garnt>
<connor> - There are a lot of good Japanese films. </connor>
<joey> But it's a lot rarer to find a really, really good Japanese- </joey>
<joey> - They come few and far in between. </joey>
<garnt> Especially in like J dramas, I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - J dramas is even harder. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy fuck, that's what I mean. </garnt>
<connor> That's where you really see the pinnacle. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the right way to describe J dramas </connor>
<garnt> from like the majority I've watched is </garnt>
<connor> just they are very campy. - Yeah, that's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> It's pantomime. </connor>
<connor> Everything is fucking over the top. </connor>
<connor> - It's so campy. </connor>
<connor> And, you know, there's an audience for that. </connor>
<connor> And there's like a, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's, you know, I do enjoy some J dramas, </connor>
<garnt> but it's less of, "I think this is a good show" </garnt>
<garnt> and more just like, "I can just get behind this show. </garnt>
<garnt> "You know, I like whatever source material it's adapting." </garnt>
<connor> - And also I don't, frankly, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck about cinematography. </connor>
<connor> I don't really care too much. </connor>
<joey> I'm not very picky, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's good because J drama has zero cinematography. </joey>
<joey> - J dramas they shoot it </joey>
<joey> like a fucking daytime TV commercial. </joey>
<connor> Why does it look like that? </connor>
<connor> Like, I never thought I would give a shit about that </connor>
<connor> until I watched J drama. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the point. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't give a about cinematography </garnt>
<garnt> until you see something that has no cinematography. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, what are you gonna fucking advertise to me a plunger </connor>
<connor> that has four and one any second now. </connor>
<connor> Waiting for it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause of how it's shot. </connor>
<connor> It's ridiculous. I don't know why it looks like that. </connor>
<garnt> It's so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like I've seen some YouTube videos </garnt>
<connor> with better cinematography than some of the stuff out there. </connor>
<connor> in J dramas right now. </connor>
<connor> - Broaden in Japan channels. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - 100%. </joey>
<connor> That'll make up for the lack of his signature. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I hate shitting on it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't really understand why. </connor>
<connor> I don't really know if they care. </connor>
<connor> I don't really know if there's a want to improve. </connor>
<garnt> - I just don't think the audience is there. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, the audience doesn't give a shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, it's normal, </connor>
<connor> I mean, the majority of the population here is older. </connor>
<joey> So generally- </joey>
<joey> - To be fair, I have seen a bunch of J dramas </joey>
<joey> where the cinematography is absolute ass, </joey>
<connor> but I've still enjoyed it </connor>
<connor> because the story was just genuinely really, really good. </connor>
<connor> And it wasn't until like, </connor>
<joey> it was like an afterthought of like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, that was a good J drama." </joey>
<joey> But the cinematography was shit. </joey>
<connor> - I saw this one and it was like, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like a James Bond show. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, this Japanese guy looked </connor>
<connor> like Japanese George Clooney. </connor>
<connor> It was really cool. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Holy shit, this guy's hot." </joey>
<joey> - I think I know who you're talking about actually. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, he looks kind of western. </connor>
<connor> - He looks western, </connor>
<connor> but I looked it up and he's 100% Japanese. </connor>
<connor> But he looks like George Clooney if he was Japanese. </connor>
<joey> - I think I know who you're talking about. </joey>
<joey> I don't know his name. </joey>
<joey> - And he was just like a no nonsense attitude guy. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "I'm coming to get the information." </joey>
<joey> And just like beat this guy up. </joey>
<joey> With terrible lighting and cinematography. </joey>
<joey> But it was like, really? </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I'm talking about this. </joey>
<joey> I was just fascinated by him. </joey>
<joey> I was like that man's so Goddamn hot. </joey>
<connor> Good for him. I wish I was that hot. </connor>
<joey> - Because I've always 'cause I've had the movie experience </joey>
<joey> of, "Wow, this movie has fucking fantastic cinematography. </joey>
<connor> "Unfortunately the rest of the movie is shit." </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> What was that movie? </garnt>
<garnt> It was the something still water or something </garnt>
<joey> where it's like... </joey>
<joey> No, no. </joey>
<joey> It was originally supposed to be the Bioshock movie, </joey>
<garnt> but then they like changed it halfway through. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I do not know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you want to- - Yeah, let me look it up. </garnt>
<garnt> I know exactly what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But like the movie had like the most </garnt>
<joey> like amazing fucking cinematography. </joey>
<joey> It looked fucking incredible. </joey>
<joey> Like, it was stylized perfectly, </joey>
<garnt> really creepy cinematography. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look it up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I remember. </joey>
<joey> "A Cure For Wellness." </joey>
<connor> - I haven't seen that movie. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's a horror movie. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the horror movie. </connor>
<connor> "A Cure For Wellness." </connor>
<connor> That was apparently, </connor>
<connor> that was originally supposed to be the Bioshock movie. </connor>
<garnt> And you can tell- </garnt>
<garnt> - Looks nothing like Bioshock. </garnt>
<joey> - No, obviously they like completely changed the story. </joey>
<joey> - That threw me off </joey>
<garnt> when you said it's meant to be the Bioshock movie. </garnt>
<joey> - Supposedly it was supposed to be the Bioshock movie, </joey>
<joey> but then something happened legality wise, </joey>
<joey> and they were like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, time to rewrite the story completely." </joey>
<joey> But like when you just look at the cinematography </joey>
<joey> and like the sets and stuff like that, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I can kind of see what they were going for." </joey>
<joey> Like, this looks cool. </joey>
<joey> It's very stylized. </joey>
<joey> Cinematography is great. </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately, the story was like, what? </joey>
<joey> Like, what the fuck is happening? </joey>
<joey> Nothing makes sense. </joey>
<joey> Characters were all shit. </joey>
<joey> So, like that's when I got to the point, I was like, </joey>
<joey> would I have preferred this movie </joey>
<joey> if it had shit cinematography but a good story </joey>
<joey> versus great cinematography but a shit story? </joey>
<garnt> - And this is like the animation versus story debate </garnt>
<joey> that anime fans go through. </joey>
<joey> - Like, which do you prefer? </joey>
<garnt> If you had to choose. </garnt>
<joey> - Story, story. </joey>
<joey> But it has to be well acted. </joey>
<connor> You can't sell me on a bad story with not with actors </connor>
<connor> who don't sell the moment. </connor>
<connor> - "The Room" is pretty good. </connor>
<connor> "The Room" is pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's a masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> - A unique exception. </connor>
<connor> - But that's called brilliant acting. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what you're talking about. (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What a top grade actor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, no. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, I feel like, </joey>
<joey> I guess watching a lot of J dramas reminds me of </joey>
<connor> like the old Thai soap operas I would see my mom watching </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, what the fuck is this, Mom? </connor>
<connor> Like, what the hell are you watching? </connor>
<connor> - Like the Indian shows as well. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like that's just a genre of itself </connor>
<connor> where you got like the campiest, </connor>
<connor> most melodrama shit going on. </connor>
<connor> Don't know what's going on. </connor>
<connor> You see out of context clips. </connor>
<joey> I think even some Korean dramas do this as well. </joey>
<joey> It's just not as well known. </joey>
<joey> Like, I remember seeing one clip </joey>
<joey> where it was a Korean drama and- </joey>
<joey> - The one where he's falling down the stairs? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, that's the Bollywood one. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's the Bollywood one. </joey>
<joey> The one I was thinking of where this woman, </joey>
<garnt> this guy says something and this woman takes this entire </garnt>
<garnt> like fucking cabbage of kimchi and just slaps this guy. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I just like, I just want to know the context of this. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause out of context it just makes no sense. </connor>
<joey> - We just have to remind our audience </joey>
<joey> that this is a Korean production. </joey>
<joey> Bring out the kimchi. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Didn't like, didn't Pewdiepie react </connor>
<connor> to like a Bollywood clip </connor>
<garnt> and then there was like drama or something about it? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, they like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it? - I swear there was drama. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm remembering this incorrectly, </garnt>
<garnt> but like there was like a clip that he reacted to </garnt>
<connor> and it was 'cause there was like a reaction image </connor>
<connor> where she was like (gasps) </connor>
<connor> and then it was like 20 shots of like zooming in. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's the woman falling off </joey>
<connor> like the balustrade, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is that what it is? - Oh, I've seen that one! </connor>
<connor> - And the guy's like slow motion trying to catch him. </connor>
<connor> But it's like going back and forth. </connor>
<garnt> And it's like this woman's been in the air for five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It's a second floor. </garnt>
<joey> - This woman's like literally fucking airbending </joey>
<connor> right in front of my eyes. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's just like watching it in slow motion. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking hilarious. </connor>
<connor> I love that. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so funny. </garnt>
<connor> - I swear he got into some spat or something because of it. </connor>
<connor> You keep talking. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I would love to react to Indian soap operas </garnt>
<connor> out of context. </connor>
<connor> I feel like there's every other soap opera, </connor>
<garnt> and then there's just Indian soap opera. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> They take campiness to the next level, and it's so amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever seen like many Bollywood movies? </garnt>
<joey> - There was a period in my life </joey>
<garnt> where I tried to get into Bollywood movies. </garnt>
<garnt> But the problem is is that there are so many fucking films </garnt>
<joey> in the Bollywood like scene. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I didn't realize how many movies they made. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, they make like fucking five, 10 times </joey>
<joey> as much as like Hollywood. </joey>
<joey> It's insane. </joey>
<joey> So, I'm just like, I legitimately was like, </joey>
<joey> where the fuck do I even begin? </joey>
<joey> Because like I don't know anybody else </joey>
<garnt> who like has stepped into that territory. </garnt>
<garnt> And so like my only other option was to like go </garnt>
<joey> on the internet and be like, "best Bollywood movies." </joey>
<joey> - Top 10 Bollywood films of all time. </joey>
<joey> Thank you, Watch Mojo. </joey>
<joey> Here's my watch list right now. </joey>
<joey> - But then every fucking like top 10, top 50 list I saw was </joey>
<joey> just like all completely, </joey>
<joey> there wasn't a single like entry where it was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I saw that on this page." </joey>
<joey> It's all fucking different. </joey>
<connor> So I'm like, what do I just have to like- </connor>
<connor> - Number one, "Slumdog Millionaire." </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Do I literally just have to like... </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's a great movie though. </joey>
<connor> - It's not Bollywood. </connor>
<connor> But I remember when that came out, </connor>
<joey> people were like yeah, I like Bollywood. </joey>
<joey> - "Slumdog Millionaire." </joey>
<connor> - It's good, it's good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I'm like, do I just have to like bite the bullet </connor>
<connor> and just like pick a random one </connor>
<connor> and just like hope that it's a good movie? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Please let us know in the comments. </garnt>
<joey> What's a good Bollywood film? </joey>
<joey> - The only one I can remember that I watched </joey>
<connor> that I think is really good is a film called "Three Idiots." </connor>
<connor> And the only reason I watched it was </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was on the IMDb top 100 at the time. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What is this?" </connor>
<joey> And it's a concept I feel like that was made for Indians. </joey>
<joey> Because it's a film, get this, about engineers. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I think it was like actual, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember if they were all mechanical engineers </connor>
<connor> or electrical engineers. </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> They were engineers. </connor>
<connor> - It was just so weird seeing this engineering movie </connor>
<connor> and then out of nowhere they just break out into song </connor>
<connor> and dance. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - There's nothing I hate more than fucking musicals. </connor>
<joey> I cannot stand- </joey>
<joey> - You don't like musicals? </joey>
<joey> - I hate musicals. </joey>
<joey> - I actually agree with Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, if I want a musical, </joey>
<joey> I'll fucking pause the movie and go on Spotify </joey>
<joey> and play Daft Punk four minutes. </joey>
<connor> Don't get in the way, man. </connor>
<connor> I hate musicals so Goddamn much. </connor>
<connor> I cannot, I would rather do anything else. </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, I'm very hit or miss with musicals. </joey>
<connor> Like, a lot of musicals I'm just like fucking whatever. </connor>
<connor> But then if you like, </connor>
<connor> like I could watch like "Rocky Horror" like 30 times. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like to me musical works well on like </garnt>
<joey> when it's a stage, you know, when it's- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When you're watching it live, </joey>
<connor> it's a really, really amazing experience. </connor>
<joey> Like, I remember watching "Les Miserables." </joey>
<joey> I'm sure I fucking butchered that. </joey>
<joey> - Less Miserables. </joey>
<joey> - Les Miserables. </joey>
<joey> I remember watching that in England at the West End. </joey>
<garnt> Fucking amazing experience. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember watching the movie, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "This is really boring." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched it for the first time like pretty recently </connor>
<connor> just 'cause Aki was like, "Oh, you have to watch it." </connor>
<connor> - No, you don't. </connor>
<joey> - "It's great." </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, okay, well, you know, </joey>
<connor> I always give musicals a go, so it's whatever. </connor>
<connor> This might be the rare time where, </connor>
<connor> like "Rocky Horror" where it's like, </connor>
<connor> oh I might fucking fall in love with it. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, Goddamn, they haven't stopped singing </joey>
<connor> for like two hours. </connor>
<connor> - It just feels like a fucking quick time event. </connor>
<connor> Like, when you're in a musical. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "I guess I'll press X. </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, I'll press X." </connor>
<connor> It just feels like it doesn't fucking end. </connor>
<connor> It's like unskippable cutscenes and shit. </connor>
<connor> It's like, get this shit outta here. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what I like about like "Rocky Horror" for instance, </joey>
<joey> is that like; one, it's fucking weird, </joey>
<joey> two, it's fucking Tim Curry in like leggings </joey>
<joey> which is just like amazing just conceptually. </joey>
<joey> But like what I like about "Rocky Horror" </joey>
<joey> compared to like say like "Les Miserables" is like, </joey>
<joey> "Les Miserables" is just like 90% singing </joey>
<joey> and then 10% dialogue. </joey>
<joey> Whereas "Rocky Horror" is like 50/50. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like you get the enjoyment of like an actual movie </joey>
<joey> like type of story </joey>
<joey> and every now and then it goes into like song. </joey>
<garnt> - But when I'm watching a musical, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> just get to the story. </joey>
<joey> Why am I here? </joey>
<joey> I don't care about the song and dance. </joey>
<garnt> Just get to the story. </garnt>
<garnt> Give me the story. </garnt>
<connor> - The only time I actually think I liked a musical was, </connor>
<connor> what is it? </connor>
<connor> "Little Shop of Horrors" right? </connor>
<connor> That has like a lot of music in it. </connor>
<connor> The one with the big plant. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - That's a musical, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think I liked that </connor>
<connor> 'cause it made the thing fucking terrifying </connor>
<connor> when it started singing. </connor>
<connor> It sold me on the horror </connor>
<joey> 'cause when this giant plant puppet started singing, </joey>
<connor> as like a 15-year-old kid I was like, "Holy shit!" </connor>
<joey> - It's like the kind of like jazzy style, like yeah! </joey>
<connor> - It was terrifying. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Did you ever watch "Bugsy Malone" as a kid? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - "Bugsy Malone." </connor>
<connor> - I know the name. </connor>
<joey> I don't know anything about it though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's, I can't remember </connor>
<connor> 'cause I only have vivid memories of watching as a kid. </connor>
<connor> All I know it was like, it's like set in like, you know, </connor>
<connor> in the prohibition era. </connor>
<connor> And it's about a bunch of people running speakeasies. </connor>
<connor> But for some reason, everyone of the gangsters </connor>
<connor> who are, you know, who are in this movie, </connor>
<connor> everyone's played by kids. </connor>
<connor> And when they have Tommy guns, instead of firing bullets, </connor>
<connor> they fire like a cream pie. </connor>
<connor> So, whenever someone gets hit by a cream pie in the face, </connor>
<connor> they're dead. </connor>
<connor> Like, thinking back as a kid, it's the most like, </connor>
<connor> this is the weirdest fever dream I'm describing right now. </connor>
<joey> But it exists! </joey>
<joey> - This sounds like a David Lynch film, you know? </joey>
<connor> It's like that weird. </connor>
<joey> - It sounds like on the same level </joey>
<joey> as what are those fucking dogs called? </joey>
<connor> The movies where they just like dub over dogs? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - It was literally like Air Buddy or some shit. </connor>
<connor> It's like a whole fucking series. </connor>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<joey> Like "Snow Dogs." </joey>
<connor> Like, that level. </connor>
<joey> - It sounds like that </joey>
<connor> where they just fucking dub over dogs doing shit. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - I've been trying to find someone else in my life </garnt>
<garnt> who also has this vivid memory of watching "Bugsy Malone" </garnt>
<connor> as a kid 'cause I just want to reconfirm that it's real. </connor>
<connor> That this was real! </connor>
<connor> It really happened! </connor>
<connor> I just need to know, okay? </connor>
<connor> So far I've, you know, maybe it was just my school thing. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it was my generation thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But I have not met a single other person IRL </connor>
<garnt> who remembers watching "Bugsy Malone." </garnt>
<garnt> So, please comment section, </garnt>
<garnt> if there's someone in the comments section who knows </garnt>
<garnt> who has watched "Bugsy Malone" before, please, </garnt>
<garnt> please tell me 'cause I need to know I'm not fucking crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to know this wasn't a fever dream. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to know if this really happened. </garnt>
<joey> - Everyone in the comments, just be like, "I have no idea." </joey>
<joey> - It was a musical so- </joey>
<joey> - It's a musical as well? </joey>
<joey> No. - That's why I remember it. </joey>
<garnt> It was a musical. </garnt>
<joey> - Real question though, did you guys watch the "Cats" movie? </joey>
<connor> - No, I didn't. </connor>
<connor> - I saw half. </connor>
<joey> - Why did you watch it? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was just like, 'cause I, </joey>
<joey> who doesn't look at that trailer and think, </joey>
<joey> "This looks like shit. </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna watch it." </joey>
<connor> - Like, you know when you just see ads so often </connor>
<connor> for something that you've decided </connor>
<connor> you're gonna dislike this thing before you see anything. </connor>
<connor> That was me with "Cats" 'cause it was just everywhere </connor>
<connor> and it was so obnoxious. </connor>
<connor> And they do that thing with like, </connor>
<connor> "This has never been done before. </connor>
<connor> "This has literally never been done before." </connor>
<connor> Like, they just say that about anything. </connor>
<connor> Like, "We've never had this. </connor>
<joey> "We've never experienced this. </joey>
<connor> "We all felt amazing on the set." </connor>
<joey> I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<joey> - The thing is with "Cats" is that I've seen it </joey>
<joey> on stage before. </joey>
<joey> And like, I actually thought, not my favorite musical, </joey>
<connor> but I was like, okay, </connor>
<joey> out of all the musicals I've seen on stage, </joey>
<joey> it's pretty all right. </joey>
<joey> It's pretty decent. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's a good story. </joey>
<joey> The songs are pretty all right. </joey>
<joey> But then when you watch that trailer, </joey>
<joey> and you see the horrific things in that trailer, </joey>
<joey> you're just like, "Well, you have piqued my interest now." </joey>
<joey> Fucking green screen like huge artists, </joey>
<joey> like on these like fucking cat like, </joey>
<joey> basically these huge actors being furries. </joey>
<connor> - I swear there was like really funny, like cast interviews. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Where like the cast were like, "I don't fucking know." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> "What do you want me to say?" </connor>
<connor> I love it when actors like give interviews </connor>
<connor> and they just fucking shit on what they're in. </connor>
<joey> There's something really cathartic about it. </joey>
<connor> And like they're like, "Yeah, it sucks." </connor>
<joey> - Like, the fucking Robert Patterson one. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the Robert Patterson one. </connor>
<connor> "I can't fucking stand Twilight." </connor>
<connor> Like, Robert Patterson please. </connor>
<connor> Have we spoke about this before on the podcast? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we were talking about it before in private. </connor>
<joey> - Robert Patterson hated being in "Twilight" </joey>
<garnt> and his interviews about it are so fucking funny. </garnt>
<connor> Like Daniel Craig in James Bond. </connor>
<garnt> - Did we talk about this? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't remember. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally can't remember if we talked about this </connor>
<connor> on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> - Apologies if we said it already. </connor>
<garnt> - We must've spoke about it on set I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Daniel Craig hates being in 007, in "James Bond." </garnt>
<garnt> The interviews that he gave were so fucking funny. </garnt>
<connor> He did like a quote where he said like, </connor>
<connor> "I'd rather cut myself than do another Bond film." </connor>
<connor> And then he did another Bond film. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's so funny. </connor>
<connor> It's just like- </connor>
<connor> - It's so tragic. </connor>
<connor> - It's like imagine getting hired back again </connor>
<connor> by the people you're just shitting on. </connor>
<joey> "I would rather die than work for you again." </joey>
<connor> - And they're like, "Let's get him back on." </connor>
<connor> - "Let's get this guy back." </connor>
<joey> Like, how out of options must they be </joey>
<joey> to have to like bring Daniel Craig back in. </joey>
<joey> They must have thrown so much money. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I'm pretty sure he must've signed a contract </garnt>
<joey> before otherwise it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause you know, if you break contract, </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure that you're just like blacklisted </joey>
<joey> from Hollywood, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's why like no one really breaks contracts. </joey>
<joey> - Either that or they must have given Daniel Craig </joey>
<joey> a fat fucking paycheck. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure they gave him a lot of money. </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure they gave him a lot of money. </joey>
<connor> - Didn't they have to do something 'cause he like. </connor>
<connor> in the, which movie was it? </connor>
<connor> What was the most recent film? </connor>
<garnt> - The one after "Skyfall" right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the one after "Skyfall." </connor>
<joey> - There was one after "Skyfall?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - God, I'm so behind on my Bond movies. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, there was one where in the casino, </connor>
<connor> it was a casino scene, </connor>
<connor> where he like- </connor>
<garnt> - I was about to say. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - "Spectre." </joey>
<connor> - Type in Daniel Craig gloves. </connor>
<connor> There was a thing where they had to like CGI </connor>
<connor> I think gloves on or off of him because he just left them on </connor>
<connor> because he liked them or something. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, he bought gloves before like filming </connor>
<connor> and he really wanted to wear them, </connor>
<connor> and so they had to like CGI the gloves off of him. </connor>
<connor> Because he wanted to wear them. </connor>
<connor> Is that right? </connor>
<connor> Can you Google it? </connor>
<connor> It was something like that. </connor>
<connor> He was so fucking done with this shit </connor>
<connor> that he impulse bought gloves and was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm wearing them on the film. I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> And they had to CGI them off of him! </joey>
<joey> - CGI artists like cracking their necks being like, </joey>
<connor> all right. </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't do that just out of feeling horrible </connor>
<connor> to the people who have to work on that CGI. </connor>
<connor> But you've got to respect the level of </connor>
<garnt> "I don't give a fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> - Just a new level of just, yeah, don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the most passive aggressive way of being like, </joey>
<joey> "Don't call me back, please." </joey>
<connor> - You're literally on like a half a billion dollar movie </connor>
<connor> and you just don't give a fuck </connor>
<joey> about wearing your like $2,200 gloves. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Ah, who cares?" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's also just like the choice of gloves as well </joey>
<joey> of all things you could have put on is </joey>
<joey> just like the biggest fuck you. </joey>
<connor> - Just, I don't know what about it- </connor>
<joey> - Hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - It's just so cathartic to just hear this. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> It's so funny just hearing individuals be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Fuck you, big movie corporation. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm going to do what I want." </garnt>
<garnt> And then they just roll with it. </garnt>
<connor> They're like, "I guess we'll fix it in post?" </connor>
<garnt> - "I guess we can't get him to take his gloves off?" </garnt>
<garnt> - "Skyfall" yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And he's in the new one as well. </connor>
<joey> And I think the new one is supposedly his last one. </joey>
<joey> But it got delayed because of COVID. </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's what they said </joey>
<connor> about "Skyfall" as well. </connor>
<joey> - They said that about like the last three films. </joey>
<joey> But they don't know who's gonna replace him. </joey>
<joey> - That's so weird. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember a time like, you know, </joey>
<joey> in like the late 90s, early 2000s where like, </joey>
<joey> I feel every "James Bond" movie, </joey>
<joey> there was a different James Bond. </joey>
<garnt> - No, they did like two or three I think each at least. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like they were like replacing them </garnt>
<garnt> like quicker than Daniel Craig, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I mean- </garnt>
<garnt> - Pierce Brosnan did a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pierce Brosnan did five maybe? </garnt>
<joey> - But he probably also enjoyed it unlike Daniel Craig. </joey>
<connor> - I think he got his paycheck and he yeeted out. </connor>
<garnt> I think he got what he got. </garnt>
<garnt> - What else has Daniel Craig done </garnt>
<garnt> apart from "James Bond" recently? </garnt>
<connor> - He's done a few pretty good films. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember any off the top of my head. </connor>
<connor> He did, like, I really liked him in like "Layer Cake." </connor>
<garnt> - Oh! </garnt>
<garnt> "Layer Cake!" </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a really British film. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've completely forgot about that. </garnt>
<connor> - I like him in everything else but "James Bond." </connor>
<connor> I think he's really good in everything but "James Bond." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I feel like in "Layer Cake," </garnt>
<connor> he also just played Daniel Craig, right? </connor>
<connor> - But he played it better. </connor>
<connor> - He just kind of played James Bond in a different skin. </connor>
<garnt> You know, it was... </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of very felt James Bond. </garnt>
<joey> - It was Daniel Craig playing James Bond </joey>
<joey> playing Daniel Craig. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I feel like James Bond is just an outdated archetype. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it is as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - You watch it nowadays and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> they've tried their best to kind of- </garnt>
<garnt> - Modernize it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it still feels like </garnt>
<connor> when they're trying to put like the Playboy scenes in, </connor>
<connor> you're like, this is kind of cringe nowadays. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why, but just seeing a guy just go, </joey>
<joey> "Yes, I'm going to fuck these two women." </joey>
<joey> It's like, all right, okay, sure. </joey>
<joey> - We get it, man. </joey>
<joey> You get pussy. </joey>
<joey> - What did you match them on Tinder? </joey>
<joey> - Don't have to brag about it. </joey>
<joey> - It just felt very like nowadays, </joey>
<connor> it just feels like, oh, this feels kind of lame. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's a very dated archetype. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I can't imagine anyone, </garnt>
<connor> like imagine if I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "My name is Maneetapho. </connor>
<connor> "Garnt, Maneetapho." </connor>
<garnt> - That's you with the outfit. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> The glasses, right? </connor>
<connor> - You're wearing the turtleneck. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Well, that's why I really enjoyed "Kingsman," right? </garnt>
<joey> - "The names Job. </joey>
<joey> "Steve Handjobs." </joey>
<connor> - Steve Handjobs. </connor>
<connor> - "Kingsman" was good until the second movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. That's why I really liked the first movie </joey>
<joey> because it completely just like almost made fun of that. </joey>
<connor> - That was really good. </connor>
<joey> I really liked it. </joey>
<joey> And then it became the archetype. </joey>
<joey> - And then it became the archetype, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> How the fuck did we get on about James Bond films? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't fucking, we were talking about musicals. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, have you ever, </connor>
<connor> I was thinking about- </connor>
<connor> - We're really good at tangents today. </connor>
<connor> - I was thinking about musicals I actually like. </connor>
<joey> The only ones I probably actually like were </joey>
<joey> the "South Park Movie." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that is a musical, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - And you guys ever see "The Book of Mormon" live? </connor>
<connor> - That's literally been the one, </connor>
<garnt> the musical that I've always wanted to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fucking amazing musical. </garnt>
<connor> And the reason I like those musicals is the music is funny </connor>
<connor> and it plays off the joke. </connor>
<joey> And it doesn't like, I don't care about the story. </joey>
<joey> - Me no think, me laugh. </joey>
<joey> - I don't care about the story of South Park, </joey>
<connor> I'm there for the jokes. </connor>
<connor> And that helps add onto the jokes. </connor>
<connor> And that's why it's the only musical I can get behind. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, I'm not really that much of a Broadway </garnt>
<garnt> or West End guy, so I've only seen- </garnt>
<garnt> - Really, Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> I thought you were. </connor>
<garnt> - You seem like a Broadway kind of gentleman. </garnt>
<joey> - Stop you from singing, Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> - Do I seem like a theater kid to you? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Have you ever been tempted </joey>
<joey> to go watch like the anime like musicals? </joey>
<joey> Have you seen any of them? </joey>
<garnt> - Tempted, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - They restarted the "Death Note" one, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - How does that work? </joey>
<connor> - I've been so tempted to go and watch it just to say </connor>
<joey> I went to go see a "Death Note" musical. </joey>
<garnt> Or like the "Prince of Tennis" musical. </garnt>
<garnt> I really wanna go. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - That idea wasn't in my head, but now it is in my head. </joey>
<joey> - I've been trying to find people to come with me </joey>
<joey> to go watch like any of the anime musicals </joey>
<joey> just because there's something like defeatist </joey>
<joey> about being like, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, so I went to go watch the Death Note musical </connor>
<connor> "by myself the other day." </connor>
<connor> Like, as you do on a Sunday. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Dude, I'd fucking do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, please. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck that. </joey>
<garnt> I'll go by myself to watch the "Death Note" musical. </garnt>
<garnt> - They had the "My Hero Academia" musical, </garnt>
<connor> didn't they as well? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they did! </garnt>
<garnt> They did! </garnt>
<garnt> - That idea wasn't in my head, </garnt>
<garnt> but now I'm just genuinely curious. </garnt>
<connor> How does that work? </connor>
<connor> - How do you adapt "Death Note" to a musical? </connor>
<connor> ♪ I like eating apples ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ Die, die, die ♪ </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like you'd have to be, </garnt>
<connor> I want it to be in the style of like Willy Wonka-esque </connor>
<connor> like original, you know, like the Oompa Loompa. </connor>
<connor> Just have Ryuk be an Oompa Loompa. </connor>
<connor> Have that kind of sing a song. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I would like that. </joey>
<joey> - Shinigami's just like. </joey>
<joey> - I'd like to think that the costume </joey>
<joey> for Ryuk is extremely poor as well. </joey>
<joey> It's just the shittest costume. </joey>
<joey> - Just a guy in like a gimp costume. </joey>
<connor> - He's just been like tarred and feathered. </connor>
<connor> And he's just kind of like overweight and he's like, "No." </connor>
<garnt> Smoker's voice as well. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> (Connor speaks Japanese) </garnt>
<connor> - Give me an apple and a cigarette. </connor>
<connor> - It's just fucking William Defoe without any makeup on. </connor>
<joey> It's just William Defoe. </joey>
<joey> - Just comes out like, "It is me, Ryuk." </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) - I'd buy it, I'd buy it. </connor>
<connor> He's very good actor. </connor>
<connor> He could do it. </connor>
<connor> - He's great. </connor>
<connor> - If anyone could just stand there and make me accept it, </connor>
<connor> it's probably William Defoe. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just remembering the "Death Note" </garnt>
<connor> live action movie now. </connor>
<connor> - He was the best part of the movie. </connor>
<connor> - He was the best part of the movie. </connor>
<joey> - He said four lines and that was it, unfortunately. </joey>
<connor> - But he was good. </connor>
<connor> He was good in those four lines. </connor>
<connor> How'd we get onto this? </connor>
<connor> How did we tangent? - I don't know, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> We're good at that. </joey>
<garnt> - So gentlemen, moving on though, </garnt>
<garnt> this is now our last few moments in the studio. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - This is the last episode of season one. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess it is. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that what we're gonna call it? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if we're doing like season one via studios </joey>
<joey> or via the year. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, either way, this is the end, right? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause we're like right on, </garnt>
<garnt> as we're recording, this is like one year anniversary </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> Something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - 53, right? </connor>
<joey> - Close enough. </joey>
<connor> - 52 weeks in a year. </connor>
<connor> - And the one over here. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, wow. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it felt a lot longer than a year to be honest. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't remember the studio being this full, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember what it looked like before. </garnt>
<joey> - It's scary going back to like episode one. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And being like, it doesn't look like the same room. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll tell you what, </garnt>
<garnt> after you mentioned it on the Trash Taste Awards, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember looking at the first episode again as well, </garnt>
<connor> and I forgot that we originally had our camera </connor>
<connor> all the way back there. </connor>
<connor> - Right in the back. </connor>
<connor> - So, it kind of looked like you're peeking through </connor>
<connor> like, you know, like you're peeking through being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, what are they getting on to?" </connor>
<connor> And now it just feels like way too close. </connor>
<connor> Hello. </connor>
<garnt> This is the new camera angle that we changed to, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - What, like 30 episodes ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it just feels weird. </garnt>
<joey> I forgot that we changed camera angles </joey>
<joey> and the different feeling that it gave off. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, like I'm impressed </joey>
<garnt> how many guests we got this year as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Given the limited circumstances of- </connor>
<connor> - All nine of them. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Except for Chris. </connor>
<joey> Fuck Chris. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, I'm sure Chris will be on again. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure Chris is gonna come knocking on the door. </connor>
<garnt> - Is he gonna be the first guest on in season two as well? </garnt>
<connor> - He said he wants to be. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Just asserting dominance to every other guest. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't see why not. </connor>
<joey> - Deadass what else is there to talk about with Chris? </joey>
<connor> - What'd you mean? </connor>
<connor> Just have Chris on. </connor>
<connor> He's insanity in shoes. </connor>
<connor> Chris just makes funny moments by being on. </connor>
<connor> We bully Chris. </connor>
<connor> Chris bullies us. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's a good deal. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm looking forward </garnt>
<garnt> to what drip he's gonna be wearing next off </garnt>
<garnt> after winning laziest drip in season one. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - You know, like after that episode goes off, </connor>
<connor> he's gonna be like, "Oh, I gotta come with a suit." </connor>
<joey> - I told Chris, I was like, "You won an award by the way." </joey>
<joey> He's like- </joey>
<joey> - Won two awards. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "You won an award." </joey>
<connor> He's like, "Oh really?" </connor>
<connor> I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </connor>
<connor> "Just one?" </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Fuck off, Chris!" </garnt>
<joey> - Lucky for you, Chris. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't tell him about the second one. </connor>
<joey> So, he'll be surprised. </joey>
<joey> - Brilliant, brilliant. </joey>
<joey> - He won't find out until- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he won't find that out until that's up. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but I guess by the time you see us next week, </connor>
<connor> we'll be in a hopefully brand new set up. </connor>
<connor> - Well, yeah, it'll be like a month for us. </connor>
<connor> It'll be one week for you guys. </connor>
<joey> - A week for you guys. </joey>
<garnt> - We want to remodel and change the setup a little bit. </garnt>
<connor> Get the angles different. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not gonna have like a completely different setup </garnt>
<garnt> right off the bat I think. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be similar to season one </garnt>
<connor> where we kind of grow our set as the season goes on. </connor>
<connor> You know, I feel, I like that. </connor>
<connor> - We haven't decided everything yet. </connor>
<connor> - We have no idea what the new set is gonna look like. </connor>
<connor> - I want to get all new figures. </connor>
<connor> That's what I want. </connor>
<joey> - That involves having another Akihabara special, </joey>
<joey> which is gonna be pretty hard right now, considering </joey>
<joey> everything is locked down. - Yeah, true. </joey>
<connor> But in future. </connor>
<connor> - So maybe you'll have to wait a little bit longer </connor>
<connor> compared to season one to get a new Akihabara special. </connor>
<connor> But we do want to do one in the future. </connor>
<connor> Apart from that, I don't know what other plans. </connor>
<connor> I'm just excited to show you guys like the new set </connor>
<garnt> that we have and having a proper "Trash Taste" office, </garnt>
<garnt> not just an apartment that we just remodeled into a set. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, you guys will see it in the "After Dark" vlog. </joey>
<joey> I mean, like speaking of, </joey>
<joey> there'll be way more "After Dark" content as well. </joey>
<garnt> - We're gonna have two sets now. </garnt>
<garnt> So, the "After Dark" specials aren't </garnt>
<garnt> just going to be "Trash Taste" 1.5. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the main arguments, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the big reasons why we wanna move, </garnt>
<garnt> just to allow us to make more- </garnt>
<connor> - More content. </connor>
<connor> - More space, more content. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause right now it's, you know, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you can make content in this room. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure we could, </joey>
<joey> but it's one of those things where- </joey>
<joey> - But what cost? </joey>
<connor> - When you're in a room that you just despise </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's too cramped, </connor>
<connor> you don't want to make like stuff. </connor>
<connor> You don't feel creative. </connor>
<connor> You don't feel like you want to do anything. </connor>
<joey> Like, you guys will see when we vlog it, </joey>
<joey> but like behind the set is an absolute mess. </joey>
<connor> And actually, the set is a mess. </connor>
<joey> - The entire room, the entire place is a mess. </joey>
<garnt> - The beauty of camera angles is everything looks bigger, </garnt>
<garnt> but this is, it is not as neat as you think it is. </garnt>
<garnt> In fact like I get actually like physically embarrassed, </garnt>
<joey> whenever a guest comes over. </joey>
<garnt> - It's pretty embarrassing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the one thing, </garnt>
<joey> the one mutual thing that every guest says is, </joey>
<joey> "Wow, this place is a lot smaller than it looks." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, yeah, we know, we know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, you know, when your mom comes in </garnt>
<connor> and your room isn't tidy. </connor>
<connor> That's what I feel like. </connor>
<connor> The first thing I feel like saying is apologizing. </connor>
<connor> And then the second thing is like, </connor>
<connor> whoever has to explain to the guest </connor>
<garnt> that they're gonna be sitting here. </garnt>
<garnt> And the first thing you have to explain to them is </garnt>
<garnt> how to get here. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just like, oh, you just got to go around the set. </garnt>
<connor> - Like you cannot see any of the desks </connor>
<garnt> and we have three desks over there by the wall. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't see any of the desk. </garnt>
<connor> My desk is a fucking war zone that Maylene's turned to. </connor>
<garnt> - Which was the guest </garnt>
<joey> that thought you had to go under again? </joey>
<joey> Who was that? </joey>
<connor> - Raina. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, Raina. - I think it was Raina. </joey>
<joey> - There was so little space. </joey>
<connor> Raina literally thought that you had to go under the table. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly there's probably more room under the table. </connor>
<joey> - Probably, probably. </joey>
<joey> - There's less of a tripping hazard under here. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't fault her for thinking that honestly. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, everything, the way we've done it is all, </connor>
<joey> it works, but it's literally the meme of like the Cheeto </joey>
<joey> holding the door locked. </joey>
<joey> Everything works, but it's not clean. </joey>
<joey> It's just about. </joey>
<joey> It looks good. </joey>
<joey> I'm happy with how it looks considering what we've got. </joey>
<connor> It's the most scuffed way we can of it looking </connor>
<connor> as good as it does and sounding as good as it does. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, we really wanna upgrade it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Get a better system in general just for everything. </connor>
<connor> Have more guests on, you know, have guests on "After Dark," </connor>
<connor> you know, just having everything upgraded, </connor>
<connor> everything better, you know. </connor>
<connor> - You know, it's 'cause of you guys </connor>
<joey> that we're even able to fucking move to, you know, </joey>
<connor> a nicer bigger place. </connor>
<joey> - Without the Patreon stuff, </joey>
<connor> we definitely wouldn't be able to consider the upgrades </connor>
<connor> that we're doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically when we started this podcast, we were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the minimum we can get away with </garnt>
<connor> in case this podcast is like zeros, </connor>
<garnt> just crashes and burns immediately, right? </garnt>
<connor> - So, we planned this on like as much of a budget, </connor>
<connor> as much money as we were willing to pay it, essentially. </connor>
<garnt> How much money do we want to lose? </garnt>
<connor> And then also hours do we want to lose? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, again, </connor>
<connor> we said this in the previous episode </connor>
<joey> with the Trash Taste Awards, obviously, </joey>
<joey> but we're very grateful I think </joey>
<joey> for the crazy amount of support. </joey>
<joey> I think if you'd have told us that we'd be this close </joey>
<garnt> to a million subs after one year, </garnt>
<connor> I think we'd have been like, funny. </connor>
<connor> - Good joke. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd be like 100,000 subs that's a success. </garnt>
<connor> - We only pushed this channel like what, </connor>
<garnt> twice on our main channels? </garnt>
<garnt> Once at the start of the video or an end of a video, </garnt>
<joey> and then the Akihabura special. </joey>
<joey> Considering it's everything else is driven by like Twitter </joey>
<joey> and you guys just enjoying the show. </joey>
<joey> - You guys spreading the good word. </joey>
<garnt> - It's crazy, man. </garnt>
<connor> It's crazy to see. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause normally with a lot of podcasts I see, </garnt>
<connor> you have like with big names </connor>
<connor> and then you have like the big announcements. </connor>
<connor> So you've got the big trickle of views. </connor>
<connor> And then the view just like drips down, </connor>
<connor> which is what I was expecting. </connor>
<garnt> And I wasn't expecting us to maintain like the view count. </garnt>
<connor> - For 50 episodes. </connor>
<garnt> - It's also intimidating </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause now I know that the stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> the dumb shit I say it'll be in front of </garnt>
<garnt> more people than ever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, one thing I certainly was surprised by was </garnt>
<garnt> just like, just realizing that some of the shit we say </garnt>
<connor> to each other people, </connor>
<garnt> like hundreds of thousands of people are now listening </garnt>
<garnt> to me. </garnt>
<connor> - I forget about everything I fucking say! </connor>
<garnt> - Same here! </garnt>
<garnt> - All the dumb shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I got an email today about baked beans. </garnt>
<garnt> Wanted to send me baked beans. </garnt>
<garnt> I totally forgot I said I like baked beans. </garnt>
<joey> And someone's offering to send me a ton of baked beans, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I'm flattered. - You can't say no to that. </joey>
<joey> - I just can't remember why I said this. </joey>
<connor> I totally forgot. </connor>
<joey> - Out of context it just sounds </joey>
<joey> like a random person wanting to send you baked beans. </joey>
<connor> - I know I went on a rant about loving baked beans, </connor>
<connor> but that was one of those things </connor>
<joey> where I'm very passionate in the moment </joey>
<garnt> and then when I leave I totally forget </garnt>
<joey> that I had a rant about that. </joey>
<garnt> I did talk very passionately about baked beans. </garnt>
<connor> That is me. </connor>
<connor> I did do that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that's a lot of moments, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean, sometimes you just get passionate </connor>
<connor> when you're talking with your mates </connor>
<connor> or when you're in like a fucking zakia </connor>
<connor> or having like an argument </connor>
<connor> where it's not really an argument, </connor>
<garnt> you're just very passionate in the moment. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you reckon we'll get any comments people like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I like the old set more. </connor>
<connor> "Had a better vibe to it." </connor>
<joey> Well, the table's gonna be the same. </joey>
<joey> - "I stopped watching after season one." </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "Season one is when it went downhill." </connor>
<garnt> - "Season two was a real let down." </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, essentially it's </garnt>
<garnt> not too much is gonna change really. </garnt>
<connor> - Really, okay, to like bring down expectations, </connor>
<garnt> really the reason we want to change offices is </garnt>
<garnt> because this is not a convenient office at all. </garnt>
<connor> On camera we don't want too much to change. </connor>
<garnt> We just want to work more comfortably </garnt>
<garnt> instead of having this like the most jank fucking set up </garnt>
<garnt> for everything we do. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, right now "Trash Taste After Dark" is running off </garnt>
<garnt> of my laptop, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's three giant ass HDMIs going </garnt>
<connor> into this man's laptop. </connor>
<joey> - The cable management is atrocious. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally, it's like, it's a laptop that's sitting, </garnt>
<connor> that's like hooked up on like on a foldable chair </connor>
<garnt> that's like connected with wide internet </garnt>
<garnt> that's just running in the middle of the floor. </garnt>
<joey> That's it. </joey>
<joey> That's "Trash Taste After Dark." </joey>
<joey> - It is jank as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - That's because we can't afford more space right now. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like the most jank. </joey>
<garnt> - It's mostly for us. </garnt>
<connor> - Enough of us complaining about all our problems I guess. </connor>
<garnt> Everything should hopefully be better. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't know 'cause we haven't moved yet, </garnt>
<connor> but we're hoping that everything goes really smoothly! </connor>
<garnt> - Offset, I want to shout out to the Denny's guy. </garnt>
<garnt> You're the real G. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The Denny's guys is always there for us. </connor>
<garnt> - We've talked before about- </garnt>
<joey> - Boss man's always waiting for us. </joey>
<joey> - We've talked before about how every time </joey>
<joey> before a "Trash Taste" recording we have lunch at Denny's, </joey>
<joey> and we've gone there so often that there's a guy at Denny's </joey>
<joey> who knows the exact time we're coming in on the exact day. </joey>
<joey> And he knows what we want. </joey>
<joey> We order the same thing every time. </joey>
<joey> - He knows how many people as well. </joey>
<joey> - I've not met a boss man in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> And I hadn't met the boss man in Japan until I met that guy. </garnt>
<garnt> You're a boss man. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - He's a real boss man. </joey>
<joey> I love it 'cause like sometimes we would come </joey>
<joey> into the Denny's and the moment he sees us, he's like, </joey>
<garnt> "Hey, oh! </garnt>
<garnt> "Four, right? </garnt>
<garnt> "I got you, I got you. </garnt>
<joey> "I got it reserved for you, don't worry." </joey>
<garnt> - You gonna miss the MILF bar </garnt>
<garnt> that's also like next door as well? </garnt>
<connor> So we discovered a bar- </connor>
<connor> - It's a restaurant. </connor>
<connor> Just it's ran by a hot woman. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a restaurant </connor>
<joey> that's just run by attractive older Japanese- </joey>
<joey> - Single MILFs in your area. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember Connor first going into there- </joey>
<joey> - And he had an awakening. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> The promised land! </joey>
<connor> - And then we almost, </connor>
<garnt> we came back almost every week for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - The land of milk and honey is right around the corner. </joey>
<connor> - What a beautiful bar. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm gonna miss this area as well. </connor>
<garnt> You know, I didn't have much expectations for this area. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously we don't- </garnt>
<garnt> - We're in a quiet area. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, you know, we've come to, </garnt>
<garnt> after a year we've come to appreciate the small things, </garnt>
<joey> you know. </joey>
<connor> - We can say we're in, it's whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, sure. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I don't think it matters now. </joey>
<joey> - We're not there anymore. </joey>
<garnt> We're not there anymore. </garnt>
<joey> So we were in Sitomo, but not anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Commuting was a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> Again, everything was on a budget. </joey>
<connor> Sitomo's outside of Tokyo, it's like an hour. </connor>
<connor> It's an hour away from Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> - It's immediately cheaper. </connor>
<garnt> - Just close enough that it kind of feels like it's </garnt>
<garnt> in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of like being in zone four, zone five in London. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like telling your, you know, </connor>
<connor> the studio is at Heathrow airport. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't that far. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't that far. </garnt>
<connor> - Heathrow airport's like an hour from central London. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but Tokyo is a lot bigger as well though, </garnt>
<connor> isn't it? I mean, you can go from one end of Tokyo </connor>
<garnt> to another in an hour as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I understand these references. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> Heathrow, yes. </connor>
<connor> - Downtown Manhattan, right? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I don't know what I was gonna say. </connor>
<connor> - Going to Pennsylvania from New York. </connor>
<connor> - I guess thank you for watching. </connor>
<connor> Thank you for watching season one. </connor>
<garnt> We don't have much else to say really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hope you guys stick with us all through season two. </garnt>
<joey> - Look forward to more fun epic- </joey>
<connor> - There probably won't be a season three </connor>
<joey> 'cause I don't think we plan on upgrading </joey>
<joey> from the new studio. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it'll be season two for awhile. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Season one is the test run. </connor>
<connor> Season two is the one that has like 500 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Don't think there's gonna be many new plot developments. </connor>
<connor> - This is literally it. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Season one was like the 54 episode pilot. </joey>
<joey> Season two is where the actual show begins. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, hopefully you guys enjoy the new studio. </joey>
<joey> - It's like "Arthur." </joey>
<connor> Does "Arthur" have seasons? </connor>
<connor> I don't know if "Arthur" has seasons. </connor>
<connor> - "Arthur?" - You know what "Arthur" is. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean the- </garnt>
<garnt> - Kid show. </garnt>
<garnt> - The cartoon. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Does that have seasons? </connor>
<garnt> Does "Arthur" have seasons? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it's just running. </garnt>
<connor> We're gonna be like "Arthur." </connor>
<connor> We're just never gonna stop airing. </connor>
<joey> We're just gonna every single week. </joey>
<connor> - I never heard of anyone being like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, season 23 of Arthur was my favorite." </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Does "Arthur" have seasons? </connor>
<connor> Can you Google it? </connor>
<connor> "Arthur" doesn't have seasons. </connor>
<connor> It just runs. </connor>
<connor> It just keeps going. </connor>
<garnt> - It just runs. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd say it's more like "Come Dine With Me" right? </garnt>
<connor> - Which we're just gonna keep coming and coming every week. </connor>
<connor> We come every week, guys. </connor>
<joey> "Trash Taste" comes every week. </joey>
<joey> - Come! </joey>
<joey> Now. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's it, we'll see you guys next. </connor>
<connor> - No, we gotta shout out the Patrons. </connor>
<joey> - Look at these lovely Patrons. </joey>
<joey> - Look at these Patrons who come every week. </joey>
<joey> - Whom without we could not move into a new studio </joey>
<joey> and have a better setup than we do now off screen. </joey>
<garnt> - [Maylene] "Arthur" has seasons. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it doesn't. </connor>
<joey> Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] Season 22. </joey>
<joey> - Season 22! </joey>
<connor> - That's basically one season. </connor>
<connor> - One long season 22. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even, I can't tell. </connor>
