<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> Connor, Joey! </connor>
<connor> What are those amazing
mugs you've got there? </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, I couldn't hear you </connor>
<connor> over the staring at my beautiful mug! </connor>
<connor> The Trash Taste Mug, </connor>
<garnt> with a lid! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God!

<garnt> is that the Trash Taste Mug </garnt>
<joey> that you can get from TrashTasteMugs.com? </joey>
<garnt> - And, there's only

<garnt> - There's only two weeks left, gentlemen. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I better snatch my mug now. </connor>
<garnt> There's only two weeks left. </garnt>
<garnt> At TrashTasteMugs.com </garnt>
<joey> (Joey gasps)
- It comes with a lid! </joey>
<joey> - $29.99 plus shipping. </joey>
<joey> Two weeks left, and once

<joey> they're gone forever. </joey>
<joey> So, you better go to it right now, </joey>
<joey> and snag it if you haven't yet. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I just knew
about TrashTasteMugs.com </garnt>
<garnt> to get these mugs right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just so grateful that
I have a perfectly sized mug </connor>
<connor> for any beverage of my wanting. </connor>
<joey> - And, it's got a lid so you
can keep cold things cold </joey>
<joey> and warm things warm. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Joey just explained science. </connor>
<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey beatboxing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking love that meme. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm literally cumming. </joey>
<connor> (Joey beatboxing) </connor>
<connor> - I just want to cum. </connor>
<joey> (Joey beatboxing) </joey>
<joey> - Here we go! </joey>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to this episode
of "Trash Taste" with me, </connor>
<connor> your host Connor, and
the boys, Joey and Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - That's us.
- Yes, that's us. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now--
- Nice of you </garnt>
<garnt> to be hosting the manga episode, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was going to get into that, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - We're all gentlemen here. </joey>
<joey> We're all connoisseurs of the fine arts. </joey>
<connor> We all read words. </connor>
<garnt> - You know the Trash Taste law. </garnt>
<garnt> You know our character development, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the best reader of all
time is obviously Connor. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly.
- That's true. </connor>
<connor> I am reading. </connor>
<connor> That's it. </connor>
<joey> - Librarians wish they could
have Connor's brain right now. </joey>
<connor> - They wish they could access
this fountain of knowledge. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And we thought obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> the best host for the
manga-centric episode, </garnt>
<garnt> which we are going to be doing today- </garnt>
<connor> - We don't choose hosts, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's a rotation. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and it just, the stars aligned. </joey>
<joey> They were sending us a message, </joey>
<connor> it's like, "It's Connor's turn." </connor>
<connor> - Connor must host. </connor>
<joey> - Do the manga episode.
- This episode. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so that's what we're doing today. </joey>
<joey> - I like how you've hosted
the Doujins episode as well, </joey>
<connor> I just realized by complete chance. </connor>
<connor> And now, you've also hosted
the manga episode, right? </connor>
<connor> - What can I say, I read. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (everybody laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I'm somewhat of a reader myself. </garnt>
<garnt> (everybody laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway, yeah as we've said, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the manga episode of "Trash Taste" </garnt>
<connor> where we're going to be
discussing our favorite mangas </connor>
<connor> on our favorite preferred methods. </connor>
<connor> It's going to be the three-by-three, </connor>
<connor> which you see on there. </connor>
<joey> - We've talked about manga in the past </joey>
<connor> in a lot of different episodes, </connor>
<connor> but I don't think we've
actually established </connor>
<joey> what our all-time favorite mangas, </joey>
<joey> or like our manga "tastes", quote unquote. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's really weird
because when we were thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about what haven't we
specifically talked about </garnt>
<garnt> on theme in an episode? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Wait a minute, </garnt>
<joey> we've never talked about manga." </joey>
<joey> And for some reason, I just
assumed that we already had. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because it feels like we have, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, it just was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, we did the anime one </garnt>
<joey> so obviously we did the
manga ones as well, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - And of course, I was thinking </connor>
<connor> about the fact that </connor>
<connor> I wonder, because the movie
one that we did recently </connor>
<connor> is probably going to have
a lot more variation. </connor>
<connor> I feel like there must
be some more overlap </connor>
<connor> this time, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I really don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Like there's one or two where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm pretty sure if it's not on your list, </connor>
<connor> you would put it on your list anyway." </connor>
<joey> - There's at least one I
know that I probably... </joey>
<connor> I mean you're kind of limited in your... </connor>
<garnt> I mean you're so expansive. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I know I've
probably got at least one </connor>
<connor> that's the same as you. </connor>
<garnt> I think I might have one that's
the same as Joey as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Here's what I realized
when I recently read </connor>
<connor> "Records of Ragnarok." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is that I've only read
really long running manga. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think I've read a single manga </connor>
<connor> that had like less than 150 chapters. </connor>
<garnt> - I would actually agree with you on that. </garnt>
<connor> Okay so I realized when
picking my three-by-three </connor>
<connor> is that there isn't that much choice </connor>
<connor> or there isn't as much choice as there is </connor>
<connor> in the anime world, right? </connor>
<connor> Of like manga that really
left a deep impression on me. </connor>
<connor> And that's because like manga, </connor>
<garnt> if you watch a season of anime, </garnt>
<garnt> it actually takes less time to consume it </garnt>
<garnt> than reading a really,
long running manga series. </garnt>
<garnt> Because if it's like a one shot, </garnt>
<garnt> or like a one volume kind of thing, </garnt>
<garnt> it probably was not going to leave </garnt>
<garnt> that deep of an effect on me. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I've read a lot of one
shots that were like, </joey>
<joey> "man, this is dead-ass better </joey>
<connor> than some like twenty
chapter plus like shows." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like the "Death
Note Donald Trump" one shot. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughing) </joey>
<joey> That was good. </joey>
<garnt> That left an impression on me. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't expect to see manga Donald Trump, </garnt>
<garnt> but... </garnt>
<garnt> - True that. </garnt>
<joey> And we saw it in the
best art-style as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Give him a fucking fist pump to Ryoku. </connor>
<garnt> (group laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, that one
shot, I didn't realize- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't realize how
much I missed "Death Note" </connor>
<connor> until I read that one shot. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Damn we kinda need a
sequel to 'Death Note'." </garnt>
<garnt> - He was just playing with us. </garnt>
<connor> That's the worst part is that it was like, </connor>
<connor> the Pro coming back and
just styling on everyone </connor>
<connor> and then being like, "See you by the way." </connor>
<garnt> (group laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> Just being like, "I could come back, </joey>
<joey> I could kill it." </joey>
<connor> - It's like that villain wrestler, </connor>
<garnt> who just comes in
clotheslines, then leaves. </garnt>
<garnt> (group laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Builds all your furniture. </connor>
<garnt> Leaves. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, "Oh shit, okay, that was cool." </connor>
<connor> - Oh cool, thank you. </connor>
<connor> - But then I also realized
making this three-by-three </connor>
<connor> is that I really haven't read </connor>
<garnt> as much manga as I have watched anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I'm unfortunately
not the manga man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's probably Joey, right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I think in your head </connor>
<connor> you feel like manga is easier? </connor>
<joey> Maybe, because you can speak... </joey>
<joey> You can read Japanese fluently. </joey>
<connor> Maybe it is, </connor>
<joey> because you can just pick them up. </joey>
<joey> You can just go to the
store, pay two bucks, </joey>
<connor> get the manga, and you're good to go. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, as someone
called, "The Anime Man", </joey>
<connor> I obviously read a lot more manga </connor>
<connor> than I watch anime.
- Yeah, you read more manga </connor>
<joey> As we all know by now.
- Go figure. </joey>
<joey> - The running meme. </joey>
<joey> And I do think that if that was the case, </joey>
<joey> I think I would probably read more. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think because of
the fact that I'm not... </joey>
<garnt> I do enjoy reading digitally. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the ease of it, </garnt>
<connor> but I do find that it's a little more, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, it feels harder to get into. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you mean digitally? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> When I'm reading it, I like it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's getting into it
where I'm like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Because when you see it in
the store, you can pick it up, </connor>
<joey> you can flick through. </joey>
<connor> You're like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<connor> - There's no better feeling </connor>
<connor> than like a physical page turner. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </joey>
<joey> That's how you really get into it. </joey>
<joey> Especially with manga
because, unlike normal books, </joey>
<joey> you have to actually just read it. </joey>
<joey> Manga it pops right out. </joey>
<joey> You can see, oh, okay well damn, okay. </joey>
<joey> - You can look at it close-by as well. </joey>
<connor> - It just feels right. </connor>
<joey> It feels much better. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like I'm reading. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It really feels like I'm reading. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right. </garnt>
<joey> - Just something about it. </joey>
<joey> - It feels more special, </joey>
<joey> and it feels a bit more intimate, I guess. </joey>
<joey> I guess like most of the manga </joey>
<joey> that I put on my three-by-three, </joey>
<connor> I actually read on paper. </connor>
<connor> - Oh okay. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that's
a complete coincidence. </connor>
<connor> Some of them... </connor>
<connor> Some manga I know are really good </connor>
<connor> and I purposely will not read it </connor>
<connor> unless it's physical copies. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> Other manga, I kind of maybe read online </garnt>
<garnt> and if it's like good, </garnt>
<garnt> then I try and go out of my
way to buy physical copies. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but I mean, like I was saying, </connor>
<connor> I think that for me at least a little bit, </connor>
<garnt> anime is slightly easier to consume. </garnt>
<garnt> It really depends. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really understand
how I consume manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - It depends on...
- I don't really get it. </garnt>
<joey> I like to think I
understand, but I don't think </joey>
<joey> I get what I'm doing. </joey>
<connor> - It depends on the
series for me, definitely. </connor>
<connor> Like there are some where it's just like, </connor>
<joey> I really fucking struggled
to like get into the manga. </joey>
<joey> But for some reason it's
really easy to watch the anime </joey>
<garnt> and vice versa. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah also another thing </joey>
<garnt> when I was picking my three-by-three </garnt>
<garnt> is that I tried not to pick titles </garnt>
<garnt> that already had like
a big anime adaptation </garnt>
<garnt> or something that I watched the anime, </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like it
doesn't make a difference. </garnt>
<connor> - So you're trying to be that guy of like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't watch the main, I
don't read the mainstream." </connor>
<garnt> - No, because like...
- Trying to be artsy boy </garnt>
<connor> - For example like, </connor>
<joey> I don't think there's any point
in me putting "One Piece," </joey>
<joey> on my three-by-three. </joey>
<joey> - As good as the manga reads, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Because the manga- </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel fucking haunted with everyone </garnt>
<garnt> asking me, "Why haven't I started it yet?" </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because like the manga is amazing, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like, with that, </connor>
<garnt> you could either read the
manga or watch the anime, </garnt>
<garnt> and you could either have like a good </garnt>
<garnt> experience on each and
as long as you put it- </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think there's a single person </joey>
<joey> watching "Trash Taste" </joey>
<joey> that doesn't know what "One Piece" is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "Do I really need to tell
my 'Trash Taste' viewers </garnt>
<connor> that I am a 'One-Piece' fan?" </connor>
<garnt> Like dude, do you really
need to know that? </garnt>
<connor> - I was in my Japanese class this morning. </connor>
<connor> And they was like, </connor>
<joey> they made me listen to
like Japanese people speak, </joey>
<joey> and tell them what they were saying. </joey>
<joey> And I got totally thrown
off in one audio clip </joey>
<joey> because there was a woman
talking about her dress, </joey>
<joey> but it's one piece. </joey>
<joey> - One piece! </joey>
<connor> - And I was like, "oh, she
likes red 'One Piece'?" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> I was like so thrown, </connor>
<garnt> and I couldn't listen to the rest of it </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm like, "Did
she just say 'One Piece'? </garnt>
<garnt> Like the anime? </garnt>
<connor> Shit, she's a bit of a weeb." </connor>
<connor> - And you just like the
PTSD of the internet. </connor>
<connor> And you're just like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah
I was like "One Piece!" </connor>
<garnt> (Connor grunting excitedly) </garnt>
<garnt> I can't escape it! </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember like... </garnt>
<garnt> When I was first getting into "One Piece," </garnt>
<garnt> I really wanted to buy the manga volumes. </garnt>
<garnt> So obviously anime- </garnt>
<garnt> - You typed 'One Piece.' </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, I typed
in 'One Piece' on eBay </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Don't give me a fucking
dress, I want the manga. </joey>
<joey> Give me the manga." </joey>
<joey> And I scroll down. </joey>
<connor> It's just like dress,
dress, dress, dress, dress. </connor>
<connor> It's like, goddammit. </connor>
<connor> - All right, gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> It's time. </connor>
<joey> - Okay.
- All right. </joey>
<joey> Trash box can decide it all. </joey>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> Man, we got some real mileage out of this. </connor>
<connor> Dollar, dollar... </connor>
<joey> - Thanks Navvy you're the real MVP here. </joey>
<joey> - [Male Speaker] He's my son.
(item jiggling in container) </joey>
<connor> - 4K hearing. </connor>
<joey> - 4K trash box good. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Who's going first? </joey>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> First up, let me get the trash. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] All right. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - First up is, Connor spelled incorrectly. </connor>
<garnt> - Conner.
- Conner. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who did this? </garnt>
<connor> Someone's getting fired. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Conner.
- [Joey] Conner. </connor>
<garnt> - It's an 'O'! </garnt>
<connor> (group laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I'm kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah I'm first. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've actually only read, </garnt>
<joey> coincidentally, like nine manga. </joey>
<joey> - I can probably name all
nine that you've read. </joey>
<garnt> - Well you don't need to cheat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, wait can we make a guess? </garnt>
<garnt> Can we make a guess before,
before you show them? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Do we want to? </connor>
<connor> - I'm not going to confirm
if you're right or wrong. </connor>
<garnt> You can just say. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> - All right.
- Well obviously "Jojo." </joey>
<joey> - "Jojo: Part Seven." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - Yup. </joey>
<joey> - "Claymore?" </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - "Eyeshield 21." </connor>
<joey> - "Eyeshield", "Gantz." </joey>
<connor> - "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> - That's five. </connor>
<joey> - "Records of Ragnarok?" </joey>
<joey> - No, that wouldn't be in there. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> There's something... what's what's like. </joey>
<joey> - There's something else. </joey>
<joey> - What's the cockroach one again? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, "Terraform!" </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, "Terraform." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit, I didn't put that on. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh.
- Oh damn! </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - We'll talk about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll talk about that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> What else has he read? </garnt>
<garnt> "Vinland Saga?" </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, "Vinland Saga." </joey>
<garnt> - That's seven. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't think of any more, that he's read. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Death Note" maybe? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe. </garnt>
<joey> - Did you read "Death Note" or watch it? </joey>
<garnt> - I think he watched it. </garnt>
<joey> - All right, okay, you know what? </joey>
<garnt> Let's find out. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've got, we've got seven. </garnt>
<connor> - You're going to kick
yourself when you missed, </connor>
<joey> you missed one that you're
going to be like, "Of course." </joey>
<joey> - I know there's one that's
like, very obviously we missed. </joey>
<joey> - All right Ashley pull it up. </joey>
<joey> Put it up. </joey>
<connor> - Put it up on the screen. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh "One Punch Man." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah "One Punch Man." </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh "One Punch Man" of course. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh and "Black Butler." </joey>
<connor> Oh and... </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] "You Are My Princess!" </connor>
<connor> - So I just got to do a bit
of self promo here real quick. </connor>
<joey> I love this manga so much that
I made an audio book of it. </joey>
<joey> You can go buy it by
the way on Book Walker. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Oh my god. </joey>
<garnt> - "You Are My Princess"
full audio book edition </garnt>
<garnt> is available. </garnt>
<joey> - We do not condone of this self promo. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I wasn't allowed to do this, </joey>
<garnt> but I'm going to do it again
anyway, just by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> It's actually okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's where "Terraformers" would go. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, okay we'll get into Terra... </garnt>
<garnt> I'll quickly, actually I will... </garnt>
<garnt> Let me touch on this. </garnt>
<connor> It's actually, genuinely,
a really good BL story. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you ever want to get
into BL, it's good, man. </connor>
<connor> It's about a guy who's like, "Yeah, dude. </connor>
<connor> I like this guy, but I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't know this isn't normal. </connor>
<connor> Right?" </connor>
<connor> But then he, but then yeah,
he really likes the guy. </connor>
<connor> (dramatic squeal) </connor>
<joey> - That's literally every Yaoi. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, a lot of them are really rapey. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of them are like,
"Oh, you don't like me. </connor>
<garnt> Well, let me make you cum and
that'll change your mind." </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like... </garnt>
<garnt> - Cyber punk music playing! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, hold on, wha, what? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like isn't this, isn't this... </garnt>
<garnt> and then everyone's like,
"No no, don't say it." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not weird. </garnt>
<joey> It's only weird if you make it weird. </joey>
<joey> - Shut up, it's hot. </joey>
<joey> - But it's actually a
really wholesome manga. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, if you want to listen
to it in audio book form, </joey>
<connor> you can officially license. </connor>
<joey> - Anyway, do you want
to go through the list </joey>
<garnt> in case there are some that.. </garnt>
<garnt> - In case we didn't, mention them already? </garnt>
<connor> - Yep, so you've got most of them, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] "Claymore", "One
Punch Man", "Beserk", "Jojo", </connor>
<connor> "Black Butler", "Gantz", "Vinland
Saga", and "Eyeshield 21." </connor>
<joey> - I wasn't expecting "Black
Butler" there for some reason. </joey>
<connor> - Actually, I-
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought you were more
of a fan of the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't realize you
read the manga of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've read, what
chapter did I read up to? </garnt>
<garnt> I've read a good chunk of "Black Butler." </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't caught up. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know that a
bunch of shit happened </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a lot of big plot
twists that I know about, </garnt>
<garnt> but I haven't read yet.
- [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I've read most of "Black Butler" </garnt>
<garnt> and it's so, so much better
in manga format than anime. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, the first season is
basically like kind of like a, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, episodical
slice of life kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't really progress
the story that much. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] And the second
season is just non-canonical- </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right.
- [Connor] of "Black Butler." </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so bad, sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> (incoherent chatter) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Water just fell down. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I just dripped on myself again. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you miss your mouth? </connor>
<connor> (group laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Cue another montage of me not
being able to drink liquids. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a shame, right. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it's the whole meme, right. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of, I don't really talk about it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't want to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You know people will
kind of want to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, he's the 'Black Butler' guy." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't mind talking about it now. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, the third
season of "Black Butler," </joey>
<joey> the anime is based on like
the manga and it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> Like it's like a really morbid part. </joey>
<garnt> It's really dark and you kind
of realize how good it can be. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, the manga is a
really, really good, good read. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'd recommend it if
you kind of like the idea </garnt>
<garnt> of "Black Butler," </garnt>
<garnt> but don't want to go
through with the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I wouldn't have read it </garnt>
<connor> if it wasn't for my YouTube videos. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like I've
heard the second season of </garnt>
<garnt> "Black Butler," is that
different from the manga? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's totally...
- That's what I heard. </garnt>
<garnt> - They just made it up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's an anime original, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's completely terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> It's universally like hated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - But like genuinely, you
give the manga a shot, </connor>
<connor> it's pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> - So what's like,
different about the manga </garnt>
<garnt> than the anime that you would
recommend the manga over it? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, it's like way more serious, </connor>
<garnt> way more like it doesn't like fuck around </garnt>
<garnt> and it doesn't really feel like, </garnt>
<joey> cause the anime very much
feels like it's kind of just, </joey>
<joey> Yaoi bait at times. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Like it just feels like- </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely trying to
pertain towards its audience. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and it's very, and
the first season, again, </joey>
<joey> it's very casual. </joey>
<connor> It doesn't really... </connor>
<connor> it does cover a lot of the same things, </connor>
<connor> but it does it in a way that
I've just, I think, okay, eh. </connor>
<joey> - I watched season one of the anime, </joey>
<connor> and I thought it was like... </connor>
<connor> - It's fun. </connor>
<joey> It's fun. </joey>
<joey> But manga does it so much better. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It does it so much more justice. </connor>
<joey> - And I feel Toboso Yana's,
like, art style was a lot </joey>
<joey> just like more gritty and like kinda dark. </joey>
<joey> - It's so good.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But she gets better as
well and it's so good. </joey>
<connor> And the third season of
"Black Butler" covers </connor>
<connor> like a circus arc and it's so good. </connor>
<garnt> And the anime does it justice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Book of cir...
- Book of Circus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Book of Circus, yeah.
- And it's actually so good. </garnt>
<connor> - So is like the anime finished now? </connor>
<joey> Or, is the manga finished, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - I think the manga is still going. </joey>
<connor> - The manga is still ongoing. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh it's still going! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's still going, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's quite long running </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know how many volumes are on. </garnt>
<joey> I think we're over like 13 at this point. </joey>
<joey> I think it's quite... </joey>
<connor> - I think it's way more than that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah quite a lot. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's like over 20 now. </joey>
<joey> - Is it really over 20? </joey>
<connor> Fuck, I think I've only
read up to like 10. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - But I really enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I stopped. </joey>
<joey> I'm probably going to
read it at some point. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yep. </joey>
<garnt> - Because you know when you
catch up to a certain point, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, "I'm done." </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah because-
- [Connor] I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what I want to do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah because for me, </connor>
<connor> my manga reading habits </connor>
<connor> is that I just love binge
reading manga so much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same. </connor>
<joey> I can't, once I start
a manga, I can't stop. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, we're on volume 30 now. </joey>
<connor> - Volume 30 of "Black Butler!" </connor>
<joey> - I know I've read over half I think. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - But I don't know how long ago that was, </joey>
<joey> because I think what was happening is </joey>
<joey> I got really burned out on it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I read so much of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- In like the space of a week. </garnt>
<joey> - And your entire career
was consistently that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and then, then that happened. </joey>
<joey> Then I got... </joey>
<joey> Which I think this is probably </joey>
<joey> going to remind me to get back into it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because with "One
Punch," I did that as well, </joey>
<connor> which we'll talk about later. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But genuinely I think, even though </connor>
<connor> if you've seen the show,
I would give it a shot. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I've definitely,
I did remember giving </joey>
<connor> the "Black Butler" manga a go. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like after I finished
watching season one, </connor>
<connor> because I had just, at that point, </connor>
<connor> season two had already finished
airing and I just heard, </connor>
<connor> "Don't watch season two." </connor>
<garnt> So I was like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> Time for the manga then. </garnt>
<joey> And then I just never got to it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And there's some... </connor>
<connor> It's really, really dark at times. </connor>
<connor> Like you forget like the main premise </connor>
<joey> is that in "Black Butler," </joey>
<joey> he's a demon and that he's
made a contract with him </joey>
<joey> to have his life at the end. </joey>
<connor> And like, they kind of play off it a lot </connor>
<garnt> in the anime and make it seem like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, oh, it's kind of hot, hot. </garnt>
<garnt> Mmm okay." </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> (group laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, in the manga, </garnt>
<garnt> they constantly remind you sometimes like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh shit. </garnt>
<garnt> He just like, murders people." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like straight up. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're not afraid of like showing </garnt>
<garnt> like really morbid stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's some really
good plot twist, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I won't spoil some of them, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's some really fucked
up shit that happens in that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay okay.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's really worth giving it a shot, </joey>
<joey> even though all the
stereotypes, not stereotypes, </joey>
<joey> but the... what's the word? </joey>
<joey> - Facade, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Facade or the preconceptions </joey>
<joey> that a lot of the Western anime fans have. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think in Japan, </joey>
<connor> it's pretty fucking popular I think. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> It is. </joey>
<connor> But it's popular, but it definitely does </connor>
<connor> have like a strong female audience. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I mean, Sebastian is iconic. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean being the sexy man of anime. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean he was like the sexy man of anime </garnt>
<garnt> for like the early to mid 2000's. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd still argue if you make a list </connor>
<connor> of top five sexiest anime
characters, Sebastian's on there. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He is just sexy. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, British! </connor>
<garnt> - He just has that like cult following. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lets hit the pubs lads. </garnt>
<connor> (group laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It's "Black Butler" innit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like he's just an icon of his time. </garnt>
<garnt> For like anime and manga at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> Like for like...there's a few, </garnt>
<joey> like I'd say characters in like anime </joey>
<joey> that just personified a
certain character trait. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like you think of
Yandere for our generation, </joey>
<connor> it's fucking Yuna Gasa,
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> You think sexy man, it's
Sebastian from "Black Butler." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think anyone's replaced him yet. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, no. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean the one that got close </joey>
<connor> was maybe like Yuri from "Yuri On Ice." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but even then like-
- Even then. </connor>
<joey> - Even then, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think he's as
charming as Sebastian, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's the staple. </connor>
<connor> Sebastian is just a staple of like, </connor>
<garnt> it's like the sexy butler, </garnt>
<connor> but also just very
suave, very charismatic. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He is very entertaining
and I feel like Sebastian, </connor>
<joey> it does carry a lot of the time
because it was just so fun. </joey>
<joey> And even though he is
like obedient, he's just, </joey>
<joey> he makes it so entertaining. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And you know, again, even my videos, </joey>
<joey> I didn't even remotely do him justice. </joey>
<joey> He's such a, </joey>
<joey> he's so witty and so clever in the anime, </joey>
<joey> in the manga, sorry. </joey>
<joey> Where it's just it's so
he's so fun to watch. </joey>
<joey> And the, you know, the third
season of the anime is good </joey>
<garnt> and the Book of Murder, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's called, is that correct? </garnt>
<garnt> Book of Murder is pretty fun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like kind of like a mini who done it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Within like in like two hours. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's obviously
Sebastian solves everything </garnt>
<garnt> and does it magically which is always fun. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - My man!
- Because it's like, </connor>
<connor> what if Sakamoto became a
butler later on in life? </connor>
<garnt> That is, </garnt>
<connor> that is Sebastian. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like Sebastian and Sakamoto </connor>
<garnt> are just like twins separated at birth. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they are
literally the same person. </joey>
<joey> Like Sakamoto is just Sebastian in school. </joey>
<joey> Like because they literally
have the same kind </joey>
<connor> of like... </connor>
<connor> Maybe Sakamoto is a little
more tongue in cheek. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But Sebastian very much has
the same kind of visual humor </connor>
<connor> a lot of the time. </connor>
<garnt> And does like a lot of, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the joke is often that he is
just so insanely competent </garnt>
<garnt> that everything is-
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just so OP. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's literally OP as
fuck, but it's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> I just love it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so, and it's, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like there's not a manga </garnt>
<garnt> that has the same feeling
as "Black Butler." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think there's a single
manga that feels like it. </garnt>
<connor> Or anime show that it has
the same kind of vibe. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I feel it definitely like created a staple </garnt>
<joey> for that kind of genre.
- [Connor] For sure. </joey>
<connor> - Like there's probably a lot of manga </connor>
<joey> that's imitating "Black Butler." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] A hundred
percent, hundred percent. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because there's not many manga out there </connor>
<connor> that do like deal with
like pretty intense themes. </connor>
<connor> They have like all these
like thriller aspects. </connor>
<connor> They also have the, you know, </connor>
<connor> the parts that appeal to the
Fuja, it's quite a lot, right. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it kind of mixes a
lot of genres together. </connor>
<connor> And I think even Yana Tobaso herself said </connor>
<joey> that she didn't even know
what genre she'd put it in </joey>
<joey> because it's so, it
touches on so many genres </joey>
<connor> throughout the manga. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I think it's
super unique and worth reading. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you watch the anime
or read the manga first? </garnt>
<connor> - Anime first. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> I should've expected that actually. </connor>
<garnt> - So anime, </garnt>
<connor> I watched the anime and, you know, </connor>
<connor> I thought... </connor>
<connor> I just watched it and I
thought it was kind of meh. </connor>
<connor> It was kind of boring. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> I thought it was okay. </connor>
<connor> I thought season two was God awful. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> And at this time Book of
Circus hadn't came out yet. </joey>
<joey> And basically I did that
and then someone was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you should, </joey>
<joey> you should just do like
character impressions </joey>
<joey> for my YouTube channel." </joey>
<joey> I was like "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> And I did a few </joey>
<garnt> and then Sebastian just
happened to be the one </garnt>
<garnt> that I tried first, </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought I sounded nothing like him. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Posh British Butler guy, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, everyone's like,
"Oh my god it's him!" </garnt>
<garnt> But then looking back, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't even sound like
Jay Michael Taylor at all, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure he was offended
that people were comp- </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be offended. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then I did that and
then I got, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I got surrounded by people who loved it </garnt>
<garnt> and kept like telling me,
read it, read it, read it. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like reluctant. </joey>
<connor> I was like, no. </connor>
<joey> - So wait what was, </joey>
<connor> what was the first manga you ever read? </connor>
<connor> Is it on the three-by-three? </connor>
<connor> That you like distinctly, remember. </connor>
<connor> - It might've been "Black But"- </connor>
<joey> No, it must have been "Black Butler." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it must've was "Black Butler." </joey>
<joey> It was Black Butler and I didn't read any </joey>
<joey> for like two years. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - He just thought "manga
equals 'Black Butler.'" </joey>
<connor> - Because I, the reason
why I actually got into it, </connor>
<garnt> I remember this now, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I did a manga dub of part of the, </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember what
the boat arc's called. </joey>
<joey> The Campania Arc? </joey>
<joey> Campaign? </joey>
<joey> - Just the boat arc.
- The boat arc. </joey>
<connor> - The Book of Atlantic, is it? </connor>
<joey> Book of Atlantic maybe is what it's called </joey>
<joey> because they made a movie about it. </joey>
<joey> I haven't watched the movie. </joey>
<joey> I did a comic dub of a portion of that. </joey>
<joey> And so yeah, </joey>
<joey> I just ended up reading
it because I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this arc looks cool." </joey>
<joey> And I had it out of context. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh,
okay, well this is cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to go read the rest." </joey>
<garnt> And I start reading it and
I read it past that point. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I stopped. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But everything before I enjoyed it. </garnt>
<connor> But I'm probably going to go finish it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because what I want to know </garnt>
<garnt> is that I'm looking at most of these </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd say a lot of these
have come from recommendations </garnt>
<garnt> literally from us telling you
to go like go out and read it. </garnt>
<joey> - I know exactly which
ones Garnt recommended. </joey>
<garnt> I know which ones I recommended. </garnt>
<garnt> - So do it in the order of
I watched them, I read them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah go for it. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay so next up was "One Punch Man." </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah so what inspired you
to read "One Punch Man?" </garnt>
<joey> - I guess the anime, right? </joey>
<connor> - Season one was too good. </connor>
<connor> Like how can you, you can't
cock block me like that, right? </connor>
<joey> Like season one was so
good and I saw the manga </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh." </joey>
<connor> A lot of the times when I'd see the manga </connor>
<connor> and when I wanted to go
further, like past the anime, </connor>
<connor> I would start reading the
manga and I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "Eh, it's not the same." </connor>
<connor> But "One Punch" was the
one where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Holy shit this is insane." </connor>
<connor> Like this, this artwork is just insane. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I noticed you have
two Murate Yusuke manga. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I love his art man. </connor>
<joey> His art is something.
- He's a beast. </joey>
<connor> - And he's so good at
visually conveying like- </connor>
<connor> - Action. </connor>
<connor> - Action and also just kind
of like metaphors I've seen. </connor>
<garnt> - God, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's talk about... </garnt>
<garnt> I swear, like, because I think
especially in sports anime. </garnt>
<connor> Sports anime, a lot of times,
live and die by the metaphor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right because how can you- </connor>
<connor> - Because concepts need to be explained. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like how can you convey </garnt>
<garnt> a certain move or certain like aspect </garnt>
<garnt> of a sport that people who are, </garnt>
<garnt> do not understand a sport
can easily understand. </garnt>
<connor> You go for metaphors. </connor>
<connor> And by far the manga </connor>
<connor> that does the best visual
metaphors is "Eyeshield 21." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck your "Haikyuu" and your
fucking crows or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why I would want
him to do a chess anime. </garnt>
<garnt> He would explain the concept of chess </garnt>
<garnt> through metaphors amazingly. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He'd be like, "This is a pen." </garnt>
<joey> And he'd figure out some weird
fucking way of showing it. </joey>
<joey> I would love that, but sadly, </joey>
<joey> it's not popular in Japan, chess. </joey>
<joey> Big RIP. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, "One Punch Man." </joey>
<joey> I just like, dude, this
one was, still to this day, </joey>
<joey> one of my favorite mangas. </joey>
<connor> Out of all of these, </connor>
<connor> I still think that "One Punch Man" </connor>
<connor> is maybe one of my favorites. </connor>
<connor> Fuck it's so hard. </connor>
<connor> It's- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the difficult one, </joey>
<joey> because you have "Jojo" there as well. </joey>
<joey> - Because "Jojo" is there as well. </joey>
<joey> And I think "Jojo" might
be my favorite obviously, </joey>
<joey> but I think "Jojo" is my fave is like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I have a difference
between my favorite </joey>
<connor> and the one I enjoyed the most. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I think I enjoyed
"One Punch Man" the most </connor>
<connor> because it was just pure fun. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But "Jojo" is my favorite </connor>
<connor> because there's so much
about Jojo that I love. </connor>
<connor> And I love the style of Jojo. </connor>
<connor> I love all of that. </connor>
<joey> And I feel like Jojo's so
much more than just the manga. </joey>
<joey> It's an experience. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's not just a manga, it's the culture. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, you don't just read "Jojo"- </garnt>
<garnt> - You live it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You live it, you experience it. </garnt>
<connor> You become Jojo. </connor>
<connor> - There's just something about "Jojo" </connor>
<connor> which we'll talk about later. </connor>
<connor> But just there's something about it. </connor>
<connor> But "One Punch Man", man,
like I finished season one </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Okay,
I'm going to check it out. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to see what happens after." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it ends... </connor>
<connor> Because I mean, after you
watched the Boros Fight, </connor>
<connor> which you know, if you haven't, </connor>
<joey> if you don't know what "One Punch Man" is, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to explain it to you. </joey>
<joey> It's a guy who beats
everyone in one punch. </joey>
<joey> That's literally it. </joey>
<joey> - And he's a man. </joey>
<joey> - And at the end of the
season one of the anime, </joey>
<joey> he has this amazing fight </joey>
<joey> that is so visually
stunning and just amazing. </joey>
<joey> And it's so hype, </joey>
<joey> it's probably one of the coolest
animated fights in anime. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Okay, I have
to know where this can go." </joey>
<joey> Because everyone's saying
the story's amazing onwards. </joey>
<joey> So I started reading it
and I was like, "Oh, okay. </joey>
<garnt> This is pretty cool." </garnt>
<garnt> The next arc starts. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Okay, this
is really interesting." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah yeah.
- [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because we start the what's known, </garnt>
<garnt> as the Monster Arc. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the Garoah arc.
- Garoah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they introduced
Garoah, which is like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the main characters going forward </garnt>
<joey> in the anime and manga
and season two covers </joey>
<joey> I probably say the beginning. </joey>
<joey> Just barely the beginning of one of the... </joey>
<joey> - It's a long arc, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's very long, it's
still ongoing on the manga. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I started reading it and I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Goddamn, this man's drawings
are just another level." </connor>
<connor> Like actually insane. </connor>
<garnt> - It's insane because I
remember reading "One Punch Man" </garnt>
<connor> before the anime came out because
everyone was hyping it up. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, it was the
one show when I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Let me just, let me just see. </connor>
<connor> Let me just read like a
chapter or two just to see." </connor>
<connor> - You can't read a chapter or two. </connor>
<connor> - What can I, what I can expect. </connor>
<connor> So I tried reading a chapter or two </connor>
<connor> and then I read everything that was out. </connor>
<connor> - You can't. </connor>
<connor> You can't pick that up
and not read everything. </connor>
<connor> It's impossible. </connor>
<connor> - And then I remember
reading it and being like, </connor>
<connor> "There's no way the anime is
going to live up to this hype." </connor>
<garnt> I was just like, "There's no fucking way." </garnt>
<garnt> But like not because the art is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think some of the best
art that's available. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - Dude when you turn... </connor>
<connor> There's a panel, right? </connor>
<connor> Where Sitoma punches so
hard, the clouds split. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And in this panel, you
like the detail on the Earth </connor>
<connor> and the clouds is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, there's some panels </garnt>
<connor> that are literally just
animated key frames. </connor>
<connor> Where you read it and
it's, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's just like an anime </connor>
<connor> because it's just basically
key frames, right? </connor>
<connor> So like, I was very, very
impressed at, you know, </connor>
<joey> the team at Madhouse for being
able to put their own spin </joey>
<joey> on his amazing, fucking art. </joey>
<joey> Like living up to this amazing art. </joey>
<joey> But even without that, "One
Punch Man" is some of the best </joey>
<connor> battle shonen in like- </connor>
<connor> - Hundred percent. </connor>
<garnt> - Art that you can find
in all of anime and manga. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I think that I'm very glad </connor>
<connor> that "One Punch Man" season one </connor>
<connor> was animated the way there was </connor>
<connor> because I think anime season
one is more of a comedy </connor>
<connor> and then season two onwards is an action. </connor>
<connor> I feel like the comedy
very much takes a backseat </connor>
<connor> after the first arc. </connor>
<joey> - Well yeah because I mean
you can only do so much </joey>
<joey> with that single concept right? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But like the way that they
made it work every time </connor>
<garnt> was so genius and funny. </garnt>
<garnt> Like "One Punch Man" season one </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the funniest shows in anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I agree. </garnt>
<garnt> - And in the manga, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel that although
the art is much better, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the comedy doesn't hit as hard </garnt>
<garnt> because the comedic timing
is super important for jokes. </garnt>
<connor> And I feel like you can't have
as good comedic timing when </connor>
<connor> you're reading something as
when you were experiencing it. </connor>
<connor> The joke. </connor>
<garnt> I think it's just like
a different experience </garnt>
<connor> or a different like- </connor>
<joey> - It's a different type of comedy. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] But a joke read
aloud will always be funnier </joey>
<connor> than a joke you've read. </connor>
<connor> Like that's just- </connor>
<joey> (Garnt exclaiming hesitation) </joey>
<connor> - I don't know.
- I disagree. </connor>
<connor> - I thought that too </connor>
<joey> until I read like stuff like "Gin Tama." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but I've bet the "Gin Tama" animes </connor>
<connor> delivers the lines funnier. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's hard to say. </joey>
<joey> Like sometimes it does, yes. </joey>
<joey> But then there are some chapters that I... </joey>
<joey> I think "Gin Tama" is the only manga </joey>
<joey> that's genuinely made me
laugh out loud reading it. </joey>
<joey> And that's like a very
powerful thing to say right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, again,
it's like, as you said, </joey>
<joey> a joke is much funnier said out loud. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But it's like timing, timing, you know, </connor>
<connor> have anything playing into the joke. </connor>
<connor> There's so many aspects that can help </connor>
<connor> elevate the joke in anime. </connor>
<joey> - I think that comes down
to, at least with manga, </joey>
<connor> how good you are at like framing, right. </connor>
<connor> And I think Munata Yuske is
so fucking good at framing </connor>
<connor> like a concept that he can just
somehow do that with comedy </connor>
<joey> as well. </joey>
<joey> Like he already proved it with </joey>
<connor> "Eyeshield 21's", like, action scenes. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh yeah.
- [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And he, </connor>
<joey> this man can also do comedy as well. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What can this man not do?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I've read the original one rap comic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> How was that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's, it's a, it's a lot harder to go to. </connor>
<connor> (group laughing) </connor>
<joey> But also I noticed- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] So explain one can't draw. </joey>
<joey> That's why he got (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] So the original, yeah, </joey>
<joey> the original "One Punch
Man" is a web comic. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure you guys know this. </joey>
<joey> It's a web comic and then
Murata Yusuke picked it up </joey>
<joey> and was like, "Hey, let
me draw good for you." </joey>
<joey> Like real good. </joey>
<joey> And then published in Shonnen, not Jump, </joey>
<garnt> it used to be Jump, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Jump Plus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jump Plus now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's once a month, which is painful </garnt>
<garnt> because I think Wandered Weekly... </garnt>
<garnt> Is... I believe the web
comics over now, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kind of, I guess it's not
over, it's just on hiatus. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I've read up to everything </garnt>
<garnt> that's out and it's just kind of </garnt>
<connor> in the middle of an arc right now. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like the manga right
now is adapting its so- </connor>
<garnt> - It's in the monster arc still. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's still in the monster arc. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's taken the web
comic as kind of like a, </garnt>
<garnt> like a basis, and just
really expanding on that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I've noticed because
they've in the differences </connor>
<connor> between the manga and the web comic </connor>
<connor> is that they've put aspect
of the story that happened. </connor>
<connor> They've moved them around in the manga </connor>
<connor> into like better timings. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like there's some characters
that got their backstory </connor>
<connor> in the web comic a certain
time that they were shifted </connor>
<connor> to them when they were having a fight, </connor>
<connor> they got the flashback and the backstory, </connor>
<connor> like there's a superhero
called Super Black Alloy. </connor>
<connor> (group laughing) </connor>
<connor> Who is a man that is super muscular. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's his thing. </connor>
<connor> And he gets his flashback
in a different time. </connor>
<joey> But in the actual, the redone manga, </joey>
<joey> he gets it during one of
his fights with Garoah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Which I noticed was like, "Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> That's interesting." </joey>
<joey> I didn't know they were
mixing things around. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah, the manga is, oh my God, </connor>
<connor> just take one look at some of these panels </connor>
<connor> and you'll be, yeah, you'll
be reading it for sure. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's definitely one
of the best action manga </garnt>
<connor> I've ever read. </connor>
<garnt> If not the best, honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it's hard. </connor>
<connor> I can't think of anything that
in terms of just pure action </connor>
<connor> and fights that comes close in mind. </connor>
<connor> I mean but I haven't read
many, so I can't say it, </connor>
<joey> but (indistinct)- </joey>
<connor> - I mean I still think
it's one of the best. </connor>
<garnt> - It's definitely one of the best. </garnt>
<connor> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck we started. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Using the
internet without ExpressVPN </garnt>
<garnt> is like taking a call on
the train or bus on speaker </garnt>
<garnt> for everyone to hear. </garnt>
<garnt> And who wants to do that? </garnt>
<connor> - No one. </connor>
<connor> - Joey did you know that your
internet service provider </connor>
<connor> can see every single website you visit? </connor>
<connor> - You're joking. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not joking. </connor>
<connor> - I might as well just
strip in front of them. </connor>
<connor> - But did you know there's
a way that you can stop it. </connor>
<connor> - How? </connor>
<connor> - By using ExpressVPN goddamit. </connor>
<garnt> They won't even see a
website that you go to. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] ExpressVPN creates a secure, </garnt>
<garnt> encrypted tunnel between
your device and the internet. </garnt>
<garnt> So people can't peep on
your online activity. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really easy to use. </connor>

<connor> Back to the show. </connor>
<connor> - I really like, as we
said, "Terraformers." </connor>
<connor> "Terraformers" is a great action. </connor>
<connor> - That was a great manga. </connor>
<connor> - But like the story is
kind of meh at times. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But the action is spot on. </joey>
<joey> It's so cool. </joey>
<joey> Actually, we spoke about
"Terraformers" before, </joey>
<joey> but "Terraformers" is just, it's a manga </joey>
<connor> which is one of my favorites. </connor>
<connor> And it has like a ridiculous
amount of chapters. </connor>
<connor> I think like 400 something I think it has. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 30.. </connor>
<joey> - It has a lot. </joey>
<joey> - It's almost 30 volumes, I think. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's like, </connor>
<joey> I think they just started a new arc </joey>
<joey> when I stopped reading it. </joey>
<connor> And it felt like it was going
to be the last and biggest arc </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Fuck me." </joey>
<joey> - I think it's already finished. </joey>
<connor> - Is it finished? </connor>
<joey> - I think. </joey>
<connor> - Has it? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - No way. </joey>
<joey> - Because I only read up to around like </joey>
<joey> volume, like, 11 or 12. </joey>
<connor> - So the concept of "Terraformers", </connor>
<connor> which dude I was so fucking
sold on this concept, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I was like, that's fucking badass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's very cool. </joey>
<joey> - So they sent a mission
to explore the moon. </joey>
<joey> And when they got there, </joey>
<joey> there was cockroaches that could just, </joey>
<joey> they were just ripped like... </joey>
<joey> - GigaChad. </joey>
<garnt> - GigaChad cockroaches. </garnt>
<joey> - Someone has shot their
fridge into the moon </joey>
<joey> and it had cockroach on there. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, may bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry about that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like GigaChad cockroach. </garnt>
<connor> I know we spoken about
"Terraformers" before </connor>
<connor> in like the third episode or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's been a while.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so there's cockroaches on the moon </connor>
<connor> and turns out they're not
just any normal cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> They're GigaChad cockroaches </connor>
<connor> that are like super human beings. </connor>
<connor> Super smart, but have the
senses of cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So this whole team dies that goes there </connor>
<connor> and you see this right away. </connor>
<connor> So it's not a spoiler. </connor>
<connor> So then Earth goes in there
like, "We must do something." </connor>
<connor> So they go and get warriors or
people they think are worthy </connor>
<connor> to fight and they inject them
in their DNA with insect DNA. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah insect DNA. </connor>
<joey> - So each one of them
has insect attributes. </joey>
<connor> So one of them is like a praying
mantis mixed with a human </connor>
<connor> and so he can punch really
like lightning fast. </connor>
<joey> - One of them I think they injected </joey>
<joey> with like a flea so they can
jump really fucking high. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And one, this was and average sort, </joey>
<connor> one of them got the, what is the? </connor>
<connor> Fuck what's it called? </connor>
<connor> It's the shrimp that
can like flick at like? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh the punching shrimp. </connor>
<connor> - The mantis shrimp. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] The mantis shrimp. </connor>
<connor> - The mantis shrimp that can break glass </connor>
<garnt> by flicking the air in front of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh shit. </garnt>
<joey> I know the mantis shrimp is bad ass." </joey>
<joey> And so then they send them to the moon </joey>
<connor> to go and do research
and fight back against- </connor>
<connor> - Fight the GigaChads. </connor>
<connor> - And it's so fucking cool </connor>
<connor> 'cause then it turns into
like a political thing </connor>
<connor> because obviously if
there's shit on the moon, </connor>
<joey> it's going to be a lot
of countries arguing </joey>
<joey> about what's going on
there and who did it? </joey>
<joey> Why was this here? </joey>
<connor> How many, how many chapters they have? </connor>
<connor> - [Producer] 22 Volumes. </connor>
<connor> - 22 volumes? </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - It is over or is it still going? </joey>
<joey> - [Producer] It's 2000.. yeah it's over. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, it's over? </connor>
<connor> Okay I need to finish it then. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess this is just the Connor </garnt>
<garnt> needs to catch up to manga episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - I read it three years ago? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And it was still ongoing. </joey>
<connor> Was it? </connor>
<connor> When did it end? </connor>
<joey> - A couple of years ago, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Producer] 2014. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - I think it started in 2014, didn't it? </joey>
<connor> - [Producer] It started in 2011. </connor>
<joey> - Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - Wait when did it finish? </joey>
<connor> - [Producer] 2014. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> There's no way I could
have read everything </connor>
<connor> because when I finished
reading it, it was not done. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It was still going at that
point, I'm pretty sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you sure it's over? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Producer] Yeah I double checked. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - Either way you need to catch up on it. </joey>
<joey> - Either way I need to catch up </joey>
<joey> and it was such a fun manga. </joey>
<connor> And if you like "One Punch Man," </connor>
<connor> I think you'll love "Terraformers." </connor>
<garnt> - I'm curious. </garnt>
<garnt> How did you find "Terraformers?" </garnt>
<joey> - I watched the anime. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<connor> Oh my God!
- I'm sorry. </connor>
<joey> I'm sorry you had to go through that. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm so sorry, </garnt>
<garnt> what convinced you from
the anime to be like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'll read the manga, maybe the manga." </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe the manga's better. </garnt>
<connor> - From, okay, so "Terraformers"
had an anime adaptation </connor>
<connor> and it was notorious for
being absolutely dreadful </connor>
<connor> because what they did </connor>
<connor> was they made this extremely gory anime </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "This is great. </connor>
<connor> Let's just censor everything." </connor>
<connor> But they did it in the worst fucking way. </connor>
<connor> They literally just put black dots </connor>
<connor> and bars across the screen. </connor>
<connor> So there was some scenes where
you couldn't see anything. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally infamous
because I remember when it first- </connor>
<connor> - Put some screenshots on the screen. </connor>
<connor> - Because I remember I
read the "Terraformers" </connor>
<connor> before the anime came
out and I was just like, </connor>
<joey> "How are they going to adapt this?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause some of these scenes
are pretty brutal, pretty gory. </joey>
<joey> - There are brutal yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I saw that, </joey>
<garnt> I think a famous scene as well, </garnt>
<garnt> like the cockroach is
holding someone's head </garnt>
<garnt> and he's just holding a black dot. </garnt>
<connor> - A black circle. </connor>
<connor> - Because dude, this I,
I'm still convinced, right, </connor>
<connor> if this had like a good anime adaptation, </connor>
<connor> like a solid animation, like
not "One Punch Man" level, </connor>
<joey> but close to it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Of the action scenes
being done that well, </connor>
<connor> this would be like fucking top 10 anime. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I was looking forward to it </connor>
<garnt> because I remember I got
recommended the manga </garnt>
<garnt> from one of my friends who, he was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Dude, you have to fucking read this. </connor>
<joey> This is amazing." </joey>
<connor> I read, I was like, "Oh!" </connor>
<connor> - Because could you imagine
the shock people would get </connor>
<connor> when they're like, there's a scene right, </connor>
<connor> where it's very early on so
it's not really a spoiler, </connor>
<joey> but one of the scenes 'cause all the teams </joey>
<joey> drop in different locations on the moon. </joey>
<joey> So you kind of get like play by plays </joey>
<joey> of where all the different
teams are on the moon. </joey>
<joey> And one of the scenes
where one team just goes </joey>
<connor> out of the ship and immediately just, </connor>
<connor> they see a flash and someone
lost their head already </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "Holy shit!" </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] And it was like
right after she was injected </joey>
<connor> as well so it was like,
"All right, here comes, </connor>
<connor> Here comes the part where she kicks ass." </connor>
<joey> And then immediately dies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh shit,
that they're stronger." </connor>
<joey> And it's like, </joey>
<connor> everything about the show is so hype </connor>
<connor> and like reading the manga, it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, how are they
going to build on this?" </connor>
<connor> And they just keep finding ways </connor>
<connor> to make it more and more interesting. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "Holy shit!" </joey>
<garnt> - And the art style is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so good!
- The art is so good! </garnt>
<joey> - The art is so good. </joey>
<connor> - Like the manga just
never stops kicking off. </connor>
<connor> It's like permanently, just kicking off. </connor>
<connor> - It's called really popping off. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah there's always fights. </garnt>
<garnt> And if there's not fights, </garnt>
<garnt> there's some like "Game of Thrones" </garnt>
<connor> political shit going on. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "All right. </connor>
<connor> Just because we're on
the moon doesn't mean </connor>
<connor> that China doesn't hate Russia." </connor>
<connor> Like there's stuff going on. </connor>
<connor> And then it's like, it's so it's so good. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I love how they introduce,
like I love it when shows, </connor>
<garnt> when there's a lot of
characters that is like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the character,
this is where they're from. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the height. </garnt>
<garnt> This is their ability. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, "Sick, sick. </garnt>
<garnt> Thanks." </garnt>
<connor> Now I can mentally
remember that information. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause how I
discovered "Terraformers" </garnt>
<connor> is moving on to the next show
on your list which is "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> Like I, I literally finished "Gantz" </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I need
more shows like 'Gantz.'" </connor>
<connor> - It's very reminiscent on "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just like how
brutal and unpredictable, </connor>
<connor> like unpredictable it is in
terms of who's going to live, </connor>
<connor> who's going to die. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's the meme wedge where
if you can't predict </connor>
<connor> what's going to happen
or who's going to die, </connor>
<connor> it's like, oh, it's kind of
like the "Game of Thrones." </connor>
<garnt> But like the first time I
actually was like properly shocked </garnt>
<garnt> at who lived and who
died was fucking "Gantz." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which I don't know if, </joey>
<garnt> how much we can go into
spoilers about "Gantz." </garnt>
<garnt> But like, you cannot predict who dies. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's insane, it's insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And the anime was like, it was decent. </joey>
<connor> It was pretty solid as well. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah I feel like
if you are between the ages </connor>
<connor> of like, even though you
shouldn't be reading this for 16, </connor>
<garnt> but if you are the age of 16- </garnt>
<garnt> - No this is like the perfect... </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've watched the
anime when I was 16 years old. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like the most I'm 16. </connor>
<garnt> And I want to be experiencing badass shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (guys laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> Because, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a scene that
happens very early on right. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is quite graphic, where, </garnt>
<connor> so I wish I could explain
the premise, right. </connor>
<connor> So "Gantz", what happens is wait, </connor>
<connor> how does it very, very start. </connor>
<joey> - It starts with the two main characters </joey>
<garnt> jumping in front of a train. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah so-
- Oh yeah that's, oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> That's right. </joey>
<garnt> - So the two characters
die in a train crash </garnt>
<connor> or like they didn't- </connor>
<connor> - And that scene was fucked as well. </connor>
<joey> - So they died pretty
brutally in a train crash. </joey>
<connor> And afterwards they wake up in this room </connor>
<connor> and this black circle has transported then </connor>
<connor> to this room along with a lot of- </connor>
<connor> - It's so fucking iconic. </connor>
<connor> - Along with other
people who have just died </connor>
<connor> and the (indistinct)- </connor>
<connor> - And everyone's wearing a suit, right. </connor>
<connor> - And everyone's wearing a suit. </connor>
<connor> They kind of look like they're wearing </connor>
<connor> like gimp suits or whatever- </connor>
<connor> - Morph suits. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And they're told that they
have to go kill this alien. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh wait, no, they don't wear the suits. </connor>
<garnt> They're told to wear the suits. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah they're told to wear the suits. </garnt>
<connor> - Some people don't
want to wear the suits. </connor>
<connor> - And it looks, it looks like a fucking- </connor>
<connor> - It does looks like a gimp suit. </connor>
<garnt> - It does kind of look
like a gimp suit, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And there's just a moment in this anime, </garnt>
<garnt> and the manga, it's a slight spoiler, </garnt>
<garnt> but not really. </garnt>
<garnt> Happens pretty early on. </garnt>
<garnt> Where like a girl gets
transported in the room </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like a teenage boy </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like, "Let's have sex." </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like, "Okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And they just have sex. </garnt>
<garnt> And you see it. </garnt>
<connor> You're like, "Whoa, okay. </connor>
<connor> What!" </connor>
<joey> - And they don't do a
"Terraformers" in the anime. </joey>
<joey> They show it in the anime. </joey>
<joey> - In the anime there's literally </joey>
<garnt> two sex scenes in the anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and he just starts
having sex with her </connor>
<connor> in the fucking hallway of this house. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Whoa, okay. </connor>
<connor> I haven't experienced
this before in a manga </connor>
<connor> and its just fucking happening. </connor>
<connor> All right." </connor>
<joey> - I don't even think Dojen's
could get into the sex scenes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it was literally a girl being like, </connor>
<connor> "Do you want to have
sex because we're dead?" </connor>
<connor> - And he's like, "Yeah, sure." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And I remember watching,
literally watching "Gantz," </garnt>
<connor> when I was about like, yeah, 15, 16. </connor>
<connor> - It is the most, "I'm 16
and want a badass show." </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, they're showing
a sex scene in an anime." </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean even now </connor>
<garnt> when I, when I read it like last year. </garnt>
<joey> You know, it's one of those shows </joey>
<joey> that there's nothing quite like it. </joey>
<joey> Whoa this is really fresh. </joey>
<joey> Holy Shit. </joey>
<joey> I haven't experienced anything like this. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it doesn't hold punches, you know? </joey>
<connor> And the whole aspect is that
they have to kill these demons </connor>
<garnt> that exist in the human world. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aliens. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah aliens. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they say that there's been aliens </connor>
<garnt> that have been living in the human world </garnt>
<garnt> and then they have to
like kill them and so- </garnt>
<connor> - And they're worth points. </connor>
<connor> And they have to get X amount
of points to come back alive. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Or, you know, there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's different things
that they can do with points. </garnt>
<garnt> They can bring people
who have died before, </garnt>
<garnt> back to life as well. </garnt>
<garnt> The point is that to kill an alien first, </garnt>
<connor> you think it's like an easy thing to do, </connor>
<connor> but like it's really, really, </connor>
<connor> fucking difficult to kill these aliens. </connor>
<connor> And every arc, there's a different alien </connor>
<connor> that they need to kill
and there's a different- </connor>
<connor> - It's harder and harder. </connor>
<connor> - And it gets harder and
harder and progressively </connor>
<connor> like more and more people die to the point </connor>
<joey> where you can never really
expect who's going to live </joey>
<joey> and who's going to die. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like the peak arc was part two, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like separated
into three parts. </joey>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think part two was the best. </connor>
<connor> Part three had some really,
really good moments. </connor>
<connor> I feel like there is a
certain climax to "Gantz" </connor>
<connor> that really like, it really,
it made me really existential. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah I know what you're on about. </connor>
<connor> - And without spoiling
too specific details, </connor>
<connor> when they find the creator of these balls, </connor>
<connor> that fucking scene just like, </connor>
<connor> I remember reading the
events of that scene. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Oh my God." </garnt>
<joey> - This man did like 10 tabs of LSD. </joey>
<joey> It's so like give your
gigabrain existentialism </joey>
<joey> - I mean have you read
anything else Oku Hiro? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I've I know he did the- </connor>
<joey> - "Inuyashiki" was fucked. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I've heard. </connor>
<connor> I know of the other stuff he's done </connor>
<connor> and it's all fucked from what I've heard. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah he did it in "Inuyashiki", </joey>
<connor> the most recent one he did
was this one called "Gigant." </connor>
<connor> - I've heard of it. </connor>
<connor> - "Gigant?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah "Gigant." </connor>
<joey> It's like Gigith and Garnt put together. </joey>
<joey> (guys laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Is it another, just awful... </connor>
<joey> - "Gigant" is also just like,
I've started reading it. </joey>
<garnt> It's real-
- Is it finished? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's still going.
- I can't fucking take this. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't take that title seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really fucking good </garnt>
<joey> but it's like, you know,
it's an Oku Hiro manga </joey>
<joey> because it's just fucked. </joey>
<connor> - There is a, </connor>
<connor> there is one scene that I will warn you </connor>
<connor> is extremely questionable in the show. </connor>
<connor> And we spoke about this
before in the podcast. </connor>
<connor> It is extremely questionable. </connor>
<connor> Just giving you a heads up. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's a little racist. </joey>
<connor> It's quite racist. </connor>
<joey> - Well I mean, "Eyeshield"
has a similar scene. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah we spoke about this
before on the podcast as well, </joey>
<joey> but just get heads up. </joey>
<joey> If you do go into it, </joey>
<joey> there is like that moment. </joey>
<connor> It's very yikes in like, "Okay. </connor>
<garnt> All right." </garnt>
<joey> - It's like all right, cool. </joey>
<joey> - It's, what I love about
"Gantz" and "Terraformers" </joey>
<joey> it's just, it's pure bat shit insane fun. </joey>
<connor> It is. </connor>
<connor> And like, it's, </connor>
<garnt> it's kind of like the edgy
16 year old in you, but like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Hundred percent. </garnt>
<connor> But it brings out the 16
year old in you who thinks </connor>
<connor> like just fighting and death is bad ass. </connor>
<garnt> - But like there's like two
kind of different categories </garnt>
<connor> I put this in, you know, </connor>
<garnt> there's like the edgy 16
year old kind of shows </garnt>
<joey> where it brings that out of you. </joey>
<joey> And it remembers what you
felt like when you were 16. </joey>
<joey> And then there's shows like "Elfin Lied" </joey>
<joey> and "Mirai Nikki"- </joey>
<joey> - I was about to say "Elfin Lied". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that you watch and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Damn, why the fuck
did I ever enjoy this?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> "Gantz" I can look back and
I'm like, "That was good." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah that was good. </joey>
<joey> - "Elfin Lied" I look back and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Why was this even remotely popular" </joey>
<joey> - I was like.
- This show sucks. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like "'Elfin Lied':
10 out of 10 when I was 16 and </garnt>
<joey> now I'm like- </joey>
<garnt> - Was I this easy to trick when I was 16 </garnt>
<garnt> when I saw blood and tits. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, because when you were 16, </garnt>
<garnt> this is new to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - This shit is exciting. </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Whoa, they can do this." </connor>
<connor> - It's edgy, it's artistic. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I remember a point when
"Elfen Lied" was literally, </garnt>
<garnt> when I joined the community, </garnt>
<garnt> "Elfen Lied" was considered
like a modern day classic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think to a lot of people it still is. </garnt>
<joey> - No! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah to a lot of people it still do. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then someone was like, </connor>
<connor> "If you thought the anime was good, </connor>
<connor> read the manga." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like completely different. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, bet." </connor>
<connor> - And it's no different. </connor>
<connor> - No, it is. </connor>
<connor> It's actually more fucked in the manga. </connor>
<joey> But like, you know, 16
year old Asian me was like, </joey>
<joey> "How could they improve on this?" </joey>
<joey> And then you read it now. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "All right." </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think I watched like
"Fullmetal Alchemist" before it </connor>
<connor> and just going from that
where I was like, "Okay." </connor>
<connor> - You went from "Fullmetal
Alchemist" to "Elfen Lied?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I was like looking at my monitor </connor>
<joey> with like with all these
fucking pop-ups everywhere. </joey>
<joey> Like, "Whoa, what the fuck? </joey>
<connor> She just cut them up and
with like, ghost arms." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that like the next show </garnt>
<garnt> after "Elfen Lied" and "Mirai Nikki" </garnt>
<garnt> was probably "Akame Ga Kill." </garnt>
<joey> Where... </joey>
<garnt> Well, I remember it got so fucking popular </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I watched the anime. </joey>
<garnt> - That is peak I am 16 and edgy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I am 16. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm 14 and this is deep. </garnt>
<connor> - I am convinced. </connor>
<connor> Right, okay. </connor>
<connor> I like "Elfen", I (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> I like "Akame Ga Kill." </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to say it right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I like it, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care people say, I like it. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck you. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait did you finish it? </joey>
<connor> - The anime?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You still like it? </joey>
<connor> - I still like it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> You can clown on me all you want. </joey>
<joey> I liked it. </joey>
<connor> - That's fine. </connor>
<connor> That's fine. </connor>
<connor> You're entitled to your wrong opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - This is good. </garnt>
<garnt> I think this will make sense. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just how I view it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - POV, you're a "Fairytale" fan. </garnt>
<garnt> You're tired of "Fairytale." </garnt>
<garnt> You want something a little edgier. </garnt>
<garnt> You go immediately to "Akame
Ga Kill" that's, it feels... </garnt>
<connor> Think about it. </connor>
<connor> It is literally "Fairytale", with fans, </connor>
<garnt> but with way more edge. </garnt>
<connor> Because it feels like
"Fairytale" in many aspects </connor>
<connor> where it's like, "This
is dumb, dumb shit." </connor>
<garnt> - Why specifically "Fairytale?" </garnt>
<connor> - Because... </connor>
<connor> People who like "Akame Ga
Kill" are "Fairytale" fans. </connor>
<joey> - You are right about that. </joey>
<connor> - It is literally, if you
are a "Fairytale" fan, </connor>
<joey> I bet you love "Akame Ga Kill." </joey>
<garnt> - You are right a hundred percent. </garnt>
<connor> - Think about it. </connor>
<garnt> Think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd say it's more "Seven Deadly Sins." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all going to be in the same pool. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Seven Deadly Sins" I
think is slightly different. </garnt>
<connor> - You think so? </connor>
<connor> - We need to make a chart of like </connor>
<connor> what you're likely to
like, based on what shows. </connor>
<connor> - Can we just get like a corkboard? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah we do, right. </connor>
<connor> I think, I think if "Seven
Deadly Sins" is on one end, </connor>
<connor> it's like "Hunter x Hunter"
is on the other end, I think. </connor>
<connor> And then what other shonnens
are there that like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, </connor>
<connor> just like fucking "Seven
Deadly Sins" somewhere else. </connor>
<garnt> - To me "Akame Ga Kill" is
just like the generation </garnt>
<garnt> that go onto "Seven Deadly
Sins" or "Fairytale." </garnt>
<garnt> And then they also have
watch "Mirai Nikki." </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like, "What
if we just combine the two? </garnt>
<garnt> What if we just combine the two </garnt>
<garnt> and then you get 'Akame ga
Kill' and you're like, great. </garnt>
<garnt> You require even less
brain cells to enjoy this. </garnt>
<connor> Brilliant." </connor>
<connor> - I, even though I recognize
the ending was fucking dumb </connor>
<connor> for "Akame ga Kill," I liked it. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was fun. </connor>
<connor> I had a great time watching that. </connor>
<connor> I'm not afraid to admit that. </connor>
<garnt> - The plot twist. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I was just like, "Come the fuck on." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, is was come the fuck on. </joey>
<joey> But I still had a lot of fun. </joey>
<connor> Like before that, I had a
lot of fun with the show. </connor>
<joey> I really enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Admittedly, as much as I
clown on "Akame Ga Kill," </joey>
<connor> first like five, six episodes-pretty fun. </connor>
<joey> This is like brainless fun, but- </joey>
<connor> - You know what else I read
that I read all of as well? </connor>
<joey> Was, I just remembered it now. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, would you have anything else? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> I was just going to say- </joey>
<connor> I read all of "Deadman Wonderland." </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh that's also I'm 16 and edgy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just all rushing back now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, I want it, you know what? </garnt>
<connor> I went on the thing where I was like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because the anime ending sucked. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, I want it. </connor>
<connor> This was like two years ago, I read it. </connor>
<connor> I had the feeling, I was
like, "You know what? </connor>
<joey> I just want to finish an manga to an anime </joey>
<joey> that didn't get an ending." </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Okay,
'Deadman Wonderland.'" </connor>
<joey> And the manga was definitely better, </joey>
<connor> but the manga had a shit ending too. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, not as bad as the anime, </joey>
<connor> but it was still not as, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It was still shit. </joey>
<joey> It was fine. </joey>
<connor> "Deadman Wonderland"
was very five out of 10. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think I was exactly the same. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I finished "Deadman Wonderland." </connor>
<connor> - I like the anime a lot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the anime was great
until about episode 10. </connor>
<connor> And then the last couple of episodes </connor>
<connor> where they're just like,
"Oh, ran out of budget." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, basically. </joey>
<connor> - And so I was like, "Okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> I need to see how this ends." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So what did we talk about so far? </connor>
<garnt> - Do we need to talk about "Jojo?" </garnt>
<garnt> Do we really need to talk about Jo? </garnt>
<connor> Do you want to talk about "Jojo?" </connor>
<garnt> - Did you have a favorite part? </garnt>
<connor> - To read, seven. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't actually
read your "Jojolion" yet, </joey>
<joey> but as of the time of recording this, </joey>
<joey> they just announced that
it's going to end next month. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah next month. </joey>
<joey> - I'm probably going to
speed run reading "Jojolion." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I- </joey>
<connor> - So that I can talk
about it when it finishes. </connor>
<connor> - Still have to read. </connor>
<joey> I think I'm like one
volume behind right now </joey>
<joey> and it's pretty fucking good so far. </joey>
<joey> I'm surprised they're
ending it this soon though </joey>
<joey> because I'm not going to go into. </joey>
<connor> - I've heard that it was not too long ago </connor>
<connor> that we got introduced
to the main villains. </connor>
<connor> So I'm not going to, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to say anything
because I don't know anything. </connor>
<joey> That's just what I know. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause everyone was telling
me that it had so much left, </joey>
<joey> but whatever. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to, I'm
probably going to read it. </joey>
<joey> I might make a video about it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I should
on my main channel. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty good. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe I will, maybe I won't. </connor>
<garnt> - I wouldn't say it's as good as- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it would be on brand for you. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it would be on brand for you. </joey>
<garnt> - In my opinion, it's not as
good as like part six or seven, </garnt>
<connor> but it's up there. </connor>
<joey> It's still pretty good. </joey>
<joey> It's "Jojo." </joey>
<connor> - So we'll see how it we'll see how this, </connor>
<joey> how your feelings will
change when the new- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like the ending of "Jojolion"
might be fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah true. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, "Jojo," I mean- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it was the "Jojo" manga </garnt>
<garnt> that made you a "Jojo" fan. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> So it was definitely I
was watching part five </joey>
<joey> and I wanted more of part five </joey>
<joey> because it hadn't fully aired. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We were only like 10 episodes in </joey>
<joey> and I was really enjoying it. </joey>
<connor> So I went and picked up the manga. </connor>
<connor> And I just fucking loved it. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, it's such a great time. </connor>
<joey> It's a shame that it's the
English official release </joey>
<joey> is quite slow. </joey>
<joey> I think they just finished
part 4 translation. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean like-
- Oh really? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh geez. </connor>
<connor> - Like a lot of people
forget that "JoJo" just like, </connor>
<connor> was this super fucking underground manga? </connor>
<connor> That only like a select
few people really read </connor>
<connor> before the anime became a thing. </connor>
<connor> - In the West. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah in the West. </joey>
<joey> And so like, there was just no interest </joey>
<joey> to translate it officially
until the anime came out. </joey>
<garnt> Now it's weird seeing it
become this like massive, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the most biggest anime franchises. </garnt>
<joey> - I made a video on, what was it? </joey>
<garnt> It was like, </garnt>
<joey> I had this series like back in the day, </joey>
<joey> it's like five years
ago, I had this series </joey>
<connor> where I would like go into manga </connor>
<connor> and like kind of find like myths </connor>
<connor> and like kind of secrets
and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> and kind of talk about it. </connor>
<connor> I remember I made a video on, </connor>
<garnt> it was part three "Oingo
Boingo" and there's that like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, the manga that he opens? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh the 9-11? </garnt>
<garnt> - The 9-11 thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I made a video on that five years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> No views. </garnt>
<garnt> No views at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh my God." </garnt>
<joey> And that's when I realized I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh no one in the West knows 'Jojo'." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- At that point. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like "Jojo" was such a 50/50 </connor>
<garnt> on whether it would do well. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it just- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm really surprised that it did. </garnt>
<connor> - It just got, </connor>
<joey> I think it just got lucky with the memes. </joey>
<garnt> - I think so yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> so perfected for meme
culture that it was like, </garnt>
<connor> so ahead of its time. </connor>
<connor> And it's really weird. </connor>
<joey> - Because it wasn't really
meme'd until part three. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The anime came out. </joey>
<joey> - I guess so. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I did not
see anything about it </joey>
<joey> until part three came out. </joey>
<joey> And then I saw I never stopped </joey>
<connor> seeing the "Dio versus
Joejaro" like steam sale memes, </connor>
<connor> you know. </connor>
<garnt> You'd see a ton of memes
with the "Ora-ora-ora" </garnt>
<joey> and all that. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's when it really started
picking up steam I think. </joey>
<joey> And then it started, </joey>
<joey> I think the people started realizing </joey>
<connor> how good the anime adaptation was. </connor>
<connor> And then part, </connor>
<connor> I remember it really
kicked off during part four </connor>
<connor> was airing in the West, </connor>
<connor> was when it started
really getting some steam. </connor>
<connor> And then part five, just like insane. </connor>
<connor> - Blew it out of the water. </connor>
<connor> - The part five anime
adaptation of "JoJo" really like </connor>
<connor> sent it into like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause the fucking
"Giorno" theme did numbers </connor>
<connor> for the meme community
and "Jojo in general." </connor>
<connor> I mean, how many people got into part, </connor>
<connor> "JoJo" in general, </connor>
<connor> from the Giorno's theme? </connor>
<connor> Because I mean, it's- </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the, </garnt>
<garnt> what was the "Undertail" theme? </garnt>
<connor> - "Megalomania?" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah that's the one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's up there with "Megalovania" </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of like iconic meme usage. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's that of the anime community. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because think of like
iconic meme that came out </garnt>
<garnt> in the past 10 years,
what have you got there? </garnt>
<garnt> Like actual, like iconic,
like super iconic. </garnt>
<garnt> "Giorno's theme", "Megalovania." </garnt>
<garnt> There's probably some
other than forgetting. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Chug jug. </connor>
<connor> - I think that wasn't there
wasn't really an explosion </connor>
<garnt> of like, "JoJo" never exploded. </garnt>
<joey> It just slowly crept up in
popularity until you couldn't, </joey>
<joey> you couldn't like stop- </joey>
<joey> - It's almost inescapable. </joey>
<connor> - I just think part five really helped. </connor>
<connor> Since part five started
airing, it really blew up. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a noticeable change. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in my opinion, </connor>
<joey> part five is probably
one of the only parts </joey>
<joey> where it's actually better in the anime. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Part four I think you can go either or. </joey>
<joey> - Part four is yeah either or. </joey>
<joey> - Three, two, and one,
hundred percent the manga. </joey>
<garnt> - Manga yeah.
- Yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think part three was
like dragged out too much </garnt>
<connor> in the anime. </connor>
<connor> - You can speed run it in the manga. </connor>
<joey> You can be like, "All right, I'm over it." </joey>
<joey> Obviously don't do that, </joey>
<joey> but you can through it at a good pace. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the part three of
the anime is very slow, </joey>
<joey> which I think "Jojo" in
general is better in manga </joey>
<joey> also 'cause you have part six and seven, </joey>
<joey> which are very good, </joey>
<joey> part seven being, especially
notorious for being amazing. </joey>
<connor> Part seven is- </connor>
<connor> - Part seven is amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Part seven is where I feel like Araqui </connor>
<connor> really came into his own </connor>
<connor> and finally made like the
perfect "Jojo" partway. </connor>
<connor> There was no pacing issues. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Wow.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like every part of "Jojo" </connor>
<connor> had some kind of weird pacing
at some point or another. </connor>
<joey> - Every character is
fun and like memorable. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like for example, like part three, </connor>
<connor> it drags out a bunch. </connor>
<joey> Part two is very short and sweet. </joey>
<joey> You don't really get too
much, but it's very nice. </joey>
<joey> And that's why part two is really- </joey>
<joey> - I mean Joseph's the
only redeeming factor </joey>
<joey> about part two in a lot of ways right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Joseph is very... </joey>
<joey> Yeah, the villain's boring, right. </joey>
<connor> Part one. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's notoriously (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> It's quite boring. </joey>
<joey> I won't lie. </joey>
<connor> It has a lot of charm as a "JoJo" fan. </connor>
<connor> - But at least it's short. </connor>
<connor> - It's very short. </connor>
<connor> You can read through it. </connor>
<connor> Part four Kira, </connor>
<joey> who is arguably one of
the best villains in Jojo, </joey>
<joey> isn't there for the first half. </joey>
<joey> So you kind of get a slice
of life for the first part, </joey>
<connor> which is fun but it takes a while for it </connor>
<connor> to kind of find its footing. </connor>
<connor> - If you're not a fan
of that kind of stuff, </connor>
<connor> then you can easily like
fall off it and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Why is this popular? </connor>
<connor> Why do people like this?" </connor>
<connor> - Part five is very solid. </connor>
<joey> I think that Giorno is one
of the weaker "Jojo" bros. </joey>
<joey> - Jo Bros. </joey>
<connor> - You know but Bruno
Bucciarati does carry part 5. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then part 6, you know, it's good. </connor>
<connor> It obviously has a bit of
a controversial ending. </connor>
<connor> - I really like it. </connor>
<connor> - I like it but some people don't like it. </connor>
<connor> I can understand why people
wouldn't like it for the, </connor>
<connor> some parts of part six are a little weak. </connor>
<connor> But part seven is like from
the start to finish, banger. </connor>
<connor> Every single character,
banger, like the villains, </connor>
<connor> even like the side villains are amazing. </connor>
<joey> - I mean it does have kind of </joey>
<joey> the least memorable Jojos though. </joey>
<joey> Johnny. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like- </garnt>
<joey> - Johnny doesn't get good till
like the last quarter, maybe? </joey>
<connor> - Johnny comes into his own </connor>
<joey> but I feel like Jono doesn't
really come into his own </joey>
<connor> at any point. </connor>
<connor> Sorry if we're going on a
whole thought about "Jojo." </connor>
<garnt> - Watch or read "JoJo." </garnt>
<connor> - Just talk about "JoJo." </connor>
<garnt> - "Jojo" fans being "Jojo" fans. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You need to read it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause then you can experience part seven, </connor>
<joey> which you should a hundred percent read. </joey>
<joey> It is amazing. </joey>
<joey> No, you can't skip to it. </joey>
<joey> Don't do that. </joey>
<garnt> Because part seven has so many references </garnt>
<garnt> to previous parts. </garnt>
<garnt> You'd be spoiling it. </garnt>
<joey> Read it all, it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - All right, what else? </joey>
<joey> - "Vinland Saga." </joey>
<joey> - "Vinland Saga." </joey>
<connor> Did you put this on your list
or not or we'll get into it? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't put this on my list. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I almost did. </connor>
<garnt> But then I was like the anime is out. </garnt>
<connor> - "Vinland Saga" gets to go on my list, </connor>
<connor> one, because its banger, </connor>
<connor> two, because they spell
a Welsh town correctly. </connor>
<garnt> (guys laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got one of the most
badass like antagonists </garnt>
<garnt> in like manga, and he's Welsh. </garnt>
<garnt> He's Welsh as well. </garnt>
<connor> Of course I knew you'd love this. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's go lads! </garnt>
<garnt> - Represent! </garnt>
<garnt> - Represent! </garnt>
<garnt> They went to like somewhere, </garnt>
<connor> and I was so glad that they,
I want, I really want it, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I obviously I read it in English. </garnt>
<garnt> I really want to see how
they spelled this Welsh town. </garnt>
<garnt> Incatacana.
- Incatacana. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because it's like, </garnt>
<connor> it was like a Bruheynyuck or something. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "How the
fuck do you, how the, </connor>
<connor> how on earth do you"- </connor>
<connor> - I don't remember how </connor>
<joey> I'm pretty sure I got up to that part, </joey>
<joey> but I don't remember how they spelled it. </joey>
<connor> - I really want to see
how they spelled it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's a funny name. </joey>
<connor> - Because how on earth do
you put the (throat) sound? </connor>
<connor> - They probably don't. </connor>
<garnt> - They probably didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they probably did
like (attempt to pronounce). </garnt>
<garnt> But honestly, memes aside,
"Vinland Saga" is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Brilliant, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think even if I had
read more than 10 manga, </connor>
<joey> it would still be on there. </joey>
<joey> It is so fucking good. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's on hiatus
and it's still amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is it on hiatus? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like it's still- </connor>
<garnt> - I read up to a certain point. </garnt>
<connor> I caught up and then I stopped. </connor>
<garnt> - What is it about like
all these like Sain manga, </garnt>
<garnt> the Sain classics, I
would like to call them, </garnt>
<joey> that just eventually go on hiatus. </joey>
<joey> - The Sain masterpieces
always go on hiatus. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah Sain masterpieces
always go on hiatus. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Man it's just "Vinland
Saga" is just amazing. </connor>
<joey> And like when you realize
it's a fucking prologue, </joey>
<garnt> the first arc is just a prologue </garnt>
<garnt> and yet it's still one
of the best stories. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, what do you think for, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause if you've seen
season one of "Vinland Saga" </garnt>
<connor> you know what the prologue is. </connor>
<garnt> You know what the main beginning arc is. </garnt>
<connor> What do you think of the Farmland Arc? </connor>
<garnt> - I really like the Farmland Arc. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm excited to see the reaction
on the anime only viewers </garnt>
<garnt> to the Farmland Arc. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay so we won't talk too much about it. </connor>
<connor> Don't want to spoil it, but it
changes the pace drastically. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. So if you think </garnt>
<garnt> that if you're go into season two </garnt>
<garnt> thinking that it's going
to be in the same vein </garnt>
<garnt> as season one, you're
going to be disappointed. </garnt>
<connor> - The way I find a feel about it, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that "Berserk" and "Vinland Saga", </connor>
<joey> they have a crossroads </joey>
<joey> and they both went different ways with it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas, you know, for
example, Guts, right. </joey>
<joey> Never stops becoming violent. </joey>
<connor> Guts arguably becomes
more violent every time. </connor>
<connor> And you know, </connor>
<connor> "Vinland Saga" tries to make a character </connor>
<connor> that maybe feels a little
bit more guilty about that. </connor>
<garnt> And so that's what was
really interesting for me </garnt>
<garnt> is that they weren't just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, this guy's good at killing." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what he does now. </garnt>
<garnt> [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He just keeps killing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, no, he
actively, like, he matures. </garnt>
<garnt> He doesn't want to keep doing that. </garnt>
<connor> And that's what's so interesting about it. </connor>
<connor> And really recommend reading it. </connor>
<connor> It is just amazing. </connor>
<connor> - It like a huge artistic
risk he took with that- </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh Yeah.
- And it paid off. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like his, the worst thing he did </garnt>
<connor> was making the prologue so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Like imagine that being the
worst thing you could do. </connor>
<garnt> You made it so fucking good </garnt>
<garnt> that people expected
you to keep doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, he keeps doing it, </garnt>
<garnt> but in a completely
different type of story. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's like "Vinland
Saga" is fucking incredible, </garnt>
<garnt> but like the prologue is so different </garnt>
<garnt> than the rest of the story </garnt>
<garnt> that if you come into it
with the same expectations, </garnt>
<garnt> you're going to just get whiplash. </garnt>
<garnt> You're going to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where's the action? </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the killing? </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the violence? </garnt>
<garnt> There was so much of this in season one." </garnt>
<garnt> And now we're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> well, once you've realized </garnt>
<garnt> that the story was never about that, </garnt>
<garnt> that the story was all about- </garnt>
<connor> - They were building it up the whole time. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> When you realize that everything </garnt>
<garnt> that his father said at the beginning </garnt>
<joey> was what the story was meant to be about </joey>
<joey> from the get-go and everything else </joey>
<garnt> was just like, a bigger tangent </garnt>
<garnt> than anything that we've ever gone on. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, and that was.. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, season one was just a tangent. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's so true to life </garnt>
<connor> because even if your dad told you shit </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't fucking listen to him. </connor>
<connor> But then you'll realize
when you were an adult, </connor>
<connor> he was right all along. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - That's why and it's genius. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry I went against you father. </connor>
<connor> You were right. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good because it's so like, </connor>
<connor> even though the situation
is obviously crazy, </connor>
<connor> but even though it's
not that unbelievable, </connor>
<connor> because you know, it's set on </connor>
<connor> like a real part of history, you know? </connor>
<connor> And it builds characters
in such a compelling way </connor>
<connor> that is so realistic and
every single character </connor>
<connor> in this show, you're like, "I
believe that could be a dude." </connor>
<connor> You know, I believe that
I see parallels to myself </connor>
<connor> in some of these characters
that are uncomfortable </connor>
<joey> and that's what I loved about it. </joey>
<joey> It was so good. </joey>
<joey> And it presented war in a horrific way. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - As war should be. </joey>
<joey> And so if you haven't
please do yourself a solid </joey>
<garnt> and read "Vinland Saga." </garnt>
<garnt> It is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm so excited.
- If you like Vikings it's- </garnt>
<joey> - If you like Vikings. </joey>
<connor> Just at least read it for Askeladd </connor>
<connor> or at least watch the anime for Askeladd. </connor>
<connor> - Welsh represent. </connor>
<connor> - Because he is honestly like, </connor>
<garnt> I think one of my favorite characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah in anime.
- In the medium. </garnt>
<connor> - Straight up. </connor>
<garnt> And also, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm very excited for the
reaction to anime fans, </garnt>
<joey> anime-only fans to the- </joey>
<joey> - Season two. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah season two.
- Farmland arc. </garnt>
<connor> - To be like hey when does stuff happen? </connor>
<garnt> - So how long are they going
to stay on this farm for? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it goes from like
"Doom" to "Runescape" </connor>
<connor> in like one chapter. </connor>
<joey> - It's like "Doom" to "Farmville"- </joey>
<garnt> - It's like "Stardew Valley"
or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess that's spoilers enough right? </connor>
<connor> - I mean "Berserk" </connor>
<connor> we've literally just
talked about "Berserk." </connor>
<garnt> It's a classic for a reason. </garnt>
<connor> - I've spoken about "Claymore" before. </connor>
<garnt> "Claymore" again is a very similar </garnt>
<joey> to I guess "Berserk" in some ways. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's dark fantasy right? </joey>
<garnt> - Would you say you enjoyed it enough </garnt>
<garnt> that if you had read more manga, </garnt>
<garnt> you think it would still be in your- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think it would be on here </connor>
<connor> if I'd read some other big
names that I know I would enjoy. </connor>
<connor> I think it's got a banger first half. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then loses its steam. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's some stories
where you're reading the manga </joey>
<joey> and you're like this
motherfucker planned everything- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like a blueprint. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He knew exactly what
was going to happen. </joey>
<joey> And he knew exactly where this was going. </joey>
<joey> Whereas with "Claymore"
I feel like they would, </joey>
<connor> he was just like, </connor>
<connor> they were just writing
it and he had a core idea </connor>
<connor> and he just didn't </connor>
<connor> or they, I don't know
if it's a guy or a girl. </connor>
<connor> They just didn't really know
how they wanted to finish it. </connor>
<garnt> But that's, there's the, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe George R.R.
Martin talks about this. </garnt>
<garnt> There's two ways of writing stories </garnt>
<joey> and there's the architect </joey>
<joey> and the something to do </joey>
<joey> with like growing plants or something. </joey>
<joey> One likes to design
everything like a building. </joey>
<joey> You have every single
aspect, like out perfectly. </joey>
<joey> And the other it's like a greenhouse, </joey>
<joey> you just kind of grow
things, see where it goes. </joey>
<joey> See what goes with it. </joey>
<joey> I definitely feel like
that is a riskier way </joey>
<joey> of doing stories but also can lead </joey>
<joey> to some super interesting results. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I feel like "Claymore" </connor>
<joey> just kind of lost itself partway through. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like the
architect like type is like </joey>
<connor> the downside to it is like
you could build too much </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of have to like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh shit, I have to pick up
all these pieces somewhere." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you have so much </joey>
<joey> where maybe you build
too much of the world </joey>
<joey> which sometimes is a bad thing. </joey>
<connor> - I mean you call pull a Togashi right. </connor>
<connor> And just like "Hunter x Hunter" </connor>
<garnt> introduce like 17,000 things. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just harder to maintain as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Like you put more bricks down </connor>
<connor> and you put more bricks down. </connor>
<joey> Then you forget the foundations you laid, </joey>
<joey> then you start building a chimney </joey>
<joey> where you've already
built like a fireplace </joey>
<connor> on the other side. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't make like any sense sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, I'm running out of bricks. </connor>
<garnt> I don't have much time left my back hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't draw shit. </garnt>
<connor> I should've thought about this, that- </connor>
<joey> - Or you could just be like Araqui </joey>
<connor> and just be like, </connor>
<joey> "I'm just going to plant the
seed here and see how it goes." </joey>
<connor> - Which is what I love about that he... </connor>
<garnt> That is the perfect example
of that kind of writer. </garnt>
<garnt> Araqui literally just gives you ideas </garnt>
<garnt> and then he just keeps expanding on it. </garnt>
<connor> And you can tell you some idea
of where he wants it to go, </connor>
<connor> but you can tell also there's so many- </connor>
<connor> - It's not completely planned out. </connor>
<connor> - You can tell there's so many
moments where he just like, </connor>
<joey> and he even says it himself, right. </joey>
<joey> When he just decides to do things because- </joey>
<joey> - He doesn't remember
half the shit he wrote. </joey>
<joey> - It's such a fun way. </joey>
<joey> And it leads to such fun writing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a hundred percent. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, "Claymore,"
although an amazing concept, </joey>
<garnt> amazing first half. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, definitely loses steam. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] And the art is so good. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah the art is
up there as one of the best. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Fucking amazing bro. </connor>
<garnt> Fucking love that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is it about dark fantasy </garnt>
<joey> where just the art is
just always a banger? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> It's like a rite of passage, right? </connor>
<connor> Oh, you want to write a dark fantasy? </connor>
<connor> Show me your drawings. </connor>
<garnt> - You better have godly art. </garnt>
<connor> - And for some reason I'm a simple man. </connor>
<garnt> I like rankings. </garnt>
<connor> So whenever there's characters
and they have ranks and like- </connor>
<connor> - Spoken like a true gamer. </connor>
<connor> - They're clearly defined as
this is "number one strong," </connor>
<joey> this is "number two strong." </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I love that but- </joey>
<joey> - Because you're a gamer. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah because it's like- </connor>
<connor> - I feel like there's
just something embedded </connor>
<garnt> into like humans that just like ranking. </garnt>
<connor> - We love ranking things and I loved it... </connor>
<connor> And then the story aspect of "number seven </connor>
<connor> could actually be stronger
than number two in some ways." </connor>
<connor> And that's super interesting. </connor>
<connor> - I can see you why you
like "One Punch Man." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah "One Punch"... </connor>
<joey> I love the hero rating
system of "One Punch Man." </joey>
<joey> I think it leads to such
interesting, like characters, </joey>
<connor> in really strange ways. </connor>
<connor> Like yeah, I love the
Bicycle Man in there. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean that's just part
of like Shonen anime, right? </joey>
<joey> We need to rank people
'cause people like ranks. </joey>
<connor> The people like power. </connor>
<connor> - I love it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] What are the, what
are the Shonen Youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> going to make videos about
if we can't fucking rank. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - In Japanese companies, </garnt>
<garnt> you get ranked on your
performance with a ranking grade. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "I wanna be number one." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah so like, it's
like they love doing it. </joey>
<connor> It's everything needs to be ranked here. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I'm going to make a bidet rank. </connor>
<connor> - What I love is how
everyone's just found out </connor>
<connor> like power ranking things. </connor>
<garnt> Just like people just, </garnt>
<garnt> you could power rank
the most mundane things. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why we have tier lists Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why tier
lists is a thing, right? </garnt>
<connor> - This is literally why tier lists exist. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it's literally just power rankings. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then obviously "Eyeshield 21" </garnt>
<garnt> which is... </garnt>
<connor> I've watched "Kuroko no Basket." </connor>
<garnt> I've watched "Yowamushi Pedal." </garnt>
<joey> What other sports anime are famous? </joey>
<joey> - "Haikyuu." </joey>
<joey> - I've watched "Haikyuu." </joey>
<joey> - "Slam Dunk." </joey>
<joey> - I haven't read "Slam Dunk." </joey>
<joey> I'm going to read "Slam Dunk." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - But so far, this is my
favorite sports story. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, it's awesome. </joey>
<connor> - And again, like the visual- </connor>
<joey> - This single handedly got
me into American football. </joey>
<connor> - I still don't know the rules fully, </connor>
<connor> but I had a fun time. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's very
deviated from real life. </joey>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like I'm watching
real American football </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like,
where are the metaphors? </garnt>
<garnt> Where? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not going to lie. </joey>
<joey> Like I was like, you
know, when I read this, </joey>
<joey> cause I was like in the
prime of my childhood </joey>
<joey> when this was in Shonen Jump, right. </joey>
<garnt> So everyone like everyone was
trying to like do rodeo drives </garnt>
<garnt> and like devil back
ghosts and shit like that. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah where's the devil back ghost? </joey>
<joey> - It's just a great fucking manga man. </joey>
<joey> It's so good. </joey>
<connor> - It's good. </connor>
<joey> - I'd be lying if I said, I
didn't practice rodeo driving. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, this is the one move </joey>
<joey> that is probably like the most feasible. </joey>
<connor> - If I ever throw a football ever again, </connor>
<joey> you bet I'm going to like picture
a fucking angel behind me. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - There's a panel where like, </joey>
<joey> he throws this ball </joey>
<joey> and it's like this amazing
artwork of like this angel. </joey>
<joey> It's like the angel throw or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't remember what it was. </joey>
<connor> This panel, it's like a spread, </connor>
<connor> and it's fucking beautiful. </connor>
<connor> And it's just, oh, so good. </connor>
<garnt> - I think some of the best </garnt>
<garnt> is where you see the
battle of the metaphors. </garnt>
<connor> And I think it just makes the, </connor>
<connor> it makes the sports
scene so much more hype. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I can't remember the exact, </connor>
<connor> because it's been years and years </connor>
<connor> but I remember like very vividly
just someone kicking a ball </connor>
<connor> and it just like, </connor>
<connor> it kicked with like so
much force or something </connor>
<garnt> that it like penetrates
something that's... </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, I'm speaking... </garnt>
<garnt> What was like the second to last match? </garnt>
<connor> - The second to last match
was against the best school. </connor>
<joey> And they were like the
best school in Japan </joey>
<joey> because that's was probably
the highlight of it. </joey>
<garnt> And then afterwards they fight America. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's right. </garnt>
<joey> - And that kind of sucked. </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, they go against
like the best players, </garnt>
<garnt> the real number seven. </garnt>
<garnt> - The real number, the real- </garnt>
<garnt> - 21, 21. </garnt>
<garnt> "Eyeshield 21," fucking hell. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - "EyeShield 21."
- Real EyeShield 21. </connor>
<connor> - The real EyeShield 21.
- What was the number? </connor>
<connor> - Sorry then if that's spoilers, </connor>
<connor> that might be spoiler actually. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) spoiler warning. </connor>
<connor> Put this before. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's brilliant. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they face the
the real EyeSheild 21. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - And as they all have interesting
powers that is literally, </connor>
<connor> it's literally "Kuroko
no Basket" on the field. </connor>
<joey> - I think the guy who wrote "Eyeshield 21" </joey>
<connor> went on to do another Shonen Jump manga. </connor>
<connor> - "Dr. Stone?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. He wrote "Dr. Stone." </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - That's right.
- Yeah, I remember that. </connor>
<connor> Very good storyteller. </connor>
<joey> - Very different as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I like that. </joey>
<connor> All these, all these I would recommend. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly. </connor>
<connor> All of these are very, very solid shows. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's like, </connor>
<connor> it kind of gives off the
vibe of just like, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I've only read my manga,
which you kind of have. </garnt>
<joey> - At you've read nine great manga. </joey>
<garnt> - You've read like nine great manga. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you, thank you, thank you. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Good taste. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Assuming the bottom left </connor>
<connor> is replaced with "Terraformers." </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah and this one you can read on Book... </garnt>
<connor> or listen to on Book Walker. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess it's kind of good you went first </garnt>
<garnt> because I guess you can listen </garnt>
<garnt> to some of mine and Joey's recommendations </garnt>
<joey> or like some of our favorite manga. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm not going to
say I recommend everyone </joey>
<joey> that's on my three-by-three. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, me neither. </joey>
<joey> (guys laugh) </joey>
<joey> - But there are definitely
some recommendations </joey>
<connor> that I think everyone should
read on my three-by-three. </connor>

<garnt> - It's been a very civilized

we complain about this? </connor>
<connor> Honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Normy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Is it normy though? </joey>
<garnt> - Kinda, I'd say it's pretty normy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know I man- </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, ain't nothing wrong
with a bit of boys' love. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] That's all right. </joey>
<joey> - That's as normy as it gets. </joey>
<joey> - Who's next? </joey>
<connor> - Which of you wants to go next? </connor>
<connor> - I don't mind going next. </connor>
<connor> - You don't want to go next? </connor>
<connor> - I don't mind going next. </connor>
<connor> - Let's see what Joey has to say then. </connor>
<connor> - And this might be, oh no okay. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Why is that so tiny? </connor>
<joey> - Hold on while we unfold. </joey>
<joey> - Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Oh it's me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I actually thought this was Garnt. </connor>
<connor> I could have sworn I folded Garnt's tiny. </connor>
<connor> This is not fixed, I just... </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying. </connor>
<garnt> Put Joey's on the screen. </garnt>
<connor> - You exposing us Connor. </connor>
<garnt> You're exposing us. </garnt>
<garnt> Scripted. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is Joey too. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was destiny. </garnt>
<garnt> - There is two Joey's. </garnt>
<connor> That was not me. </connor>
<garnt> I swear we did not... </garnt>
<garnt> When I asked who wanted to go next. </garnt>
<garnt> That was not fixed. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like the Google </garnt>
<joey> when people search up, "What
is Gigert's real name?" </joey>
<joey> - [All] Joey. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - All right put Joey's up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Put mine up. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was rigged, but whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> we'll have Joey's up next, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Do I know all of these? </connor>
<joey> Okay let me try and guess this. </joey>
<joey> All right so "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Obviously. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Obviously you put
"JoJo" part six specifically. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I like part six specifically. </joey>
<connor> - "Yu Yu Hakusho." </connor>
<connor> - Do you know this one? </connor>
<garnt> - Is that Misa from "Death Note" is that- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh fuck, I- </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you recognize? </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of recognize this. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait isn't it, </joey>
<joey> it's the Assassins thing? </joey>
<garnt> - Assassins thing? </garnt>
<connor> - No, that's "Hitman Reborn." </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - No this is, this was a fucking- </connor>
<connor> - Wait wait! </connor>
<joey> - It's a Shonen. </joey>
<garnt> - It's Shonen Jump. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- "Black Cat." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's "Black Cat." </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen the anime "Black Cat." </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Very good. </connor>
<connor> - Is the manga good? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - But why did the enemy suck dick? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I didn't watch the anime. </connor>
<connor> - What the anime was- </connor>
<garnt> - It's a manga tier list. </garnt>
<joey> Not tier list, three-by-three. </joey>
<garnt> - This is a manga three-by-three. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had see this. </garnt>
<joey> I was like I've seen this boy with the X. </joey>
<connor> Triple three Vin-Diesel. </connor>
<garnt> - That's Train. </garnt>
<connor> - All right so this one- </connor>
<garnt> - I forgot his name was Train. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it's Train. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - This is the "Line Rider," right? </connor>
<garnt> That many clip. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah "Line Rider." </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, what is this? </connor>
<connor> I don't know this one. </connor>
<garnt> - That's "Oyasumi Punpun." </garnt>
<garnt> - Ahhh. </garnt>
<connor> - That's "Oyasumi Punpun." </connor>
<connor> - Of course I knew that
was going to be on there. </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't look depressing. </connor>
<connor> - It's hella depressing. </connor>
<connor> - This doesn't look depressing. </connor>
<joey> - He's the main character. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He's the main character </connor>
<connor> and everyone else is a
normally drawn character. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And then- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "Slam Dunk." </connor>
<connor> [Garnt] And then "Slam Dunk." </connor>
<connor> "Beastars." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] "To Love Ru." </connor>
<connor> You bought the whole collection
of "To Love Ru" recently. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, accidentally. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - You want to explain the story? </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> So I got "scammed", quote unquote. </connor>
<connor> So I bought all the volumes of "Bobobo," </connor>
<garnt> which was one that I thought
about putting up here. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was only volume
one and four though. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically I opened up
volume one and it was, </garnt>
<garnt> I bought it second hand. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, "Okay it
was whatever it's cheap. </garnt>
<joey> So it was whatever." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "All right, cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to relive my childhood." </joey>
<joey> Open up volume one of "Bobobo", </joey>
<joey> it's volume three of "To Love Ru." </joey>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> They just literally replaced the cover. </connor>
<garnt> I got scammed. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Woman] You got bamboozled. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] They literally just
put the cover of "Bobobo" </joey>
<joey> on the front of this but it's
volume 3 of "To Love Ru." </joey>
<connor> - Do you reckon they did it
on purpose or on accident? </connor>
<connor> - I reckon it's by accident. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Wait, don't tell me </connor>
<connor> all of these are To Love Ru." </connor>
<connor> Luckily they weren't. </connor>
<joey> For some reason volume 1 and 4 was. </joey>
<joey> - So, so it's probably just, you know, </joey>
<joey> you know when you like
take a DVD out to watch it </joey>
<garnt> and you have to put the
DVD in the DVD player </garnt>
<garnt> back in the box, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you forget that you've just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Who the fuck replaces a cover though? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah but, I was going to say. </connor>
<garnt> - I was going to say,
"How does that happen?" </garnt>
<garnt> - That analogy would be fantastic </garnt>
<garnt> if manga were interchangeable things. </garnt>
<joey> - It was more like, you know, like- </joey>
<garnt> - Book in brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was more like the
"Bobobo" set was owned </garnt>
<garnt> by like a teenager. And it was like, well, </garnt>
<joey> "I need to hide the
degenerative shit from my mom. </joey>
<garnt> I'm going to put the 'Bobobo' cover." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God that was totally it wasn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> That was totally it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That could be it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like they'll never know. </garnt>
<connor> My mom will never know
I have "To Love Ru." </connor>
<garnt> - My mom will never know. </garnt>
<garnt> - She'll just think it's "Bobobo." </garnt>
<garnt> - Some kids jacked off to
your "Bobobo" volume 1. </garnt>
<joey> - Time to throw that out? </joey>
<connor> - Is this "Junji Ito?" </connor>
<joey> - So that's "Uzumaki." </joey>
<connor> - Ahh. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I still- </connor>
<garnt> - As this, I'll be
surprised if you know it, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ichigo 100%." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh it's "Ichigo 100." </garnt>
<joey> - I've heard of this. </joey>
<joey> - I have not read it or watched it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so which one would
you like to know first? </joey>
<connor> Obviously we, </connor>
<joey> I think we can get rid
of a "Berserk" and "Jojo" </joey>
<garnt> 'cause we already talked about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Already talked about that. </garnt>
<joey> - So "YuYu Hakusho" and
not "Hunter x Hunter"? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I'm probably
going to get destroyed. </joey>
<connor> - Okay.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Haven't read "Hunter x Hunter" yet. </connor>
<connor> - Whoa. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Whoa, I can't believe you haven't- </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, wait. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't done that but- </garnt>
<garnt> - You haven't read- </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason why- </garnt>
<connor> - Have you watched it? </connor>
<connor> - Nope. </connor>
<connor> (guys laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Okay well I've watched
it and it's amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the only reason why I- </joey>
<garnt> - The biggest Tohashi simp
hasn't read "Hunter x Hunter." </garnt>
<joey> - I know so much about "Hunter x Hunter" </joey>
<joey> just from outside information. </joey>
<connor> But I haven't actually
read it or watched it. </connor>
<connor> I own all the volumes right now. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I think it's the- </connor>
<joey> - It's sitting there
waiting for a rainy day. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's safe to say this: </connor>
<garnt> it's the best Shonen anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - A lot of people say that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I've been lied to. </connor>
<connor> Because the amount of times we
talk about "Hunter x Hunter" </connor>
<garnt> and me and Connor have
just like been talking </garnt>
<connor> about the Dark Continent. </connor>
<connor> I had just- </connor>
<connor> - We always meme like
Netro getting hyped up. </connor>
<connor> - I just always assumed
that Joey was just like- </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally all the information I know </garnt>
<joey> is because people around
me don't stop talking </joey>
<joey> about "Hunter x Hunter."
- What the... </joey>
<joey> That is not okay. </joey>
<garnt> You need to go watch it, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> Or read it. </garnt>
<connor> The anime is amazing. </connor>
<connor> - I never said I read it or watched it. </connor>
<garnt> - I just assumed the anime man </garnt>
<joey> had watched "Hunter x Hunter." </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like this has just
been a game of "Among Us" now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He's a fucking imposter.
- We've exposed the imposter. </garnt>
<garnt> - I should've known the
guy with anime is his name </garnt>
<joey> was a fucking imposter. </joey>
<garnt> - There's an imposter among us right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Again, I know so much
about "Hunter x Hunter." </connor>
<connor> I could probably like give you
the outline of how it goes, </connor>
<connor> but I don't know the details. </connor>
<garnt> - What are the names of the arcs? </garnt>
<garnt> - I want to go back to every
clip now that we talked about- </garnt>
<garnt> - I know like Dark Continent
arc, Chimera Ant arc, </garnt>
<joey> all of those. </joey>
<joey> The Hunter Exam arc and all that. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </garnt>
<joey> I know them. </joey>
<garnt> Again because I hear it from every body. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to watch it.
- What is this? </garnt>
<connor> - Again, I know I will love it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Of course I will. </connor>
<connor> I fucking love Togashi stuff. </connor>
<joey> "Yu Yu Hokusho" I fucking grew up with. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, what's holding you back? </connor>
<connor> What's holding you back? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. It's just- </joey>
<garnt> - Come on, what are you waiting for? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just one of those
shows I haven't started yet. </connor>
<connor> - What I want to know is
how we've just found out </connor>
<garnt> about this, despite the
fact that we've talked </garnt>
<garnt> about "Hunter x Hunter" so
many times on the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this publicly known? </garnt>
<garnt> Is this widely available information? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've like been a
part of the conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, we're going to
have to like rewind every clip </garnt>
<garnt> where we've talked
about "Hunter x Hunter." </garnt>
<joey> - I've said it on streams multiple times. </joey>
<garnt> I've never read or watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't be there for the
whole three hours Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like, again, I know so
much about "Hunter x Hunter" </garnt>
<garnt> and I know I'm going to like it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I'm not in a
rush to read it or watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know I'm going to like it. </garnt>
<joey> - Me and "Fullmetal Alchemist." </joey>
<joey> I get it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like of course, it's like- </joey>
<garnt> - We've just found Joey's
"Fullmetal Alchemist." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like it's Togashi,
I already love Togashi- </garnt>
<connor> - It's right up your street though. </connor>
<connor> It's just-
- I know. </connor>
<connor> And again, I know it's going to be good </connor>
<connor> 'cause I love Togashi. </connor>
<connor> Like "Yu Yu Hakusho" is fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> (Connor burps) </connor>
<connor> - Don't read it, watch the anime. </connor>
<connor> The anime is-
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - The anime is better. </connor>
<connor> Do you agree? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I've heard both
sides of the argument. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Listen. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the other side of the argument? </garnt>
<joey> - The other side is that the manga is good </joey>
<joey> because Togoshi is good. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean that's... </garnt>
<garnt> So it's so it's basically just like </garnt>
<garnt> a preference in medium then, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty much, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, yeah- </joey>
<joey> - I'm mean I'm probably
going to watch and read both, </joey>
<joey> to be honest, it's just a
matter of which one to do first. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean "Hunter x
Hunter" is just prime Madhouse. </garnt>
<garnt> And Madhouse haven't been at their prime </garnt>
<garnt> for like a long time I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And the manga also looks
like napkin drawings </connor>
<garnt> a lot of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not if you buy the volumes.
- No, not in the beginning. </garnt>
<connor> - The volumes? </connor>
<joey> - The volumes are fixed as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh so they fixed it? </garnt>
<joey> - In the Shonen Jump
volumes, the magazines, </joey>
<connor> it looks like shit. </connor>
<joey> But then he redraws it
for the actual volumes. </joey>
<connor> - I finished the anime and
then carried on reading. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Am I reading
like One Web comic right now? </connor>
<garnt> Like, what is this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - It was about that
drawing style wasn't it. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly it's it's yeah. </connor>
<joey> But I... </joey>
<connor> Yeah wow. </connor>
<joey> - But then he takes the time </joey>
<joey> to actually redraw everything
properly for the actual books. </joey>
<connor> So the books look fucking amazing. </connor>
<joey> - I guess that makes sense. </joey>
<connor> But also kind of sad if you're
a big "Hunter x Hunter" fan </connor>
<connor> who waits and then you have
to go back and read it. </connor>
<connor> But maybe they like that. </connor>
<connor> - If you read it weekly, </connor>
<connor> then you'll probably yeah- </connor>
<joey> - Maybe they like that-
- Read it weekly Lamau. </joey>
<garnt> - When it was serialized weekly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that's your favorite
Shonen Jump title of all time? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, here's the thing, </joey>
<garnt> a lot of these are Shonen Jump. </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of realized that what's like. </garnt>
<garnt> What's "Black Cat" doing there? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Yu Yu Hakusho",
"Black Cat", "Slam Dunk", </garnt>
<joey> "Ichigo 100%", "Jojo", it's all Jump. </joey>
<connor> - Let's talk about "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<connor> because I haven't watched, </connor>
<connor> I think I mentioned on
the podcast one time </connor>
<connor> I tried to start it and
then I just couldn't. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't stand the audio on the- </connor>
<joey> I don't know it was dub or what? </joey>
<joey> - Oh so you watched the anime? </joey>
<connor> - I watched five minutes. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Oh I can't take this." </joey>
<joey> - So "Yu Yu Hakusho", it does like a, </joey>
<connor> what I like to call, a reborn. </connor>
<connor> Basically it starts off as a
comedy, ends up as an action. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Same thing with "Dragon ball", right? </connor>
<connor> Like "Dragon Ball" started off as a comedy </connor>
<connor> and then Z came along </connor>
<connor> and it became the action
that it's known for. </connor>
<joey> So like "Yu Yu Hakusho",
the first couple of arcs, </joey>
<joey> like when Yuske, the main character dies, </joey>
<connor> like it's kind of like a slice of life- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's how is starts right. </connor>
<connor> That's not a spoiler. </connor>
<connor> - Literally first panel
Yuske, our main character, </connor>
<joey> gets hit by a car and dies. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] This was before
Isakai was the thing. </connor>
<connor> He didn't go to another world. </connor>
<connor> He just- </connor>
<connor> - He just died. </connor>
<connor> - He just died. </connor>
<garnt> - He became a ghost. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know a lot about "Yu Yu Hakusho" </garnt>
<joey> without ever of watching it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah right. </joey>
<joey> - I know a lot of, I know the bad guy. </joey>
<joey> I know there's an epic fight with one guy. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know who it is. </joey>
<joey> And then yeah- </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you know the
Tournament arc, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I know the Tournament arc. </connor>
<garnt> - He literally just described </garnt>
<garnt> literally every Shonen anime of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> I know the bad guy. </garnt>
<garnt> I know there's an epic
fight with the bad guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what the bad guy- </garnt>
<garnt> - You literally could've
fucking described "JoJo." </garnt>
<connor> - I know what he looks like. </connor>
<garnt> I know who it's going to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - The "GigaChad" right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's his name? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, GigaChad. </connor>
<garnt> (guys laughing) </garnt>
<connor> "GigaChado." </connor>
<garnt> - That's Toguro. </garnt>
<connor> Toguro. </connor>
<connor> - Toguro that's it. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think he's even
the best villain of the arc. </garnt>
<garnt> - He looks like the, you know, </garnt>
<connor> if you watch "Fairly OddParents." </connor>
<connor> - Crimson Chin? </connor>
<connor> - He looks like yeah you know like... </connor>
<garnt> Have you watched "Fairly OddParents?" </garnt>
<connor> - Oh the buff fairy right? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah he looks like the buff fairy </connor>
<garnt> from "Fairly OddParents." </garnt>
<garnt> - I have not seen "Fairly OddParents." </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me pull it up. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me pull it up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - It does right. </garnt>
<joey> That's like Toguro like 0% </joey>
<joey> looks like the buff fairy
from "Fairly OddParents." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - He looks spot on. </garnt>
<connor> Every time I see the bad
guy from "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<connor> I just see that guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Really going to do my
boy Taguro like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Because he has the muscles,
but like the weird neck </connor>
<garnt> and it's literally like
"The Fairly OddParents." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> He looks exactly like that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - Put up the picture. </garnt>
<garnt> - You literally just ruined one of the- </garnt>
<joey> - Put up the picture of the villain. </joey>
<garnt> Like best villains in all of Shonen anime. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't believe Togashi
copied off "Fairly OddParents." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I can't believe they
did him dirty like that. </garnt>
<connor> Like probably Nickelodeon got plagiarized. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks the same. </garnt>
<joey> - Good old Togoru. </joey>
<joey> - All right. So like, </joey>
<joey> so have you ever seen the
anime of "Yu Yu Hakusho"? </joey>
<joey> - I have.
- Oh, good. </joey>
<joey> - All of it? </joey>
<garnt> - Not, not a fan. </garnt>
<garnt> Not a fan </garnt>
<garnt> - Not a fan? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's, I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> It's bittersweet, right? </garnt>
<connor> Because it's like, </connor>
<connor> same thing with "Black
Cat" where it's like, </connor>
<connor> I love the manga so much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That like, it wasn't
like the perfect adaptation </connor>
<connor> that I wanted. </connor>
<joey> Like, it was good, but it's like, </joey>
<joey> I'd rather just reread the manga. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, what was missing </garnt>
<garnt> to make it the perfect
adaptation as someone who's like, </garnt>
<joey> I haven't read the manga
of "Yu Yu Hakusho." </joey>
<joey> I've only seen the anime. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, did you like the anime? </garnt>
<garnt> - I fucking loved the anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Well you'd fucking
love the manga even more. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, but like is there
anything I can get from the manga </garnt>
<connor> that I couldn't have already
gotten from the anime? </connor>
<connor> Or just rewatch the anime? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I thought the anime </joey>
<connor> was like a really good adaptation,
especially for its time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah
- Like "Records of Ragnorak." </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was better than that. </garnt>
<joey> - That's solid animation, you know? </joey>
<joey> I mean, I dunno, like I
think this might just be like </joey>
<joey> the whole thing was like
how manga art styles </joey>
<joey> I feel age better than
animation in a lot of aspects. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah I-
- [Joey] In my eyes. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] "Demon Slayer" begs to differ. </connor>
<joey> - You think so? </joey>
<connor> - Like "Demons Slayer" in
the manga just looks terrible </connor>
<joey> compared to the anime. </joey>
<joey> - Well I mean that's
because like the animations </joey>
<connor> for the character designs
change differently, right? </connor>
<connor> But like in the anime
adaptation of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<joey> they did a pretty good
job of like readapting, </joey>
<joey> like, Togashi's art style, I feel. </joey>
<connor> - I haven't read it, but from
what I've just seen of it, </connor>
<joey> it looks one-to-one to me. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if that's- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You think so? </joey>
<joey> - Just a glance. </joey>
<joey> That's like a person who should- </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I feel- </joey>
<connor> - Glanced at both. </connor>
<connor> - I sometimes look at clips of
the anime of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Something about
this hasn't aged as well." </connor>
<connor> - But like 80's... </connor>
<joey> What was it 90's? </joey>
<joey> - Do you- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's 90's. </joey>
<joey> - Like the 90's animation is, </joey>
<connor> some of it hasn't aged
very well because it was- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean some of it's </connor>
<joey> like very janky limited animation. </joey>
<joey> This is like a 90's anime. </joey>
<joey> But like, they still had like when, </joey>
<joey> during the big fights </joey>
<joey> there were still like
those Sakaga moments. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - Like those have aged wonderfully. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I honestly think at this point, </joey>
<connor> it's just like a personal
preference to me. </connor>
<connor> Like the same thing
with "Slam Dunk" right? </connor>
<connor> It's like "Slam Dunk" for me </connor>
<garnt> like I watched the anime as well, </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking banger of an
anime, but it's like, </garnt>
<joey> I just personally prefer
the manga to be honest. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually have like huge problems </garnt>
<garnt> with the "Slam Dunk" anime. </garnt>
<connor> I think that's aged horribly. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - I've heard the "Slam
Dunk" anime isn't very good. </connor>
<joey> - And that's because- </joey>
<joey> - Might be a nostalgia factor too. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it probably is nostalgia factor. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I watched it in
university and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, this is a, </joey>
<connor> it's a really slow sports anime." </connor>
<connor> My fucking God, </connor>
<connor> it literally like take
10 episodes or something. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 120 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - I do think sports
anime, sorry sports shows, </connor>
<connor> sorry just sports properties in general, </connor>
<connor> almost better in manga normally. </connor>
<connor> Like just because of pacing. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that that's true </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 years ago or 20 years ago now </garnt>
<garnt> because like "Slam Dunk", "EyeShield", </garnt>
<connor> I would like recommend the manga
way over the anime because- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I watched an episode
of EyeShield and I couldn't- </garnt>
<connor> - That's why for me like both "Slam Dunk" </connor>
<connor> and "Yu Yu Hakusho" are in
my manga three-by-three, </connor>
<garnt> not my anime three-by-three. </garnt>
<joey> Like I much prefer the manga. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because like, I
feel like old sports anime, </garnt>
<garnt> they had horrible pacing, </garnt>
<garnt> but like shows like "Haikyuu", "Kuroko"- </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually "Yowamushi Pedal"
I really enjoyed the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Yowamush Pedal." Like they, </garnt>
<garnt> I think within the past, like
new generation of sports, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean they really fixed
their pacing issues </garnt>
<garnt> to the point where if a match
last more than three episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's like a super,
super important match. </garnt>
<connor> Have you seen "Haikyuu"? </connor>
<connor> - I've watched the first two seasons. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So season three is like one single match. </garnt>
<joey> It's like 10 episodes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I've heard that yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When I saw that, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Here we fucking go again. </joey>
<joey> Another like "Dragonball
Z"-esque fight scene </joey>
<joey> in a sports anime. </joey>
<joey> But like that match was so fucking intense </joey>
<joey> that it needed 10 episodes. </joey>
<joey> And then like, </joey>
<garnt> it was just what it... </garnt>
<garnt> It was not stretched out at all. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was like, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> like the highlight of
"Haikyuu" so far of the anime. </garnt>
<connor> - I enjoyed "Koroko no Basket", </connor>
<garnt> I thought that I enjoyed the
pacing on that even if it- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, because- </garnt>
<connor> - It was very quite fast really. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think it was
like actually good pacing. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it was like never
more than three episodes. </connor>
<connor> Because how many times like, </connor>
<joey> I can only be invested in
one match for like so long, </joey>
<garnt> you know? </garnt>
<garnt> There's only so much that
can happen in a single match. </garnt>
<connor> - Kuroko was really good at
building up the bullshit, </connor>
<garnt> I think.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Or like-
- What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - You know, they weren't rushing too much </connor>
<connor> into like the powers, </connor>
<connor> like they were pretty sparingly
adding them in, I felt. </connor>
<connor> And then I didn't watch the
movie, but everything else- </connor>
<garnt> - The movie was (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Everything past the main
run of the, what is it? </garnt>
<garnt> Three seasons? </garnt>
<garnt> Two Seasons? </garnt>
<garnt> - Three seasons.
- Three. </garnt>
<garnt> - After the, how many is that 50 episodes? </garnt>
<connor> - Something like that, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Over 50 episodes, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's where they beat the... </connor>
<connor> Does it end? </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> But the point was that I found
that out after like that, </connor>
<connor> that was like not really invested anymore. </connor>
<joey> - It's such a shame for me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like I didn't
watch all of "Kuroko." </joey>
<joey> Like, but from what I did
see, I really enjoyed it, </joey>
<joey> but it sucks because
for me now "Slam Dunk" </joey>
<joey> is just like forever just
ruined basketball anime- </joey>
<connor> - I wonder if I will read "Slam Dunk" </connor>
<connor> and I'll feel like I can't enjoy this, </connor>
<connor> Kuroko is better, </connor>
<connor> or if I'll feel that like- </connor>
<joey> - It's definitely been both cases. </joey>
<connor> So like I've recommended
"Slam Dunk" to people </connor>
<connor> who first read "Kuroko" </connor>
<connor> and they were like,
"Ah, it's not as good." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're just used
to the "Kuroko" format. </connor>
<connor> Because unlike "Kuroko", </connor>
<connor> "Slam Dunk" doesn't have
any like super powers. </connor>
<garnt> It is like the most- </garnt>
<connor> - It's just very realistic.
- Bare bones raw. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like an NBA Jam versus NBA 2K? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - Basically.
- Pretty much. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It kind of like </joey>
<joey> it kind of like takes the fact that </joey>
<garnt> it is probably one of the
most realistic adaptations </garnt>
<garnt> of sports in manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it still makes it just as exciting. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it does it in the most
like cinematic, like fuck yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> type of way. </garnt>
<joey> And I mean like, you know,
in the case of "Slam Dunk", </joey>
<joey> like when that first came out in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it created a fucking cultural phenomenon. </joey>
<connor> - Every time I have an old taxi man here </connor>
<connor> and he asks me if I liked anime </connor>
<connor> or whatever, I'll be like,
"Yeah, I like anime." </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, "Oh,
do you like Slam Dunk?" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - They always ask me. </garnt>
<garnt> If they're in their like forties plus, </garnt>
<connor> they always ask me if I like "Slam Dunk." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it was like a cultural
phenomenon here in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> Wasn't it when it came out. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the year that it came out, </joey>
<joey> I think I read something like </joey>
<joey> of all like middle schools
and high schools in Japan, </joey>
<connor> the attendance of basketball
clubs raised by 600%. </connor>
<connor> - Well basketball's a huge
sport in Japan as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but it wasn't... </connor>
<connor> But it got big because of "Slam Dunk." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean it was that good. </joey>
<joey> I mean, in my opinion, "Slam Dunk", </joey>
<joey> the final chapter of "Slam Dunk" </joey>
<joey> is still one of the
most beautiful chapters </joey>
<garnt> in all of manga in mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean he had balls
to just put zero dialogue. </garnt>
<garnt> - The entire last chapter
has zero dialogue. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll get there one day. </connor>
<connor> - And it just ends. </connor>
<joey> And it is the most cinematic
final chapter of manga ever. </joey>
<joey> In my opinion. </joey>
<joey> But I mean like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I mean, obviously that's great. </joey>
<joey> - So "Black Cat." </joey>
<joey> - All right so "Black Cat" for me- </joey>
<garnt> - Walk me through it. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so you know how my character, </joey>
<joey> like my avatar on YouTube,
has that cat mask? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh so that came from "Black Cat?" </joey>
<joey> - That came from "Black Cat." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - So, Yabuki Kentaro, who's
the guy who made "Black Cat", </joey>
<connor> he has this thing in all of his manga. </connor>
<connor> So he also illustrated
"To Love Ru" as well. </connor>
<joey> - One of Joey's favorites. </joey>
<joey> - And I mean, it is fucking good. </joey>
<joey> But he has this like
kind of Easter egg thing </joey>
<joey> in all of his manga where in
every chapter of his manga, </joey>
<connor> he puts this like little white
cat in at least one panel </connor>
<connor> of every chapter of his manga, </connor>
<connor> just as like a little hidden Easter egg. </connor>
<connor> And it's that cat face
that I use as my mask. </connor>
<garnt> So like originally like
fucking back way back when, </garnt>
<joey> on like New Grounds and shit like that, </joey>
<joey> that was just my logo. </joey>
<joey> And then I, and then it
adopted into my current avatar, </joey>
<joey> but like, I don't know, "Black
Cat" was like, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> It's definitely heavy nostalgia factor. </joey>
<connor> But I think this was the first
time I ever read a manga. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, like manga artists
are fucking talented." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It was the first time </connor>
<joey> where I was actually
wowed by a piece of art. </joey>
<connor> - Do you want to explain
what happens in it. </connor>
<connor> I can try and explain, </connor>
<joey> but I honestly can't remember anything. </joey>
<joey> - It's been a while. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's been a while
for me as well so like, </joey>
<joey> do you want to try explaining it? </joey>
<joey> - He's not a black cat. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - But that's like his code name? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - He's an assassin right? </garnt>
<joey> - He's an assassin. </joey>
<joey> He's number 13. </joey>
<joey> - That's it. </joey>
<joey> - His name is Train. </joey>
<connor> - He has two guns. </connor>
<connor> - Train Hearnet, I believe his name was. </connor>
<connor> - Two guns? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh is that it?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Train Heartnet.
- Train Heartnet. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it two guns? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, He has two guns. </connor>
<connor> - Two pistols.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he shoots people. </connor>
<connor> - Then there's Sven and Eve,
I believe were the names. </connor>
<joey> - Sven and Eve, okay. </joey>
<connor> - I remember that this was the first </connor>
<joey> because I just got into anime. </joey>
<joey> It's the only thing I remember about it. </joey>
<joey> This was the first show that I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you know what? </joey>
<joey> Not every anime is above a seven. </joey>
<joey> Fuck." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - This is the first show that I was like, </joey>
<joey> " I'm going to teach you a lesson </joey>
<joey> as an example to the other
anime, you're a five." </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like I gave it a lower
score than I would have </connor>
<garnt> just to be like, "Yeah, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fair."
- Just to prove a point. </garnt>
<garnt> - I give out fair scores. </garnt>
<garnt> So okay I give it a five. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I remember
watching like a few episodes </garnt>
<garnt> of "Black Cat" years ago. </garnt>
<connor> And it was just me... </connor>
<connor> It was just that phase where
you'd watch everything. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like,
"Cool, guy in a black coat. </connor>
<joey> He looks kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> I'll watch a few episodes." </joey>
<joey> And it was just like, "Wow, I am-" </joey>
<connor> - So what happens in it? </connor>
<joey> - Extremely whelmed. </joey>
<joey> - So "Black Cat" is like, he kind of, </joey>
<joey> so Train, obviously he starts
off as this like assassin, </joey>
<joey> but then he escapes from the
organization that he's part of. </joey>
<joey> And he basically the entire manga, </joey>
<joey> he gets chased by the organization members </joey>
<joey> to come back to the organization. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he has like all
the secrets or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And like there's a dude
in the organization </joey>
<joey> or I think who also left the organization, </joey>
<joey> who is like, </joey>
<joey> he's basically like the
quintessential male Yandere. </joey>
<joey> Like it's really, like, I
remember the main bad guy is like, </joey>
<joey> I dunno, I've never really heard </joey>
<joey> of like a male Yandere
antagonist before in a manga. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Especially in a Shonen manga. </joey>
<garnt> - I just realized, out of
context, you kind of sound like </garnt>
<joey> you're describing John Wick or something. </joey>
<joey> - (Joey laughs) A little. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like "And he left the organization </garnt>
<garnt> and he is an ex assassin." </garnt>
<garnt> - Who uses gold coins. </garnt>
<connor> They killed his dog. </connor>
<connor> They killed his black cat. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - How dare they. </garnt>
<garnt> How dare they. </garnt>
<connor> - He's on a mission to
tear down the organization. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah, basically, and
then like Sven is the guy </joey>
<joey> who like, has like a, he's
like an explosives expert. </joey>
<joey> And then Eve is this he's like this </joey>
<joey> she's like this test
tube, like experimental. </joey>
<connor> - This is when every single manga </connor>
<connor> had to have like a ragtag band of people </connor>
<garnt> who could do special things. </garnt>
<connor> And have comedy. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay so, why is this
in your three-by-three? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so curious. </garnt>
<joey> - It's in my three-by-three </joey>
<joey> because it was one of the first mangas... </joey>
<joey> Okay, so when I was
growing up reading manga, </joey>
<joey> I obviously started off
reading things like "Doraemon" </joey>
<joey> and like, you know,
"KoroKoro" comic magazine, </joey>
<joey> which is more aimed towards kids </joey>
<joey> under the age of 10 years old. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And then when I got to
around 10, 11 years old, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, you know what? </joey>
<joey> 'Doraemon', 'KoroKoro' stuff, </joey>
<garnt> it's a bit too young for me?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I've got a big pee pee now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a big boy now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm about to enter middle school, right. </garnt>
<connor> I want to read some of this middle school- </connor>
<connor> - "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> - "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> So I was like, you know, I want to read </connor>
<connor> this like Shonen Jump thing </connor>
<connor> that I keep hearing all my
Japanese friends talk about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So at the time </connor>
<joey> I borrowed one of my friends
Shonen Jump magazines. </joey>
<joey> And I think that particular magazine </joey>
<garnt> "Black Cat" was on the cover of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because "Black Cat" had like, </garnt>
<connor> because like every month,
every week on Shonen Jump, </connor>
<connor> they have like- </connor>
<connor> - Change the cover. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah they changed the cover. </connor>
<connor> You some chapters have like, </connor>
<connor> you know, colored pages
and some of them are like </connor>
<connor> have like center covers
and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And I think "Black Cat"
had a front color chapter. </connor>
<connor> And again, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you go from the "Doraemon" to this, right. </connor>
<connor> Like clearly this is going to make you go, </connor>
<connor> "Whoa, what the fuck is that?" </connor>
<connor> And so, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I think like, honestly
I really enjoyed it. </connor>
<joey> I mean, Yabuki Kentaro I think </joey>
<joey> still makes some fucking
godly character designs. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know, the
reason why "To Lover Ru" </joey>
<joey> was so fucking infamous </joey>
<joey> is because like the character
designs fucking cute, </joey>
<joey> like he knows how to draw </joey>
<joey> really just aesthetic looking
characters and like, you know, </joey>
<joey> "Black Cat" I feel was definitely when </joey>
<joey> he was still kind of in
his like younger times. </joey>
<joey> Where like he hadn't quite refined </joey>
<joey> his art, but near the end of "Black Cat" </joey>
<garnt> his art just got better and
better and better and better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's nothing like deep or anything </garnt>
<joey> or like profounding in any way. </joey>
<connor> It's just a really solid Shonen manga </connor>
<connor> with like really just intricate, nice art. </connor>
<connor> - Would it hold up today? </connor>
<joey> - You know what? </joey>
<joey> I haven't read it in quite a while. </joey>
<connor> I did- </connor>
<connor> - Would you recommend it
to someone to read now? </connor>
<joey> - It's hard. </joey>
<connor> It's really hard because like, I dunno, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I'm obviously looking at the show, </joey>
<joey> because this shows very closely to me. </joey>
<garnt> - It's nostalgical. </garnt>
<joey> - It's very nostalgical, </joey>
<connor> obviously looking at this
with like rose tinted gloss. </connor>
<connor> So like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Maybe if you're a fan of
like "Yabuki Kintaro" stuff. </connor>
<joey> If you liked what you saw on "To Love Ru." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And want like that, with action. </joey>
<connor> - Does it, is the story
just kind of wrap up? </connor>
<connor> Does have a good conclusion. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it does. </joey>
<joey> Actually, it has a really nice conclusion. </joey>
<joey> And like the final fight </joey>
<joey> with like the male Yandere antagonist, </joey>
<connor> who's a really fucking
interesting character. </connor>
<connor> And the powers and everything
they're like super cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> It's again, it's just like a really solid </connor>
<joey> Shonen Jump manga that's like
very inoffensive, I feel. </joey>
<connor> - I think this was the start </connor>
<connor> of the the time where I started realize </connor>
<connor> that anime sometimes
just don't have endings. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I was like-
- What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Well because I started off </connor>
<connor> with "Death Note", "Code
Geass", "Fullmetal Alchemist." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Sick, these are great." </connor>
<garnt> - You spoiled yourself. </garnt>
<connor> You literally spoiled all
of anime for yourself. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- No I did not. </connor>
<connor> I had a great time. </connor>
<connor> And then I started getting into shows- </connor>
<garnt> - Because what I mean,
is that no other anime, </garnt>
<garnt> that just is a normal anime, </garnt>
<garnt> is just going to live
up to those standards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so then I started
watching shows and I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Wait, why didn't this end?" </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the ending? </garnt>
<garnt> And this is when, this is how, you know, </garnt>
<joey> everyone else had the
same desperation as me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause whenever you type in the show, </joey>
<joey> the first auto-fillers, </joey>
<garnt> "When is season three
coming out of this show?" </garnt>
<connor> "There are no plans for
season three of this show." </connor>
<connor> - Literally when you click like, </connor>
<connor> when you type in "No Game No Life", </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Or like "Spice and Wolf." </garnt>
<joey> - Because everyone's like, </joey>
<joey> "Wait, why would there
not be a season two? </joey>
<joey> This was a popular show, right? </joey>
<garnt> There's season 2 coming right? </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Right!" </connor>
<connor> - Never happened. </connor>
<connor> - And then this is when
I started to realize... </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, they're just
not going to finish shows. </connor>
<joey> They're just going to like release shows?" </joey>
<connor> - They just going to be
like, "We released it. </connor>
<joey> We're not going to finish it. </joey>
<joey> Fuck you, go read the manga." </joey>
<connor> - This is where sometimes I wish anime </connor>
<connor> was produced by Americans </connor>
<connor> because you know that
it would fucking end. </connor>
<connor> They might not be good, but
you know it's coming out. </connor>
<garnt> - And that's why I feel like manga </garnt>
<garnt> takes more of the same form
as like American TV shows. </garnt>
<garnt> Because some manga just
go on for fucking ever. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know, I don't, I'm not... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm even invested
to see this end anymore." </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Then anime will make
like a billion dollars </connor>
<connor> and they're like, no, I don't
think we need another... </connor>
<garnt> No there's no more seasons. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like sometimes, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes an anime makes
like a billion dollars, </garnt>
<garnt> but then it's like 100th
of the entire story. </garnt>
<joey> And you're just like, how are they going? </joey>
<joey> Like, how are they ever going
to adapt the entire story? </joey>
<joey> It's going to take like
fucking 10 decades to do this. </joey>
<joey> And so, you know, </joey>
<joey> there are some stories
where I'm just like, I just, </joey>
<joey> I know I'm never going to
see the end of the anime. </joey>
<connor> And even like manga form,
like I'm still waiting. </connor>
<connor> Like fucking "Ipo." </connor>
<connor> Like, oh how long is
"Ipo" going to go on for? </connor>
<connor> - True.
- Right? Like Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Or "Baki." </connor>
<connor> - Or "Baki" right? </connor>
<connor> - "Baki" should go on forever. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah "Baki" should go on forever. </joey>
<connor> - "Baki" should go on forever. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of "Baki", obviously Baki's... </garnt>
<garnt> The fucking Itgaki sends
his daughter "Beastars", </garnt>
<joey> fucking amazing manga. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like the newest
one that's on there right? </garnt>
<joey> - That's probably the newest one. </joey>
<joey> Like after I finished reading
"Beastars" I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, that is so close to
a modern masterpiece." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] How come- </connor>
<joey> - In terms of manga. </joey>
<connor> - How come "Baki" isn't on here? </connor>
<joey> - "Baki", I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Like for me, "Baki" is one of those shows </joey>
<connor> where it's like, it's good, </connor>
<connor> don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> And it's so unique, but
I feel that it's like, </connor>
<joey> there are some parts where it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's just a blur when you
read it, you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> Or it's like, </connor>
<joey> it's so long and there's so
much shit that happens in it </joey>
<joey> that it's just so insane and ridiculous </joey>
<connor> that you think of one fight scene </connor>
<connor> and it blends in with about
10 other fight scenes. </connor>
<connor> - Actually yeah that's true.
- That's true. </connor>
<connor> - Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - Like part two for example, right, </connor>
<connor> With the whole Tournament arc. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I can only remember maybe
like one or two fights. </connor>
<connor> I re-read it the other day- </connor>
<connor> - The fights were kinda underwhelming. </connor>
<joey> - There's like 20 fights in the manga. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and in the anime
they only showed like four. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - But that's pretty good
because most of them </joey>
<joey> are kind of underwhelming. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the fights, even in the anime, </joey>
<connor> they only showed like six and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Eh, 3 of these are boring." </connor>
<joey> - Like with "Baki", you
remember the most like notable, </joey>
<connor> like meme worthy ridiculous
type of scenes, right. </connor>
<connor> Whereas with "Beastars", for example, </connor>
<connor> it was like just as
like one cohesive story, </connor>
<connor> it was just: </connor>
<joey> A, really fucking
unique, really done well. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Has it concluded? </connor>
<connor> - Yep, it ended. </connor>
<connor> - When did it finish? </connor>
<garnt> It couldn't have been too long ago? </garnt>
<garnt> - About a year ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - So how many seasons of the anime </garnt>
<garnt> do you think there should be
if we were to adapt everything? </garnt>
<joey> - To adapt everything? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So we're at season two right now, </connor>
<connor> which is, oh, I probably shouldn't say. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh. </connor>
<connor> - Where we're up to in season two. But- </connor>
<connor> - I haven't watched it yet. </connor>
<garnt> That's probably about
volume seven or eight. </garnt>
<garnt> - And how many volumes are there? </garnt>
<joey> - Over 20.
(Garnt winces) </joey>
<connor> - Well to be fair wasn't
season three announced already? </connor>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure Netflix wants
to keep that coming. </joey>
<joey> And I am very happy with that. </joey>
<connor> Please do. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] And it gets more and
more interesting after that. </joey>
<connor> - I'm hoping we finally
get a fucking anime </connor>
<connor> that finishes in anime form. </connor>
<connor> We never fucking get it
anymore, it's bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean we're getting it like the... </garnt>
<garnt> The latest one I can think
of that we're getting </garnt>
<garnt> is "Attack on Titan" and that's only like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the most successful
anime of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - So it takes the whole
fucking world watching it </connor>
<garnt> for them to be like, "Maybe we
could just finish this one." </garnt>
<connor> It's like if the streamers
are like start new anime, </connor>
<garnt> finish old one. </garnt>
<connor> And then like, "I like though..." </connor>
<connor> No! </connor>
<connor> Stop! </connor>
<connor> Finish this one. </connor>
<garnt> Finish this! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like, if an anime
gets over three seasons, </garnt>
<garnt> like, because even if, even
if we get a season two, </garnt>
<joey> that's just like getting
the table scraps, right. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> I can't believe I've got a season two." </joey>
<joey> (Connor panting) </joey>
<joey> - Is this an OVA? </joey>
<joey> - May I have some more? </joey>
<joey> - May I have some more. </joey>
<joey> And then for some reason there's
like fucking four seasons </joey>
<joey> of "Mahouka" or something. </joey>
<joey> I'd like, "Well, what's going on?" </joey>
<garnt> - There's be like 10 seasons of- </garnt>
<connor> - There's a fucking spin off of Mahouka. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like nobody asked for this. </connor>
<garnt> - There'll be like fucking
10 seasons of "Saki", </garnt>
<garnt> like playing mash off. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh, fuck off." </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck off, is this doing well? </garnt>
<connor> You cannot tell me this
deserves a second season </connor>
<joey> and "No Game No Life" doesn't? </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Exactly.
- Fuck right off. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah so "Beastars"... </garnt>
<garnt> So you think it's like up there
as the modern classic now? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I- </joey>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<connor> The ending wasn't exactly
like amazing, amazing. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It was just a solid ending. </joey>
<connor> - If we get the full anime
adaptation of the manga </connor>
<joey> in the way that it's
going right now, right. </joey>
<connor> Would it would be
considered a masterpiece? </connor>
<joey> (Joey sighs) </joey>
<joey> - Man, I personally would see it </joey>
<garnt> as like easy nine out of 10, at least. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean I can see that. </garnt>
<joey> If the anime keeps up
the quality of a story. </joey>
<garnt> Because I love season one,
but it felt like season one </garnt>
<garnt> just felt like a kind of a setup season. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the ending of
"Beastars" is very much like, </joey>
<joey> the ending of part six. </joey>
<joey> Where it's like the people
who love it, love it. </joey>
<joey> But the people who didn't
like it were like, "Eh." </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean- </joey>
<connor> - It's like a lot of people say </connor>
<connor> that it's like kind of
an anticlimactic ending </connor>
<connor> but I thought it was kind of fitting </connor>
<connor> to how the entire story went. </connor>
<connor> Because like the final part of "Beastars" </connor>
<connor> there's like this big fight that happens. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Obviously.
- Yeah, of course, right. </connor>
<joey> - And then from that big fight, </joey>
<connor> it kind of suddenly winds down </connor>
<connor> into just like regular stuff. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And like to a lot of people </connor>
<joey> that was seen as "anticlimactic." </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes I like that though. </joey>
<joey> I like a little breathing
time to say goodbye. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah right.
- You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I like to, "All right guys, </joey>
<joey> just going of read a few more chapters </joey>
<connor> with you guys before you
guys fuck off forever." </connor>
<garnt> (Connor fake cries) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like what gets me
sometimes is I know like </garnt>
<connor> there's always the hype around
the last chapter, right? </connor>
<connor> Because the last chapter you're
saying goodbye to everything </connor>
<connor> and you know, this is,
this is where this is... </connor>
<connor> And people like try to put a
conclusion in the last chapter. </connor>
<connor> Whereas some of like my favorite manga </connor>
<connor> is when that last chapter is just, </connor>
<connor> the climax is over. </connor>
<connor> It's done. </connor>
<connor> It's purely just an epilogue. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like epilogues
are so fucking underrated. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In so many anime and manga,
because most of the time, </connor>
<connor> it's just like you get to
the final episode, right? </connor>
<connor> And half of this episode is the climax. </connor>
<connor> So you've got like 10
minutes to say goodbye </connor>
<connor> to all these characters. </connor>
<joey> You've grown- </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Give me a full episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Give me a full episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, give me a full episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate the epilogues that are like, </garnt>
<joey> there's like seven minutes
left of the episode. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Are they going
to stick the landing?" </joey>
<garnt> And then you know that
it's a rushed epilogue </garnt>
<garnt> when they start talking
and the ending song plays. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no no no. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's not even, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not even an epilogue. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like a slide show. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Of just like here
are the characters now. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, here they go. </joey>
<joey> - They're going away.
- There they go. </joey>
<connor> - And then we have "Ichigo
100%", which again, </connor>
<joey> for me is like another, I
wouldn't even, it's weird. </joey>
<garnt> - What's this about? I've heard- </garnt>
<garnt> - Please explain this. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so is "Ichigo
100%" is just this really </connor>
<joey> just super simple romcom, essentially. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know how Shonen
Jump, every time, right, </joey>
<joey> they replace harem romcoms right? </joey>
<garnt> Like once one harem romcom ends, </garnt>
<garnt> another one takes its place kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] True yeah.
- Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - "Ichigo 100%" was probably- </connor>
<connor> - It's like the "Terminator." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - "Ichigo 100%" was the one
that, well, first of all, </connor>
<connor> like it was like right at its prime </connor>
<connor> when I started reading Shonen Jump. </connor>
<connor> So again, big nostalgia factor, </connor>
<joey> I'm going to completely admit that. </joey>
<joey> But second of all, to me, </joey>
<joey> it is like the one manga series </joey>
<joey> where there was no one clear winner. </joey>
<joey> Like right up until the end. </joey>
<joey> It was like all the girls are
so liked through and through. </joey>
<joey> Like people think
"Quintessential Quintuplets" </joey>
<joey> is like the ultimate, </joey>
<joey> like "any one of these girls
could win" type of thing. </joey>
<joey> It's like-
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, it's not. </joey>
<joey> "Ichigo 100%" is. </joey>
<joey> Because you start off with liking one girl </joey>
<joey> as you do with any harem romcom right. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Of course.
- Of course. </joey>
<joey> - But "Ichigo 100%", </joey>
<joey> I don't know how the fuck
Kawashita Mizuki did it, </joey>
<joey> but she did it in a way
where by the end of it, </joey>
<connor> any one of them could win. </connor>
<connor> But you don't know who. </connor>
<connor> Like right up until the end. </connor>
<connor> And it's just so simple, but so well done. </connor>
<connor> And again, I really like
Kawashita Mizuki art style </connor>
<garnt> because again, very different. </garnt>
<connor> It almost doesn't even look- </connor>
<connor> - It looks super 90's.
- [Joey] Yeah, oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean because it is very nineties. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] They all look
like the Chobits robots. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Oh yeah they do! </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] A little bit yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's around the same era. </connor>
<garnt> - It looks like the exact same
characters design as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah they look like
they're like all robots. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's weird right because- </joey>
<garnt> - We are programmed to
fall in love with you. </garnt>
<connor> Beep beep beep beep beep beep. </connor>
<connor> - And it's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's like, to me, </connor>
<joey> it's not even the best
romcom manga, in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh okay. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- I think- </joey>
<connor> - So is this a harem romcom? </connor>
<connor> - Harem romcom. </connor>
<garnt> - Which we all know
that Joey loves a good- </garnt>
<joey> - I like a good harem romcom. </joey>
<connor> - Joey loves a good- </connor>
<connor> - I love a good harem romcom. </connor>
<connor> Don't get me wrong. </connor>
<joey> In my opinion, the best romcom
manga ever written is "Eyes" </joey>
<joey> which is also from Shonen Jump. </joey>
<joey> Which came before this one. </joey>
<joey> So like this one
basically replaced "Eyes." </joey>
<garnt> - I've heard of "Eyes." </garnt>
<garnt> That got an anime
adaptation didn't that in? </garnt>
<joey> - In like early 2000's I think. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah it was like a very shit adaptation. </garnt>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't a very good adaptation. </joey>
<joey> - It was forgettable. </joey>
<garnt> That's all I know. </garnt>
<joey> - But yeah, it's done by the
same guy who made "Zetman." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay okay.
- And like all of those. </joey>
<joey> He's done a lot of manga. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> Again, this was one of those
shows that I think this show </joey>
<joey> is the reason why I love harem romcoms. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so do you read the... </garnt>
<garnt> Did you watch the anime
adaptation of this at all? </garnt>
<joey> - Was it anime? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah there is anime. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah there is, there
is an anime adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not good.
- Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically every, like- </connor>
<connor> - Joey's like, "There is an anime. </connor>
<connor> Just don't read it. </connor>
<connor> Just watch the shows." </connor>
<connor> - Like basically most of the shows on here </connor>
<joey> have like very mediocre anime adaptations. </joey>
<connor> Aside from like- </connor>
<joey> - The only, except for "Beastars"- </joey>
<joey> - Aside from "Beastars" </joey>
<joey> I'd argue "Yu Yu Hakusho"
but that's just me. </joey>
<joey> - "Beastars" and... </joey>
<joey> Yeah probably "Yu Yu Hakusho" and "JoJo." </joey>
<joey> - Okay, "JoJo." </joey>
<joey> Well Part 6 hasn't got a dub yet. </joey>
<joey> - Well Part 6 yeah.
- It's coming. </joey>
<garnt> - Hopefully it's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's coming, oh it's going to- </garnt>
<joey> - It's coming.
- Oh it's going to- </joey>
<connor> - Oh Lord she coming.
- Oh Lord he coming. </connor>
<joey> - Oh you know it's going to be good. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, and then we have, Uzimaki- </joey>
<joey> - Of course, of course.
- Junji Ito. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly anything from Junji
Ito could have been in here. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, he's probably the
reason why I love horror manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I do think "Uzimaki" is like, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like in terms of like a long form, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it is his magnum opus. </garnt>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - Some of my favorite works
of Jinji Yuto isn't "Uzimaki." </connor>
<connor> But just his one shots actually. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like "Uzimaki" is
his like only long form work </connor>
<garnt> that I think is like the best. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and again, like
that's why I feel like I could </joey>
<joey> have put anything in there. </joey>
<connor> Like I also fucking love "Tomie" </connor>
<connor> which was his first one that he made. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is also brilliantly horrifying. </connor>
<joey> Like if you love like your
kind of body dysmorphia, </joey>
<joey> McCobb horror type of thing. </joey>
<connor> - I do really want to read
Junji Ito at some point. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's part of the- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a trip. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's on the infinite list of, </garnt>
<connor> "I need to get right into that." </connor>
<connor> - Well it's just like with Jinji Ito, </connor>
<garnt> you don't even need to
like be that invested in it </garnt>
<connor> because I, like, </connor>
<joey> I think the best entry point for Jinji Ito </joey>
<joey> is just to read some of his one shots. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because like, I feel like, </joey>
<joey> one there's only like a few genres </joey>
<joey> that really worked well with one shots </joey>
<joey> and horror is some of them. </joey>
<garnt> Because all he has to do is like, </garnt>
<garnt> he hits you with this like
really weird fucking idea. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it just ends. </garnt>
<joey> - It's, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like he definitely
like has taken a lot </joey>
<joey> of inspiration from like
classic Asian horror </joey>
<joey> in the sense that the stories
don't necessarily make sense. </joey>
<joey> But at the end of it, </joey>
<joey> you're somehow still
invested and still terrified. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's purely that he
purely just assaults you- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - With all of these senses of
just super disturbing shit. </joey>
<joey> And then kind of just
like, that's the end. </joey>
<joey> How do you feel? </joey>
<connor> - How do you feel? </connor>
<connor> Take a seat. </connor>
<connor> - Why you here? </connor>
<connor> (guys laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sold. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so obviously
I think it's no secret </connor>
<connor> that I love- </connor>
<connor> - Jinji Ito , yeah.
- Stuff. </connor>
<connor> - And then I guess we just
talk about the center one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's a reason why
I put it in the center </connor>
<connor> 'cause I still think to this day </connor>
<joey> it's one of the greatest
manga series ever made. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one manga series that I know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm building myself
up to be ready for. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, it's like </garnt>
<connor> I haven't watched the last
season of "BoJack Horseman." </connor>
<connor> It's not because I don't want to. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just kind of not in the mindset </connor>
<connor> where I want to be depressed. </connor>
<joey> - I mean you know, with
your three-by-three, right. </joey>
<joey> You were talking about like </joey>
<joey> the one that you enjoyed the most </joey>
<connor> and the one you think is
the best is different. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is definitely that. </connor>
<connor> - The one that you think is the best? </connor>
<joey> - I did not enjoy reading
"Oyasumi Punpun" at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah like you don't enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> But you just can't stop. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's one of those... </connor>
<connor> I know this, even though
I've never read it, </connor>
<joey> it's one of those series or stories, </joey>
<joey> from what I understand
that it's just it hits you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it sticks with you and it's like, </joey>
<garnt> you read it once and
it's just a part of you. </garnt>
<connor> - I've just got like shit to do you know. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm going to be sad for like a while. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I got to deal with that. </joey>
<joey> - I remember I binged this
manga for the first time </joey>
<connor> and I finished reading it at like 4:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I just kind of, </connor>
<connor> the moment I finished it, </connor>
<connor> I just kind of closed it </connor>
<connor> and just sat on my couch. </connor>
<joey> - I know exactly... </joey>
<connor> Because that's like me after
every "BoJack" episode. </connor>
<connor> And then they're like
automatically playing the next one. </connor>
<joey> Like, "No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Give me a second." </joey>
<joey> - Give me some time to recover. </joey>
<connor> - Give me a minute man. </connor>
<connor> Just give me a minute. </connor>
<connor> That was so depressing. </connor>
<connor> - But I think the one
thing that I really like </connor>
<connor> about "Oyasumi Punpun" is the fact </connor>
<connor> that it almost goes beyond manga. </connor>
<connor> Like what Ino Asano
did to "Oyasumi Punpun" </connor>
<connor> is so like... </connor>
<connor> We were talking about
metaphors before, right, </connor>
<connor> with, you know, "EyeShield
21" stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - The metaphors in "Oyasumi
Punpun" are insane. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> Because literally like
what kind of mangaka </joey>
<joey> has the balls to turn their
main character into a metaphor? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's genius. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's absolutely genius. </joey>
<joey> So to explain "Oyasumi
Punpun" for those of you </joey>
<joey> that don't know. </joey>
<joey> This is the main character. </joey>
<joey> His name is Punpun. </joey>
<joey> He's a bird character </joey>
<joey> and every other character
in the manga is a human. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But all the human characters
see Punpun as a human. </connor>
<connor> - It's... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so it's like how he sees himself </connor>
<connor> is different from everyone else. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> It's how he sees himself. </connor>
<joey> But it's also how you, as
the reader, see him as well. </joey>
<joey> So like throughout the
manga as he's gone... </joey>
<joey> So basically it's this manga </joey>
<joey> where it follows the life
of Punpun growing up. </joey>
<connor> So he starts off as a kid
and he turns into a teenager </connor>
<connor> and then turns into an adult. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I already don't
like the sound of this. </connor>
<connor> I don't like shows that
follow them growing up. </connor>
<connor> I know its going to be fucked. </connor>
<connor> - At it kind very slowly, yet steadily, </connor>
<connor> it goes through every inch of his life. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I don't like those. </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of
things that happen to him </connor>
<garnt> and around him that are very fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that's how- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah so like it starts
off with him as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> He meets this girl, you know, </connor>
<connor> learns what falling in love is. </connor>
<connor> Learns the the joys and
the heartbreak of puberty. </connor>
<connor> And then-
- I feel you man. </connor>
<connor> - And then that drags on with him. </connor>
<connor> And then he has family problems. </connor>
<connor> He has problems with his friends. </connor>
<garnt> He has problems with who he is- </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically just a broken life, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a broken life. And- </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> - And what's so brilliant
about "Oyasumi Punpun" </garnt>
<joey> is that as, obviously, you know, </joey>
<joey> like when he like gets
older, he gets bigger, </joey>
<joey> taller, but still the bird. </joey>
<joey> But then there are certain
points in the manga </joey>
<joey> where his look completely changes. </joey>
<joey> So there's one part in the manga </joey>
<joey> where he just turns
into a floating pyramid </joey>
<joey> for about two chapters. </joey>
<joey> - Oh.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And it's not really
explained why it happens. </joey>
<joey> - But as you're reading it in context, </joey>
<joey> it represents something in him. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay
- Okay. </connor>
<joey> - And it's very, literal in that sense. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll read it. </garnt>
<garnt> How long is it, how many chapters? </garnt>
<joey> - Seven volumes. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - I own all of them. </joey>
<joey> I've owned all of them for years. </joey>
<garnt> It's been sitting- </garnt>
<joey> - It's 12 volumes, I think. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, well- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's 120 something chapters </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt's like, "Shit
okay, so I own 7 of them." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well no. </garnt>
<joey> I believe, at least
the translated volumes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah the Western
volumes are a lot thicker </joey>
<joey> - They're a lot thicker. </joey>
<garnt> So I have, I own the- </garnt>
<joey> - There's 13 volumes in Japan. </joey>
<joey> But it's like 120 something chapters. </joey>
<connor> - So you could probably
read it in one day. </connor>
<connor> - You could easily read it in one day. </connor>
<garnt> I mean I read it in one day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, it's been sitting on
my shelf, I think for years. </garnt>
<joey> It's just been staring at me. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, I stare at it. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Is today
the day today I read it." </garnt>
<garnt> - Just the thought about it- </garnt>
<joey> - Nope I'm happy today. </joey>
<connor> - Just the thought about reading it, </connor>
<garnt> I hear like "Guts" theme in my head. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, basically. </connor>
<connor> - My very first experience </connor>
<joey> with hearing about "Oyasumi Punpun" </joey>
<joey> was when I actually started dating Sydney. </joey>
<joey> And, so... </joey>
<joey> This was back when I didn't
know Sydney too well. </joey>
<joey> And she gets really,
really invested in stories </joey>
<joey> end of stories. </joey>
<joey> And she's one of those
people that, you know, </joey>
<joey> that gets truly gets invested </joey>
<joey> and involved into a piece of fiction. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just here sitting in my room, </joey>
<joey> sitting in my office doing like
YouTube videos or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And then I hear Sydney just like balling. </joey>
<joey> I mean, this is like, </joey>
<joey> I'd never seen her cry harder than this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, she was like,
like beyond ugly crying. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, it was like,
I came in and like my- </garnt>
<garnt> - Honey what's wrong? </garnt>
<garnt> - My gut just sank because
like, I've only like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the kind of reaction you see </garnt>
<garnt> when someone's family
member just died, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, I
take a few deep breaths. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Okay, I know, </garnt>
<joey> I know we're going to have to
deal with something serious." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - Something really fucked
up And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Honey, are you okay? </joey>
<joey> What happened?" </joey>
<joey> And she just went, </joey>
<garnt> "I just finished a manga." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I dead ass just went, "What, what?" </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like, "It's
called 'Oyasumi Punpun'." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I am going
back in my office now." </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's some Kleenex. </garnt>
<garnt> Clean yourself up. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - But yeah like I- </joey>
<connor> - I mean like I didn't like
ugly sob at the end of "Punpun"- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But there were definitely
moments throughout "Punpun" </joey>
<joey> that I kind of just opened my eyes wide </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Holy shit." </joey>
<connor> Like, there are many times </connor>
<connor> where I actually said to myself out loud, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "No, no." </connor>
<connor> - Not this like. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah not like this. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, and again, it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's the way that he can somehow fit </connor>
<joey> this fucking bird character
into a super realistic context </joey>
<joey> of like very realistic setting </joey>
<joey> with very realistic characters. </joey>
<joey> And give this bird </joey>
<joey> the most human life
possible is so insane to me. </joey>
<connor> And the fact that he can
just do it seamlessly. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, obviously at first, </connor>
<connor> if you're going into this blind. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - First couple of pages, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck is this? </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck is this bird?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah true. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you kind of like
learn to grow with it. </garnt>
<garnt> And again, like, you know, it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of those things
where like a lot of people say </garnt>
<connor> like, "Oh, he turned it into a bird </connor>
<connor> so that you yourself </connor>
<connor> can put yourself into
Punpun's situations." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah.
- [Connor] Sounds like it. </connor>
<connor> - So that you're not fixated </connor>
<connor> on one particular type
of person, you know, </connor>
<connor> when concerning looks and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Like you can just imagine
this as any human. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And again, it's like Inio
Asano literally just took </connor>
<connor> all these like rudimentary
concepts about manga </connor>
<connor> and just went throw out
the window and just went... </connor>
<connor> I just going to draw what I think is cool </connor>
<joey> And it's like, there's lots
of like weird shit in it </joey>
<joey> as well. </joey>
<joey> But like, I mean, I've been
trying to write a video </joey>
<joey> about his manga for so long. </joey>
<joey> But literally every time
I reread it, first of all, </joey>
<joey> I get destroyed for about a week. </joey>
<joey> So I try not to do it. </joey>
<joey> But second of all, </joey>
<joey> there was just so many subtle things in it </joey>
<joey> that I keep picking up
on that I didn't before. </joey>
<joey> That just completely
makes me change the way </joey>
<joey> I view this manga. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, yeah, it's insane. </joey>
<joey> So I like, again, probably the
manga, I enjoyed the least. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But definitely one of the best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that's what I
assumed it was going to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Which is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not reading this manga to enjoy it. </garnt>
<joey> I'm reading this manga because I know </joey>
<joey> it's probably going to be </joey>
<joey> one of the most like
powerful pieces of media </joey>
<joey> I've ever consumed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And that's like my
assumption going into it. </garnt>
<connor> - And the final chapter made
me cry, like fucking crazy. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Fuck man." </connor>
<connor> It was brutal. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, I don't know
what else I can talk about. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I realized that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I've read a lot
of manga, you know what, </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the day, </garnt>
<garnt> Shonen Jumps just kind
of the king to be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's kind of the king for, it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how it's always been. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean Shonen Jump just has a formula. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know what that
formula is, but they just keep- </garnt>
<garnt> - It works. </garnt>
<garnt> - They just keep pumping out
bangers, not just bangers, </garnt>
<garnt> like everything they
pump out just seems to be </garnt>
<garnt> like a global sensation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even if it's not, </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to have some kind
of cult following behind it. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just kind of the ones </joey>
<joey> that I remember the most for some reason. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, like fucking now, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when the Big Three
ended or like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> "Naruto", not the big three, </garnt>
<garnt> but the era of the Big Three </garnt>
<garnt> were "Naruto", "Bleach" and "One Piece". </garnt>
<garnt> "One Piece" is obviously still going on, </garnt>
<garnt> but everyone was just like,
"What's going to replace it? </garnt>
<garnt> How can anything replace
'Naruto' and 'Bleach'?" </garnt>
<joey> Those were like global sensations. </joey>
<joey> Then "My Hero" came out and was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Hold my my beer." </joey>
<joey> And then "Demon Slayer" came out </joey>
<joey> and it was just like, "Hold my sword." </joey>
<joey> And then like fucking
now, "Jujitsu Kaisan" </joey>
<joey> and now like "Chain Saw Man"'s coming out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is going to be
a massive fucking hit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like where did they miss? </garnt>
<garnt> When did I like-
- They don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are they fucking aim boxing? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what's their secret? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Like what the fuck is going on? </joey>
<joey> - We don't miss! </joey>
<joey> No legit. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, you know, again, it's like, </joey>
<joey> you know, you kind of get in that period </joey>
<joey> of your manga reading life
where you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "You know what, maybe, </joey>
<joey> maybe it's time to
graduate from the Shonens." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, it's, it's like,
it's kind of formulaic. </joey>
<joey> I want to try something new. </joey>
<joey> So you go out, </joey>
<joey> read some of the more obscure Sanin manga </joey>
<joey> or the Shojo or the
Jose manga or, you know, </joey>
<joey> some like weird gore or edgy type of shit. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, there's lots of good ones. </joey>
<joey> Don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> But at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> you're always going to
go back to Shonen Jump. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> I remember I said that opinion on Twitter </joey>
<garnt> and I got a lot of shit for it. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like look-
- I agree. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just spitting the facts, man. </garnt>
<joey> There's a reason why it's
still the greatest selling- </joey>
<garnt> - They hated him because
he told the truth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> So, yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Is it normy? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, is "Berserk" normy? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like "Berserk" is legendary. </connor>
<joey> - I just, seeing the fact </joey>
<garnt> that more than half of
these are Shonen Jump. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say this now, I've got "Berserk" </garnt>
<garnt> on my three-by-three as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, "Can
I justify not putting </garnt>
<garnt> "Berserk" on my three-by-three?" </garnt>
<garnt> I just went through these, </garnt>
<garnt> like this mental gymnastic of just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Is there any manga </garnt>
<garnt> that I could like
feasibly put over Berserk? </garnt>
<garnt> No."
- No. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, it's the GOAT for a reason. </joey>
<joey> - It's one of a kind. </joey>
<connor> - Guess we could talk
about it at the end maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we can definitely talk about it. </garnt>
<connor> - But honestly like- </connor>
<connor> - Good three-by-three. </connor>
<joey> - No, no trash taste here. </joey>
<joey> You have a very solid list. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you. </joey>
<garnt> - Obviously there are
some that I haven't seen. </garnt>
<connor> - Seems well-rounded though. </connor>
<joey> - Again I had to recommend to anyone, </joey>
<connor> who's never read any of these. </connor>
<connor> Obviously "Berserk", please go read that. </connor>
<connor> "Beastars", fucking fantastic. </connor>
<connor> And if you can handle it,
please read "Oyasumi Punpun." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It will change your life. </joey>
<connor> - I do want to read most of these. </connor>
<joey> Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean "Slam Dunk" as
well is one of the greatest- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I want to read "Slam Dunk" too. </connor>
<joey> - It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - How many chap- </joey>
<joey> because like fuck dude. </joey>
<connor> "EyeShield 21" took me a long time. </connor>
<connor> It's got a lot of chapters. </connor>
<joey> - "Slam Dunk"'s got 30 volumes. </joey>
<joey> - Oh shit. </joey>
<garnt> - It's long. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's going to take you some time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I'd say there's
a lot of these that- </garnt>
<joey> - But the payoff is insane. </joey>
<garnt> - All right, all right,
all right, all right. </garnt>
<joey> - If you like your sports manga, </joey>
<joey> you kind of need to read "Slam Dunk." </joey>
<garnt> - I do, I do. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you like sports manga you'll like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the quintessential sports manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that is Joey's taste. </garnt>
<garnt> You can judge. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, we've had two very
solid three-by-threes now. </connor>
<connor> - Let's see if we can
keep up that momentum. </connor>
<connor> - I'm kind of worried about mine now. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh shit." </joey>
<connor> - Ashley put up Garnt's three-by-three. </connor>
<connor> - All right, let's take a break. </connor>

<garnt> Go on, pull up my three-by-three. </garnt>
<joey> - Pull up the three-by-three. </joey>
<joey> Let's see. </joey>
<garnt> - Some of these that
shouldn't be surprises at all. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay okay. </joey>
<garnt> Okay well let's got through the order. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a mix. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - So before we get into it, </joey>
<connor> there are some that I feel
like I would put in there </connor>
<connor> if there wasn't already like
an amazing anime adaptation </connor>
<joey> of it.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - I really wanted to put
"Vinland Saga" on there </joey>
<joey> for example, but I'm just like, well, </joey>
<joey> I also really, really
enjoyed the anime, so- </joey>
<joey> - Do you want to go through them? </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> So from going down from a
"Great Teacher Onizuka", </joey>
<joey> "Kingdom", "The Breaker",
"20th Century Boys", </joey>
<joey> "Domestic Girlfriend",
"Love Hina", "Berserk", </joey>
<joey> "Beck", and "Psyren." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] "Psyren", really? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] I was not expecting "Psyren." </connor>
<garnt> - What is... </garnt>
<garnt> Is "Breaker" the Korean one? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's amanhwa. </garnt>
<connor> - That's amanhwa. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> To me like Breaker. </connor>
<connor> I'll start off on "Breaker" </connor>
<connor> because that's the only one
on there that is actually </connor>
<garnt> not actually a manga, but amanhwa. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like "Breaker"
is that one, it takes, </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically everything I
wanted from a Shonen anime </garnt>
<connor> that you could not get
for then Shonen Jump. </connor>
<garnt> Because it takes the kind
of the Shonen Jump-like </garnt>
<joey> battle manga formula, and
adds martial arts to it. </joey>
<joey> And it's so rare to see something, </joey>
<joey> to see a manga that just
does martial arts well. </joey>
<joey> And I've kind of realized </joey>
<joey> if I'm looking for martial
arts, because you know, </joey>
<joey> if you watch the film three-by-threes </joey>
<joey> you'd know that I'm a huge
fucking fan of Kung Fu movies </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And it's just so hard to
find that same vibe in manga. </joey>
<joey> - But amanhwa does martial arts, </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know, "God of
High School" as well, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> So you got like "God of High School." </connor>
<garnt> - They don't really care
about kung-fu in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- In a sense almost, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah almost. </connor>
<garnt> But like Veratuas is
like the perfect balance </garnt>
<garnt> between martial arts and superpowers </garnt>
<garnt> because people are like
still very human in there </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, you can still
take someone out with a gun, </garnt>
<connor> but they have enough power </connor>
<connor> that they're kind of also
superhuman as well, right. </connor>
<connor> So it's kind of balanced in that way. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, it's got
like a very, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's got a very standard story. </connor>
<connor> It's about this guy who has
zero martial arts powers </connor>
<connor> and zero ki, as you know, which
is the power system there. </connor>
<connor> And he just meets this
guy who was, you know, </connor>
<joey> he's beating up some street thugs </joey>
<joey> and turns out he's just
like a fucking, you know, </joey>
<joey> martial arts master or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Right right. </joey>
<joey> - And so to help teach this
guy or to help this guy </joey>
<joey> basically like protect himself </joey>
<joey> and not be bullied and all that, </joey>
<joey> he gives him like this
medicine, which you know, </joey>
<garnt> is technically he gave it to
him by accident and ends up </garnt>
<connor> this guy is just like, </connor>
<connor> obviously a secret genius in martial arts </connor>
<connor> and kind of like takes on the
entire martial arts world. </connor>
<connor> - Performance enhancing drugs. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Of course. </connor>
<garnt> - Always say yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<joey> - We figured use a hundred
percent of your brain. </joey>
<joey> - But like, it's, it's like- </joey>
<joey> - It sounds cool though. </joey>
<joey> - But like in terms of like formula, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's a very, very standard
formula, but one, okay, </joey>
<joey> like the art is fucking fantastic. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean the cover looks amazing. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's so it's like so much more detailed </connor>
<connor> than you see in a lot </connor>
<connor> of just standard Shonen Jump manga, right. </connor>
<joey> And what blows my mind </joey>
<joey> is that this was like a weekly release, </joey>
<joey> but the art quality is that of
like a monthly release manga. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like "One Punch Man" for example, </joey>
<joey> is a monthly release, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you can see why, you
know, it took the time to be, </joey>
<joey> to make it a monthly manga. </joey>
<joey> This was released weekly </joey>
<joey> and it's not as good as "One Punch Man" </joey>
<joey> in terms of art quality. </joey>
<joey> But it's like way better </joey>
<joey> than pretty much most standard
Shonen Jump weekly manga. </joey>
<joey> - Damn. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like the action choreography </joey>
<joey> and the action art is fucking insane. </joey>
<connor> And it's just like pure fun. </connor>
<connor> It's just pure... </connor>
<connor> You know what you're getting, </connor>
<connor> this guy is like a weakling, okay. </connor>
<connor> But the amount of times </connor>
<connor> that he fucking does
something badass unexpectedly </connor>
<connor> is just like, it's just insane. </connor>
<connor> And he keeps like the stakes
keep rising and rising. </connor>
<connor> And what I love as well is
they've really built up, </connor>
<connor> I really loved the world building </connor>
<connor> of just like the secret organization </connor>
<connor> that's of like martial artists. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Who like kind of rule the
world, you know, it's like- </connor>
<connor> - Like in real life. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Kinda like in real life kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> It's got like the same
kind of like vibe as John, </joey>
<connor> the "John Wick" world,
if you know what I mean, </connor>
<connor> - I'm down for that. </connor>
<connor> I love John Wick. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously the main
protagonist isn't John Wick. </connor>
<connor> It's someone who grows into someone </connor>
<connor> who's going to be that
skilled in that world. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's kind of got that same vibe </garnt>
<garnt> in world building and it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking love it. </garnt>
<garnt> And not enough people
talk about "The Breaker." </garnt>
<joey> - I've definitely heard of the title </joey>
<joey> because it's just one
of those shows you hear </joey>
<joey> when someone says, "Oh, you know, </joey>
<garnt> I know a fucking amazing manhwa." </garnt>
<garnt> Or like... </garnt>
<garnt> What was the other one? </garnt>
<garnt> "Solo Leveling"? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Solo Leveling" yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That like I hear a lot of
and that I really need to read. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh I hear that too. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean "Solo Leveling"
I feel is it's good, </garnt>
<connor> but it's, I dunno why "Solo
Leveling" works so well. </connor>
<connor> It's basically just an Isaki in disguise, </connor>
<garnt> but for some reason, it feels, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's mostly carried by the arts. </garnt>
<joey> - Right right. </joey>
<garnt> - The arts just amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, manhwa art is like next level. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how they
do it so consistently. </garnt>
<joey> - Literally every manhwa I've read </joey>
<joey> has just been like, "Oh my God." </joey>
<garnt> - I really don't know </garnt>
<joey> how they do it so fucking consistently. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's insane. </joey>
<connor> - And then- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> What else did we want to talk about? </garnt>
<connor> - "Kingdom"? </connor>
<connor> I haven't read "Kingdom." </connor>
<connor> I've been considering it. </connor>
<joey> - I've read the first
five volumes of "Kingdom" </joey>
<garnt> because I read it- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's long right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's 60 volumes. </joey>
<garnt> - It's it's like... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] It's still going.
- 60?! </connor>
<garnt> - It's still going too.
- Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember because I
remember when I was like </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get new manga to read. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, "Fucking
hell this has 500 chapters." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Oh for fuck's sake." </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> And then I read the first hundred chapters </connor>
<connor> in like two days and I'm
like, "Thank fucking God." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - This has 500 chapters. </connor>
<connor> It was like one of those
manga when I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "I'm so glad </connor>
<connor> that there is just like an
infinite number of chapters." </connor>
<connor> - It's not that that I dread, </connor>
<connor> it's that I dread that I
literally can't do anything else. </connor>
<connor> Like, I can't watch anything. </connor>
<connor> I can't read anything else. </connor>
<connor> - I love that. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like that's the feeling
I'm constantly looking for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I love the feeling
of just being so absorbed </garnt>
<garnt> into this manga or anime or something </garnt>
<garnt> that I literally can't
get on with my life. </garnt>
<garnt> Unless I'm finishing this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Because like that to me is
like pure enjoyment, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And "Kingdom" gave me that
for like a good like month. </joey>
<joey> - I only have time. </joey>
<joey> Yeah-
- Just a month. </joey>
<joey> - I lost a month of my life, I think. </joey>
<garnt> And it was like the best month ever. </garnt>
<joey> It was fucking worth it. </joey>
<garnt> - I only read like the
first five volumes of it. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I was like at a manga
cafe just like chilling, </joey>
<joey> waiting for a friend or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And I had to leave. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "No, I'm not leaving." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to continue reading. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fucking insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like to give a
brief like sell of "Kingdom"- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, sell me on "Kingdom." </connor>
<connor> - So it's like when
China was like fragmented </connor>
<joey> into different kingdoms. </joey>
<joey> - Haha, see- </joey>
<joey> - Ahh. </joey>
<joey> - You see what they did there? </joey>
<joey> - There's three kingdoms right? </joey>
<joey> - No it was, I think this one
has seven kingdoms, right. </joey>
<joey> And so it's the story of, </joey>
<joey> it's just an epic basically. </joey>
<joey> It's the very definition of an epic </joey>
<joey> where it's just the story of- </joey>
<joey> - Epic. </joey>
<joey> - So like there's one farm boy, Shin, </joey>
<joey> who's the main character. </joey>
<joey> And by complete chance, </joey>
<joey> he meets one of the future
kings of the kingdom </joey>
<joey> that he's living in, right. </joey>
<joey> And throughout the
entire history of China, </joey>
<joey> no one's been able to
unite all of the kingdoms. </joey>
<joey> No one's been able to take over everything </joey>
<joey> and just unite everyone. </joey>
<joey> And so it's very simple. </joey>
<joey> It's just the basic story of the king </joey>
<joey> growing up to be a king
and uniting everyone. </joey>
<joey> And it's the farmer who,
the farm boy who grows up </joey>
<joey> literally as a peasant, and it's his story </joey>
<garnt> of becoming the greatest general of China. </garnt>
<joey> - It's basically, if you
took the Golden Age arc </joey>
<joey> of "Berserk" and just made it an epic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds good. </joey>
<connor> - Which is awesome because
Golden Age arc was awesome. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt coughs) </connor>
<connor> - I love the Golden Age arc. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like imagine the Golden Age arc, </connor>
<connor> but the biggest to me, </connor>
<garnt> the biggest selling point
of "Kingdom" is the battles. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] This man's dying over here. </connor>
<connor> - He can't contain his love for "Kingdom." </connor>
<connor> - It went down the wrong hole. </connor>
<connor> - He's choking up thinking about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I just want to
talk about "Kingdom" okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So I have never seen
any other piece of media </garnt>
<garnt> depict warfare in as much detail
as I have "Kingdom" right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's only like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's been 500 chapters
and one single battle </garnt>
<garnt> can easily take up like
50 to a hundred chapters. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like "Lord of the Rings." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean it's- </garnt>
<connor> - Battle for Helms deep here? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally like imagine- </garnt>
<garnt> - But every battle. </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine if that was
just every battle, right. </connor>
<connor> But it's fucking, </connor>
<garnt> it's actually fucking insane. </garnt>
<garnt> Go on, go for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are we close to finishing the story? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - We're about halfway. </connor>
<connor> - Oh for fuck's sake. </connor>
<connor> See that puts me off. </connor>
<connor> Because I don't want to get into something </connor>
<connor> where I'm going to be like
50 years old and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey son, my favorite
manga is finishing soon." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - "Kingdom." </connor>
<garnt> - Literally every "One Piece" fan. </garnt>
<connor> - But like, it's one of those manga </connor>
<connor> where it's such a simple kind of, </connor>
<joey> it's well, it's simple
and it's not, right. </joey>
<joey> Because obviously there's a lot of, </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of like politics involved. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of like intricacies </joey>
<joey> into how they basically try </joey>
<joey> to take over their
kingdom because there's... </joey>
<joey> I really can't condense it down into like, </joey>
<joey> whatever I'm going to say now. </joey>
<garnt> - It's an epic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it is an epic. </connor>
<connor> - Oh it's epic all right. </connor>
<connor> - But like, because it's broken up </connor>
<connor> into like different arcs. </connor>
<connor> So you can just read one arc and you just, </connor>
<connor> you can just like- </connor>
<connor> - Stop. </connor>
<connor> - It's kind of- </connor>
<connor> - Take a breather. </connor>
<connor> - You can take a breather. </connor>
<connor> Like I literally binge one arc </connor>
<connor> then binge another arc and
then binge another arc. </connor>
<connor> Because I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "I just want to see what happens
at the end of this battle." </connor>
<connor> And it depicts war, like I said, </connor>
<connor> it depicts warfare in a
better way than I've ever seen </connor>
<connor> in any other manga because like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you know how they like try
to write smart characters </connor>
<garnt> in a lot of fiction, whereas
to write a smart character, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to make the other
character dumb, right. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's been so many
like warfare kind of scenes </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> they introduce this like really
smart general or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's because he sees a strategy </garnt>
<garnt> that the other general doesn't see. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, to the reader, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the most obvious
fucking strategy of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - We're going to go around the back. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Holy shit. </joey>
<garnt> - They'll never know if we
flank them to the right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And with Kingdom, the reason it takes like </connor>
<connor> about like 50 to a hundred
chapters per battle </connor>
<joey> was because it's so- </joey>
<joey> - They're playing 5-D chess. </joey>
<joey> - They are like it's so incredible </joey>
<joey> to see so many styles of generals </joey>
<joey> battling against each other. </joey>
<joey> Because it is literally
like watching two GM's </joey>
<joey> play against each other and no, </joey>
<joey> I'm absolutely serious because like </joey>
<joey> you're turning the page and you're like, </joey>
<joey> both sides are making moves. </joey>
<joey> Both sides are like taking pieces. </joey>
<joey> They're taking rooks, </joey>
<joey> they're taking bishops. </joey>
<joey> It is kind of like watching a chess game </joey>
<joey> except because it's a battle, </joey>
<joey> it's not just all about strategy. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you have people
who fucking flip the board </joey>
<garnt> and then there's nothing
you can do about that. </garnt>
<joey> Just because they're too powerful. </joey>
<garnt> And then there's some people
who knows that this guy </garnt>
<garnt> is someone who is going to flip the board </garnt>
<joey> and he takes that into account. </joey>
<garnt> And so the winner of the battle, </garnt>
<garnt> isn't the person who's
like necessarily dumber. </garnt>
<joey> It's just the person who maybe thinks </joey>
<garnt> that extra half step ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> And you really don't know </garnt>
<garnt> until you turn like the
final few pages of an arc, </garnt>
<garnt> how it's going to turn out. </garnt>
<joey> - The author must have
like fucking binge read </joey>
<garnt> like "The Art Of War" like 10 times. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly.
- because like- </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, like that's it. </connor>
<joey> - I've only heard like
the most insane battles. </joey>
<connor> - I love those people that like, you know, </connor>
<joey> like those reviews. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - "Sunsu five stars." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - "Come read my work." </connor>
<garnt> - Like without spoiling
some of the best moments </garnt>
<garnt> of this manga, like I think
this manga has an arc, </garnt>
<garnt> which is one of my favorite
arcs of like all of manga. </garnt>
<connor> - Damn. </connor>
<connor> - And that's because it's like, </connor>
<garnt> it's an arc without spoiling
the exact plot points, </garnt>
<garnt> it's an arc where you have like
fucking five, six generals. </garnt>
<garnt> All of them have like I'm playing
5-D chess with each other, </garnt>
<joey> making moves against each other. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, "Holy fuck." </joey>
<garnt> I can't even keep up with the
amount of strategies going on. </garnt>
<joey> And the different pieces like </joey>
<joey> that are being pushed around. </joey>
<joey> It's absolutely fucking insane. </joey>
<garnt> It's so big brain that
I really cannot explain. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I'm sold, I'm sold. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and ever since I read </garnt>
<garnt> those five volumes of "Kingdom," </garnt>
<joey> I've been this close
to just saying fuck it. </joey>
<joey> And just buying the rest of the volumes. </joey>
<joey> - Is it published weekly? </joey>
<connor> - Mmm hmm. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, that's good. that's good. </connor>
<garnt> It's published, but there's no way </garnt>
<connor> they're going to get to 500 chapters. </connor>
<garnt> - I've just given up hope
on manga where they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, now we're publishing monthly." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like "All right." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm never going to read it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's never going to finish. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> If you want to see like
the brain expands meme </garnt>
<garnt> of like of just reading
something that is just like </garnt>
<garnt> super smart without making it like seem </garnt>
<connor> pretentious or something. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And the art is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think someone asked, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know who was, might
have been George RR Martin, </connor>
<connor> the question was like,
"If you're not smart, </connor>
<connor> how do you write smart characters?" </connor>
<connor> If you're not smart yourself, </connor>
<joey> how do you write a smart character? </joey>
<joey> Like, legit. </joey>
<joey> I remembered they answered something. </joey>
<garnt> But even me, I was thinking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't know how you would. </garnt>
<garnt> How would you? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you wouldn't know what smart is </garnt>
<joey> because you're not smart. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's I think this is
smart, is this smart? </connor>
<garnt> - Is this what smart people are like? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like-
- Ask your smart friend. </connor>
<connor> - How do you write a smart character? </connor>
<connor> Who's like 300 IQ when you're not 300 IQ. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Very good question. </connor>
<connor> - What I would guess is
that the author of this </connor>
<connor> must've just studied so many
like history, historic battles. </connor>
<joey> Because someone like the
tactics and strategies that they </joey>
<joey> come up with this, it's
just like, it's 300 IQ, </joey>
<joey> versus 302 IQ. </joey>
<connor> And it's just like, </connor>
<joey> that extra 2 IQ that gives
them the edge in battle. </joey>
<connor> - It's the pawn that matters and- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah exactly. </joey>
<garnt> It's such a good read. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sold, I'm sold. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it's fucking fantastic. </garnt>
<connor> - Another one to add to the fucking list. </connor>
<connor> - If you want something </connor>
<garnt> that is just an incredible
epic, read "Kingdom." </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - "Great Teacher Onizuka"- </joey>
<joey> - Classic. </joey>
<joey> - Is a classic. </joey>
<connor> - I've heard all about this. </connor>
<joey> I haven't watched it. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird. </connor>
<connor> I've never read the manga for this. </connor>
<connor> I've only watched the anime. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I've hear the
anime is amazing though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> The anime is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> But I've heard the manga is even better. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the anime is, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> it's good because the
manga is fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, that's the only
reason the anime is good. </garnt>
<connor> - The recipe so god damn good </connor>
<garnt> you can't mess up (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like you, okay. </garnt>
<joey> Have you seen the anime? </joey>
<joey> - I've seen the anime yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When do you think it came out? </joey>
<garnt> - What, the anime? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like late eighties, right? </joey>
<joey> Wasn't it? </joey>
<garnt> - It came out in the year 2000. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I'm not joking. </connor>
<connor> - Are you serious? </connor>
<garnt> - I am serious. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was like a trap question. </garnt>
<garnt> I felt the trap when he asked that. </garnt>
<joey> - It feels like late 80's manga. </joey>
<garnt> - It feels like late 80's- </garnt>
<joey> - Early 90's manga. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like late 80's,
early 90's, anime adaptation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It came out in the 2000's. </joey>
<garnt> It came out after "Cowboy Bebop." </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm so lost. </garnt>
<garnt> - But because like, </garnt>
<garnt> because the anime adaptation- </garnt>
<joey> - I wasn't expecting to
have an existential crisis </joey>
<joey> over GTO today, God damn. </joey>
<joey> - So, I mean, I think I've
talked about GTO briefly before. </joey>
<joey> But to give a brief synopsis of GTO, </joey>
<joey> it's about this teacher
who is a delinquent. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, he great. </joey>
<connor> - Oh great. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, he a great teacher. </joey>
<joey> - He's... </joey>
<joey> No, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> He's not a great teacher yet </joey>
<joey> because he's just.... </joey>
<garnt> So his name is Onizuka. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's delinquent who finds himself </garnt>
<garnt> in a teaching job, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Let me guess, let me guess. </connor>
<connor> He's just, he's not a
good teacher in the start. </connor>
<garnt> But he learns to love the kids </garnt>
<garnt> and he wants to help the kids. </garnt>
<garnt> So he becomes a good
teacher along the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, actually he wants
to be the greatest teacher </garnt>
<joey> in all of Japan. </joey>
<joey> Hence the name: </joey>
<joey> - "Great Teacher Onizuka."
- "Great Teacher Onizuka." </joey>
<joey> - But he's given like a very
problematic class, right. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, he's not like the
greatest teacher academically. </joey>
<garnt> And that's like part of
the point of this manga </garnt>
<garnt> is that he doesn't teach academic lessons. </garnt>
<garnt> He teaches life lessons. </garnt>
<joey> And I know sounds- </joey>
<garnt> - How do I reach these kids? </garnt>
<garnt> - He ain't book smart. </garnt>
<garnt> He's street smart. </garnt>
<joey> - This is how you wear bag kids, </joey>
<connor> making you shoulder it correctly. </connor>
<garnt> - But like it's a manga that
I think really affected me </garnt>
<garnt> when I read this as like a teenager, </garnt>
<joey> because you know, it is like
a completely cheesy kind </joey>
<joey> of setup, right. </joey>
<joey> Because you know, it's just, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's a teacher who
reforms a problematic classroom </joey>
<joey> and teaches them life lessons. </joey>
<garnt> It makes them appreciate life and stuff." </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, that's exactly it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably the best feel
good manga I've ever read. </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan loves those
kinds of mangas though. </garnt>
<garnt> There's another manga like
that called "Rookies." </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if you know that one. </joey>
<joey> - I don't. </joey>
<joey> - It's like if you took GTO </joey>
<joey> but you made them play baseball. </joey>
<joey> And, but it's like, it's
the exact same, like, </joey>
<garnt> feel good vibe. </garnt>
<connor> You have the delinquent teacher
who like teaches a bunch of </connor>
<joey> delinquents to like join a baseball team </joey>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Exact same feel as GTO. </joey>
<garnt> It's like just as good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just, it's just really, </garnt>
<garnt> it's also a comedy one. </garnt>
<garnt> And I do like the comedy, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> what I really love is that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't teach you so much
cheesy life lessons, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's so much, it's just
teaches you that you, </garnt>
<garnt> especially growing up in Asian culture, </garnt>
<garnt> it tries to teach you that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> grades and you're like
this, the school system, </garnt>
<garnt> isn't what defines you as a person. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like a lot of
people might need to like hear </garnt>
<garnt> some of the things that
this manga has to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially in Asian culture. </garnt>
<garnt> And kind of the cherry on
top is just how fucking goofy </garnt>
<garnt> and at the same time bad ass Onizuka is. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking, seeing the
antics they put him through </garnt>
<garnt> is just like everything is such a treat. </garnt>
<garnt> Like one of my favorite
scenes in the manga, </garnt>
<garnt> which never got adapted
to the anime was like, </garnt>
<garnt> he was trying to teach
this like this leader </garnt>
<garnt> of like this gang to
like try to attend school </garnt>
<garnt> and take it fucking
seriously and all that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And so this guy, this student leads him </garnt>
<garnt> to like this underground, </garnt>
<garnt> like fight ring or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the exact
setup, but he's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Look, if I arm wrestle
a hundred of you and win, </garnt>
<garnt> then you got to come to school." </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is so fucking stupid, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> how are you going to fucking
arm wrestle a hundred people. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he, he beats one person. </garnt>
<garnt> He beats two persons. </garnt>
<garnt> He beat... </garnt>
<garnt> He starts taking on three at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> And like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Three at a time? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He starts taking on three at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> It's Shonen manga okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's just like, </garnt>
<joey> the way that it just kind of builds up </joey>
<joey> and like escalates is
like hilarious and bad-ass </joey>
<joey> at the same time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's, it's something
where it's not 100% serious, </joey>
<joey> but when it hits, it fucking hits. </joey>
<joey> And some like, </joey>
<joey> it's a manga that can really, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say change a person, but it... </joey>
<joey> If you're looking for
something that affects you </joey>
<joey> in the opposite way of "Punpun." </joey>
<joey> Where it's just like, "Wow"- </joey>
<joey> - It uses comedy to teach you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Not depression. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it still teaches you </joey>
<joey> like very important life lessons, </joey>
<garnt> but you feel wholesome at the day. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't want to cry. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like that genre of manga </garnt>
<joey> is so like beloved and known and quite, </joey>
<joey> you know, more common, especially
to a Japanese audience. </joey>
<joey> I feel it's slept on in the West. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Like there are so many like good, </joey>
<joey> like feel-good comedy centered, </joey>
<garnt> like delinquent life lesson
type of manga that is out there. </garnt>
<joey> And they're all fucking great. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because, I feel like
to do this type of manga, </garnt>
<garnt> or to do this type of story, </garnt>
<joey> it's so hard to just not be cheesy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - You know, like. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like GTO is that one manga </joey>
<garnt> when I'm just like you see
this done in any other way </garnt>
<garnt> and it would just be cheesy. </garnt>
<garnt> But, the way that they do
it in this, just it doesn't- </garnt>
<joey> - It almost doesn't take
itself seriously always. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> So, yeah, Onizuka like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think one of my favorite
characters in manga </garnt>
<garnt> for that reason. </garnt>
<joey> What'd you want to go on next? </joey>
<joey> - Can we talk about "Psyren?" </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Why is "Psyren?" </connor>
<garnt> - What is "Psyren?" </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck is that? </garnt>
<connor> - Shonen Jump. </connor>
<connor> - It's Shonen Jump. </connor>
<connor> I'm surprised you've heard of "Psyren." </connor>
<garnt> - I fucking love "Psyren." </garnt>
<garnt> - You love "Psyren." </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my fucking God, yes! </garnt>
<connor> - That's why I was like,
"Why is this here?" </connor>
<connor> - What is "Psyren?" </connor>
<connor> - It's one of those,
like, it's one of those- </connor>
<connor> - Please explain the plot. </connor>
<connor> - Underground Shonen Jump manga that like- </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - It didn't have very
long run time, did it? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it had like a
good hundred chapters. </garnt>
<joey> - Did it? </joey>
<joey> - It got canceled. </joey>
<joey> It got canceled. </joey>
<joey> - That's right. </joey>
<joey> Yeah it did get canceled. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] All right so, tell the plot. </joey>
<joey> - I will tell you the plot. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so there's going to
be like a slight spoiler, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like it's within
the first four chapters. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like it's a big twist </joey>
<joey> that I feel is what got me
hooked into this manga, right. </joey>
<joey> So, that's the main... </joey>
<joey> I can't actually remember
the character names. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's been so
long since I've read it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But it's this main character and he, </joey>
<joey> I don't think there's
anything too special about him </joey>
<joey> at the beginning. </joey>
<joey> He runs a service where
he solves problems, right. </joey>
<joey> That's got nothing to do
with what happens, right. </joey>
<joey> And so he sees this girl, it looks like </joey>
<joey> she looks like she's going
through some issues or something. </joey>
<joey> So she, he tries to help her. </joey>
<joey> And in that process, </joey>
<joey> he follows her and then he
gets transported with her </joey>
<joey> to just this new place. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't know where he is, right. </joey>
<joey> - He gets Isakai'd. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he basically gets Isakai'd, right. </joey>
<connor> - So goes to another world. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, kind of. </connor>
<connor> He goes to another world. </connor>
<connor> - Ooh I see a theme here Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no. </connor>
<connor> He goes to another world
with this girl, right. </connor>
<connor> And then they're in, just in, </connor>
<connor> there's just in this
like barren wasteland. </connor>
<connor> And then they get transported
with a bunch of people. </connor>
<connor> And it's kinda like the
"Gantz" kind of theme </connor>
<connor> where it's not as brutal. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like Shonen Jump "Gantz." </connor>
<connor> So it's not got like massive gore, </connor>
<connor> but like people just start
dying left, right, and center. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason she has
like a special psychic power </connor>
<connor> that she uses to survive. </connor>
<joey> So he kind of follows her right. </joey>
<joey> And so in like fighting through
this kind of "death game", </joey>
<joey> kind of barren wasteland kind of thing, </joey>
<joey> he like tries to figure
out where the fuck he is, </joey>
<joey> how he got there and what
the fuck's going on, right. </joey>
<joey> And then it's like the big
twist at the end of episode four </joey>
<joey> is that he goes on top
of this like a building </joey>
<joey> that's just been like, laying, </joey>
<joey> it's like a, what's the
word I'm looking for? </joey>
<joey> - Like abandoned or- </joey>
<joey> - No, not abandoned, but
it's just like, it's, </joey>
<joey> what's the word where it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's been years since
this building's been- </joey>
<joey> - Overgrown? </joey>
<joey> - Dilapidated? </joey>
<joey> - Dilapidated, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's this dilapidated building right. </joey>
<joey> And he, and he goes on it </joey>
<joey> and then he sees Mount Fuji, right. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, he realizes </joey>
<connor> that for some reason, he's in Japan. </connor>
<connor> He's in a city that is in complete ruins </connor>
<connor> and the apocalypse has happened. </connor>
<connor> And so he doesn't know how
he got there or where he is. </connor>
<connor> - That's right. </connor>
<connor> - Or, should I say it? </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'm going to say it, okay- </connor>
<connor> - Spoiler alert. </connor>
<garnt> - Or when he is, but- </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I guessed when you
had said that he was in Japan </connor>
<connor> that is was a time thing. </connor>
<connor> - When he said it was dilapidated. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like okay well </connor>
<garnt> that's a signal the passage of time. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So, I guess that spoils it. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, so
what I love about this </garnt>
<connor> is that it's a Shonen Jump action manga </connor>
<connor> that has a mystery core. </connor>
<connor> Because the core of this is
him going back to his own world </connor>
<connor> or his own time and kind of figuring out </connor>
<connor> what the fuck happened. </connor>
<connor> How did it happen? </connor>
<connor> And in that process, like, </connor>
<connor> that's all I'm going to say,
because in that process, </connor>
<connor> there's so many twists and
turns that come from that </connor>
<joey> and him trying to figure
out what's going on. </joey>
<joey> And it was just nice to
see like a Shonen Jump </joey>
<joey> that has action in it, </joey>
<joey> but also has this really mystery aspect </joey>
<joey> that keeps you coming back </joey>
<joey> and just keeps you like
reading the next page </joey>
<joey> just to figure out what happens. </joey>
<joey> Because I feel like
there's been Shonen Jump </joey>
<joey> with a mystery aspect, for example, </joey>
<garnt> what's the one where they eat kids, again? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Promise Neverland." </garnt>
<garnt> - "Promise Neverland." </garnt>
<garnt> It's a bit like "Promise Neverland" </garnt>
<garnt> and it's a bit like, obviously- </garnt>
<joey> - I've never heard "Promise Neverland" </joey>
<joey> be described as "what's the
one where they eat kids?" </joey>
<joey> - I mean, am I wrong? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know why I got it right away. </connor>
<connor> - Am I wrong, am I wrong? </connor>
<connor> - I mean-
- That is what happens. </connor>
<garnt> - That is what it is, that is what it is. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not the one about
the kids trying to escape. </joey>
<garnt> It is the one where the kids get eaten. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't fuck around. </connor>
<connor> - Like I liked the fact
that it had a mystery aspect </connor>
<garnt> and also a battle Shonen aspect. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like it was so underground. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause nobody fucking read it. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the problem with "Psyren" </joey>
<joey> is that it kind of came out
at a time where Shonen Jump </joey>
<joey> was just absolutely stacked. </joey>
<joey> Where like everything else in Shonen- </joey>
<joey> 'Cause this was like mid
2000's Shonen Jump, right? </joey>
<joey> So this was not only in
the midst of the Big Three, </joey>
<joey> but also like the lesser
known Shonen Jump stuff </joey>
<joey> that was not the Big Three
was still very, very popular. </joey>
<garnt> - So why did they get canceled? </garnt>
<joey> - Just because it wasn't popular enough. </joey>
<joey> - It just got axed. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like another thing
is that unfortunately </joey>
<garnt> the art style just looks so generic </garnt>
<garnt> because this came after "Bleach." </garnt>
<connor> - It does look... </connor>
<connor> The main character looks like Ichigo. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It kind of looks so generic, </garnt>
<joey> but it has so many original ideas. </joey>
<joey> Like I've really liked without spoiling </joey>
<joey> what the main character's power is. </joey>
<joey> So like anyone who goes to this world </joey>
<joey> gets a special power of their own, right. </joey>
<joey> And I like as an engineer, </joey>
<joey> he has like a really unique power </joey>
<joey> where I'm not going to
spoil exactly what it is, </joey>
<joey> but he can't control this power. </joey>
<joey> Like he can't consciously
control this power. </joey>
<garnt> So what he does to kind of
figure out a way different ways </garnt>
<garnt> to use his power is he makes
sub routines for this power. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's basically like he
makes programming loops </garnt>
<garnt> for this power, like to
follow a set algorithm, </garnt>
<garnt> to do exactly what he wants.
- That's right. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like,
"That's such a unique idea." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like slowly, remembering this manga </joey>
<connor> as you talk about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Man can type 2000 words per minute. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, like, I mean, I could- </garnt>
<connor> - Sounds interesting. </connor>
<connor> - I could have put like "Hunter x Hunter" </connor>
<connor> or other Shonen jump manga on here. </connor>
<connor> - It's nice to see some variation. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, like I said, </connor>
<connor> every Shonen Jump manga I
can think of putting on here </connor>
<connor> has an anime adaptation. </connor>
<connor> So that's the only reason why </connor>
<joey> I put "Psyren" on here </joey>
<joey> because it is my favorite
Shonen Jump manga </joey>
<joey> that does not have an anime. </joey>
<joey> Because it got canceled because
it wasn't popular enough. </joey>
<joey> - The other one I would
put it on there is... </joey>
<joey> Gid you ever read "M Zero?" </joey>
<garnt> - I did not read "M Zero." </garnt>
<joey> - Okay that's another one
that was like, kind of, </joey>
<garnt> it came out around the
same time as "Psyren" </garnt>
<garnt> where Shonen Jump was just stacked. </garnt>
<garnt> Never gotten an anime
adaptation, but it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's that about? </garnt>
<garnt> - "M Zero" is about... </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically it's this kid
who enters this magic school, </garnt>
<connor> but he himself has zero magic abilities. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So this is literally like, </connor>
<joey> think of like fucking
"My Hero Academia" right? </joey>
<joey> Where instead of quirks it's magic power. </joey>
<joey> And you have like certain levels of magic. </joey>
<joey> And the higher your magic level is, </joey>
<joey> the more powerful of
like a magic card you get </joey>
<joey> that can like activate magic
skills and the main character, </joey>
<garnt> again, he has zero magic
so he gets an M Zero card. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ahh okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just him basically just trying </garnt>
<garnt> to basically survive and
graduate the magic school. </garnt>
<garnt> But like the art style is so unique </garnt>
<connor> and it's such a dope, solid story. </connor>
<connor> But again, it never got
an anime adaptation. </connor>
<connor> And like hardly anyone
read it, because again- </connor>
<connor> - Did it get canceled?
- Shonen Jump. </connor>
<joey> No, it didn't get canceled. </joey>
<joey> It had a proper ending, it got
like 12 volumes of something. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh. </joey>
<joey> - And it had a proper ending. </joey>
<garnt> It just no one read it
because during that time, </garnt>
<garnt> Shonen Jump was so stacked. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - With all these other insane shows- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's stacked now as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's stacked now </garnt>
<connor> but like mid 2000's
Shonen Jump was like peak. </connor>
<connor> - So you can recommend it even
though there's not an ending? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no, it has an ending. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just very rushed. </garnt>
<garnt> But like- </garnt>
<garnt> - They were like wrap it up, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Yu Yu Hakusho" was
kind of the same as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like, I feel like
I can still recommend it. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the mystery aspect got solved </garnt>
<garnt> and it got solved in a
decent amount of time. </garnt>
<garnt> What didn't get... </garnt>
<connor> What was like a bit unsatisfying </connor>
<connor> was just each character's resolution </connor>
<connor> because it got wrapped up so quickly. </connor>
<connor> But the mystery aspect, </connor>
<connor> which was the reason I was so
addicted to it, and reading, </connor>
<connor> that gets wrapped up just fine. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I can still recommend it. </connor>
<connor> - So, what's "Love Hina" about? </connor>
<joey> - Wait, have you not read
or watch "Love Hina?" </joey>
<connor> - No, I don't-
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know anything about "Love Hina." </connor>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<connor> - "Love Hina"-
- It's about... </connor>
<garnt> - I'mma say right now. </garnt>
<garnt> This is nostalgia. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean look, Akamatu
Ken's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - It is.
- "Love Hina" is a classic. </joey>
<connor> - Listen explain yourself. </connor>
<connor> What is it about? </connor>
<garnt> - It's nothing you haven't heard before. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a manga where a guy loves Hina. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh for fuck's sake. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's Hina. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it interesting? </garnt>
<joey> - And he loves Hina. </joey>
<joey> - That's Naru. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's Naru and... </joey>
<joey> Okay, so a guy moves </joey>
<joey> in to his grandma's onsen, right? </joey>
<connor> Because his grandma owns owns an onsen </connor>
<connor> and it turns out it's also
a girls' dormitory and- </connor>
<connor> (Connor sighs) </connor>
<connor> - Ayeee. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, all right. </joey>
<joey> - And okay, it's a
fucking harem anime okay. </joey>
<joey> It's a, sorry, it's a harem manga okay. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - And how can I say this? </joey>
<joey> - It's a classic isn't it. </joey>
<joey> - It's it's it's just a solid harem manga. </joey>
<joey> And there's nothing I can do
to convince you to watch it. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to try and
convince you to read it, okay. </joey>
<garnt> I'm not here. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't for you, Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> This is for me. </garnt>
<garnt> This is for me Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never said it was. You know- </garnt>
<joey> - This is Garnt's "Ichigo 100%." </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, this was the very
first manga I have ever read. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Out of everything, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember watching... </connor>
<connor> it was the first anime I ever watched </connor>
<connor> because before that I had this like- </connor>
<connor> - First anime? </connor>
<connor> - No, sorry. </connor>
<connor> It's the first anime I- </connor>
<garnt> - I was going to say
this is the first anime </garnt>
<garnt> you ever watched? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the first anime I watched </garnt>
<garnt> where before that I had
this massive complex </garnt>
<garnt> against manga, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I was like, no, because like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I discriminated against manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, honestly, because I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "How can you get into
black and white drawings? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> This is disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> This is for peasants." </garnt>
<joey> - Western comics go through
the trouble of coloring in. </joey>
<garnt> - Where's the movement? </garnt>
<garnt> - Where's the color? </garnt>
<garnt> - Where's the color? </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly, that's what I'm saying. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, "How am I
supposed to get into this?" </garnt>
<garnt> And unlike "Love Hina" was
the first anime I watch </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm just like, "I
want to see what happens." </garnt>
<joey> - I'll fight through the black and white. </joey>
<joey> - And I want to see what happens enough, </joey>
<garnt> that I'll fucking read the manga. </garnt>
<connor> - She looks cute, but she
looks like a Pokemon reject. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - She's a- </joey>
<garnt> - I think every character in the 90's </garnt>
<garnt> looked like a Pokemon reject. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I think they all </joey>
<joey> had like the same kind of characteristics. </joey>
<connor> - So out of 10? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I- </garnt>
<connor> - Just give me a fucking score Garnt. </connor>
<connor> What is it? </connor>
<connor> - 10.
- Oh fuck off. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That stutter was a 5. </connor>
<connor> That served the ending enough. </connor>
<connor> - I think "Love Hina" to this day </connor>
<garnt> is like a solid six or seven. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a fun six or seven? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a fun manga. </connor>
<connor> - If you like harem manga- </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Which you don't. </connor>
<connor> So if you like harem manga, </connor>
<connor> I still think "Love Hina" is such, </connor>
<garnt> is a very, very solid harem manga. </garnt>
<joey> - It still stands up to it's time. </joey>
<joey> - Why do you love harem
anime and manga so much? </joey>
<connor> I mean what about the
harem speaks to you Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - I just like girls. </connor>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I want all the girls. </connor>
<connor> - I'll break it down </connor>
<connor> because this is going to
be a really weird analogy. </connor>
<connor> If I'm like, </connor>
<connor> if there's a harem manga
that I'm invested in, </connor>
<connor> it's not, it's not specifically about, </connor>
<joey> oh, there's a bunch of girls. </joey>
<joey> What I equates reading a harem manga to, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like watching
a sports match, right? </joey>
<connor> Because like- </connor>
<connor> - I knew you were going
fucking to say that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, because... </connor>
<connor> Okay, because- </connor>
<connor> - You pick your team
when you root for them. </connor>
<connor> - You pick your team </connor>
<connor> and you get emotionally invested, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you pick your best girl
and you fucking root for them. </connor>
<joey> And you stick through it
through thick and thin. </joey>
<joey> - Yup. </joey>
<joey> - And then- </joey>
<joey> - Even if they don't win,
they've won in your heart. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, even if they don't
win, but if they do win- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "Yeah!" </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such an emotional rush. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you're like, "Yes, yes, yes!" </garnt>
<connor> You literally become a fucking sports fan. </connor>
<connor> - I bet Garnt's never as happy </connor>
<connor> as when his fucking harem of choice wins. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly like, part of the
best part of harems, right, </garnt>
<garnt> Is being, is watching
it with the community. </garnt>
<joey> Because like half the fun
is seeing your girl win. </joey>
<joey> But also half the fun
is shitting on the fans </joey>
<joey> of the losing girls as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like, that's like equally as fun. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I loved about "Ichigo 100%" </joey>
<joey> because I read it with a
bunch of my Japanese friends </joey>
<connor> who are all just as invested. </connor>
<connor> And the all had their own winners. </connor>
<connor> And when I, when my girl won, I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Fuck you! </joey>
<garnt> I told you!" </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey had the biggest dick that week. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did, I did. </garnt>
<connor> I felt good, I felt good. </connor>
<connor> - All right. Okay. I mean- </connor>
<connor> - So like, I mean, I still
think it's a solid harem. </connor>
<connor> I think one of the biggest differences </connor>
<connor> to a lot of harems I met </connor>
<connor> is that I do like the
character development </connor>
<connor> of the main guy. </connor>
<connor> He starts off as obviously a fucking loser </connor>
<connor> with no personality. </connor>
<connor> But as the series goes
on, he actually develops. </connor>
<garnt> - Why do we ever get Chad's
as the main characters. </garnt>
<joey> - Because they wouldn't be interesting. </joey>
<joey> - Because then it wouldn't be a hentai. </joey>
<joey> - Chad should become more- </joey>
<garnt> - That's the difference between- </garnt>
<connor> - More Chad? </connor>
<connor> - Where's the space for growth
if they're already a Chad. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe they come more modest. </garnt>
<joey> Maybe they learn modesty. </joey>
<joey> - No one wants to see that. </joey>
<connor> - I wanna see a man learn modesty. </connor>
<connor> - He goes from like this
brick shit house brute. </connor>
<connor> - It's just the guy who
was too full of himself. </connor>
<joey> And he just gets modest. </joey>
<connor> I'd watch that. </connor>
<connor> That'd be awesome. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure that exists somewhere. </joey>
<connor> - And I guess like the
other classic on there, </connor>
<connor> of course is "20th Century Boys." </connor>
<connor> - I thought you were going
to say "Domestic Girlfriend." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I thought you </garnt>
<garnt> were about to say "Domestic Girlfriend." </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was about to like
give you the back hand. </joey>
<joey> - While we're on shit, </joey>
<connor> let's keep talking about
"Domestic Girlfriend." </connor>
<connor> If we're going to talk about "Love Hina." </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay, okay. okay. </garnt>
<connor> I realize- </connor>
<garnt> - He's not going to stop talking you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just give me. </garnt>
<garnt> We've seen it on your channel. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We can and watch it.
- We've seen your videos. </connor>
<connor> - We can literally go </connor>
<connor> and get the fountain of
like nonexistent youth </connor>
<connor> from you on this thing </connor>
<connor> where you just never age </connor>
<connor> and you talk about this for 10 years. </connor>
<connor> - I can continually talk about it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't want to. </joey>
<joey> Give me a five minute... </joey>
<joey> You've got 5 minutes Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - Sell this to me because- </joey>
<connor> - You have five minutes. </connor>
<joey> - I watched three episodes
and I immediately dropped it. </joey>
<garnt> - "Domestic Girlfriend" fucking
awoke something in me man. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like this single show </garnt>
<garnt> basically dictated my
hentai taste from like- </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] So, so, so, so- </joey>
<joey> - There's me before "Domestic Girlfriend" </joey>
<garnt> and there's me after
"Domestic Girlfriend." </garnt>
<connor> - So wait, if I'm correct is it, </connor>
<garnt> there's a guy and there's a teacher? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And a sister. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay, so- </connor>
<connor> - That's correct? </connor>
<joey> Is that correct? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so let me break
it down for you okay. </joey>
<joey> So there's this guy who has, </joey>
<joey> who's in love with his teacher, right? </joey>
<joey> And one day he just
randomly goes up to a meetup </joey>
<joey> and he meets another girl at a karaoke. </joey>
<joey> What's it called? </joey>
<joey> In like a- </joey>
<joey> - Bar? Bar?
- [Producer] A bar? </joey>
<joey> - No what's the event where- </joey>
<joey> - [Sydney] A mixer. </joey>
<garnt> - A mixer. </garnt>
<joey> Thank you Sydney, you know. </joey>
<joey> So he goes to a mixer. </joey>
<joey> And he meets this girl. </joey>
<joey> And this girl for some reason
wants to lose her virginity. </joey>
<garnt> Because she just at that
age where she just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck it, I've got nothing better to do." </garnt>
<joey> - Doesn't the anime literally
open with them like- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - After having sex. </joey>
<joey> - The anime literally opens
with them just after sex. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay, right. </joey>
<joey> - And so he sleeps with this girl </joey>
<joey> and then, who he's just
met and they say goodbye. </joey>
<joey> And then he goes home. </joey>
<joey> And then he finds out that
his dad's getting remarried. </joey>
<joey> And then he meets the family </joey>
<joey> that he's getting like, </joey>
<garnt> his dad's getting married to. </garnt>
<garnt> And it turns out that the mother of, </garnt>
<garnt> or his future mother-in-law, </garnt>
<garnt> or no his future step-mother. </garnt>
<garnt> She has two daughters. </garnt>
<garnt> One is the girl he slept with </garnt>
<garnt> and the other is the
teacher he's in love with. </garnt>
<garnt> And that is the premise
of "Domestic Girlfriend." </garnt>
<connor> - Where is the incest
sign when we need it? </connor>
<connor> - This is literally, this is incest Garnt. </connor>
<connor> And this is just like, </connor>
<connor> this is like what if we made
all porn categories into one. </connor>
<garnt> This is what it sounds like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like combine every porn. </connor>
<garnt> Where are the laundry machines? </garnt>
<garnt> Get four of them in this house. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so like I will fully admit that- </garnt>
<garnt> - This is porn. </garnt>
<garnt> - The concept... </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, yeah this is a hentai plot. </garnt>
<joey> - This is your "Kiss Sis." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Let's be real, it is. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<garnt> It's better than "Kiss Sis."
- It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - People would want... </garnt>
<garnt> Like when we did the anime three-by-three, </garnt>
<garnt> people were like, "Why is the
'Domestic Girlfriend 'anime </garnt>
<garnt> not on there?" </garnt>
<garnt> It's because I actually read the manga. </garnt>
<connor> I think it's a good fucking manga </connor>
<connor> and I will defend it til
the day I fucking die. </connor>
<connor> - Would you say it's a masterpiece? </connor>
<connor> - I would say- </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm asking. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a masterpiece in my heart. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I understand. </garnt>
<joey> - No because like, what happens is like- </joey>
<joey> - If masterpiece is short for
masturbating piece then yes. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, what I love about this manga </garnt>
<garnt> is that it takes the most like, </garnt>
<garnt> the situation is a complete car wreck. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just turns to a
car wreck to a train wreck </garnt>
<joey> to a fucking nuclear Holocaust. </joey>
<joey> Like the layers of how
complicated the situation gets </joey>
<joey> just gets stacked on top of each other. </joey>
<joey> But what offsets this </joey>
<joey> is that it's actually a
really well written manga. </joey>
<joey> It's like a lot of thought- </joey>
<joey> - Hold on, you're being very
oxymoronic right now, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> Because a lot of thought was
really put into the characters. </joey>
<joey> So the characters actually
seem really realistic </joey>
<joey> and you can kind of like
empathize with them, right? </joey>
<joey> What you can't relate to </joey>
<joey> is the fucking situation that they're in. </joey>
<joey> So you put really- </joey>
<joey> - I hope not. </joey>
<joey> - You put actual like realistic characters </joey>
<joey> or well written characters </joey>
<garnt> into this really fucking
trashy, wacky situation. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like a juxtaposition </garnt>
<garnt> of just you're actually
invested in these characters, </garnt>
<garnt> but also the stuff that's
happening is so wild </garnt>
<garnt> that you just want to keep reading </garnt>
<joey> just to see what happens next. </joey>
<joey> It's like a soap opera, </joey>
<garnt> but the characters are
actually really like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're really, really
invested in these characters. </garnt>
<joey> - I just couldn't get to
that point with the anime. </joey>
<joey> Honestly, I was like- </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no- </connor>
<joey> - So what's more of a
battle, this or "Kingdom?" </joey>
<connor> What's more of an epic battle? </connor>
<garnt> - That's two different battle, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is the bigger battle? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know which
one's more five head man. </garnt>
<joey> - One of them is like, </joey>
<garnt> you're physically getting hurt battle </garnt>
<garnt> and the other is like
chipping away your brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay because like the
anime is the really... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, what the anime
did is that it just took </garnt>
<garnt> all the trashy moments in the manga </garnt>
<garnt> without any of the character moments </garnt>
<garnt> and just put them and just speed run it. </garnt>
<connor> - So, they made a bad porno. </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - They made a bad porno. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they made a bad porno. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, what porno doesn't
have character development. </garnt>
<connor> Well how can I get invested? </connor>
<connor> - Most of them. </connor>
<garnt> - A good one. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't need it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, I will keep talking
about "Domestic Girlfriend"- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sure if you want to
hear Garnt talk about it, </connor>
<garnt> just ask him in public, ask him anywhere. </garnt>
<joey> - Watch the 17 videos he made on it. </joey>
<garnt> - I realize that I've made
like a manga three-by-three, </garnt>
<garnt> a hentai three-by-three,
a dojin three-by-three. </garnt>
<joey> - This is all in one. </joey>
<joey> - And an anime three-by-three. </joey>
<joey> And all of them have incest in it. </joey>
<joey> I just want to say for the record- </joey>
<joey> - Where is the incest
sign when we need it? </joey>
<joey> - I just want to say for the
record, I do not like incest- </joey>
<connor> - You are very lucky
you are an only child. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's all I'm saying. </garnt>
<joey> Otherwise the incest
would've destroyed you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If I put this many
incest things in mine, </joey>
<garnt> everyone would be like, "Yo
Connor's got three brothers. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no." </garnt>
<connor> - I've got a sister. </connor>
<garnt> And I'd be fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look, all I'm saying is at
least I don't like stepmom porn </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone has a mother. </garnt>
<garnt> What like everyone, everyone,
everyone has a mother. </garnt>
<garnt> What's your excuse? </garnt>
<garnt> What's your excuse Connor for mothers. </garnt>
<garnt> "Mother Knows Breasts." </garnt>
<connor> - Let's not get into that. </connor>
<joey> - All right, let's let's talk
about "20th Century Boys." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Because that is actually a good manga. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay this is my favorite
manga of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's brilliant. </connor>
<connor> - I've never read this. </connor>
<connor> I've been wanting to read this. </connor>
<connor> I've actually got it
downloaded, ready to read. </connor>
<joey> - Everything by Urasawa Naoki is- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I can give you the
manga volumes instead. </joey>
<joey> - Oh you have them with you? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that's- </connor>
<garnt> - In English? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah in English. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh sick. </joey>
<connor> - That's a much better- </connor>
<garnt> - What other language is
he going to read it in? </garnt>
<connor> - Thai, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> The cover look bad ass. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - So "20th Century Boys" is
my favorite manga of all time. </joey>
<joey> And I only read this just
before moving to Japan </joey>
<joey> and it's kind of like the "Oyuamsi Punpun" </joey>
<connor> where I knew I would love this for ages. </connor>
<connor> And I held off reading it </connor>
<connor> until I had just the right amount of time </connor>
<connor> and the right mindset. </connor>
<connor> And that just so happens when
I had the few week break, </connor>
<connor> before I moved to Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, "Okay, I
am now ready to experience </connor>
<connor> '20th Century Boys'." </connor>
<connor> - I am now ready for emotions. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it lived up
to everything and more. </connor>
<connor> I like, I knew it was like a
magnum opus of a piece of work. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I still like, it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> But also it like every
lesson and every message </joey>
<joey> you tried to say, like spoke
to me personally as well. </joey>
<joey> So it was kind of like
a mixture of personally, </joey>
<garnt> this was my kind of story, </garnt>
<garnt> and also it's an amazing story. </garnt>
<joey> - This was the manga that made me go, </joey>
<joey> "Wow Urasaw Naoki is a fucking genius." </joey>
<connor> - Can you give me a very
quick rundown of the plot. </connor>
<garnt> - Sure, sure. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, it's so- </connor>
<joey> - Because I don't really
know anything about it. </joey>
<joey> - It's, I'll- </joey>
<joey> - It's a pretty convoluted plot isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Its a very- </connor>
<connor> - Just give me the most
bare bones explanation. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so I'll try to sell you
this as quickly as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> So imagine like when you're
growing up as a kid, right, </garnt>
<garnt> you play hero and villains, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so like you play a hero </garnt>
<garnt> and someone plays the hero
and someone plays the villain. </garnt>
<joey> And normally a super villain, </joey>
<joey> they try to take over the world, right? </joey>
<joey> It's a cartoony plot. </joey>
<joey> They take over the world
and the hero stops them. </joey>
<joey> Now, what if you could </joey>
<joey> make this very childish plot believable? </joey>
<joey> That is basically what "20th
Century Boys" is, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Sounds cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's someone who basically
tries to take over the world </garnt>
<garnt> and Naoki Urusaw went, "How
can we actually make this </garnt>
<joey> actually seem realistic and feasible?" </joey>
<joey> - And terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - And terrifying as well. </joey>
<joey> That's like the bare bones,
basic premise of this. </joey>
<joey> What I love about this is that
it's kind of like a mystery. </joey>
<joey> So it doesn't open up with that premise. </joey>
<joey> What it opens up with is this guy, </joey>
<connor> who's just a normal guy who stumbles </connor>
<connor> upon a conspiracy, right? </connor>
<connor> And so of course, </connor>
<connor> if you stumble upon a
conspiracy and you see </connor>
<connor> how deep this conspiracy goes. </connor>
<connor> - The Earth is flat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And the way the story
unravels is that like </connor>
<connor> you are given pieces just
to how deep this conspiracy, </connor>
<connor> this conspiracy goes and how far it runs. </connor>
<connor> And the more chapters that you read, </connor>
<connor> normally, like you see a mystery </connor>
<connor> and like you you're able to like, </connor>
<connor> kind of get a feel for like
how big this mystery is, right. </connor>
<connor> What I find fucking amazing
about "20th Century Boys", </connor>
<connor> is that I was like five to 10 volumes in </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And it felt like I was
staring into an abyss </connor>
<connor> in terms of this mystery, like, </connor>
<garnt> this feeling where you
just don't know how deep </garnt>
<garnt> this rabbit hole goes. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "There's no way this can go deeper." </garnt>
<garnt> And then something gets revealed. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where does this end?" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - How the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> How far does this go? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, the way that,
and I find that incredible. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no been no other mystery </garnt>
<garnt> that's just given me this
feeling of just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was kind of like
almost existential dread. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I know how far this
sank or how deep this went. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's probably like, it's
my favorite manga of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's my favorite
mystery of all time. </garnt>
<joey> - Urasawa Naoki is just
so amazing at writing </joey>
<joey> these just mysteries where it's just like </joey>
<joey> you don't know where it's going. </joey>
<joey> And also, I don't know about you, </joey>
<joey> but Urasawa Naoki I feel is a genius </joey>
<joey> at writing some of the
most perfect antagonists- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In manga, I mean, he also did "Monster." </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> Okay you should've said that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's the same guy.
- Same guy writing "Monster." </connor>
<connor> - Okay I'm sold. </connor>
<connor> I'm sold. </connor>
<joey> - But like "Monster" is like
way more character-driven </joey>
<joey> and I think it's like
much more smaller scale. </joey>
<connor> This one is like a fucking massive scale. </connor>
<connor> - This fucking sucks. </connor>
<connor> I've got so much to read now. </connor>
<connor> Fuck. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I'm this is never going
to get anime adaptation. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Because like, compared to "Monster"- </joey>
<joey> - It go a live action though. </joey>
<garnt> - This is, yeah- </garnt>
<garnt> - It did? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, compared to "Monster", </garnt>
<garnt> this would be like
hundreds of episodes maybe. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because that's just,
that's just how, like far- </joey>
<garnt> - "Monster" was like
70 something episodes. </garnt>
<connor> This would easily be
like 150-200 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm down. </joey>
<joey> Make it happen. </joey>
<connor> "Hunter x Hunter" got over 148. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, I feel like
it's the greatest manga </connor>
<connor> I've ever read and- </connor>
<joey> - It's definitely up there. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is there anything more than that? </connor>
<connor> Can you give it higher praise than that? </connor>
<connor> I guess I to read it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] You have to read it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh fuck me. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah it's brilliant. </connor>
<connor> - It's my, I like, </connor>
<garnt> I can't even pick a
favorite anime of all time, </garnt>
<joey> but the fact that I can pick
a favorite manga of all time- </joey>
<joey> - Is telling. </joey>
<joey> - That's telling. </joey>
<joey> - Ladies and gentlemen. </joey>
<joey> - We got him. </joey>
<joey> - We got him. </joey>
<connor> - And it's not "Domestic Girlfriend." </connor>
<garnt> Surprisingly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank fuck for that. </garnt>
<connor> - Even though it's in the middle. </connor>
<connor> - Thank fuck for that. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I didn't put anything
significant in my middle one. </connor>
<connor> I just clicked. </connor>
<joey> I should have, I should have. </joey>
<joey> - It was the Oromo square. </joey>
<garnt> That's why I put it in the middle. </garnt>
<connor> - And do you have, well, two more? </connor>
<connor> Well, I guess one more. </connor>
<connor> We'll talk about "Berserk" after. </connor>
<garnt> "Beck." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The manga for "Beck." </connor>
<joey> - The manga for "Beck." </joey>
<joey> - I've only watched the anime. </joey>
<joey> - You've only watched the anime? </joey>
<connor> - I've only watched the anime. </connor>
<connor> - Joey, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Joey my boy. </connor>
<joey> - I know- </joey>
<garnt> - You would actually
love the "Beck" manga. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean dude I fucking loved the anime. </joey>
<joey> And again, same thing. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's saying the
manga is even better. </joey>
<garnt> - The manga is even better. </garnt>
<connor> - Before you get your dicks
out and start comparing them, </connor>
<connor> walk me through the plot of "Beck." </connor>
<connor> I know nothing. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's like a... </garnt>
<garnt> It's a music anime right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Music. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck off. </garnt>
<connor> It's not a music anime. </connor>
<connor> - It is a music anime. </connor>
<connor> - Just music? </connor>
<connor> - Yup. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- He just plays music? </garnt>
<garnt> - He just joins a band
and tries to get big. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so- </garnt>
<garnt> - Come on, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck off. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not even joking.
- That's it? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not joking.
- That's it. </joey>
<joey> - That's literally the plot of "Beck." </joey>
<joey> - What's good about it then? </joey>
<joey> - It's just the journey. </joey>
<joey> - It's completely character driven. </joey>
<garnt> - You looked at me dead
in the eyes and just said, </garnt>
<garnt> "It's the journey." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well it's just like some- </garnt>
<connor> - It really is the journey. </connor>
<joey> - It's the journey. </joey>
<joey> The journey. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it is. </joey>
<joey> Like it's... </joey>
<joey> What I love about "Beck," </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's a very simple
story in that sense. </joey>
<joey> It's a complete character driven story </joey>
<joey> where it's about a boy who joins a band </joey>
<connor> and they're very underground. </connor>
<connor> They're trying to make it big. </connor>
<connor> And it's literally just their journey </connor>
<connor> of making it big, right. </connor>
<connor> And you know, I mean you've seen movies </connor>
<connor> and fucking, you know, stories- </connor>
<connor> - "A Star is Born." </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - "A Star is Born." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and obviously
there's, I mean, there's- </garnt>
<garnt> - "Sabrina." </garnt>
<connor> - Miley Cyrus, Hannah Montana. </connor>
<garnt> - The best of both worlds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Think about that but just like better. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - How dare you diss my Miley like that. </joey>
<connor> - It's just a good musical anime? </connor>
<joey> - It is just the most- </joey>
<connor> - Does it just relies on
the characters is that. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's very heavily
reliant on the characters. </joey>
<joey> But like the way the characters
are written and just the, </joey>
<joey> how they like play off each
other and like all the, I mean, </joey>
<joey> A, it's very realistic, </joey>
<joey> which is already like a big plus for me, </joey>
<joey> especially with like a character
driven story like that. </joey>
<joey> But also just like, yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's just a really good journey. </joey>
<connor> - Do you think I'd enjoy it? </connor>
<connor> - Ah, do you like rock music? </connor>
<connor> - I enjoy rock music. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's if you were like... </garnt>
<garnt> To me "Beck"- </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like Mark Zuckerberg
answering that question. </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you like human things? </garnt>
<garnt> Yes I like human things." </garnt>
<garnt> - Initiate blink. </garnt>
<connor> - Sorry, sorry, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - I kind of realized, </connor>
<connor> I asked the person who enjoys
the beeps and the boobs. </connor>
<connor> - I do-
- Do you like rock music? </connor>
<connor> - I do enjoy rock music. </connor>
<connor> But I felt like the pressure
was on for some reason. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, go ahead. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, </connor>
<garnt> it's what I love about
"Beck" is that it's just all, </garnt>
<garnt> it just captures the, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the love for rock and you
know, good old, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> old classic rock and roll. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like how rock
has evolved through time. </garnt>
<joey> - So they mentioned like all of like, </joey>
<joey> do they mention the fact, </joey>
<joey> like they play like a cover of the Beatles </joey>
<connor> and shit like that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh okay. </joey>
<joey> That's dope. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, how does, is it, you know? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I just thought, wait a second. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh wait. </garnt>
<garnt> Surely you'd want to listen to the music." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I thought that- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I watched the anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah that's what I figured. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that as well, right. </joey>
<joey> Because I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Shit I kind of really
want to know what happens, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know if I can get it invested </joey>
<joey> in a fucking manga about music where..." </joey>
<connor> I don't know if you'd
know anything about manga, </connor>
<connor> but you can't really hear anything </connor>
<connor> that's going on in the manga. </connor>
<connor> - That shit don't have audio. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, and then then
I realized the fucking... </connor>
<connor> I kind of realized a super life hack </connor>
<connor> when reading "Beck," right. </connor>
<connor> Because you know, I
also watched the anime. </connor>
<connor> That's what got me into reading the manga. </connor>
<joey> - I know what you're going to say. </joey>
<joey> And I realized that when they're playing </joey>
<joey> in their concerts and it's hype. </joey>
<joey> - You play the song? </joey>
<joey> - You can literally
just play whatever song </joey>
<joey> you fucking love and you
feel the fucking emotion. </joey>
<connor> - Mega brain. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking brain expansion. </connor>
<connor> - Brain expansion. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like a lot of work you know. </connor>
<connor> I've got to go through my playlist. </connor>
<connor> - Brain expansion. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like you can do it if you, </connor>
<connor> if you want to like really get invested </connor>
<connor> and really like put yourself
into this rock concert. </connor>
<connor> But what what's amazing
about the manga is that </connor>
<garnt> it somehow captures the energy
of a concert so fucking well. </garnt>
<garnt> And like if you've ever been to a gig </garnt>
<garnt> and if you've ever like seen, </garnt>
<connor> - Sorry, sorry Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Thanks. </connor>
<garnt> Thank you Connor, thank you. </garnt>
<connor> No I'm joking, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> - I was just so bored. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> - I sneeze when I'm bored. </joey>
<garnt> - Connor when he listens to
someone talking about music. </garnt>
<connor> - He's having like
allergic reaction to it. </connor>
<connor> He's like music- </connor>
<connor> (mocks sneeze) </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, someone like read
musical sheets near me. </connor>
<connor> Go on, go on. </connor>
<connor> - If you've ever been to a gig </connor>
<connor> and especially like a rock concert, </connor>
<connor> there's a certain like energy- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I agree. </connor>
<connor> - To seeing your favorite bands live. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know how the manga, </connor>
<connor> which is a medium where
you can't hear anything, </connor>
<connor> it captures the energy so well
that you can play the music </connor>
<joey> of whatever your favorite band is. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, "Holy
fuck, I'm feeling hyped." </joey>
<joey> And the reason this is- </joey>
<connor> - It's more about conveying the feelings </connor>
<connor> than the music necessarily. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And the music is just like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like complementary
to that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, if you like the anime, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> then you're going to
fucking love the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the manga takes the best parts </garnt>
<garnt> of like the best scenes of
what happens in the anime. </garnt>
<joey> And there are scenes in the manga </joey>
<joey> that are like five times as hype </joey>
<joey> as anything that happens
in "Grateful Sounds." </joey>
<joey> - I know when I'm buying next. </joey>
<connor> - I guess you're sold. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's hard to sell "Beck" </connor>
<connor> if you haven't seen the anime. </connor>
<connor> Because if you haven't seen the anime, </connor>
<connor> I think that's the best
way to get into the manga. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's, like I said, </connor>
<connor> it's a musical manga </connor>
<connor> and it might be a hard sell </connor>
<connor> if you don't know what
you're getting into. </connor>
<connor> - So give just it a shot? </connor>
<garnt> - But if you like rock, if
you like good old rock n roll- </garnt>
<joey> - I still remember that scene in "Beck" </joey>
<joey> that made me be like hell yeah. </joey>
<connor> It was like the scene
where he does the cover </connor>
<connor> of "I got a Feeling" by the Beatles. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That scene is like the most
fucking like hell yes moment. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking incredible moment. </joey>
<joey> - It is so good. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know what you're talking about- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's so good.
- But hell yes. </garnt>
<joey> Hell yes. </joey>
<connor> - It's just so steeped in rock culture. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That if you like that- </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of people in Japan </connor>
<connor> just love fucking rock n' roll. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - People say, you know, when
you see a British, like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh Sex Pistols. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, that's me." </garnt>
<connor> - That's a British fan. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, like they
make so many references </garnt>
<joey> to like real life bands. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is something I also love as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like they say like, "Oh,
this person's inspired </connor>
<connor> by Hendricks or Sex Pistols." </connor>
<connor> - I think there's another
manga that does that. </connor>
<garnt> - "Jojo." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah "Jojo." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly right? </connor>
<garnt> - That was the joke I was going to go for. </garnt>
<garnt> Joey fucking stole it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And of course, the only
square that's been taken up </garnt>
<garnt> by all three of our
three-by-threes, "Berserk." </garnt>
<connor> - Rightfully deserved. </connor>
<garnt> - The legend has arrived. </garnt>
<garnt> I think last time we spoke about it, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I'd finished
it on the podcast, had I? </garnt>
<garnt> - No you hadn't. </garnt>
<connor> - No I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - Well I "finished it". </connor>
<joey> - You caught up to it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I caught up. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, you could
tell it was nearly done. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of had like its
own somewhat conclusion. </joey>
<connor> - Kind of. </connor>
<connor> - Around that point. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, when I was reading
it and I saw the dreaded, </connor>
<connor> I saw how many chapters
I had left, you know, </connor>
<connor> the little sinking feeling
was coming in my heart, </connor>
<connor> but you know, I still, I'm very sad. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I felt like he
was so close to the end. </connor>
<connor> Like we were, we were there, </connor>
<connor> like he was literally prepping. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He was prepping. </joey>
<joey> He was in the praying phase. </joey>
<joey> - I think, I still think he had a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know because he you know, </joey>
<joey> you know how before a big raid, you know, </joey>
<joey> you get some new armor, </joey>
<joey> you get some new stuff, right. </joey>
<joey> That's what was going on. </joey>
<joey> - That was definitely a
prominent fight coming for sure. </joey>
<joey> - We were going to, and it was
gearing up that it was like, </joey>
<joey> all right, we're getting a big boy fight. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It might've been like 10
years away, but it was coming. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was coming. </garnt>
<connor> It was on its way. </connor>
<connor> - It was like, "Oh she coming." </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, do we need </connor>
<connor> to re-exaplain the plot of "Berserk?" </connor>
<garnt> Do we? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's just- </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess we should a little bit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you haven't read "Berserk." </garnt>
<garnt> There's probably people watching this </garnt>
<garnt> who have not read
"Berserk" because I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I was one of the people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you like to explain the plot then? </garnt>
<garnt> - There was a boy who was orphaned. </garnt>
<connor> He was thrown to the wayside </connor>
<connor> in a pile of horrible
fluids on the ground. </connor>
<connor> And there was a woman who was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, we must pick this up." </connor>
<connor> And the mercenary band that was traveling </connor>
<connor> with this woman, was like,
"No, let him let him die." </connor>
<connor> But then somehow the woman
convinces the men to let her </connor>
<connor> pick the baby up and raise this child </connor>
<connor> who is going to be Guts,
our main character. </connor>
<connor> And as you can tell, this
upbringing is not the best </connor>
<connor> and many more horrible things happen </connor>
<connor> to this child through his upbringing. </connor>
<joey> - So may horrible things. </joey>
<joey> - So many gross things. </joey>
<joey> But the band of mercenaries </joey>
<joey> also train him to be a warrior. </joey>
<joey> And then, you know, because, </joey>
<joey> cause he's had so many
bad things happen to him </joey>
<joey> during his childhood, </joey>
<joey> he becomes kind of the lone gamer warrior </joey>
<joey> that we all think is
the coolest thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you know-
- The black swordsman. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the black swordsman, right? </garnt>
<connor> The guy who can carry
the big ass sword that- </connor>
<connor> - Not Kiruto.
- Isn't that Kiruto. </connor>
<connor> - Not Kiruto. </connor>
<joey> - The one who can just
beat everyone alone, right. </joey>
<joey> And, and you know, </joey>
<joey> he slowly realize that
that's a bit of an empty life </joey>
<joey> and wants to make friends. </joey>
<joey> And then bad things happen. </joey>
<connor> Very bad things happen and
bad things continue to happen. </connor>
<connor> And it's about getting
over those bad things </connor>
<connor> and trying to learn to accept people </connor>
<connor> and love again I supposed in certain ways. </connor>
<joey> - It poses itself as this
like big bad guy with a sword </joey>
<joey> fights monsters and bad dudes
and tries to survive them all. </joey>
<connor> But at the end of it, you realize, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's not about that." </connor>
<connor> It's about his journey. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's always always about that. </connor>
<connor> It's always about the journey. </connor>
<connor> - It's about him. </connor>
<joey> It's literally just like
a manga about his life. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and just the cherry
on top is just God tier art. </connor>
<joey> - God tier. </joey>
<joey> - The art is just insane. </joey>
<connor> Like it's, it's just the- </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] No one can draw like Miura. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if you haven't read it, you know, </joey>
<connor> I had not read it for a very long time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I knew it was good,
but I just didn't do it. </connor>
<joey> - You didn't know how good it was. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't know how good it was. </joey>
<joey> I mean I had watched the anime </joey>
<joey> and I thought, "Oh it's pretty good yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's good, this thing
is pretty all right." </connor>
<connor> - Okay wait, the 2016 anime? </connor>
<connor> - No the- </connor>
<connor> - Or the 90's?
- 90's anime. </connor>
<connor> - Oh okay. I was about to fucking say- </connor>
<joey> - That's what I was going to say. </joey>
<garnt> - We don't do that here. </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't do that here. </garnt>
<connor> - We do not do that here. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, I read it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm saying like, </garnt>
<connor> if you're sleeping on it or
you've been putting it off, </connor>
<connor> like now is the time like, you know, </connor>
<connor> while it's still fresh in
everyone's hearts you know. </connor>
<connor> It's pay tribute to the king, read it. </connor>
<connor> It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> You will not regret it. </connor>
<connor> Like it has, dare I say, a
little something for everybody. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, there's a reason why- </joey>
<joey> - Whatever you want out of a manga, </joey>
<connor> I guarantee you'll get
something out of this. </connor>
<joey> - There's a reason why- </joey>
<connor> - You will get something out of this. </connor>
<joey> - It's been goaded forever now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It is not just like over-hyped at all. </connor>
<garnt> It is- </garnt>
<garnt> - Rightfully deserved. </garnt>
<connor> - It is, it is not over-hyped. </connor>
<garnt> And I've thought of every
possible reason I could </garnt>
<garnt> to not put this on my three-by-three, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just the one that- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we all know that we
were all going to put it in. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like the manga </garnt>
<garnt> that goes on everyone's three-by-three </garnt>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Can I be that person?" </connor>
<connor> Yes, Miura deserves it. </connor>
<connor> - I've had many manga
that I, well not many, </connor>
<joey> most that I've had one or two
chapters that I have, like, </joey>
<joey> you know what, let's just
kind of speed run this part. </joey>
<connor> Let's get through it fast. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I never, ever, ever felt
like that during "Berserk." </connor>
<connor> Even though I'd seen the first arc. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still was like, "Fuck this is good. </garnt>
<garnt> Taking my time." </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - Like what I find
incredible is that, you know, </garnt>
<connor> people will look at "Berserk" </connor>
<joey> or people who have never read "Berserk", </joey>
<joey> they look at it and they see, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, musty man with big sword go burr." </joey>
<joey> You know, that's kind of
like what it looks like </joey>
<joey> on the cover, but like what everyone </joey>
<joey> who's read "Berserk" and the moments </joey>
<joey> that stand out in "Berserk" and the parts </joey>
<joey> that people remember are
always like the quiet moments. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's the beautiful moments. </joey>
<joey> And that's because
there's the juxtaposition </joey>
<garnt> between like the fucked
up shit that happens </garnt>
<garnt> and the bloody and gory and amazing action </garnt>
<garnt> that is in the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's juxtaposed with some of like </garnt>
<garnt> the most beautiful moments
you can find in fiction. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Just the scene of Guts </joey>
<joey> standing in the field of flowers. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, that whole
like mini arc, if you will, </connor>
<connor> was one of my favorite moments reading it. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh shit." </connor>
<garnt> They just took like... </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, "Hold up." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's bring feels. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because I feel like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like the story of "Berserk" speaks </joey>
<joey> to just a core that so
many people can relate to </joey>
<joey> like, to, you know, to get
fucking real for a second. </joey>
<joey> Like if you've ever felt lost in life </joey>
<joey> or you don't know what your purpose is, </joey>
<joey> or you don't know- </joey>
<joey> - If it's worth it- </joey>
<joey> - If you don't know if it's
worth or why you're here. </joey>
<joey> Like if you're just ever having a bad day, </joey>
<joey> like that's exactly what Guts
goes through in "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> He may look like a big muscly man, </joey>
<garnt> but he like, </garnt>
<garnt> the journey that he goes through </garnt>
<garnt> is exactly the same realization </garnt>
<garnt> that a lot of us have gone through </garnt>
<garnt> in our lives, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Under that hunk of
muscle, there is a heart. </joey>
<connor> - You can't chop your way
through every problem. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's what, you know- </connor>
<connor> - He tries and he realizes no he can't. </connor>
<connor> - As much as we'd all love
to be the overpowered MC </connor>
<connor> like at the end of the day </connor>
<connor> that this is not going to
help you solve every problem. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what, you
know, does it shows you, </connor>
<connor> I guess in some ways not to
get too lost in the things </connor>
<garnt> that are right in front of you, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is a lot about
what "Berserk" is about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the scene that
sold me on "Berserk" if like, </garnt>
<joey> if I can get to do some,
like small spoilers </joey>
<joey> of the Golden Age arc, </joey>
<joey> it's like the scene after he beats </joey>
<connor> like the hundred men. </connor>
<connor> Because like you, you think in warfare, </connor>
<connor> you have one man takes on a hundred men. </connor>
<connor> That's fucking bad ass. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In any other anime that would like, </connor>
<connor> that's framed as like, "Holy fuck." </connor>
<garnt> This is an incredible feat, which it is. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I remember like
it was just Guts' reaction. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just realizing it
doesn't fucking mean anything. </garnt>
<connor> - And also the aftermath of
everyone coming in the forest </connor>
<connor> and seeing him just
murdered a hundred people. </connor>
<joey> They were just like disgusted. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> - How is this man alive? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, it's afterwards
that he just realizes, </joey>
<joey> "I'm doing this for no reason. </joey>
<joey> I'm literally just killing a hundred men </joey>
<connor> and it just means nothing to me." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like even right away. </connor>
<connor> Like even though I, you know, </connor>
<connor> I think I said this in the last episode, </connor>
<connor> the last time we spoke about "Berserk." </connor>
<garnt> I do think that I would have
preferred the first part, </garnt>
<garnt> which they because they
have like a time skip. </garnt>
<garnt> I would've preferred they've just put that </garnt>
<connor> in the right time because
I feel like it kind of- </connor>
<joey> - Just start from like Golden Age arc. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it would have been perfect </connor>
<connor> to start from there. </connor>
<connor> Even though I'm sure
people disagree with me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like you get so
many really cool experiences </connor>
<connor> if you didn't know what
was going to happen. </connor>
<connor> And also just getting to see his childhood </connor>
<connor> from the start would
tell you all about the </connor>
<joey> how fucked up this thing is going to be. </joey>
<joey> - I guess they needed a hook, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- To sell people in. </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why, but like, you know, </joey>
<joey> I wonder if it was done again, you know, </joey>
<joey> would it be ordered differently? </joey>
<connor> Looking back I wonder. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> That's obviously just pure
speculation and I'm sure people </connor>
<connor> would completely disagree
with me and that's fine. </connor>
<garnt> That's opinions, right? </garnt>
<connor> That's what we're here for. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I think especially is
especially what happened recently. </connor>
<connor> "Berserk"'s really changed my perspective </connor>
<connor> on how I view media as well,
because I'm just like before, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like something
that's not finished </connor>
<connor> can't be a masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> And then I think about it
and I'm just like "Berserk" </connor>
<connor> is a pure example of
something that has done more </connor>
<connor> than fucking enough to be a masterpiece. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like an unfinished masterpiece
is still a masterpiece. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know? </garnt>
<joey> And I feel like that's
really changed my perspective </joey>
<joey> on other shows, which maybe not have ended </joey>
<joey> and may never end. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, well, </joey>
<joey> I think it's still done enough </joey>
<connor> to be called like a masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<joey> - And I think "Berserk" has
really shown me that as well. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I agree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Read "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - Read "Berserk." </joey>
<garnt> Please. </garnt>
<joey> And listen to Guts's theme. </joey>
<joey> - Even if you're not into dark
fantasy, I think it's still- </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not in the dark fantasy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still think it can
be very much enjoyed. </garnt>
<connor> - I love dark fantasy. </connor>
<joey> - I love dark fantasy. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess there's
nothing else to say really. </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing else. That was- </joey>
<connor> - You've had some new recommendations. </connor>
<connor> - You know what Garnt, not bad. </connor>
<joey> I mean, let's take into
consideration this middle one. </joey>
<garnt> - Get that shit out of here. </garnt>
<joey> - Other than that, good choice. </joey>
<garnt> Good Choice. </garnt>
<connor> - Anyone who's read "Domestic Girlfriend" </connor>
<connor> knows that this shit slapped. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, let us know your
three-by-three on the subreddit. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I'm sure you will anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because we'd love to see... </garnt>
<connor> Like I need more recommendations. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm wondering how many people </garnt>
<garnt> will have "Berserk" on there? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm saying, man, like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Listen it's- </connor>
<joey> - I want to see a three-by-three </joey>
<joey> that doesn't have "Berserk." </joey>
<joey> - It's not normy to put
"Berserk" in your three-by-three. </joey>
<joey> - It's not overrated. </joey>
<connor> It's just that good. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like you know putting a salt </garnt>
<garnt> in my favorite condiments. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, it needs to go on everything. </connor>
<connor> Like what do you, I'm not, come on. </connor>
<connor> Don't boo me, I'm right. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a three-by-three
of essential things. </joey>
<connor> I put water. </connor>
<joey> Water is overrated. </joey>
<connor> - Water, really? </connor>
<connor> Wow, you really put in water, wow. </connor>
<garnt> I think Fanta belongs in but no water. </garnt>
<garnt> But, yeah anyway... </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, please send us your three-by-three's </garnt>

<joey> - You know what, we went from trash today. </joey>
<garnt> - Just a good conversation. </garnt>
<connor> - We weren't "Trash Taste." </connor>
