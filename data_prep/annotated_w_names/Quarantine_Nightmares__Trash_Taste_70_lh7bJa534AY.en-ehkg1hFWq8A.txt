<connor> - I want the coffee so when that's ready, </connor>
<joey> please give it to me. </joey>
<joey> - Hold on to your knickers. </joey>
<joey> - I heard I can see your knickers, </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> - When he said it, it sounded
to me like he was singing. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I say the word knickers
the same way as you do. </joey>
<connor> - Guys, stop! </connor>
<connor> You guys are really leaning into that N. </connor>
<joey> - Don't put your knickers in a twist. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> (upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> I am your host for today, Little Baby Man. </joey>
<joey> - Stop doing this. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - And together with me, </connor>
<connor> are the other little baby men. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - The little baby men. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen that image on Reddit? </joey>
<joey> It's just like the little baby men. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] All three of us? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I fucking love that image man. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing)
- Of course you do. </garnt>
<garnt> Finally, I'm as tall as you guys. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - He's actually gonna be as tall as us. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> I saw some guy make it
his phone wallpaper. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, thanks guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, you guys
probably haven't seen any, </garnt>
<joey> like you guys probably
haven't felt any break. </joey>
<joey> We felt a massive break--
- Six weeks. </joey>
<joey> - Six weeks since we last recorded, </joey>
<garnt> which to me has felt
like six months, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, it's one year
since I saw you guys. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing)
- I know. </garnt>
<joey> - It's crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> But yeah like so if you didn't know, </joey>
<joey> me and Connor went back to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- For like three, four weeks, </joey>
<joey> and then we had two weeks of quarantine. </joey>
<joey> So basically scheduling that out, </joey>
<connor> it comes out to about six weeks </connor>
<connor> before we last recorded. </connor>
<connor> It has been like, </connor>
<connor> since we started Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize how much my schedule </connor>
<connor> relied on me going to Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> and just seeing the boys. </connor>
<connor> Because it was weird just not seeing </connor>
<garnt> the both of you every week. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was so bored during September. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna lie,
while you guys were gone </garnt>
<connor> like every Tuesday I
was getting ready to go </connor>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I don't have to." </joey>
<joey> - Honey I'm going to work. </joey>
<joey> - I'm going to work JK. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, we have our coffees, yes! </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, finally! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God, I love this.
- Thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, we went back to the UK. </garnt>
<joey> That was fun.
- Yeah, how was it? </joey>
<connor> - It was good.
- I mean, how long is it? </connor>
<joey> Like two years, or almost, </joey>
<joey> since you guys went out?
- Yeah, two years. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's been about two years. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's been two years basically </garnt>
<joey> since I've seen any of my mates there, </joey>
<joey> or my parents or my family.
- Same. </joey>
<joey> - Was it emotional? </joey>
<joey> Did you guys hug it out? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was weird seeing my parents. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - Because it was just like, </garnt>
<connor> I've only seen them through Zoom, </connor>
<garnt> for like two years, </garnt>
<connor> and it was just kinda like-
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was weird having
conversations with people, </garnt>
<garnt> not through a discord
call or the Zoom call. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you realize, I've
forgotten what it was like </garnt>
<garnt> to just actually catch up with someone, </garnt>
<garnt> not through a computer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, "Damn, look at those graphics." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I can touch them now.
- It's like no lag. </garnt>
<joey> - I felt like, when I went back to Wales, </joey>
<connor> I felt like the Pope
going around a small town. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "HI guys--
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - "HI parents yes, come, give me a hug. </garnt>
<connor> I'll give you, I'll take a
picture with your parents." </connor>
<connor> Okay, now I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It was nice. </connor>
<connor> I also learned from my past mistakes </connor>
<connor> of when I used to go back home. </connor>
<connor> I actually try to schedule </connor>
<joey> as many hangouts with friends as possible. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- I reached out </joey>
<joey> to as many people as possible. </joey>
<joey> Because the last time I went home, </joey>
<garnt> I just kind of thought, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'll figure it
out when I get there." </garnt>
<garnt> And I ended up not doing anything </garnt>
<garnt> in like half days and I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Shit, I really should
have planned things." </connor>
<garnt> - I did the same thing as you. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I think I made another mistake </garnt>
<joey> and I think I planned two months. </joey>
<joey> - No, yeah, then that happened. </joey>
<connor> - Because then, I kind of realized </connor>
<joey> about like five, six days in, </joey>
<joey> not even like halfway through my trip, </joey>
<connor> seeing someone every day, </connor>
<connor> you haven't caught up with
someone for two years, </connor>
<connor> what do they wanna do? </connor>
<connor> Like crack open some
beers or bottle of wine? </connor>
<connor> And you just like, </connor>
<joey> you end up just eating
and drinking like shit </joey>
<joey> every single day. </joey>
<joey> - And so you basically downloaded </joey>
<joey> the alcoholic DLC. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing)
- Well, basically. </connor>
<connor> - Well, so I was there for 20 days </connor>
<joey> and only one day I didn't drink. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - Every single day, I had at
least one beer or something, </joey>
<connor> just because that was like the thing </connor>
<garnt> that you do in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think 70 to 80% of my schedule </garnt>
<garnt> for my days there were seeing someone </garnt>
<joey> or catching up with someone. </joey>
<garnt> And that meant 70% to 80% of my trip </garnt>
<joey> was like having some sort of drink. </joey>
<garnt> - So that's how you socialize. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do you drink with your parents? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so your parents are
drinkers as well, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes.
- My parents don't drink, </garnt>
<connor> - But you drunk anyway. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, but since we
haven't drunk in two years, </connor>
<joey> they brought open a bottle of wine </joey>
<joey> and they had a glass, I was
just like, "Oh shit, okay." </joey>
<joey> - This is special.
- This is a special occasion. </joey>
<joey> (Connor and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I think I've seen my
mum drunk before this, </connor>
<connor> once in my life when I was
four at my cousin's wedding. </connor>
<connor> And you know, it was just
the weirdest fucking thing, </connor>
<connor> 'cause my mom is like, </connor>
<joey> as far as my perception is, </joey>
<joey> like the biggest straight
edge there is, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right.
- She doesn't drink, </joey>
<joey> she doesn't smoke, </joey>
<joey> doesn't do anything like that. </joey>
<joey> I had never ever seen her like... </joey>
<connor> In my life, I think I've seen
her take a sip of alcohol </connor>
<connor> about like, I think five times in my life, </connor>
<connor> total, total. </connor>
<joey> And then I remember going
to my cousin's wedding </joey>
<joey> and my entire family were there. </joey>
<joey> Everyone had like flown in from Thailand. </joey>
<joey> So it was a rare occurrence </joey>
<joey> that we have a massive
family gathered in one place. </joey>
<joey> And it was the first time </joey>
<joey> I'd seen a different side of my mom. </joey>
<joey> I had no idea. </joey>
<joey> I had no idea </joey>
<joey> that there was just this
monster laying within. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> And it felt almost like </connor>
<connor> she got more drunk than Sydney on the day. </connor>
<connor> Oh, she got drunk faster than Sydney. </connor>
<connor> And that gives you an indication
of how surprised I was. </connor>
<connor> And I remember like halfway
through the wedding, </connor>
<connor> I come sit down, </connor>
<connor> and my mom and dad are
just sitting on this table. </connor>
<connor> My mum has a glass of wine in front of us. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know how much she had drunk </connor>
<connor> at this point. </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Gig." </connor>
<connor> Oh, my Thai name is Gig. </connor>
<connor> She was like, "Gig, do you wanna see me </connor>
<connor> down this glass of wine?" </connor>
<connor> I was like,
(Connor and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no mum, I don't wanna see you </connor>
<connor> down that glass of wine, mum, no." </connor>
<connor> She was like, "I'll do it, I'll do it" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Mom! No, no, don't do it!" </connor>
<garnt> And she just-- </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Mom, what are you 15? </garnt>
<joey> What are you 18?" </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile, there's
like six bottles of wine </joey>
<garnt> below her feet. </garnt>
<garnt> - And Sydney was on the dance floor. </garnt>
<garnt> This was like 10:00, 11:00 PM, </garnt>
<joey> Sydney was on the dance floor. </joey>
<garnt> Sydney was pretty not sober,
but she was like merry. </garnt>
<connor> She wasn't completely drunk. </connor>
<connor> And then my mum just comes up to her, </connor>
<connor> takes the bottle of beer
that she's drinking, </connor>
<connor> just downs it in front of her </connor>
<connor> and takes it and gives it back to her. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen Sydney so
dumbfounded in my life. </connor>
<joey> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's awesome. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah so, yeah, I ended
up drinking with my parents </joey>
<joey> a bit more which was a
very rare occurrence. </joey>
<joey> Of course, of course I'm gonna
share some alcohol with them, </joey>
<connor> but about like the fifth day
in and your body's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Please, please no more, like please." </connor>
<connor> I like the social aspect, </connor>
<connor> but my God, my body just died </connor>
<joey> like halfway through the trip I think. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - Damn yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> There's a thing where,
especially with my family, </joey>
<connor> they drink quite often. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like they saw it as an excuse </connor>
<garnt> to drink more than usual. </garnt>
<garnt> So then it became a
thing where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is great, but I'm dying." </garnt>
<joey> My dad's retired as well now. </joey>
<joey> So now, he loves it. </joey>
<joey> He's just like-
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I thought my dad would
get bored being retired. </joey>
<joey> He seems like, I thought
he was one of those guys </joey>
<connor> that really needed like a
job to keep him occupied, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, and he fucking loves it. </connor>
<joey> He just gardens all day and he loves it. </joey>
<joey> It like he's like--
- That's the life, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's living his life.
- That is the life. </joey>
<joey> - He like bought a canoe </joey>
<joey> and I'm like--
- Oh shit! </joey>
<joey> - "Buying a canoe?" </joey>
<joey> Buys a canoe. </joey>
<joey> Where do you even store a canoe? </joey>
<joey> How do you even keep that? </joey>
<joey> I don't even know, </joey>
<joey> the logistics behind owning a canoe </joey>
<joey> seem way too difficult. </joey>
<joey> - Like, throw it in your backyard. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, he seems
like he's loving it </joey>
<connor> and yeah, so it was nice. </connor>
<joey> - At least he's picked hobbies </joey>
<joey> that are gonna keep him active. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's other things he
could have invested in. </joey>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> He occasionally does do work, </connor>
<connor> he does like, helps a friend
with houses building stuff, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Yeah for me, that's all I saw. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's just like--
- He's chilling, </connor>
<connor> he's chilling.
- That's just retiring. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I've been doing.
- That's just peak retirement </joey>
<joey> - That's where I wanna be
when I retire, just vibing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was fun. </connor>
<connor> I went back and forth
between Wales and London, </connor>
<connor> it was a lot of fun. </connor>
<garnt> I got to see as many friends as possible </garnt>
<garnt> and drank way too much alcohol. </garnt>
<garnt> - We did, we did. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like 'cause we
posted a few pictures </garnt>
<garnt> while we're on break in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember we were catching up </garnt>
<connor> with a bunch of our friends, </connor>
<joey> and I actually hardly
ever talked to Connor </joey>
<joey> in our trip. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we obviously
like talked and caught up </joey>
<joey> and everything but we mostly
spend time just catching up </joey>
<joey> with other people. </joey>
<connor> - I don't feel the need
to talk to you guys. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we see each other every week. </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking talk to you way too much. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel that we had a
mutual understanding. </garnt>
<connor> - I couldn't escape you. </connor>
<joey> - We've talked every week </joey>
<joey> for like the past fucking over a year now, </joey>
<joey> we can have a little bit time apart. </joey>
<connor> I think the only times </connor>
<connor> that we did do something together was, </connor>
<connor> I think we played like
a game of chess, IRL. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, I was drunk. </connor>
<connor> We were both drunk.
- We were both drunk, </connor>
<connor> and of course you beat me. </connor>
<joey> The only time when there was-- </joey>
<joey> - Fortunately there was no cameras. </joey>
<connor> - No cameras. </connor>
<garnt> No one watching it.
- The next chess tournament </garnt>
<connor> should have a blood-alcohol
level measured before, </connor>
<joey> and you need to be X
amount required to play. </joey>
<connor> That's what we need. </connor>
<joey> - You just qualify if it's below 0.7. </joey>
<connor> - You're a little too sober for my liking, </connor>
<joey> you're not in, you're out. </joey>
<joey> - Got so many brain cells
for this tournament. </joey>
<joey> - Every time you lose a piece, </joey>
<garnt> you got to do a shot or
something I don't know, just die. </garnt>
<garnt> This is what chess needs,
the next evolution. </garnt>
<garnt> - Drunk chess. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're going from casual chess </garnt>
<connor> to absolute euphoric drinkable chess. </connor>
<garnt> - I also like playing chess. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember playing chess against you </garnt>
<garnt> because we had a physical board, </garnt>
<joey> none of this online chess business. </joey>
<joey> We went old school. </joey>
<joey> And we even had like a chess clock </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And I think I've realized </joey>
<connor> how much I've relied on the chess.com UI </connor>
<connor> to really like-
- Oh, it's very good. </connor>
<connor> - Be good at the game 'cause-- </connor>
<joey> - Because otherwise you
have to look down like this. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was pretty
intoxicated at that point. </joey>
<garnt> But I remember I fell for
the most obvious checkmates </garnt>
<garnt> of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I was great. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was trying to question
how I couldn't see that, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we bet 20 pounds on the game. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why we bet
20 pounds on the game, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I was drunk at the time. </garnt>
<connor> - Whenever I'm like
playing games with friends, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, 10 bucks, one buck. </connor>
<garnt> Let's make it interesting. </garnt>
<connor> Let's do it let's have fun. </connor>
<connor> - Fair, fair. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah how was your perception
of England going back? </connor>
<connor> - I wrote notes, I wrote notes. </connor>
<garnt> - You wrote notes?
- You wrote notes? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh this is why you--
- Chris told me </garnt>
<joey> to write notes and my phone is on 1%. </joey>
<joey> - You better read them all.
- So what I'm gonna do, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna read through them all, </joey>
<joey> then we can talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- Very, very dirty. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> London is really loud, </joey>
<joey> I didn't realize how noisy it was before. </joey>
<joey> It feels like the same amount of people </joey>
<joey> are walking around Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> but in London it's less orderly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Lots more homeless. </joey>
<joey> People making gestures or
saying something to you </joey>
<joey> whenever you do anything. </joey>
<joey> Like when I... </joey>
<garnt> This guy just started
talking to me in the lift, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was really confused. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I just forgot that
that was like a thing. </garnt>
<connor> We started just talking and I was like, </connor>
<connor> I had literally just
checked into my hotel. </connor>
<joey> I just got off the flight. </joey>
<joey> I was like-
- what did he say to you? </joey>
<joey> - He was just like, he
was talking about like-- </joey>
<garnt> - Did you say hi? </garnt>
<garnt> - He was like, "How you doing?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Me?" </connor>
<joey> - It's so funny to say that </joey>
<joey> 'cause I literally got
recommended a video yesterday </joey>
<joey> of this satire news
report, that's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Northerner terrorizes Londoners </joey>
<joey> by saying hello." </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Literally what happened.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> People would... </connor>
<connor> Okay, when they bump into
you, right in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And I've totally forgotten </connor>
<connor> this was the thing. </connor>
<connor> This is the longest cable on earth, man. </connor>
<connor> When people bump into you
in Japan, they say sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Someone bumped into me, </connor>
<connor> and those dickheads didn't say sorry. </connor>
<garnt> - They didn't say anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could not, every
time that happened to me, </garnt>
<connor> I could not stop saying </connor>
<connor> (speaks in foreign language) </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joy laugh) </connor>
<connor> It was just like muscle memory. </connor>
<connor> Even if I hadn't bumped into someone, </connor>
<connor> I was like on the tune. </connor>
<connor> And I was like (speaking
in foreign language) </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "I'm not in Japan anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to stop doing
this 'cause no one else </garnt>
<garnt> is saying this shit." </garnt>
<garnt> I just couldn't stop saying
it or like subconsciously. </garnt>
<connor> - I heard one thing that happens in Japan, </connor>
<connor> now I don't expect this, </connor>
<connor> so I just noticed that it was different. </connor>
<connor> When you get a taxI in Japan, </connor>
<connor> the taxI driver will always try </connor>
<connor> and help you with your bags,
even if you don't need it. </connor>
<connor> - Right, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It could be the smallest bag on earth </connor>
<connor> and he might try and come out </connor>
<connor> and help you with it. </connor>
<connor> And that never happened with
taxis in the UK I noticed. </connor>
<connor> Every time I had a suitcase or anything, </connor>
<garnt> they would just sit in the car </garnt>
<garnt> and then I'd have to open
the boot too as well, </garnt>
<joey> which is fine, totally fine with that. </joey>
<joey> But I just felt, I was like, </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah, this is the
thing that we don't do. </joey>
<connor> And that was most of them. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, that was the most it. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll tell you the biggest, </garnt>
<garnt> the immediate thing that I noticed </garnt>
<connor> about going back to the UK, </connor>
<connor> that I immediately missed about Japan. </connor>
<connor> So, I think it was the second
day that we landed there </connor>
<connor> and also my second day in the UK, </connor>
<connor> and we went out to just
walk around Brighton again, </connor>
<joey> walk around town, because
it's been quite a while </joey>
<joey> since I've been in my hometown. </joey>
<joey> So, me and Sydney just went
out, did a quick shopping trip </joey>
<joey> and I got thirsty. </joey>
<joey> My throat was a little bit parched, right? </joey>
<joey> And so I started searching for a drink-- </joey>
<joey> - I can see where we are going with this. </joey>
<joey> - In order to quench my thirst, </joey>
<garnt> and I look around and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where are the vending machines?" </garnt>
<joey> How am I supposed to procure some liquids </joey>
<joey> so that I may quench my thirst?" </joey>
<connor> And I walk around in this shopping center </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, wait. </connor>
<connor> And then I soon realized, </connor>
<connor> I have to go to a shop </connor>
<connor> in order to purchase some liquids. </connor>
<joey> - Not even a community
shop, like a supermarket. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like a corner shop. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "What
backward system is this? </joey>
<joey> I need to go into a shop </joey>
<garnt> that sells other things other than drinks, </garnt>
<garnt> and I need to do human interaction </garnt>
<garnt> in order to purchase this? </garnt>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<joey> - We really do take for granted </joey>
<garnt> how many fucking vending machines </garnt>
<garnt> are on this country.
- I didn't realize that, </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes, I'm
just walking around, </garnt>
<joey> I get a little thirsty, </joey>
<connor> and I'm just like literally a minute away </connor>
<connor> from the next vending machine. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize how convenient that was </connor>
<connor> until I went to the UK. </connor>
<connor> It's in a big shopping center, </connor>
<connor> most of this is just like cloves, </connor>
<connor> or different kinds of stores, </connor>
<connor> that are not like food drink items. </connor>
<connor> And even if it is, </connor>
<connor> most of them are something like super drug </connor>
<connor> or some very big pharmacy store </connor>
<connor> where they sell the drinks there, </connor>
<connor> but it's way bigger than it needs to be. </connor>
<joey> So I ended up like having to go in, </joey>
<joey> go into this massive store, </joey>
<joey> go to like the small segments, </joey>
<joey> just for food and drink. </joey>
<joey> - And then line up.
- And then line up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm just like--
- Disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine lining up for things. </joey>
<connor> Not on my watch. </connor>
<joey> - Imagine lining up for a bottle of water. </joey>
<joey> Jesus! </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But that's like the
first thing I noticed </joey>
<joey> where it was just like, </joey>
<joey> I really missed the vending machines </joey>
<garnt> and just being able to
buy very conveniently, </garnt>
<garnt> buy like a snack or something . </garnt>
<joey> - I felt that way as well,
whenever I got back to Australia, </joey>
<connor> or like the U.S or anything as well. </connor>
<connor> Because we have vending machines, </connor>
<connor> like in Australia and the U.S </connor>
<connor> but you don't have like a Suica. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like I said. </joey>
<connor> - So you have to reach in,
grab your fucking change, </connor>
<connor> jiggle that around and then--
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why </connor>
<connor> they got you five fucking
vending machines in the West, </connor>
<joey> because sometimes the drink
doesn't even fucking pull back. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, "Oh, good. </joey>
<joey> I'm about to gamble $3 </joey>
<joey> to see if I can even get this. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you gotta double-pull as well. </joey>
<joey> That just happens sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> - You're really lucky for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you buy a drink and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm gonna buy another drink immediately." </garnt>
<garnt> But then, the machine is designed </garnt>
<joey> in such a way that it just can't handle </joey>
<joey> two drinks being dispensed at once. </joey>
<joey> So you have to like fucking
scrunch your hand inside </joey>
<joey> and pull one out, just so you can unblock </joey>
<joey> this fucking thing.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, I noticed as well, obviously, </joey>
<joey> I got at the airport and it's like, </joey>
<joey> "No one was wearing masks." </joey>
<garnt> - Really?
- Yep, yep. </garnt>
<connor> - No one was wearing masks. </connor>
<connor> I don't have fucking opinion on it. </connor>
<connor> I do whatever I'm told to do, I'm a sheep. </connor>
<connor> All right, what can I say? </connor>
<joey> - Wake up sheep! </joey>
<joey> - That's taking a stance in the self club. </joey>
<garnt> - I really don't give
a shit, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> If everyone around me is wearing a mask, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll wear a mask, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But it was one of those things </garnt>
<garnt> where I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, whoa, this is fucking weird." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause in Japan, you'll be crucified </connor>
<connor> if you don't wear a mask. </connor>
<joey> - You could be in the
middle of a rice field </joey>
<connor> and they'll still somehow find a way </connor>
<joey> to crucify you.
- [Garnt] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And it was just like so strange, </joey>
<connor> just seeing everything
kind of back to normal. </connor>
<connor> It was like the UK just took the route of, </connor>
<connor> we don't give a shit anymore open back up. </connor>
<connor> But the rules are different as well </connor>
<connor> between England and Wales. </connor>
<connor> And because I was traveling between them, </connor>
<connor> on Wales trains, you have to wear a mask, </connor>
<connor> on English trains, you
don't have to wear a mask. </connor>
<connor> But some trains go from Wales to England. </connor>
<joey> So what happens is, </joey>
<joey> is that when you get into England, </joey>
<joey> people just took off
their masks on the train. </joey>
<joey> - Which does nothing. </joey>
<connor> - Which then eliminates
the whole point of... </connor>
<joey> Not that I think one of
either is wrong or right, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> It invalidates with both </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to put it on off. </garnt>
<garnt> You're on the same God damn train. </garnt>
<connor> It was, whatever. </connor>
<joey> - That's like you being on a flight </joey>
<joey> and then like, </joey>
<connor> - Oh, well we're now in Russian airspace. </connor>
<joey> (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> - COVID is like, "Okay
guys, I'ma head back now." </joey>
<joey> - Sir, I can't survive
in this jurisdiction. </joey>
<joey> I need to get back. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So, it's like, "Okay,
that's kind of weird." </joey>
<connor> And I was wearing a mask </connor>
<connor> and I thought this was
early, like in America, </connor>
<connor> but someone came up to me and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Take off your mask." </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - Yes, someone came up to me and was like, </joey>
<joey> "Take off your mask." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "I don't think I will." </joey>
<joey> And then he was like, "Why?" </joey>
<joey> - Where were you? </joey>
<joey> - I was in Wales. </joey>
<connor> He was saying-
- Where you have </connor>
<connor> to wear a mask, right? </connor>
<connor> Still in Wales?
- No, no, no, you don't. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you just did anyway? </joey>
<connor> - Obviously everybody was wearing a mask. </connor>
<connor> I looked like shit, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to cover my
face, I felt dreadful. </connor>
<connor> But he came to me and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Take off your mask." </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "No." </garnt>
<garnt> And then he was like, "Why? </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you wearing a mask?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, I just ignored him </garnt>
<garnt> I carried on with my phone </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like-
- On the train? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Outside the train station. </garnt>
<joey> And he was just like,
"Take off your mask." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "No."
- Why? </joey>
<joey> - So I said no. </joey>
<connor> Some people get weirdly offended by it. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "Sorry,
I'm protecting myself." </joey>
<connor> - At one time I was wearing it as well, </connor>
<connor> and the guy asked me, he was like, </connor>
<joey> "Are you wearing that for me or for you?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "For me." </joey>
<joey> - I think both, technically. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the thing was
that even though, you know, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause we had a flight to get on. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was coming up to that flight, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "I'm wearing a mask." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I do not wanna be having
to rearrange all my plans </joey>
<joey> and delay transportation."
- Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - So that's why I was wearing it. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, "Oh my God, </joey>
<connor> why are so many people coming up to me </connor>
<connor> and tell me to take off my mask?" </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause you're taking a stance. </garnt>
<garnt> I think going back to with him, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I had very similar experiences </connor>
<connor> where every time I'd meet
some group of friends, </connor>
<connor> they'd question me of why
I chose to wear a mask. </connor>
<connor> Why I chose to put on this mask. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing)
(group chattering) </connor>
<garnt> They didn't listen to me
until I put on the mask. </garnt>
<joey> And so I get questioned about it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I need to fly back to
Japan in like two weeks </joey>
<joey> and I'm pretty used to it. </joey>
<joey> And I just don't wanna take any risks." </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> That's just my opinion, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Why do you have to be accused
for protecting yourself? </joey>
<connor> - I'm not saying- </connor>
<joey> - That's like being like, "Why
are you wearing the condom? </joey>
<joey> Take it off." </joey>
<joey> - It's not like I'm
going around and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Put your mask on, put your mask on." </joey>
<joey> I don't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> You don't need it... </joey>
<joey> If the government tells you
you don't need to wear it, </joey>
<joey> I don't give a shit, don't wear it. </joey>
<connor> I'm just gonna wear it. </connor>
<joey> - But if the government also
says, "Don't wear a mask." </joey>
<joey> It's not like they're gonna
fucking take your mask away. </joey>
<garnt> - I just feel like what I've
realized going back home </garnt>
<connor> at least in England, it
became very political. </connor>
<joey> It's like as, you know,
as everything does, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like we got
sheltered from that in Japan, </joey>
<joey> because everyone here wears their masks. </joey>
<joey> And everyone here wore a mask before COVID </joey>
<joey> and that's why it was like super easy </joey>
<joey> to just integrate that into society. </joey>
<joey> Whereas like people just don't like </joey>
<joey> being told what to do in England </joey>
<joey> and America as well. </joey>
<joey> It was something where </joey>
<joey> just doing this one thing, </joey>
<joey> like wearing a mask, </joey>
<garnt> in the environment you
are making a statement </garnt>
<joey> or a stance or a choice </joey>
<joey> that was conscious, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> I just never really thought
about it that deeply. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get that, but it's like, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why that is subject </joey>
<joey> to ridicule or criticism, right? </joey>
<joey> It's not like your doing something bad </joey>
<joey> by protecting yourself. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It was weird. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd get it if it was
the other way around. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, this was
the way I looked at it, </joey>
<joey> it was not even a political stance. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, I just wanna wear it </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I wanna wear it, fuck off. </garnt>
<joey> - If I was wearing a hat, </joey>
<joey> would you tell me I can't wear a hat? </joey>
<connor> - Take it off. </connor>
<connor> What are you hiding? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm bald head, bro, leave me alone. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like me before going to England, </joey>
<joey> I'd never really thought
about it that deeply. </joey>
<garnt> I think I've thought about </garnt>
<garnt> the difference between chicken
breasts and chicken thighs </garnt>
<garnt> more deeply than wearing a mask. </garnt>
<joey> - You should have just turned
around to the guy and be like, </joey>
<connor> "It ain't that deep bro. </connor>
<joey> I'm just wearing a mask, get off my back." </joey>
<joey> - I was just like, "No." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Leave me alone." </joey>
<connor> What the fuck are we gonna do? </connor>
<connor> - Rip the mask off of you. </connor>
<garnt> - I was just like, Oh, my
God, I couldn't believe that, </garnt>
<connor> I was just like, "Fuck off!" </connor>
<connor> - Jesus!
- One positive thing </connor>
<connor> that I think changed about England though, </connor>
<connor> since I've been back is, </connor>
<connor> ever since the pandemic, </connor>
<connor> a lot of big establishments now </connor>
<connor> have made it possible for you </connor>
<connor> to just order your food via QR codes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that was-
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> Great! </connor>
<connor> We're getting to the
Japanese way of things now, </connor>
<garnt> less human interaction. </garnt>
<connor> Brilliant, I love it.
- Although, I was at Nando's. </connor>
<garnt> I had to pause that
just for dramatic value. </garnt>
<garnt> I was at Nando's, </garnt>
<connor> And I was trying to order my meal </connor>
<connor> and I was in a kind of a rush as well. </connor>
<connor> So I didn't have much time </connor>
<connor> and I thought it'll be easier on the app. </connor>
<connor> It turns out this specific
Nando's restaurant </connor>
<connor> just didn't have good cell phone service </connor>
<connor> and they didn't have free Wi-Fi. </connor>
<connor> So I was like fighting for my life, </connor>
<connor> trying to order this fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> And every single time
I got to one webpage, </connor>
<connor> it just could not get to the next one. </connor>
<connor> It was like, I had to keep resetting, </connor>
<connor> spent about 20 minutes
trying to order this meal, </connor>
<connor> but I only had 10 minutes to eat. </connor>
<connor> And then eventually went up to the counter </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Give me this." </connor>
<connor> And they got my fucking order wrong. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - He just couldn't get a dog. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Oh my God, man." </joey>
<connor> I'm fighting out here
just to get some Nando's. </connor>
<connor> And it was terrible. </connor>
<joey> I mean, it didn't taste good either. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - The specific Nando's did not taste good. </connor>
<connor> And I was like,
- What did you order? </connor>
<garnt> - I ordered a butterfly chicken burger. </garnt>
<garnt> - You mean the chicken breast burger? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, chicken breast.
- Don't. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Just don't. </garnt>
<connor> Just don't. </connor>
<connor> - I had great Nando's when I was there. </connor>
<garnt> I fucking miss that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The chips were kind of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> The coleslaw was not as
good as I remembered. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know if my tastes are-
- Maybe Nando's </connor>
<joey> isn't just as good as you remember. </joey>
<joey> - Or maybe that Nando's specifically. </joey>
<joey> I need to try more Nando's. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I had KFC and that was fantastic. </connor>
<garnt> I had UK KFC was so good. </garnt>
<connor> - UK KFC is good.
- I miss that so much. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll tell you the second
biggest thing I noticed, </garnt>
<garnt> which was, I really, really miss </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese food service. </garnt>
<connor> It's-
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So many times I'd go to restaurants </connor>
<garnt> and like half the tables
still had the shit </garnt>
<garnt> from the previous customers on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh yeah, </garnt>
<joey> that isn't a thing in Japan, </joey>
<joey> that shit's gone immediately. </joey>
<joey> They won't even let you in the restaurant. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, sometimes
they'll take the plate away </joey>
<joey> while you're still at the table. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I think, after being there </garnt>
<garnt> for like two weeks or something, </garnt>
<garnt> you you've had like all the food </garnt>
<garnt> that you missed from being in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And then after that </garnt>
<garnt> you go back to your usual eating routine </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Man." </garnt>
<garnt> You forget how good Japanese food is, </garnt>
<garnt> and Japanese restaurants in general, </garnt>
<garnt> because, you order anything here, </garnt>
<garnt> even if it's off E-breeze </garnt>
<connor> or you go to random restaurant, </connor>
<connor> it is really good food standards. </connor>
<connor> And I'd just forgotten </connor>
<connor> how many British establishments, </connor>
<connor> were just really, really mediocre. </connor>
<connor> And after the novelty wears out of, </connor>
<connor> yes, I'm having all of these things </connor>
<connor> that I've missed being out of the UK, </connor>
<connor> after that wears off, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Damn, Japanese food is just better." </connor>
<connor> It's just so, so much better. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, I've really felt that </connor>
<garnt> in my last week in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> where I just missed having good food </garnt>
<garnt> on the daily. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Did you have any Japanese food </joey>
<garnt> while you were around? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, I didn't have any Japanese food. </connor>
<connor> - Some of my friends wanted to </connor>
<joey> and I looked at them like, </joey>
<connor> "No, we're not having Japanese food." </connor>
<joey> - It's like the first time I went to LA </joey>
<connor> and they took me to Little Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Fucking kidding me?" </connor>
<connor> I came from big Tokyo motherfucker. </connor>
<joey> - It's like that episode of Simpsons </joey>
<joey> when they go to Japan and
they go to America town, </joey>
<garnt> and it's just like, "No, no, come on." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, cause like what
I didn't understand, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just realized this is, </connor>
<connor> the UK is also an island
nation like Japan, </connor>
<connor> but Japan has really
spoiled me with good seafood </connor>
<connor> and fresh seafood </connor>
<joey> that you can find everywhere basically. </joey>
<joey> And just like getting
good seafood in the UK </joey>
<joey> is so fucking difficult. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know why it is,
'cause we're an island nation </joey>
<connor> that is smaller than Japan. </connor>
<connor> Our coastlines should be easier to get to. </connor>
<connor> Why is it so hard?
- Less distance to travel. </connor>
<connor> - Why is it so hard to find good seafood </connor>
<garnt> that is not just fish and chips? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I did have a good lobster, actually. </connor>
<connor> - You did?
- Yeah, it was good. </connor>
<joey> - But how much did you pay for it? </joey>
<connor> - You don't wanna know. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's probably like, if you
want good seafood in UK, </connor>
<connor> you probably have to pay
arduous amount of money for it. </connor>
<garnt> - You do, you do.
- It was like a seafood pasta. </garnt>
<joey> And I was really craving lobster. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, we don't
really get lobster in Japan. </joey>
<connor> And I really wanted like a creamy- </connor>
<garnt> - Do we get lobster in the UK? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - If you can pay for it.
- It's quite expensive. </connor>
<connor> Feel like most frozen canned stuff. </connor>
<connor> And it was really good. </connor>
<joey> It was probably the most I'd spent </joey>
<connor> on a single dish in the UK. </connor>
<connor> It was something ridiculous,
like $30, $40 or something. </connor>
<connor> But man, was the lobster was good. </connor>
<connor> It was so worth it.
- Worth? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone said while
having something like that, </joey>
<joey> like treating yourself to
something kind of that expensive, </joey>
<joey> it's very nice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah , yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely something
I felt so guilty for </joey>
<joey> when I was looking at the bill, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "I literally had a pasta." </connor>
<connor> I'm like filing a mortgage. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Holy shit!" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I did something similar in Hawaii. </connor>
<connor> I had a $55 pasta. </connor>
<connor> - Once in a while, </connor>
<joey> you gotta treat yourself. </joey>
<joey> - But again, it was another seafood pasta. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what is best seafood pasta. </joey>
<joey> But it was like the entire
cost of a little mermaid </joey>
<joey> on this fucking pasta. </joey>
<joey> There was so much seafood on it. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, now I can see why $55." </joey>
<joey> I'll never do that again. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how Australia is, </joey>
<connor> but I noticed that the
fancy restaurants in Japan </connor>
<garnt> are cheaper than the fancy
restaurants in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - By far.
- By a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause in Japan, you
can go to a restaurant, </garnt>
<garnt> and you can buy a bottle of wine. </garnt>
<garnt> And even though it's
obviously more expensive </garnt>
<garnt> than it would be buying it wholesale, </garnt>
<garnt> it's still not that bad. </garnt>
<garnt> If we went out together, </garnt>
<garnt> we could split a bottle of wine </garnt>
<garnt> and it comes to like 20 bucks each, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I noticed wine in
the UK was way cheaper, </garnt>
<connor> which is why-
- Really? </connor>
<garnt> Someplace I went to, </garnt>
<connor> like the lowest price
bottles are like $150, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I want wine." </connor>
<joey> - What kinda bougie
ass place do you go to? </joey>
<connor> - Not even like that bougie places. </connor>
<garnt> - But the wine was bougie? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't
know, maybe I should. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck me for trying to eat good. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember going
to Tesco's and Co-op </garnt>
<connor> to buy some wine and I
recognize some of the wine </connor>
<connor> that was available there. </connor>
<joey> There were like premium
wines here in Japan though, </joey>
<joey> that is like 20 bucks plus, </joey>
<joey> you can get a five or a
seven quid in like Tesco's. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I think that's just because </joey>
<joey> Japan isn't really a wine drinker. </joey>
<joey> - That's exactly it. </joey>
<joey> And for the most part, </joey>
<connor> when I noticed wines that were available, </connor>
<connor> you can get wines for
like a much cheaper price </connor>
<connor> 'cause if you're drinking wine in Japan, </connor>
<connor> you're eating good, </connor>
<connor> you're drinking good. </connor>
<garnt> - This was the hard part, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to have the good, </garnt>
<joey> the wine that was way cheaper and nice, </joey>
<joey> but I also wanted to drink all the beer. </joey>
<joey> So I had to like, </joey>
<joey> it was very hard </joey>
<joey> having to decide.
- You can't do both. </joey>
<joey> - You can't mix and match, </joey>
<joey> otherwise you'll end up in a, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be in a coma the next day. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I had a drink the next day. </connor>
<connor> So I had to make sure that
I was in peak condition </connor>
<garnt> at all times. </garnt>
<connor> - That was the biggest
thing that I forgot about, </connor>
<connor> which was tactically
choosing how much you drink </connor>
<joey> so you can survive </joey>
<joey> and drink the next day as well. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> We sound like such alcoholics. </connor>
<joey> - I miss having like nice... </joey>
<garnt> You can get IPA's and
stuff like that in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I love like the craft beer in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> it's really nice.
- I miss having good ciders </garnt>
<garnt> Ciders was like the biggest thing there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lagers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lagers, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I just missed that. </joey>
<joey> I drunk a lot. </joey>
<joey> I had Tesco meal deal as well. </joey>
<joey> - How was it? </joey>
<connor> Was it good?
- It was amazing. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "All of
this for three pounds?" </connor>
<connor> Get out of here. </connor>
<connor> - He says after having his lobster pasta, </connor>
<connor> he goes straight to Tesco. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, I bought that lobster pasta </garnt>
<garnt> for like $30, $40, I don't
remember how much it was. </garnt>
<garnt> And it still didn't make me as happy </garnt>
<garnt> as that three pounds meal deal. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was better. </garnt>
<connor> It honestly, a part of it tasted better. </connor>
<connor> I was like, 'Oh my God, I
get an innocent smoothie. </connor>
<connor> It's like a three pounds smoothie </connor>
<connor> in this three pound meal deal, </connor>
<connor> they're practically giving it away. </connor>
<garnt> - I was happy going back to Nando's. </garnt>
<connor> That was like the biggest, </connor>
<connor> I'm home now. </connor>
<connor> I am now home. </connor>
<garnt> - I ate at Subway as well. </garnt>
<garnt> That was nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, Subway. </garnt>
<garnt> I've forgotten how good
Subway was outside of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Because Subway in Japan,
if you guys don't know, </garnt>
<connor> you can't toast the sandwich, </connor>
<connor> you can't pick your bread.
- No. </connor>
<connor> There's like two choices
of bread, I think. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is the point </connor>
<connor> if you can't pick your bread </connor>
<connor> and choose to toast it? </connor>
<connor> I was so shocked </connor>
<connor> when you couldn't toast
your sandwich in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> You what? </garnt>
<joey> That's like the best part of any sandwich, </joey>
<connor> I don't even like Subway that much. </connor>
<joey> - That's literally the
drawing point of Subway. </joey>
<joey> - We can like Uber eat Subway here. </joey>
<garnt> And sometimes when these
two don't wanna choose, </garnt>
<joey> they order a Subway, </joey>
<connor> and I'm just like, no. </connor>
<garnt> If I'm not having my subway
toasted, it is not a Subway. </garnt>
<connor> - I had a lot of fast
food, a lot of fast food </connor>
<garnt> and I'm surprised I'm not
obese by the time I came back </garnt>
<connor> with the amount I drank and ate. </connor>
<garnt> - Every time I saw you in the holiday, </garnt>
<garnt> I think you had a bag of crisps in hand. </garnt>
<connor> - I went to town on Christmas.
- I think you were more crisp </connor>
<connor> than manner at a point.
- I was. </connor>
<connor> There was like one day
where we were hanging out </connor>
<connor> and there was just no food in this Airbnb, </connor>
<garnt> but there was like family packs of crisps. </garnt>
<connor> So I ate like 20 packs of crisps. </connor>
<garnt> - I think your dinner
that day was like a hotdog </garnt>
<connor> and like five packs of Doritos. </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't five, it was like eight. </connor>
<joey> - Eating like a true gamer. </joey>
<joey> - I literally went full gamer
mode and ate only chips, </joey>
<connor> crisps, I should say, before
British people kill me. </connor>
<connor> - I almost said chips as well,
which is why like I paused. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wait. </connor>
<joey> - I'm used to saying it for the Americans, </joey>
<joey> - The chips. </joey>
<connor> - The Americans watching. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, no, it was fun. </joey>
<joey> I had a great time. </joey>
<joey> I got to see all the
friends I wanted to see. </joey>
<joey> - That's good. </joey>
<garnt> - A lot of things really worked out nicely </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I was asking people
like last minute to hang out </connor>
<garnt> and luckily everyone was able to. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I had enough rest
days, well, towards the end </garnt>
<garnt> because, my God, my body was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I need to not touch alcohol
for like a month after this, </garnt>
<garnt> which is great, 'cause we've
had quarantined since then. </garnt>
<joey> - Tell us about the hotel experience. </joey>
<joey> That's what I wanna know. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, no, no. </joey>
<connor> This experience doesn't
start from the hotel. </connor>
<connor> It starts from the point
where we get off the plane. </connor>
<connor> - It starts before that. </connor>
<connor> It starts before we've
left the fucking country. </connor>
<garnt> It's already like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, me and Connor had two
very different experiences </garnt>
<garnt> leaving the country and
getting back in the country. </garnt>
<connor> - So, I mean, how should we do this? </connor>
<connor> How should we split this up? </connor>
<connor> I have to go section
by section (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> So first of all, the most annoying part </connor>
<connor> which is to get even on the plane, </connor>
<connor> you need a negative COVID test form. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, I am making a video
about my quarantine hotel, </garnt>
<garnt> things in-depth, stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're interested by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'll give you the... </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna talk more about it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I didn't wanna bog down that video. </garnt>
<garnt> We are just complaining for nine hours. </garnt>
<garnt> So we are gonna complain
on Trash Taste right now. </garnt>
<garnt> So this whole thing is confusing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So normally, if you want a negative test, </garnt>
<garnt> most test providers would give you a form, </garnt>
<garnt> say, "Hey, you're negative. </garnt>
<joey> Take this." </joey>
<joey> And then everyone will
accept it, normally. </joey>
<joey> Problem is, Japan doesn't work like that. </joey>
<joey> Japan just decided, we've gotta do things </joey>
<joey> a little bit different. </joey>
<joey> - We doing it our way. </joey>
<garnt> - It's literally our way or the highway. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, "how about
we just give you a form </connor>
<connor> that you need to fill
out the very specific way </connor>
<connor> that we want it filled out." </connor>
<connor> And this just sends fear
down, anyone who knows Japan, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you know they're not playing games. </connor>
<connor> I have heard that some
airlines will let you on </connor>
<connor> with the negative test, and
you don't need that one, </connor>
<connor> but why would you risk it? </connor>
<connor> So, I was shitting
myself, 'cause I was like, </connor>
<joey> "How the fuck do I fill out this form?" </joey>
<joey> So this form needs to be
signed and stamped by a doctor. </joey>
<joey> It can't be a nurse,
it has to be a doctor. </joey>
<joey> The test can be administered by a nurse, </joey>
<joey> but it has to be signed
and stamped by a doctor. </joey>
<connor> So, the most testing
facilities don't have a doctor </connor>
<connor> who's gonna stamp or sign it for you. </connor>
<connor> So then now, you have to find a place </connor>
<connor> that has a doctor that will stamp it. </connor>
<connor> Turns out like none of these test centers </connor>
<connor> have doctors that are willing </connor>
<connor> to sign or stamp things for you. </connor>
<connor> So I managed to find, </connor>
<connor> I found after I basically... </connor>
<garnt> I went to the UK government
website and got the email </garnt>
<garnt> of every single test
provider they recognize </garnt>
<garnt> and sent out a mass email to all of them. </garnt>
<garnt> This was a big mistake, </garnt>
<garnt> because then what ended up happening was, </garnt>
<garnt> it was one thread. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - They were all replying to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a blank carbon copies, </garnt>
<garnt> they weren't replying each other. </garnt>
<connor> But for me it was one thread. </connor>
<connor> So I sent this email off
and within about 10 minutes, </connor>
<connor> I realized the mistake that I'd made, </connor>
<connor> because I had 15 replies in one thread </connor>
<connor> and I couldn't keep track. </connor>
<joey> - So, you basically opened a forum post? </joey>
<joey> - I basically opened a forum
post directly to the person. </joey>
<joey> And so, I got like 50
responses in the first day </joey>
<connor> that all be like, "This is okay." </connor>
<connor> But then some of them were like, </connor>
<connor> "Yes, this is totally fine." </connor>
<connor> But they didn't say yes to everything. </connor>
<connor> So I had to then call
up places that said yes, </connor>
<connor> and I walked them through it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Are
you sure this is okay?" </connor>
<connor> And one of them was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, that's no problem. </connor>
<connor> We've done it all the time. </connor>
<connor> We've had people go to Japan all the time </connor>
<joey> from our facility." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Great, okay." </joey>
<joey> So I booked on with them </joey>
<joey> 150 pounds, it's like $200, right? </joey>
<joey> But, I know Japan. </joey>
<joey> I know that I should have
a backup, just in case, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I don't fucking trust... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you have to get it 72 hours before. </garnt>
<garnt> So if I this up, I'm panicking
to try and find something. </garnt>
<connor> So I booked two. </connor>
<connor> I booked another test,
but this place said, </connor>
<connor> "Book a test with us, and then
when you get your results, </connor>
<connor> three hours later, take those results </connor>
<connor> and book a doctor appointment
and then get the doctor </connor>
<connor> to sign and stamp it all." </connor>
<connor> So I did that too. </connor>
<connor> So I had that first. </connor>
<connor> So I went to this testing
facility at 8:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> they shoved a thing up my nose, I'm dying. </connor>
<connor> And then I get my results at
11:00 AM, and it's negative. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Great, great." </connor>
<connor> So then I go to the doctor, and perfect! </connor>
<connor> They sign it all, they stamp it all. </connor>
<connor> It was all super easy. </connor>
<connor> But I had to pay individually
for both of those things. </connor>
<connor> It was like 150 pounds for the test again, </connor>
<connor> or, no, 90 for that one, </connor>
<connor> and then 90 for the doctor's appointment. </connor>
<connor> So this is already like 400,
500 bucks, just on the test. </connor>
<garnt> - Not counting the amount
you have to pay for the test </garnt>
<connor> to get in the country as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you have to pay for like... </connor>
<connor> A lot of things people don't
consider is, I spend a lot. </connor>
<connor> We both spent a lot on
just tests, basically. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, we did so many tests. </connor>
<connor> - Because you got to obviously get tested </connor>
<joey> before you fly out of Japan to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - That was like 150 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - Which was another 150 bucks. </joey>
<connor> And then you have to pay for another test </connor>
<connor> when you land in the UK as well, </connor>
<connor> which is also about 100 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Lots of tests, so many god damn tests. </connor>
<connor> - If you're thinking traveling is just, </connor>
<garnt> you just have to consider
the cost of the airline, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not a thing anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Which also they've increased
the prices on the flights </connor>
<connor> that they know people are flying. </connor>
<connor> So, like the direct flight
from Japan to London, </connor>
<connor> it was very expensive compared
to what it normally would be. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, you also booked very late. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did book very late. </garnt>
<garnt> But even then, it was still
more expensive normally. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I got this paper and I was like, great. </garnt>
<garnt> I have this Japanese document
signed the way I think. </garnt>
<garnt> I sent a message to Raina Sculley, </garnt>
<garnt> who'd also done traveling abroad. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, I sent her a
picture of the signed document. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Does this look okay?" </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "Yeah, it looks great." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Okay, good." </connor>
<connor> But I had the next
appointment the next day </connor>
<connor> for the people who were like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, dude, it's all okay." </connor>
<connor> And I'll get it signed there and all that. </connor>
<connor> But to me it did make sense a little bit </connor>
<connor> because I was like, "How are
you gonna sign all this stuff </connor>
<connor> while I have to wait three
hours for the results?" </connor>
<connor> So I turn up to this test the next day, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'd already paid for it. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Fuck it,
I'll just get another test, </connor>
<connor> why not?" </connor>
<connor> I go there, and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so you need to fill out this form." </connor>
<connor> They're like, "No." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What do you mean?" </connor>
<connor> They're like, "No, we
don't fill out that form." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I called you up </connor>
<connor> and you said that you
could fill out this form." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "No, no,
no, no, no, we don't do that. </connor>
<connor> We will give you a phone." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, but that's
not good enough for Japan. </connor>
<joey> I told you this on the phone call </joey>
<joey> and you said it was no problem." </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "No,
we're not doing that." </joey>
<joey> - Did you not read the forum? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Did you not read the thread? </joey>
<joey> And so then, a woman
came out of the office </joey>
<joey> and she was like, "Oh
no, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> You're going to Japan?" </joey>
<joey> She's like, "Oh yeah, come
with me, come with me. </joey>
<joey> I got you, I got you." </joey>
<joey> And so I go there and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, so can you fill this out?" </joey>
<joey> She's like, "No, no,
I'm not gonna fill out.' </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Why aren't you gonna fill out?" </joey>
<joey> She's like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, because the form I'm gonna give you </connor>
<connor> is gonna be enough anyway. </connor>
<connor> It's gonna have your
passport information on it." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "All right." </connor>
<connor> But I already knowing that
I had the signed document, </connor>
<connor> put me at ease. </connor>
<connor> I probably would have
been very uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> if I was in that situation
and didn't have a backup. </connor>
<connor> And I'm glad I didn't,
because I got my test results </connor>
<connor> after filling out this form and doing... </connor>
<connor> They were like, "We
promise, it'll be fine. </connor>
<connor> We promise this form will be enough." </connor>
<connor> And so I'm like, "Okay, fine. </connor>
<connor> All right, fine." </connor>
<connor> So I get my results back later, </connor>
<connor> it's got even less information on it </connor>
<connor> and no stamp, no doctor's signature. </connor>
<connor> Then like the other test result I got </connor>
<connor> to take to the doctor, which
wasn't even the real one. </connor>
<connor> So they've given me
this piece of shit form, </connor>
<connor> and then I went to the website, </connor>
<connor> I should have done this before, </connor>
<connor> and the reviews were
terrible for this clinic. </connor>
<connor> And then I found out it was a clinic, </connor>
<connor> but it was like a weird
modern medicine-esque clinic. </connor>
<connor> But it was a legitimate COVID testing... </connor>
<joey> They were allowed to do it. </joey>
<garnt> - But not for official
documents, I'm guessing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so then I was like, "All right, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna see." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause now I have two forms. </connor>
<connor> When I go to the airport, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm gonna give
them the shit one first </connor>
<connor> and see if they accept it." </connor>
<connor> They probably thought I was
weird for doing this as well. </connor>
<connor> So I give them the form, </connor>
<connor> and then they looked really confused. </connor>
<connor> They looked really uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> and they brought like some staff over </connor>
<connor> and I knew they were
about to tell me like, </connor>
<connor> "You can't get on the flight with this." </connor>
<connor> And I was like... </connor>
<connor> And before they said anything to me, </connor>
<connor> I was like, 'By the way, I have
another form just in case." </connor>
<garnt> And they looked at me like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What do you mean?" </garnt>
<garnt> "Like I have like another test
with the form filled out." </garnt>
<joey> And they looked at me </joey>
<joey> like I was doing something really bizarre. </joey>
<joey> I imagined it would be. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Why
didn't you just give us?" </joey>
<joey> Because I paid 150 bucks for this, </joey>
<connor> I wanted to make sure
that it was bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> - This man limit-testing
the system right now. </garnt>
<joey> (group chattering)
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I wanted to see if I'd been ripped off. </connor>
<connor> And I realized now I played
paper please the other day, </connor>
<garnt> and I feel like, oh, this is
what I did in paper place. </garnt>
<garnt> Some people just wouldn't give
that passport or something. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Testing for bugs. </garnt>
<garnt> - They didn't tell me they
weren't gonna accept it, </garnt>
<garnt> but they were like bringing
managers over and stuff, </garnt>
<connor> after I handed them this form. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Let's not worry. </connor>
<garnt> Let's not kick me out. </garnt>
<garnt> Here's the real one. </garnt>
<connor> Here's the real one." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I talked
to like a few people </garnt>
<garnt> who had traveled to their
home country and back to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> before I even flew, </garnt>
<connor> and that's how I knew
about this quarantine hotel </connor>
<connor> that we were going to have to stay in. </connor>
<connor> And we'll get to that, but
every one of them told me, </connor>
<connor> "You need to get this form, </connor>
<connor> this form that the Japanese
government gIve you, signed. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't matter what any clinic says, </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter what they promise, </connor>
<connor> if you don't have this form, </connor>
<joey> you're not gonna guaranteed
to get back here." </joey>
<joey> And so you have to look
for a specific clinic </joey>
<joey> that can fill out this
exact form with a doctor, </joey>
<joey> which is a lot harder to find </joey>
<joey> than you originally think it is. </joey>
<joey> There's a big difference </joey>
<joey> between getting a positive COVID test, </joey>
<joey> which is all you need to get out of Japan, </joey>
<joey> but getting back into Japan, </joey>
<connor> you need to have this exact form </connor>
<connor> in order to get back in Japan. </connor>
<connor> And luckily, Connor went
a few days before me, </connor>
<joey> so I had like my own clinic booked. </joey>
<joey> And hearing about his second experience, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Yeah, I'm just
gonna go for the proven way. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, let Connor be my beta tester." </garnt>
<connor> - It was just like, it was so stressful. </connor>
<joey> I was just trying to get a
goddamn piece of paper signed </joey>
<joey> and it was like impossible, </joey>
<joey> but luckily, I managed to do it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how it would be in the US, </joey>
<joey> I just know that getting
doctor appointments in the UK </joey>
<joey> is quite difficult unless
you're spending money, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of money. </joey>
<joey> So, and again, it's kind of
come under a lot of criticism, </joey>
<joey> rightfully so, 'cause traveling, </joey>
<connor> even though it's a luxury in general, </connor>
<connor> but they've made it ridiculously
expensive to travel. </connor>
<garnt> I probably spent like 600, 500
bucks on COVID tests alone, </garnt>
<garnt> which I'm lucky enough to
be able to afford that, </garnt>
<connor> but it's pretty fucked
that it's that much. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's weird. </connor>
<connor> It's annoying. </connor>
<connor> So then yeah, got on the plane </connor>
<connor> and then it almost felt too easy, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I got through check-in
and it was super easy. </garnt>
<garnt> Was it easy for you as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It was very easy-
- Show them the paper, </garnt>
<connor> they were like, "Yeah, have fun." </connor>
<garnt> - Once you show the paper,
which was the same for me, </garnt>
<connor> like going out of the country,
once you show the paper </connor>
<connor> and everything's accepted, </connor>
<connor> then it's the most stress-less experience </connor>
<connor> I've had in an airport,
because it's fucking empty, </connor>
<connor> 'cause no one's traveling. </connor>
<connor> So you're like, no queue
for security or anything, </connor>
<connor> you just walked straight in, </connor>
<connor> and it's just a breeze. </connor>
<connor> Like after everything got accepted, </connor>
<garnt> I've never had a more pleasant
experience in an airport. </garnt>
<garnt> And I never thought we'd
get a good experience </garnt>
<garnt> in an airport, until now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was really chill. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a great time at the airport. </garnt>
<connor> I was charging my devices. </connor>
<connor> In my terminal, I think I
counted, there was like 20 people </connor>
<connor> in the whole waiting area. </connor>
<connor> - Wow! </connor>
<connor> - For like the whole thing. </connor>
<connor> So you had your whole section to yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then it came to
coming back into the Japan, </garnt>
<connor> and we always obviously
talked about the documents. </connor>
<connor> That was just the start of the process. </connor>
<connor> Because you get off the plane, </connor>
<connor> and obviously you have to
present the same documents </connor>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And they put you in this
queue of just checkpoints. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] It was like eight checkpoints, </connor>
<joey> that's before immigration. </joey>
<joey> So you do eight checkpoints
before you can even </joey>
<connor> get to what is normally the annoying part. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And you kind of like, you go in </connor>
<connor> and they present you these documents, </connor>
<joey> and then they give you a tag, </joey>
<joey> that you have to put over
your hand to identify you. </joey>
<connor> - It's like a fucking slaughterhouse. </connor>
<joey> - That is exactly it. </joey>
<joey> So you're literally like being
cattle, being herded through. </joey>
<connor> - It's how they know you're
going to the quarantine hotel. </connor>
<connor> They put this large thing
on your hand like this. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] They literally tag you. </garnt>
<connor> - I took it off for a second
and someone shouted at me, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I wanted to get my
coat off and I took it off </joey>
<joey> and they were like, two men came over, </joey>
<joey> shouting and panicking at me, </joey>
<connor> pointing at it to put it back on. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What the fuck man? </connor>
<connor> Give me a fucking second. </connor>
<garnt> - So, they give you about
17 million documents, </garnt>
<connor> that they will check
across like this journey </connor>
<connor> that you take. </connor>
<connor> And the thing is like,
you present this document, </connor>
<connor> they check it, great, go
to the next checkpoint. </connor>
<connor> Then also the same
document, and they check it, </connor>
<connor> you go to the next point. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason, </connor>
<connor> these few documents that you have, </connor>
<connor> get checked a total about like five times, </connor>
<connor> by different checkpoints,
even though nothing changed </connor>
<garnt> between you walking
from point A to point B. </garnt>
<connor> - There's like eight stops. </connor>
<connor> So the first stop is they... </connor>
<connor> So this is also a thing, right? </connor>
<connor> No one told me this. </connor>
<joey> You have to keep your boarding card. </joey>
<joey> Normally on airplanes, </joey>
<joey> I just like... </joey>
<joey> Fuck it, the moment I'm on the plane, </joey>
<joey> I just put the boarding card in my pocket, </joey>
<garnt> scrupled up or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you don't it need
any more, you're on the plane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah you do, the luggage tags. </garnt>
<garnt> What do you do with the luggage tags? </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause that's normally on your card. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<connor> They normally put that on
your passport or something. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But the luggage tags... </connor>
<connor> I know my bag, I've never had to use it. </connor>
<joey> - I always hold onto them
until I'm out at the airport. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, the luggage tags, I keep. </connor>
<connor> But normally the boarding card, </connor>
<joey> I would just scruple it
in my pocket or something. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - No one told me you needed it, </joey>
<joey> because you never need it at an airport. </joey>
<joey> - I just hold onto it just in case. </joey>
<joey> - Just in case. </joey>
<joey> - I don't throw it away. </joey>
<joey> I'm not like on the plane,
fucking tearing it up, </joey>
<joey> but I don't think about it much. </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of just like whatever,
but yeah, you needed it. </joey>
<garnt> So when you get off the plane, </garnt>
<garnt> they ask for like your passport, </garnt>
<garnt> your boarding pass and the documents. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, I printed off all the documents </garnt>
<garnt> that the Japanese
government told me to have. </garnt>
<garnt> Turns out that some of them, </garnt>
<garnt> they just give you on the plane anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I didn't need to print them out. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't even end up using my version. </garnt>
<joey> I used the ones that
they printed out for me, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was like smaller, </joey>
<joey> and the one I printed out
was A4 and it was like a... </joey>
<joey> I don't really understand. </joey>
<joey> So, you have these two documents. </joey>
<joey> One of them is a declaration
saying that you're a good boy </joey>
<joey> and you won't leave your house </joey>
<joey> and you won't break quarantine rules. </joey>
<joey> And if you do, they'll deport you. </joey>
<joey> - Not ominous at all? </joey>
<joey> - And if you're a Japanese national, </joey>
<joey> I think they will do criminal
charges or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how much
they're enforcing it. </joey>
<connor> And another one was, </connor>
<connor> you have to circle the countries </connor>
<connor> you've been in the past 14 days, </connor>
<connor> and then just sign your name and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then they always check this </connor>
<connor> and they put a lot of your
information on the sheet. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't realize what sheet
was gonna be important. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I didn't either. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, yeah, the first check
is they check those documents </garnt>
<connor> and the next one is the wellness check, </connor>
<connor> where they take your temperature
and then you have to do </connor>
<connor> a COVID test immediately at the airport. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Like a PCR test, not
like antigen tests as well. </garnt>
<connor> So the difference between a PCR test is </connor>
<joey> you have to take your spit, </joey>
<joey> whereas with an antigen test, </joey>
<joey> I think you can-
- Shove the thing </joey>
<connor> in your nose. </connor>
<connor> - They shove the thing in your nose. </connor>
<connor> And it's like an instant, </connor>
<connor> almost an instant response
for the antigen test. </connor>
<connor> With the PCR, takes like an hour or two. </connor>
<connor> - You need a centrifuge for it. </connor>
<joey> - [Director] It's the other way around. </joey>
<joey> The PCR test is the one up your nose, </joey>
<joey> I think the antigen test is the one. </joey>
<garnt> - I think you can, I mean, I took both. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Director] PCR test is the
one that takes the most... </garnt>
<joey> - All I know is that they
put it in a centrifuge. </joey>
<joey> That's the hard part. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why they can do it fast. </joey>
<joey> So you get asked, "Oh, you feeling okay?" </joey>
<joey> They check your temperature. </joey>
<joey> Again, I don't know what happens </joey>
<joey> if you have a high temperature. </joey>
<joey> I assume they just like put you down. </joey>
<joey> Like they just like shoot you
on the spot, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Grab the pillow and, silencer Pa! Pa! </joey>
<joey> - I imagine something like
Oompa-Loompas come out </joey>
<garnt> and just take you away. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what happens. </garnt>
<joey> - So, you get melted into the chair. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Because it's so fucking scary. </joey>
<garnt> You are literally treated like cattle. </garnt>
<garnt> Anytime I asked anyone questions, </garnt>
<connor> I got looked at like a fucking weirdo. </connor>
<connor> - Why is this cow taking? </connor>
<joey> - Before we go on to, and
I'll explain more of the flow. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, okay, I'll do it after. </joey>
<joey> So, you go to the wellness check </joey>
<connor> and then you have to do
a COVID test immediately. </connor>
<connor> Problem is, I was really dehydrated </connor>
<connor> and I needed to start spitting. </connor>
<connor> And I couldn't spit anything,
I was just spitting air. </connor>
<connor> And on the wall, they had
pictures of plums and lemons </connor>
<connor> to help you get some saliva.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "This is not helping!" </connor>
<joey> - Why did they not just
give you a plum or a lemon? </joey>
<garnt> - Because you're not meant to </garnt>
<joey> eat or drink anything before you do it, </joey>
<garnt> because that will dilute the result. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you do that. </garnt>
<connor> Someone takes your test, </connor>
<connor> they will look at you
like you're the devil. </connor>
<joey> - But the thing is, you're in a room, </joey>
<connor> where you're just full of
a bunch of people spitting. </connor>
<connor> - It's really fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> - And they're spitting in this container, </connor>
<joey> it's not really like the nicest thing </joey>
<connor> to watch people spitting into this glass </connor>
<connor> or in this container. </connor>
<joey> And Sydney had like... </joey>
<joey> Sydney, after being on this
flight for like 12 hours, </joey>
<connor> felt a bit queasy. </connor>
<connor> I could just hear her in
the container next to me, </connor>
<connor> because she was feeling queasy
before she had to do it. </connor>
<garnt> And her seeing people spitting
around, she was just like. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And I felt so bad, it smelt so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Because yeah, you do feel a bit
sick seeing a stranger spit. </garnt>
<connor> - It's fucking weird,
it's really fucking weird. </connor>
<joey> - It sounds so post-apocalyptic. </joey>
<connor> - You do the spitting thing,
you give it to someone, </connor>
<connor> they check the documents that you have, </connor>
<connor> the right COVID barcode on your thing, </connor>
<connor> and then you go to a place </connor>
<connor> where they make you give your email </connor>
<connor> and then they send you an email </connor>
<garnt> and then make sure you got it. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's okay, that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they make you install these apps. </garnt>
<garnt> I had pre-installed them. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I had a problem. </garnt>
<garnt> This app was so fucking junk, </garnt>
<garnt> when I selected my birth date as July, </garnt>
<garnt> it would randomly just go back to June. </garnt>
<garnt> - That happened to me too. </garnt>
<joey> - Did it happen to you as well? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I had to re-install </joey>
<joey> the whole app, and the internet was shit, </joey>
<joey> and it wasn't installing for some reason. </joey>
<connor> And they came over and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, here's a pocket Wi-Fi." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No, I've got 4G, it's fine." </connor>
<connor> I don't know this app is just dog shit. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's going on. </connor>
<connor> It didn't install. </connor>
<connor> And it's this really fucking weird thing </connor>
<garnt> that's watching you fill
out this app as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "It's all right, man. </garnt>
<connor> You can go and get help someone else. </connor>
<connor> I'm all right, I can do this. </connor>
<connor> Apparently the first time,
but I can fill it out." </connor>
<connor> And they make make sure that
your Google Maps thing is on. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Yeah, it's on already. </connor>
<connor> It's always on." </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Can we check?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "All right, sure." </connor>
<connor> So I showed them and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, good, good, nice, nice, nice." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh yeah." </connor>
<connor> And then once I got that installed, </connor>
<joey> you go to the waiting area to
get your COVID test results. </joey>
<joey> - Which takes a couple of hours, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Mine took 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> How long did yours take? </joey>
<garnt> - Waiting, mine took about an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Mine took about 30 minutes, </connor>
<connor> and then you get put into
the bus waiting area, </connor>
<joey> and that was a long time. </joey>
<joey> I waited like an hour-
- To be shipped off </joey>
<joey> to the butchers. </joey>
<joey> - It's weird, 'cause they've laid you out, </joey>
<joey> like you're sitting on a bus. </joey>
<garnt> Did they do that for you as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- There like in a corner, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're all sitting
like you are on a bus. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a dress rehearsal. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like what they do on school trips. </joey>
<garnt> - That's exactly it. </garnt>
<joey> Where you have this teacher,
who leads you onto the buses </joey>
<garnt> and you have to sit in the
exact same way you sat down </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "What is this?" </garnt>
<connor> - And then, you know, once
you've got all that then... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so this whole process
is just part of like </connor>
<connor> three hours. </connor>
<connor> And then you can go through immigration, </connor>
<connor> which takes a while again. </connor>
<connor> But luckily, 'cause there's
no people traveling, </connor>
<connor> it's a little quicker. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it does just takes time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, if you fly back into Japan </garnt>
<garnt> at the moment, regardless of how quickly </garnt>
<garnt> or how many people are flying in with you, </garnt>
<joey> you're gonna be in the airport for around </joey>
<joey> three to four hours-
- I was there for five. </joey>
<joey> - Before you can get to immigration, </joey>
<joey> before you can even get your bags. </joey>
<joey> Because I was there wondering, </joey>
<connor> "Am I even gonna get my bags today? </connor>
<connor> What's happening with that?" </connor>
<connor> So basically, after your 12 hour journey, </connor>
<connor> which is what we had,
12, 13 hours on a plane, </connor>
<connor> you have to withdraw the four hours, </connor>
<connor> in an airport being herded, </connor>
<connor> through this system, </connor>
<connor> which kind of felt like
this dystopian society </connor>
<connor> where you were just treated like cattle, </connor>
<connor> like a piece of meat being herded through. </connor>
<garnt> You are there to be processed. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird man, 'cause
I don't know what happens </connor>
<connor> if you just don't follow along. </connor>
<connor> It was just really weird and very strange. </connor>
<connor> You are treated almost like a disease </connor>
<connor> rather than a person, </connor>
<connor> which you know, </connor>
<joey> I don't give a shit about, it's whatever, </joey>
<joey> but it's just weird. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, waiting for my bags took so long. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause obviously when you
get your bags at the airport, </garnt>
<garnt> you can just go. </garnt>
<connor> Because we're all on the same bus, </connor>
<connor> all dirty travelers. </connor>
<connor> We have to all wait till
everybody's gone through </connor>
<connor> and everybody's got their bag. </connor>
<connor> And then you can start going
through the bag checking. </connor>
<joey> Once you've got your bag,
you still got to wait. </joey>
<joey> And then, I don't know
if this happened to you, </joey>
<joey> did they bring out like
search dogs and stuff? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And they checked everything. </joey>
<joey> - My God!
- And I was like, oh my... </joey>
<joey> Bro, I don't think the dog
can smell COVID, can it? </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "This is a joke." </joey>
<joey> And then they were like... </joey>
<joey> Did they interrogate you
about what you brought in? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - They were asking me like, </joey>
<joey> "Do you have any food?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I mean, I got some snacks." </joey>
<connor> And they're like, "What is it? </connor>
<connor> What is it? </connor>
<connor> What snacks?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Just like a nature bar." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Does it contain meat?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No, it's a fucking
nature bar, I don't know." </connor>
<connor> It was just weird. </connor>
<connor> They were like grilling me
about these cereal bars I had. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "It's
a fucking cereal bar! </connor>
<connor> What do you mean? </connor>
<joey> Look at it. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like typical
Australian customs to me. </joey>
<garnt> - When you illustrate
there, it makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, we finally got through it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was talking to
this old Japanese man, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he'd lived in the
UK for like 20 years, </garnt>
<connor> and he was just so funny. </connor>
<connor> He was just like, "I miss pub already. </connor>
<connor> I miss my friends. </connor>
<connor> I have good friends in pub." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, man, I love the pub too." </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Wait,
where are you going to? </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "Oh, I'm going to Kyushu." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "You're going to Kyushu? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause you can't, how
can you get to Kyushu?" </connor>
<connor> So he was quarantining
in Tokyo for two weeks </connor>
<connor> and then Kyushu. </connor>
<garnt> I was like fuck that
- Jesus, fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - This poor guy was like 70. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this guy was a 70
year old Japanese man, </connor>
<connor> they didn't even try and
make him wear a mask. </connor>
<connor> He just took it off and no
one told him to put it on. </connor>
<connor> But anyone else who even took
it off, they stopped them, </connor>
<connor> and they were like,
"Put your mask back on." </connor>
<connor> - What are you fucking playing,
Squid Game all of a sudden? </connor>
<joey> (group chattering)
(all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I immediately befriended the old guy. </garnt>
<connor> I would have won Squid Game. </connor>
<connor> We were just chatting the whole time, </connor>
<joey> but I was like, "Bro, I think
you should put your mask on." </joey>
<joey> I told him, "I think you
should put your mask on." </joey>
<joey> He's like, "They won't make me put it on." </joey>
<joey> He's like, "I'm too old,
they won't make me do it." </joey>
<joey> To be fair, they didn't make him do it. </joey>
<joey> I was really impressed. </joey>
<connor> He was that kind of amazing old man </connor>
<connor> that just did not give a fuck anymore. </connor>
<garnt> He's like, "I'm far too old to
give fucks about your rules." </garnt>
<garnt> Which I respect. </garnt>
<garnt> Also, I was like, "Bro,
they've got guns, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Put the mask on. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally Squid Game. </garnt>
<connor> They have guns bro." </connor>
<connor> I was trying to help him out here. </connor>
<connor> - My God! </connor>
<connor> - And we got through. </connor>
<connor> Of course this old man, </connor>
<joey> they didn't make him open
his bag or do anything. </joey>
<joey> And I'm next up, they made
me fucking open my bag, </joey>
<joey> I've got like three bags and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Uh, for fuck's sake!" </joey>
<joey> He was like, "Do you smoke cigarettes?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "No." </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "What about tobacco?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "No." </joey>
<joey> And then he was like, "Do you have any?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No. I just said, no" </joey>
<joey> - Can I have some? </joey>
<garnt> - I just wanna hit man, I
just wanna hit, give me a hit. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then after that, </garnt>
<garnt> after you finally get through all that, </garnt>
<joey> I'm assuming this is the same
for you, you get on the bus, </joey>
<joey> we get to wait 30 minutes
for it to fucking go. </joey>
<joey> And then, 'cause it was peak
traffic hours at this point, </joey>
<connor> it took an hour and a half
to get to the fucking hotel. </connor>
<connor> So not fun. </connor>
<connor> But where was your hotel? </connor>
<garnt> - I can't remember where my hotel was, </garnt>
<connor> but it was a different one. </connor>
<joey> - They blindfolded me in the bus. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, I got in the bus </joey>
<connor> and I just like fucking conked out. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> It was like Squid Game 'cause I was like. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it had the squid game music. </joey>
<garnt> - They didn't need to gas me. </garnt>
<connor> I fucking conked out myself. </connor>
<garnt> Like, Jesus, fuck.
- Woke up on a bunk bed. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - If they could have
gassed us, they would have. </connor>
<joey> - Congratulations, you're
here on quarantine day one. </joey>
<joey> - They took us- </joey>
<joey> - Only half of you will survive. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - They took us all the
way from Haneda Airport, </connor>
<joey> which is like very south
of Tokyo to Ryogoku. </joey>
<connor> - Ryogoku?
- Ryogoku. </connor>
<joey> - That's like an hour and a half away. </joey>
<connor> - It was like North Tokyo.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I've never been to Ryogoku before. </connor>
<connor> And it was literally, </connor>
<connor> we were staying right on
top of the Sumo stadium. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, mine was like 20
minutes away from the airport. </garnt>
<garnt> - Motherfucker! </garnt>
<connor> And so, yeah. </connor>
<connor> We'll get into how good
your treatment was, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> So, we get to this hotel
and I shit you not, </connor>
<connor> there is like 40 armed
guards at this hotel, </connor>
<connor> for like 20 of us. </connor>
<connor> It was ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - It's like literally Squid Game. </connor>
<connor> - It was literally like 40 armed guards. </connor>
<connor> And all they did is you
watch you get off this bus. </connor>
<connor> And they're watching you the whole time. </connor>
<connor> But again, presumably I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> like this seems excessive. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even think the prison system </joey>
<connor> has that many fucking guards. </connor>
<joey> - These hotels have been
completely converted </joey>
<joey> into COVID hotels. </joey>
<joey> They're closed to the public. </joey>
<connor> There's one right in Shinjuku Sanchome, </connor>
<connor> I walked past it, and I saw all the guards </connor>
<connor> and with all their face masks on. </connor>
<connor> And it was just weird. </connor>
<connor> You have to wait, again. </connor>
<connor> You have to wait for fuck's sake, </connor>
<connor> you have to wait another 30 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Finally you get to a table
where a woman talks to you. </connor>
<connor> And she was explaining what
you could and couldn't do, </connor>
<connor> but her English was really bad, </connor>
<connor> and obviously again, </connor>
<connor> I know this is my fault,
I don't speak Japanese, </connor>
<connor> but I asked her a question </connor>
<connor> and then she just got really like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> She like didn't understand that. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, maybe
I can ask someone else?" </connor>
<connor> And I felt really bad, but
then someone else came over </connor>
<connor> and who spoke perfect English. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "So come on, tell me what's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> What am I doing here, man?" </garnt>
<garnt> And also, this whole time,
during this whole thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I kept asking everyone at
every single checkpoint, </garnt>
<connor> "Do you know how many days
I'm spending in this hotel?" </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they said three days, right? </connor>
<connor> When does three days start? </connor>
<connor> When would you think it would start? </connor>
<joey> - Like the moment you
get to the hotel, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's day zero.
- That's day zero. </joey>
<joey> But, here's the thing.
- That's orientation. </joey>
<joey> - At every single checkpoint, </joey>
<joey> I asked people which day does it start? </joey>
<joey> And everyone said a different thing. </joey>
<joey> So, I didn't know how long
I'm staying in this hotel for </joey>
<connor> until I heard that thing where she says, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, you will get a test on this day, </connor>
<connor> and then if it's a
negative, you can leave." </connor>
<connor> That is when I found out how long </connor>
<connor> I'm staying in this hotel for. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, so, if you get a
negative test, you can leave. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, oh my God, it
was fucking terrible, </connor>
<connor> just getting there. </connor>
<connor> Not even to mention the hotel, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause what was your room like? </connor>
<connor> - So, it's a nice room. </connor>
<garnt> And like APA hotels-
- You stayed </garnt>
<garnt> in the APA hotel, right?
- Yeah, did you not? </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't stay in APA hotel. </garnt>
<connor> - APA hotel is a chain of business hotels. </connor>
<connor> Also very famous for having
a very funny book in them. </connor>
<connor> Have you heard of this book? </connor>
<connor> It's a revisionist book
of Japanese history, </connor>
<garnt> that is quite, </garnt>
<connor> what's the word? </connor>
<connor> Racist, that's the word. </connor>
<garnt> It was a really famous book </garnt>
<garnt> and it caused a lot of
controversy before the Olympics. </garnt>
<connor> Like the Chinese team
refused to stay in the hotel </connor>
<joey> because of this book. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah , I heard about that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause this book, it
would say that like things </connor>
<garnt> that Japan did never
happened and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of a somewhat
weird controversial, </garnt>
<garnt> and the owner is a controversial figure </garnt>
<garnt> of APA hotel, I think, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway, just a fun little history. </garnt>
<garnt> So this hotel, I had one of the rooms </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just a business hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> So you're not supposed
to be in there all day. </garnt>
<garnt> The idea is that you go, </garnt>
<garnt> you travel to like somewhere in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> you do your businesses in the
day and then you sleep there. </connor>
<connor> - It's just used to shower and sleep </connor>
<joey> - It's got everything you need. </joey>
<joey> - I've stayed in the APA hotel as well. </joey>
<joey> Probably like they're
all very similar style. </joey>
<joey> I remember like there's
only enough space in there, </joey>
<joey> for a bed. </joey>
<connor> And there's no room to walk at all. </connor>
<connor> It is very much like a prison cell. </connor>
<connor> Because you do have a
TV, but the TV is like, </connor>
<connor> you can probably kick the TV, </connor>
<connor> with how close it is to the bed, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like, it has like enough space </connor>
<garnt> to contain a human being in it. </garnt>
<connor> - And that's what it's designed for. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I'm 5'10, </garnt>
<joey> and my feet were just
at the end of the bed. </joey>
<joey> So if you were like
6'5, bro, you're fucked. </joey>
<joey> And I show it off in the
video a lot, that I filmed, </joey>
<joey> but you get this room, </joey>
<connor> and there's about two steps horizontally </connor>
<connor> and like two steps vertical
of walking the room. </connor>
<connor> So that's all the room you have. </connor>
<connor> You're not allowed to
leave the room, obviously. </connor>
<connor> And if you do try and leave the room, </connor>
<connor> there's an armed guard
outside who will shout at you </connor>
<connor> if you even opened your door </connor>
<connor> for longer than like five seconds. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I spoke to an
Irish guy who was there </connor>
<connor> and he said he wanted to get
some fresh air in his room </connor>
<connor> because you can't open the window. </connor>
<connor> You can't even crack it open. </connor>
<connor> The window doesn't open at all. </connor>
<connor> So if you want any fresh
air, like you can't. </connor>
<connor> So it's kind of, at
least by the second day, </connor>
<connor> my room started to smell not good. </connor>
<joey> And so I understand that he
wanted to leave his door open, </joey>
<joey> apparently like two guards came over </joey>
<joey> and like told him to close the door. </joey>
<joey> And if you do it again they'll like... </joey>
<joey> (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> - And then we never saw him again. </joey>
<connor> - And now, so you spend
three days in that, right? </connor>
<connor> If you get a negative
test, you get to leave. </connor>
<connor> The scary thing was,
is the moment I landed </connor>
<connor> and I got into my hotel, I got an email </connor>
<connor> from the Ministry of Health, </connor>
<connor> telling me that somebody on my flight </connor>
<garnt> tested positive for COVID.
- Oh shit! </garnt>
<garnt> - So if I got COVID, </garnt>
<garnt> I would have to stay in
that hotel for 14 days. </garnt>
<garnt> So I don't know when
they change your sheets </garnt>
<garnt> or do anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - They don't change your sheets. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I was accumulating a lot of trash, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, meals and stuff adds up, </connor>
<connor> and the bottles and stuff adds up. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, couldn't you get rid of that? </connor>
<connor> - No, only the meal, they
didn't collect bottles. </connor>
<garnt> They took yours? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God!
- We'll get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, the room itself is nice. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a good hotel except the pillow. </garnt>
<garnt> The pillow, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> This pillow is for sadists. </garnt>
<garnt> It's one of those
concaved-like medical pillows. </garnt>
<garnt> So your neck is like this, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's supposed to
stretch your neck out. </connor>
<connor> I do not wanna sleep on
that when I have jet lag </connor>
<connor> and I'm trying to just fight for my life </connor>
<connor> to get eight hours of sleep here. </connor>
<connor> And so I told Garnt, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Bring your own pillow
because this pillows suck!" </connor>
<connor> But you didn't have APA hotel, </connor>
<connor> so I guess you didn't need it. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, definitely the worst thing was </connor>
<connor> not being able to walk or have fresh air. </connor>
<joey> And I thought, "Okay,
at least even in prison, </joey>
<joey> they get one hour of outside time of day. </joey>
<joey> Can I have one hour of
outside time please? </joey>
<joey> I want some walking." </joey>
<joey> But it's only three days, so it's not bad. </joey>
<joey> It was shit, but it had to be done. </joey>
<joey> - And then the meals were crap, right? </joey>
<joey> You guys sent me pictures of the meals. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I posted one of them and I was like, </joey>
<connor> "This is the saddest breakfast ever." </connor>
<connor> And it caused a fucking
argument on Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> - You must have got canceled
on Twitter for that, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't you? </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone was like, people
like, man, Connor's privileges, </connor>
<connor> acting out so much... </connor>
<joey> - Didn't you say something
like, "I don't eat breakfast." </joey>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<connor> - I don't eat breakfast. </connor>
<connor> And this breakfast had like
French fries, slice tamps, </connor>
<connor> which is fine but... </connor>
<connor> There's single cheese
slices, sliced in half, </connor>
<connor> one small tomato, one piece of broccoli, </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) omelet, I still
didn't know what it was, </connor>
<connor> a really, really hard croissant bread roll </connor>
<connor> and cinnamon roll, </connor>
<connor> and three pieces of
macaronI for breakfast. </connor>
<joey> - I think in-flight meals
are better than that. </joey>
<connor> - Well, that's the thing
is that, people were like, </connor>
<connor> "This looks amazing." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Think about it. </connor>
<connor> This is breakfast. </connor>
<connor> I just want cornflakes or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't want this shit. </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> I don't want cold french fries. </connor>
<connor> That's another thing, all
of this stuff was very cold. </connor>
<garnt> - All the meals you get are cold. </garnt>
<connor> - Cold and they are-
- You don't have a microwave. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no way to heat it up. </garnt>
<garnt> It would've been nice to have a microwave </garnt>
<garnt> so I could heat them up. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause some of them are nice. </garnt>
<garnt> There was one where they
made jerk chicken rice. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was good. </garnt>
<garnt> But most of them were really
ice cold, not that good. </garnt>
<connor> But that one breakfast, oh my God, </connor>
<joey> that made me so depressed. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "This is it?" </joey>
<joey> - As if your situation
isn't already depressing. </joey>
<joey> - And everyone was like,
"You're so privileged Connor." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Look at it. </joey>
<joey> This is not a balanced
breakfast in any capacity. </joey>
<joey> No one should have cold
french fries for breakfast." </joey>
<connor> I was like, "What's wrong with you guys?" </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they were like, </connor>
<connor> "In my country, that would be amazing." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What country? </connor>
<connor> Tell me your country." </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Whenever I've been to countries </garnt>
<connor> that are not as wealthy
as other countries, </connor>
<garnt> they normally have the best breakfasts. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they're always home
cooked and they're amazing </garnt>
<joey> and they're like really
cheap, really filling. </joey>
<joey> I had Sri Lankan breakfast, </joey>
<joey> that shit was the best shit
I'd ever had for breakfast. </joey>
<joey> It was like a curry thing. </joey>
<joey> I would kill for that </joey>
<joey> over some shitty cornflakes or oatmeal. </joey>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> I got so annoyed about this whole thing. </joey>
<joey> And everyone who called me privileged. </joey>
<joey> - Well, it sounds like Garnt
had a much better time. </joey>
<joey> - So like I was prepared... </joey>
<joey> I was prepared for prison. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I talked to other
people who'd traveled before </connor>
<connor> and they had a very, very
similar experience to Connor, </connor>
<connor> where you did feel like you
were stuck in a prison cage, </connor>
<connor> and you couldn't leave your room. </connor>
<connor> I knew about the cold meals as well. </connor>
<connor> And like the one advice everyone gave me </connor>
<connor> before traveling was, pack snacks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I brought a lot of snacks. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I'd seen the meals. </connor>
<garnt> All I knew is that most
places had a kettle. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, "All right,
I know I'm gonna do." </garnt>
<garnt> I filled up an entire carry-on
case with just instant ramen. </garnt>
<joey> I posted a picture on my Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I saw that. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Why did you need twenty? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so before flying off, </joey>
<connor> I tell my mom, "Mom, I'm
probably gonna need snacks." </connor>
<connor> If anyone knows Asian moms, </connor>
<connor> they will over-pack food for shit. </connor>
<connor> And she's gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, here's what you
need for the quarantine. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you might need a bit
more of you're missing home, </connor>
<connor> and you want a bit more ramen, </connor>
<connor> but you know what, I've got a few spare, </connor>
<connor> why don't I pack that as
well in the suitcase?" </connor>
<connor> And I just see a fucking
mountain of instant ramen there. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "I can
survive nuclear winter now, man." </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking sorted. </connor>
<connor> Let alone for quarantine. </connor>
<connor> So I had like just a whole,
like a normal suitcase </connor>
<connor> and then just a carry-on </connor>
<connor> that was just full of food and snacks </connor>
<connor> prepared for this prison
experience I was gonna go through. </connor>
<connor> And so, I had exactly the
same experience with Connor, </connor>
<connor> going on the bus and everything. </connor>
<connor> Conked down on the bus and
woke up don't know where. </connor>
<connor> I was just like fucking Squid Game, like, </connor>
<connor> "Where am I? </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, okay, I'm ready. </connor>
<connor> I'm ready for the prison
experience to start." </connor>
<connor> So I get off, and first thing is that, </connor>
<connor> you get chauffeured in, </connor>
<connor> I didn't have any armed guards, </connor>
<garnt> just like a bunch of people
who worked at the hotel </garnt>
<connor> who are obviously like decked out. </connor>
<garnt> - There was no security? </garnt>
<connor> - There was security, </connor>
<connor> but they weren't armed. </connor>
<connor> They were just people. </connor>
<connor> It looked like they were just people </connor>
<garnt> who worked in the hotel, </garnt>
<garnt> just with a full like
hazmat suit on, basically. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's totally different. </connor>
<garnt> - So, here's a hack, </garnt>
<garnt> here's a life hack that I learned </garnt>
<connor> going through this process is, </connor>
<connor> if you're traveling with someone, </connor>
<connor> they will give you extra
privileges and extra rooms. </connor>
<connor> Because, Connor traveled by himself </connor>
<connor> and I was traveling with Sydney. </connor>
<connor> So, when they sat us down </connor>
<connor> and gave us the whole spiel of like </connor>
<connor> Oh, you can't do this,
you can't drink alcohol, </connor>
<connor> you can't leave your room,
can't open your window. </connor>
<connor> Yada, yada, yada. </connor>
<connor> And then I was just like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, I mean, me and Sydney are together, </connor>
<connor> can we get a bigger room please? </connor>
<garnt> Because, my God, your room
contains a double bed. </garnt>
<connor> - It was a semi-double.
- A semi-double. </connor>
<connor> - And that took up like the room. </connor>
<garnt> - That took up the room, so I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "There is no way I could
stay with another person </connor>
<connor> in that room." </connor>
<connor> So me and Sydney were deciding, </connor>
<connor> Should we just say we're separate </connor>
<connor> in case they do put us in the same room? </connor>
<connor> But I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Let's see what they say
if we say we're together." </connor>
<connor> And so I said, "Oh, I'm with Sydney. </connor>
<connor> Can we stay together, please?" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, we'll see what we can do." </connor>
<connor> And so they go off, </connor>
<connor> they talk to their supervisor
or something, they come back </connor>
<connor> and then they tell us, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I think we can get you a room </connor>
<joey> suited for two people." </joey>
<joey> At this point-
- The suite is open. </joey>
<joey> - At this point, I didn't
know what it meant. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like doubling down to be like, </joey>
<joey> is this room big enough for two people? </joey>
<joey> Because, if it is not big
enough for two people to stay in </joey>
<joey> for possibly two weeks, if
we test positive for COVID, </joey>
<joey> God forbid, </joey>
<joey> but if it is not big enough, </joey>
<joey> then we would rather have separate rooms. </joey>
<garnt> And then they go off. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like chatting
again to the supervisor </garnt>
<garnt> and then they come back and they go, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'm really sorry." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Okay, maybe
we do need to get two rooms." </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'm really sorry, </garnt>
<garnt> all the king size beds are gone. </garnt>
<garnt> This one only has a queen size bed." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> Bro, you getting a five star experience </connor>
<connor> and I'm out here fighting for my life. </connor>
<connor> - Did your quarantine in the Hilton? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm sorry, can you say that again?" </garnt>
<joey> And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, unfortunately all the
king size suites are gone, </joey>
<joey> so we're gonna have to
put you in the queen." </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry, the room
has only three jacuzzis. </joey>
<joey> - "The queen size suite,
are you okay with that?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yes." </joey>
<joey> I looked at a Sydney, </joey>
<joey> "Are you okay with that?" </joey>
<joey> And Sydney's like, "I think that's good. </joey>
<garnt> I think that's good." </garnt>
<garnt> And so, we get taken to our room. </garnt>
<garnt> Did anyone like take you to your room? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - We had like a guard behind us. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - He'll like smack your ass. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's like, "Don't
look behind or you die." </garnt>
<garnt> - So we had like four luggages with us, </garnt>
<garnt> like to two big luggages
and two carry-ons. </garnt>
<connor> And so we've been lugging them around </connor>
<connor> the fucking airports and
it's like heavy as fuck. </connor>
<connor> And so after they check
us in to our rooms, </connor>
<connor> we go pick up, they give
us our meal right away. </connor>
<connor> There's a table with all our meals. </connor>
<connor> We pick one up and then I
started putting the meal </connor>
<connor> on the suitcase, and
started lugging around </connor>
<connor> and someone goes, </connor>
<connor> "Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. </connor>
<garnt> Don't do that."
- What the fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I had like 10 bags, that
would have been nice. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, "Oh, what's going on?" </garnt>
<garnt> And then they called another person over. </garnt>
<joey> And then we have a luggage person </joey>
<joey> who puts mine and Sydney's
luggage on a trolley, </joey>
<joey> leads us to the lift, and they're like, </joey>
<joey> "What room were you checking into? </joey>
<joey> Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> It's a Room 301. </joey>
<joey> Okay, that's on the third floor." </joey>
<joey> So they take us in, he
takes us into the lift, </joey>
<joey> presses the button for us </joey>
<joey> and then it takes us out and he says, </joey>
<joey> "Have a good stay." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Have a good stay? </joey>
<joey> What's going on here?" </joey>
<joey> So we get up to the third
floor expecting me and Sydney </joey>
<joey> to have to take over from there, </joey>
<joey> there's someone waiting
for us on the third floor. </joey>
<joey> And then they take our luggage
out and leads us to our room. </joey>
<joey> And before they check us in, </joey>
<joey> once again, they explain
everything we can and can't do. </joey>
<joey> And so this is like the moment of truth. </joey>
<joey> This is where I find
out how big our room is. </joey>
<joey> And I'm preparing for the
worst because I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I'm not gonna be able to walk. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna be able to do anything. </joey>
<joey> - It's Japan sizes.
- It's Japan sizes. </joey>
<connor> We open the door and it's a fucking suite. </connor>
<connor> - Bear in mind, these hotels are free. </connor>
<connor> It's the government paying for them. </connor>
<garnt> - Like this is a hotel I would
stay in if I was on holiday. </garnt>
<garnt> We walk in and there's a
hallway that leads to our bed. </garnt>
<joey> So we walk in, me and
Sydney look at each other </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "The Gacha gods are on my side!" </joey>
<joey> - What is this, a Trash Taste special? </joey>
<joey> Why is he getting a dab
and you're getting the L? </joey>
<joey> - The Gacha gods fucking
smiled down on me. </joey>
<joey> And we walk in and there's a hallway </joey>
<connor> before we get to our room. </connor>
<connor> And then we have like
a decently sized bed. </connor>
<connor> It's a queen sized bed. </connor>
<connor> And then we have an office segment </connor>
<connor> with a big desk and a massive TV, </connor>
<garnt> that both me and Sydney can
use for desks to work in </garnt>
<garnt> if we really wanted to. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'It's gonna be a great holiday, Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> This will be a great fucking holiday." </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never thought
myself as a communist. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes I wonder if they have like-- </garnt>
<joey> - Are humans truly equal? </joey>
<connor> - So I remember... </connor>
<connor> - I was so pissed off when
he messaged me a picture </connor>
<connor> of his hotel room. </connor>
<connor> and I was like, I fucking hate you. </connor>
<connor> I hate you so much. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
after I checked in </garnt>
<garnt> Connor was just like,
how's your room, man? </garnt>
<garnt> It's shit, isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> It's shit, tell me it's
shit, tell me it's shit. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, please
tell me it's shit, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Please tell me you hate
your life right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Just tell me I'm not alone. </garnt>
<garnt> Then he sent me a picture </garnt>
<connor> and it was this fucking massive room. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't just tell him-- </garnt>
<connor> - This man could've ran laps in his room. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't just send him a picture, </garnt>
<garnt> I sent him like a video tour of our room. </garnt>
<garnt> The fact that I could send
like a video tour of our room. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - We live in a society. </garnt>
<connor> We live in a society. </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, we, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we had a lot of
the same experiences, </garnt>
<joey> but I mean, did you have a
laundry service in your hotel? </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck! </joey>
<connor> No, you didn't. </connor>
<joey> - No you fucking didn't. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck! </joey>
<joey> - So what we are allowed to do, </joey>
<joey> so we had a receptionist, right? </joey>
<joey> So when we walk into the room, </joey>
<joey> we notice that there's only
one pillow and we're like, </joey>
<connor> fuck, what do we do? </connor>
<connor> There's only one pillow,
we can't contact anyone. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, there there's this... </connor>
<connor> They gave us like a hotline </connor>
<connor> in case anyone developed
symptoms or anything like that, </connor>
<connor> that you can phone. </connor>
<connor> But then there's a small print that says, </connor>
<connor> you can phone this hotline
for any other requests </connor>
<connor> that you may need during
your stay as well. </connor>
<connor> And so we called them up
and they were just like, </connor>
<connor> oh, how is your condition? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Everything's fine. </connor>
<connor> There's only one pillow
in my room, unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> And there's two people staying here. </connor>
<connor> Could we get another pillow?" </connor>
<connor> And they were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, yeah, sure, don't worry about it. </connor>
<garnt> We'll have someone
deliver a pillow to you." </garnt>
<garnt> like normal hotel service. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, so we get another pillow, </garnt>
<connor> we start checking in, </connor>
<garnt> we start looking under the instructions </garnt>
<garnt> we see that we can order
things to our room. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we can order Amazon
and we can order deliveries, </garnt>
<garnt> to our room as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - They said I could do that, </garnt>
<connor> but they had like a
very weird list of stuff </connor>
<connor> you weren't allowed to order, </connor>
<connor> like burgers and pizza and chicken. </connor>
<joey> - Like food?
- Certain foods, </joey>
<joey> but it was really oddly written </joey>
<connor> that I didn't really understand it. </connor>
<connor> And you couldn't get certain
things like Amazon delivered. </connor>
<connor> They said that you couldn't. </connor>
<garnt> - So we actually were able
to get Amazon deliveries </garnt>
<garnt> to our room. </garnt>
<garnt> We couldn't get Uber Eats, </garnt>
<garnt> we couldn't get hot food. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like the only
thing that we couldn't get, </garnt>
<garnt> which was hot foods. </garnt>
<garnt> So we can get Amazon deliveries, </garnt>
<connor> we can get anything
that would help our stay </connor>
<connor> be more pleasant. </connor>
<connor> We had like a laundry service </connor>
<connor> where they would come
collect laundry at 7:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> And they would like
deliver it back to our room </connor>
<connor> in the evening.
- You can't make this shit up. </connor>
<connor> - We live in a society.
- It's so funny. </connor>
<garnt> - We had like a garbage service, </garnt>
<garnt> they would pick up the
garbage every morning. </garnt>
<joey> - I had my garbage in my room. </joey>
<joey> - We also had a masseuse, just like... </joey>
<joey> - Like they would give us
new garbage bags every day, </joey>
<connor> so we could fill it up. </connor>
<connor> And honestly, our food
aside from like being cold </connor>
<garnt> was pretty damn fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> We got like a pretty--
- Yeah, I saw your food, </garnt>
<connor> it looked way better than mine. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we got like a fucking
decent bento everyday. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of this shit was better than Matsiya. </garnt>
<garnt> What was like the water
situation in your place? </garnt>
<garnt> - So you can ask for
more bottles of water. </garnt>
<garnt> A unit got one bottle of
water with every meal. </garnt>
<connor> And I ran out 'cause I was a thirsty boy. </connor>
<connor> And I asked for more and they said, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, sure, we'll deliver it." </garnt>
<garnt> They never delivered it. </garnt>
<connor> They just didn't turn up. </connor>
<connor> - So when we went in... </connor>
<connor> Oh, sorry, I forgot to say, </connor>
<garnt> our place also had a minI fridge as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, mine did as well.
- Did yours as well? </connor>
<joey> - I think most hotels have minI fridges. </joey>
<joey> - It just like never got cold though. </joey>
<joey> It was just like--
- Just a container. </joey>
<joey> - They made it like less
than room temperature, </joey>
<joey> which I was like, I guess that's good. </joey>
<connor> But like, I mean, what am I gonna do, </connor>
<connor> call them and make them
replace the fridge? </connor>
<garnt> - So we realized water would
be a very important resource </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking survive as it is. </garnt>
<joey> They said you can use tap
water, but you know, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - It taste like shit in Japan.
- Yeah, it does. </joey>
<joey> So we go in and there
is two bottles of water, </joey>
<joey> which is standard, I guess,
for every hotel stay. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know that. </joey>
<connor> - You didn't?
- No. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so they gave us.. </connor>
<connor> They started off with two bottles of water </connor>
<joey> and then we opened the mini fridge </joey>
<joey> and it was a mini fridge
full of bottles of water. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck off.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Mine wasn't even on. </joey>
<joey> I had to turn it on. </joey>
<joey> - So at the start of our journey, </joey>
<joey> we had like eight bottles of
water, which is brilliant. </joey>
<joey> And every time they delivered meals, </joey>
<garnt> which was like three times a day, </garnt>
<garnt> which was like, they gave
us more food than I needed </garnt>
<garnt> because by the time... </garnt>
<garnt> I had the breakfast was massive </garnt>
<garnt> and by the time lunch
was being delivered-- </garnt>
<connor> - I often didn't eat breakfast </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just wasn't hungry at breakfast. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, by the time lunch was delivered, </garnt>
<garnt> I was still full from breakfast. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had a little bit of lunch. </garnt>
<joey> And then like, by the time dinner came, </joey>
<joey> I was eating like a king. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - This man, this man, this man. </joey>
<garnt> - It was a great experience. </garnt>
<joey> - The dichotomy that we faced, oh my gosh. </joey>
<joey> - This guy is literally
living like a English king </joey>
<connor> during the black plague. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this man is a plague- </connor>
<joey> - While the peasants are
dying from the black plague </joey>
<garnt> he's just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, there's too much
food here guys, fuck me" </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, you know
that scene in Goodfellas </garnt>
<connor> well the gangsters like go to jail, </connor>
<joey> but they're having-
- They're like champagne </joey>
<joey> - Like champagne and shit. </joey>
<joey> That's basically my
quarantine hotel experience. </joey>
<joey> I didn't wanna leave, honestly. </joey>
<joey> Me and Sydney woke up on the third day </joey>
<joey> and we're like, oh, do we have to go now? </joey>
<joey> Do we have to go back to our-- </joey>
<joey> - Can one of us just get COVID? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing)
Just so we stay here </joey>
<joey> for like two weeks or so. </joey>
<joey> - It was just a free vacation. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have enough to pay for it, </joey>
<joey> didn't have enough to pay for the meals. </joey>
<connor> It was a good meal everyday, </connor>
<connor> had a hotel service. </connor>
<connor> - While this man living in the slums. </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I got so depressed. </joey>
<garnt> Like on the second, third
day I was miserable. </garnt>
<garnt> What's it called? </garnt>
<garnt> Cabin fever, is that what it is? </garnt>
<joey> I couldn't even play games or watch shit, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was just so miserable. </joey>
<joey> - You were just like lying in bed? </joey>
<joey> - I was just like lying
there, checking Twitter </joey>
<joey> then just like, should I do something? </joey>
<joey> No, I'm too tired. </joey>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I can't fucking walk. </joey>
<joey> So I'm literally just
lying, sitting down all day. </joey>
<joey> - You're just bed-ridden. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it make you feel fucking awful </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, if it was terrible. </garnt>
<joey> I know I'm gonna sound
just like a little bitch, </joey>
<connor> and I'm sure everyone's gonna say that. </connor>
<joey> - I saw the photos, some
of the photos you sent. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd feel the same way. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one of those things where
when you see it and hear it </garnt>
<garnt> you're like doesn't sound too bad </garnt>
<connor> but then when you do it you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, shit this is really depressing." </connor>
<garnt> - Meanwhile me and Sydney
were just like playing games </garnt>
<garnt> on like the big screen
TV in the living room </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like it's fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like-- </joey>
<joey> - Let's pull out the PS5 we packed in. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't have a game console. </joey>
<joey> I tried playing some games on my laptop </joey>
<joey> but I immediately was like, </joey>
<joey> oh, this shit is not comfortable. </joey>
<connor> It's not comfortable doing this. </connor>
<connor> And the smell of my
room was so goddamn bad, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause all the food. </garnt>
<connor> It was like coagulating in the air </connor>
<connor> and my sweat. </connor>
<connor> - But then after reading a few more posts </connor>
<connor> and after like talking to various people </connor>
<garnt> I think your hotel quality experience </garnt>
<garnt> is literally down to chance. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah, 'cause there's three buses. </connor>
<connor> I noticed there's three bus lines </connor>
<connor> and they all take you
to a different hotel. </connor>
<connor> And whichever one you go to,
you get a different experience. </connor>
<garnt> - I think our hotel was
not just a business hotel </garnt>
<connor> it was actually like a four-star hotel, </connor>
<connor> where they put us in. </connor>
<connor> - Certainly sounds like it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, which I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> Gacha luck man, the Gacha
lords are on your side. </garnt>
<connor> - You know I will say, </connor>
<connor> this is kind of... </connor>
<connor> Don't make any more Squid
Game jokes but this is... </connor>
<connor> When I got on the bus that we all came on </connor>
<connor> there was like half the people on the bus, </connor>
<connor> which means that half of them got COVID. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - It was weird.
- First round elimination </joey>
<connor> - The Irish guy was there who I spoke to </connor>
<joey> and the old man was there. </joey>
<connor> So I was like... </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What's up guys? </joey>
<joey> (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> - So I saw that guy without his mask on </joey>
<connor> in front of like seven armed
guards, not giving a fuck, </connor>
<connor> and I was like damn man, I did it. </connor>
<garnt> - What day did you travel on? </garnt>
<garnt> - What date?
- What day? </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean like? </connor>
<connor> - Was it like a Saturday like a Friday? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know man, it was all the same, </connor>
<connor> it was all the same. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause what I will say is that </garnt>
<garnt> I traveled on like a weekday </garnt>
<garnt> so like not many people were traveling </garnt>
<garnt> so I feel like... </garnt>
<garnt> I was traveling on a, </garnt>
<connor> Friday maybe, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, Friday's like a peak time </garnt>
<garnt> for people who are traveling </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not sure you know,
I have to have a look. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause if you travel on the weekend </garnt>
<garnt> I think more people travel on the weekend </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like the
worst hotels are for like, </garnt>
<connor> when there are too many people traveling </connor>
<connor> that it kind of like bleeds out. </connor>
<connor> Because, I think we didn't
have too many buses. </connor>
<connor> Which is why like, I think
we had like one or two buses, </connor>
<connor> and they all went to the same place. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like once that hotel
started getting filled out, </connor>
<connor> I mean if you think about it, </connor>
<joey> why would you need to drive
one and a half hours... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we flew in through
Haneda which is like south. </joey>
<garnt> There's no reason to drive
to a hotel in the north. </garnt>
<connor> - Well they drove to the hotel </connor>
<garnt> and they drove us back to the airport. </garnt>
<garnt> And then when you get to the airport </garnt>
<garnt> you have to have a weird specific taxi. </garnt>
<joey> You can't get a normal taxi, </joey>
<joey> can't book a normal taxi, </joey>
<joey> it has to be a quarantine approved taxi. </joey>
<joey> And the problem is that </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what time we were leaving. </joey>
<joey> So what time I should I tell this taxi? </joey>
<joey> I couldn't figure it out. </joey>
<joey> So I didn't know. </joey>
<connor> So I had to guess and I
had to wait for two hours </connor>
<connor> at the Haneda. </connor>
<connor> But the thing was, right, </connor>
<connor> so this whole period has
just been in quarantine. </connor>
<connor> They drop you off at Haneda,
and they're like, fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> No one checks you. </garnt>
<garnt> No one makes sure and
everyone just went went off. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, where's everyone going? </garnt>
<garnt> Does everyone know where they're going? </garnt>
<garnt> I spoke to the Irish guy
who'd done it a few times </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, you can just chill
around the airport and wait." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, well I can just go to the cafe </connor>
<connor> and interact with people. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Yeah, if you want to." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that doesn't seem right. </connor>
<connor> I didn't, I just I stood
in like a corner waiting </connor>
<joey> far away from everyone, and I
was like don't come near me, </joey>
<joey> I'm sick. </joey>
<connor> But I mean, yeah, it was fucking weird </connor>
<connor> and it was-- </connor>
<joey> - You're literally like that dude </joey>
<joey> who's been in jail for most of their life </joey>
<joey> just trying to assimilate
back into society. </joey>
<connor> (group chattering) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah man, it was it was fucking weird </joey>
<joey> and not a very fun experience </joey>
<joey> and they've got rid of
it now, for UK travelers. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, really? </garnt>
<connor> - Have they got rid of it, have they? </connor>
<connor> - They probably will soon. </connor>
<connor> - They reduced the quarantine time. </connor>
<connor> Before we flew, </connor>
<joey> I mean before we flew off to England, </joey>
<joey> it was six days in quarantine hotel </joey>
<joey> and then they got halved to
three days in quarantine. </joey>
<connor> - Six days in a hotel, fuck! </connor>
<connor> - Why couldn't be six days?
- He would've been all right. </connor>
<joey> - I shiver at the thought of
spending another day there. </joey>
<joey> It was nerve wracking, 'cause
the day I had to do my test, </joey>
<joey> they called me up and they said, </joey>
<connor> "Hey, when you get your
results if they're negative </connor>
<connor> you have to leave the room right away. </connor>
<connor> So you have to pack just in
case that you're leaving. </connor>
<connor> - But I didn't know </connor>
<connor> 'cause someone on my
plane had been infected </connor>
<connor> there's a good chance
that I could have got it. </connor>
<joey> Luckily I didn't but
like they called me up, </joey>
<joey> they're like, "Your test
results are negative, </joey>
<joey> please leave the room
as soon as possible." </joey>
<joey> And like everyone's leaving. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, what the fuck,
I gotta get out of the room. </joey>
<joey> Which is weird, it was
really a shit experience, </joey>
<connor> don't recommend, IGN
is 10 out of 10 there. </connor>
<garnt> - I wouldn't recommend that experience, </garnt>
<connor> my experience wasn't that bad. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, you got a free suite hotel. </connor>
<connor> - I remember Connor like
messaging me every day </connor>
<connor> Connor was like trying to drag
something negative out of me, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> (group chattering) </connor>
<joey> And he's like tell me about,
Garnt, tell me about it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, honestly it's
just pretty good actually. </joey>
<joey> I'm having a good time. </joey>
<joey> He'd mention to me the
next day, me being like </joey>
<joey> maybe this this day will get to him, </joey>
<joey> this day will get to him. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure something
bad happened since then. </connor>
<joey> - I went on Twitter as
well the day I checked in </joey>
<connor> and a fucking video from
Zed, the musical artist. </connor>
<connor> This motherfucker had like
a penthouse suite somewhere, </connor>
<connor> like literally a penthouse suite. </connor>
<connor> - [Zed] A bedroom and an insane view. </connor>
<connor> Look at this, just crazy. </connor>
<connor> I'm ready for the
quarantine, let's get it. </connor>
<connor> - And bear in mind, </connor>
<connor> Japan isn't even giving out
visas right now to anyone, </connor>
<connor> but somehow he got in? </connor>
<joey> - He got a penthouse suite in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - In Japan and he got a
visa to get in, somehow, </connor>
<connor> because he's doing a concert. </connor>
<connor> And somehow they made an exception </connor>
<connor> and people were not happy </connor>
<connor> because there was tons of people
in the comments being like, </connor>
<joey> Zed, you know that students
haven't been able to enter Japan </joey>
<joey> in two years, what the fuck, </joey>
<joey> and he's off here showing his suite. </joey>
<garnt> And Zed didn't even have to
do a quarantine for two weeks, </garnt>
<garnt> only three days. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah so after the quarantine hotel </garnt>
<connor> you still have to quarantine at home </connor>
<connor> for two weeks.
- For 11 days. </connor>
<garnt> - For 11 days </garnt>
<joey> - There were people trying
to cancel you for privilege. </joey>
<joey> - I was like--
- That's real privilege there. </joey>
<connor> - I made a joke 'cause he gave a room tour </connor>
<connor> that was like two minutes long, </connor>
<connor> of like all the different rooms he had </connor>
<connor> and all the shit he'd been sent. </connor>
<connor> He'd been sent like
everything you'd ever need. </connor>
<connor> Someone sent him like a
gaming pc for his quarantine </connor>
<connor> and I was like this is fucking stupid. </connor>
<connor> This is the stupidest shit I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> And I made a parody video. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Hey guys this is my room tour </connor>
<joey> and I just turned the camera </joey>
<joey> and it's just like the room
and that's the whole room. </joey>
<garnt> And I was just joking. </garnt>
<connor> I was just joking about how like, </connor>
<connor> the difference compared to rooms. </connor>
<connor> And then people got
angry at me being like, </connor>
<connor> you should be happy that you
even were able to enter Japan. </connor>
<connor> You know people haven't
been able to enter Japan </connor>
<connor> for two years, the privilege your showing. </connor>
<connor> I'm like what the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> I was so annoyed. </joey>
<joey> - You just can't get a dove there. </joey>
<joey> - So I deleted the tweet, </joey>
<joey> I was getting pissed off with the replies. </joey>
<joey> I was like what the
fuck are these reply... </joey>
<joey> And they're like why are you blaming me? </joey>
<joey> Don't blame me for being
a resident in a country </joey>
<joey> and getting back in, </joey>
<joey> blame the country for
banning any form of visas, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck!
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - They were like taking it out on me, </joey>
<joey> I was getting so annoyed. </joey>
<connor> I was fuming, fuming. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, those people
couldn't fucking tweet </connor>
<connor> to the Japanese government, </connor>
<connor> so they had to go for the next best thing. </connor>
<joey> - They were like, </joey>
<joey> "You're so lucky that
you can re-enter Japan." </joey>
<connor> Like, I'm lucky that i
can re-enter the country </connor>
<connor> I fucking live in, what
the fuck do you mean? </connor>
<connor> Shut the fuck up.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like what? </connor>
<joey> This is absurd. </joey>
<garnt> Don't try and say that I'm lucky. </garnt>
<joey> - That is pretty unfair.
- We're all unlucky </joey>
<connor> that the government has
some shitty rules on this. </connor>
<connor> Like don't don't take
it out on each other. </connor>
<connor> That's why I got annoyed about it </connor>
<connor> 'cause people are attacking other people </connor>
<connor> who are able to get into the country </connor>
<connor> instead of, I don't
know, blaming the people </connor>
<connor> who are making the rules </connor>
<joey> and these arbitrary
rules between countries. </joey>
<joey> Like in America, some
states have to quarantine </joey>
<connor> but others don't. </connor>
<joey> And so there's this
whole weird thing where </joey>
<joey> it's like why, I mean it's
all one country, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, same with Australia as well, </joey>
<joey> like most of the states... </joey>
<joey> Like I mean, Australia had
that the fucking worst though. </joey>
<joey> Like, Victoria I think was in lock down </joey>
<joey> for 280 days in a row,
something like that. </joey>
<joey> Like, no interstate thing. </joey>
<joey> My sister was like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'm not allowed to
travel more than 10 kilometers </joey>
<joey> from my house, otherwise I get fined. </joey>
<connor> But like there's nothing stopping you </connor>
<connor> from just, if you live in like... </connor>
<joey> So one of the countries that
was banned was like Texas. </joey>
<joey> You could just fly--
- You mean state? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the state. </joey>
<joey> - The country of Texas. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> The state of Texas was like one country </joey>
<connor> that you'd have to quarantine
in, go to the hotel for. </connor>
<connor> But there were other states </connor>
<connor> that you didn't have
to go to the hotel for. </connor>
<connor> So like why wouldn't you just
drive over to the next state </connor>
<connor> and fly from there? </connor>
<joey> And just say that you've been there? </joey>
<joey> Because there's no way
they can validate that. </joey>
<joey> - They can check that, right? </joey>
<joey> - So to me it just felt
really like fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> But COVID has shown that </joey>
<joey> the rules are not to do
with what's practical, </joey>
<connor> it's political ties and all those things </connor>
<connor> if we've learned anything
and that's what is shitty, </connor>
<connor> is that it sometimes feels
like you're just caught up </connor>
<joey> in some international
bullshit politics of countries </joey>
<joey> that don't like each other </joey>
<joey> and countries that do like
each other and favoring. </joey>
<joey> I mean the UK did it a lot
too with countries as well. </joey>
<connor> They've been pretty bad for it. </connor>
<connor> It was just a mess and I
hated it and it's shit. </connor>
<joey> - Well at least you guys got to you know </joey>
<garnt> sit here with me.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You guys made it, you made it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean like for the longest time we were </joey>
<joey> like literally trapped in this country </joey>
<joey> because we couldn't fly
out for the longest time. </joey>
<connor> And it was only recently
that the rules got changed </connor>
<connor> that people who are already
residents can fly out </connor>
<connor> and then fly back in, you know. </connor>
<connor> And I mean now we're just
waiting for the actual </connor>
<connor> people who are waiting on visas </connor>
<connor> because I can only imagine
that, that does suck. </connor>
<connor> Because we were really lucky
to be able to get our visas </connor>
<joey> before all this happened </joey>
<joey> otherwise we would have literally, </joey>
<connor> Trash Taste would have never happened, </connor>
<connor> if we would had applied for our visas </connor>
<connor> literally a few months
after we got our visas. </connor>
<joey> We would still be waiting now </joey>
<garnt> to even get our visas to move to Japan. </garnt>
<connor> It's actually crazy to think about. </connor>
<connor> - And Japan faced a lot of criticism </connor>
<connor> when the coronavirus started </connor>
<connor> 'cause they banned... </connor>
<connor> Only Japanese nationals
were allowed back in. </connor>
<garnt> Which is like okay I
guess that makes sense </garnt>
<garnt> but then they also didn't
allow green card holders, </garnt>
<garnt> permanent residents,
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> If you're like me you're British </joey>
<joey> and you're married to a Japanese woman </joey>
<joey> and then you went and
then you came back in, </joey>
<joey> if I was married to Japanese person, </joey>
<joey> they'd be allowed in but
I wouldn't be allowed in. </joey>
<connor> That came under a shit ton of criticism, </connor>
<joey> rightfully so, </joey>
<joey> because if someone's a permanent
resident of your country </joey>
<joey> that's literally like
where their whole life is. </joey>
<joey> You can't just say like, no, but they did, </joey>
<joey> and they faced a lot of criticism, </joey>
<joey> which they did eventually change </joey>
<joey> but they've still been banning visas. </joey>
<garnt> And like I feel really fucking
sorry for these students </garnt>
<garnt> who've had their life on pause, </garnt>
<garnt> who had their whole
like basically two years </garnt>
<garnt> lined up in Japan,
they've just been banned </garnt>
<garnt> from entering Japan.
- They've just been waiting. </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't make sense to me </garnt>
<garnt> that they wouldn't allow some system </garnt>
<connor> even if it's complicated </connor>
<connor> and even if it's fucking
stupid and tedious </connor>
<connor> to get in if you're a student. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't understand </connor>
<connor> why they haven't changed the rule on that. </connor>
<connor> It's just Japan being Japan, you know. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's because Japan thinks that, </joey>
<joey> oh, the foreigners, </joey>
<joey> you're more likely to get
it if you're a foreigner, </joey>
<joey> which is just not true. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just one
of those things where, </connor>
<connor> you can go through enough precautions </connor>
<connor> and you can do enough tests </connor>
<connor> to make sure that 99% of
the time you'll get it, </connor>
<connor> so that it's good and it works, </connor>
<connor> but I don't know to me it just, </connor>
<connor> I can't fathom it why they've banned </connor>
<connor> issuing any visas at all. </connor>
<connor> It really doesn't make sense to me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know, it's dumb as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and after going through that </garnt>
<garnt> quarantine experience like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't believe anyone who's flying in </connor>
<connor> is spreading COVID. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> People, my God. </connor>
<connor> They have this shit on lockdown man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, yeah, there's like two tests </connor>
<garnt> when you get here and your test before. </garnt>
<connor> Obviously, somehow, someone
did get COVID on my flight </connor>
<joey> but that was caught </joey>
<joey> and then if you test
positive in the three days </joey>
<connor> you have to... </connor>
<connor> I understand it can still slip through </connor>
<connor> but also it feels like
such diminishing returns </connor>
<connor> at this point, to keep this rule in place. </connor>
<garnt> You know, I mean it's whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure everyone will have
a personal opinion about it </garnt>
<garnt> and that stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I understand allowing tourists in, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously I get that
this is like, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - There like different
levels, there's tourists </connor>
<connor> which is opening the floodgates </connor>
<connor> but then there's people
who are literally waiting </connor>
<garnt> on a working visa.
- It breaks my heart, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I really feel sorry for these people </garnt>
<connor> who had their life lined up to come here </connor>
<joey> and they've just been just
hanging around, waiting. </joey>
<joey> Really, I do feel so sorry for them. </joey>
<connor> It's so fucked, it's really fucked. </connor>
<joey> - Well, hopefully soon. </joey>
<joey> I mean the the cases are
going down a lot now. </joey>
<connor> - I saw an article today that was like, </connor>
<joey> 'Japan's drop in COVID
cases baffles experts.' </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> But also I heard that
Japan isn't testing as much </joey>
<connor> so I mean yeah yeah... </connor>
<connor> - But I mean it's also because like </connor>
<joey> most young people now are
finally fucking vaccinating. </joey>
<garnt> - Have we missed anything
since we've been gone? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean the country's
opened back up again. </joey>
<connor> I mean in terms of like
the the 'lock down.' </connor>
<connor> So beginning of October they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah so everything's just good now. </connor>
<connor> Everything's open, you can
drink alcohol if you want." </connor>
<connor> Everyone's like, "Are you sure?" </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you said that last time... </joey>
<connor> (group chattering) </connor>
<connor> We did that last time we
could only do it for a week </connor>
<garnt> before you shut that shit down again. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It was just like, the
floodgates were open, </joey>
<joey> everyone went out drinking </joey>
<garnt> and then a week later
everyone's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Well, that was a good time." </garnt>
<garnt> - Experts were like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah, that's a bad
idea, let's not do that." </joey>
<connor> - The Japanese government
managed to do something </connor>
<connor> that I think they've never done before, </connor>
<joey> test the patience of their population </joey>
<joey> and piss them off. </joey>
<joey> I've never seen people
get so actually angry </joey>
<joey> about shit in Japan. </joey>
<joey> It just doesn't happen, </joey>
<joey> but people actually
got so angry about them </joey>
<connor> keeping extending the lockdown </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because they're so
fucking wishy-washy as well. </joey>
<connor> They're like, "Oh, yeah, so
the cases are going down, </connor>
<connor> it's not zero, but it's going down </connor>
<connor> so maybe we can open it up again." </connor>
<connor> And then it goes back up and they're like, </connor>
<joey> Experts are baffled.
- Surprised Pikachu face. </joey>
<garnt> - Experts are baffled. </garnt>
<joey> How did this happen? </joey>
<joey> It was going down. </joey>
<joey> - And the Olympics just like blew it up. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God, just like I watched a video </joey>
<joey> about all the fuck ups of the
Olympics and it was insane. </joey>
<connor> Having it all in one video, </connor>
<connor> the sheer amount of people that got fired </connor>
<connor> off the Olympic committee is insane. </connor>
<connor> - It was like half of them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and then the amount
of controversy, it was insane. </joey>
<joey> I was like this is fucking terrible. </joey>
<joey> - It was so fucking weird.
- Oh, my God. </joey>
<connor> - I mean so far it seems
to be going all right. </connor>
<connor> I mean the other day I was at a park </connor>
<connor> and with some of my friends </connor>
<connor> and someone was like, </connor>
<connor> we should do a bold gamer move. </connor>
<joey> We should drink a beer in
this park, and I was like... </joey>
<joey> It felt like someone
just offered me cocaine. </joey>
<joey> I was like no no, </joey>
<joey> I don't think that's a good idea. </joey>
<joey> I think someone's watching,
this this doesn't feel right. </joey>
<connor> I did it, it was very liberating but... </connor>
<connor> - Fuck the police.
- Yeah, I was like </connor>
<joey> fuck the police, they can't stop us now. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I'm just waiting again for next week </joey>
<joey> for the government to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Changed our minds. </joey>
<joey> It's lock down again." </joey>
<garnt> - Well, the real question
is, is karaoke open? </garnt>
<joey> 'cause that's
- Is that true? </joey>
<joey> - Everything is open.
- That's how you know </joey>
<connor> lock down's actually ended. </connor>
<joey> Once the karaoke opens, </joey>
<joey> that's like the equivalent of when </joey>
<garnt> the British pubs were open. </garnt>
<joey> - So the karaokes are open, </joey>
<joey> restaurants now go past eight o'clock </joey>
<connor> you can order alcohol, </connor>
<connor> basically, everything's back to normal. </connor>
<connor> - Well, some of the
restaurants are still closed. </connor>
<joey> - Some restaurants. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's kind of confusing. </connor>
<joey> - Which is basically, </joey>
<joey> it's basically most restaurants. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause actually, the
day of filming this, </garnt>
<garnt> this is literally my first
day out of quarantine. </garnt>
<joey> So I've not been out to explore the town. </joey>
<joey> I've just been stuck in
my or stuck in my house. </joey>
<joey> - You sound like Andy Dufresne, </joey>
<connor> like my first day of freedom. </connor>
<connor> - How was your 11 days at your home? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Honestly I prefer like the three days </connor>
<garnt> in my quarantine hotel. </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking love my home. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, Oh my God, I
can walk, I have a space. </garnt>
<connor> - I can walk.
- I can walk around, </connor>
<connor> I can shit in a bathroom that
has a bidet that's usable. </connor>
<connor> - Your hotel... </connor>
<connor> - It had a bidet, but it was like so weak. </connor>
<connor> It was like a duck tickling my butt hole. </connor>
<connor> I wanted something to power
wash my cheeks, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - It was okay for like
a good five, six days </garnt>
<joey> and then like the second
half of the quarantine </joey>
<connor> it really starts to get to you, </connor>
<connor> where you're just in your house </connor>
<connor> and you're seeing everyone out </connor>
<connor> and you're seeing the
country be normal, I guess </connor>
<connor> and you just kind of... </connor>
<connor> Luckily i have Sydney so
I had her to interact with </connor>
<garnt> in case I was feeling too lonely. </garnt>
<garnt> If I was by myself--
- Oh, bro I loved it. </garnt>
<connor> I had a great time.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, dude.
- The dichotomy of man. </joey>
<joey> - I was like I was testing like
every single Uber Eats out, </joey>
<connor> I was loving it. </connor>
<connor> My new place, I really love </connor>
<connor> and I got to like kind of work on it a bit </connor>
<connor> and I didn't schedule anything. </connor>
<connor> So I just had like the full 11 days </connor>
<connor> to just kind of do what I want. </connor>
<connor> I played some games-- </connor>
<joey> - I mean you did that like
three, four days stream. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I did a 72-hour stream
- Oh, yeah, you did do that. </joey>
<joey> - And guys I didn't say
anything racist in my stream. </joey>
<connor> - That was good. </connor>
<connor> - Well we don't know, I muted my mic </connor>
<connor> so maybe I did.
(all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I saw a lot of mouth flaps, </joey>
<joey> couldn't make it out. </joey>
<joey> - Enhance, enhance, enhance. </joey>
<connor> - Expert lip readers.
- Lip readers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I did a 70 hour stream not 72 </connor>
<connor> because I had a Japanese
class so I had to end it. </connor>
<connor> But it did a 70-hour stream which was fun, </connor>
<connor> I had a really good time. </connor>
<connor> It was kind of last minute, </connor>
<connor> I was kind of like I'm
gonna do a 70-hour stream </connor>
<connor> and my mods were like, </connor>
<connor> "What? </connor>
<connor> You're gonna what? </connor>
<joey> No you can't do it, it's too soon." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "No, we're
doing it, we're doing it. </joey>
<joey> It's perfect time, I'm gonna do it." </joey>
<joey> - You were in quarantine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean you're stuck
at home, you might as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was good. </joey>
<joey> By the third day I was
getting quite tired. </joey>
<joey> I understand now why
Ludwig would watch clips </joey>
<garnt> for so long, because after a while </garnt>
<garnt> I just was like, can I
stop talking for a bit? </garnt>
<garnt> Like can I just stop? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm getting really tired. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was fun it was fun. </garnt>
<garnt> Sleeping on stream was not as difficult </garnt>
<garnt> as I thought it would be. </garnt>
<joey> I was generally just quite
tired from streaming all day. </joey>
<connor> I kind of just conked out. </connor>
<joey> - I tuned in right at the beginning </joey>
<connor> and then again right at the end </connor>
<joey> and it was like looking
at two different people. </joey>
<joey> I was like wait, is this the right link? </joey>
<joey> - I was starting to get
some really big eye bags </joey>
<joey> under my eyes.
- I could see that. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I think like I wasn't
sleeping like eight hours </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's very hard to,
'cause when you wake up </joey>
<connor> you wanna check, make
sure everything's okay, </connor>
<connor> is everything working? </connor>
<connor> And people could have had the
ability to fuck with my lights </connor>
<connor> the whole time. </connor>
<connor> So people were making my house
a rave while I was sleeping. </connor>
<connor> What's that fucking meme edit </connor>
<joey> where it's like the outside of the house </joey>
<joey> and you can hear the music inside </joey>
<joey> and the lights...
- Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was literally like that. </joey>
<joey> But I just played Trash
Taste episodes while I slept. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, wow.
- That was what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Easy content. </garnt>
<garnt> - Racking up those views, baby. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought right, when I was sleeping </joey>
<joey> I assumed, 'cause when I was streaming </joey>
<joey> I had about 10 to 14k viewers concurrent. </joey>
<connor> Which was more than I normally have, </connor>
<connor> I was very impressed. </connor>
<connor> I thought when I was sleeping
it would go down to like 1000. </connor>
<connor> Turns out there was like
7,000 people watching this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, I saw that. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like what the fuck. </connor>
<connor> What have you been doing? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I was like going through jet lag </connor>
<connor> and I'm like let's see
what Connor's up to. </connor>
<joey> He's like 7,000 people watching me sleep. </joey>
<joey> I was like fucking hell, man. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you did 7k normally. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - My normal streams get like that </joey>
<joey> and i was like why am I... </joey>
<joey> I'm getting more sleeping, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Are they like sleeping with you? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - It's like I'm sleeping next to Connor. </joey>
<joey> - You know what was weird, </joey>
<connor> waking up and seeing like
people had subscribed </connor>
<connor> like paid to sub to me
while I was sleeping. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, shit, I should just
sleep on stream all the time. </connor>
<connor> I get paid to sleep, fuck me. </connor>
<garnt> I'm kidding, it's weird though. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like why did
someone give me 50 subs </garnt>
<garnt> while I was sleeping. </garnt>
<connor> It's like 300 quid, more
than that I think actually. </connor>
<connor> It's a lot of money,
I'm like, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - That's like the most generous
tooth fairy in the world. </joey>
<joey> (group chattering)
(all laughing) </joey>
<connor> I was like what the fuck. </connor>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<connor> But it was weird and I'd
have like weird moments </connor>
<garnt> where I would wake up but
i don't remember waking up </garnt>
<garnt> and I would see clips of me waking up </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, I don't remember that. </connor>
<joey> - I saw a clip of you, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you
were half asleep or not, </joey>
<joey> but you just like flipped off the camera, </joey>
<joey> like halfway through your sleep. </joey>
<joey> - I was trying to sleep, right, </joey>
<connor> and then people just
went ham with my lights, </connor>
<joey> and they just started
changing it every second </joey>
<joey> and then I was just like, fuck you guys. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, it was fun though. </connor>
<connor> I really enjoyed it. </connor>
<connor> I didn't think it was
something I ever thought </connor>
<joey> I'd be interested in,
but I thought, fuck it, </joey>
<joey> I'll try it and I
obviously had a lot of fun. </joey>
<joey> I'd recommend you guys try it out. </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm good.
- I'm good, man. </joey>
<joey> - I like my privacy. </joey>
<connor> - I can barely stream as it is. </connor>
<garnt> - People always tell me, they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You guys should do a Trash Taste </garnt>
<connor> where you just take it in turns streaming </connor>
<connor> and then like... </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh it could work sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like
if we did it as a group </garnt>
<garnt> it would be easier, but
like by myself, fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - You do shifts. </connor>
<connor> Like we're together
sometimes but then shifts. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I've done long
streams with other people, </joey>
<connor> that go for like 15 to 20 hours. </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't do it by myself. </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't do it by myself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I didn't have like many guests come on, </connor>
<joey> I just had (indistinct) play
with me which was great. </joey>
<joey> It's fun when you have
someone else to talk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> It's like if you have
someone else to bounce off of </joey>
<joey> then you don't have to be like,
likely talking to a chair. </joey>
<connor> - Here's one of the reasons
why I decided to do it. </connor>
<garnt> So i had not been
streaming for like a month </garnt>
<garnt> before I left for the UK </garnt>
<garnt> and so I didn't stream for a month at all. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't stream for two months. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I have a second channel as well </garnt>
<joey> and we like ran out of videos. </joey>
<joey> We had like no more videos left. </joey>
<joey> And so, Mudan, my editor was like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, Connor, please, </joey>
<joey> please make like a shit ton of content </joey>
<joey> and I was like, all right I got you. </joey>
<joey> - 72 hours of story content. </joey>
<joey> - So the (indistinct) I
got like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> like 10 plus videos out of it. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like there you go Mudan. </joey>
<joey> Here you go. </joey>
<connor> He was very happy now. </connor>
<joey> He's like, "Great, now I
have more content to edit. </joey>
<joey> This is great this..."
- More money for me. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause we have a deal </joey>
<joey> where we split the money 50-50. </joey>
<joey> - That's why he was desperate, he's like, </joey>
<connor> "I need to get paid, man" </connor>
<connor> - Well, yeah, because the
channel has been doing great </connor>
<joey> so he's like come on Connor, </joey>
<joey> we've got to keep up the content. </joey>
<joey> - He's like whipping you for content. </joey>
<joey> - He's now the guy who's
like, come on, man, </joey>
<joey> I need content, start doing
something, Connor, film it. </joey>
<garnt> And he tells me, he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Play this game, it'll
be funny for a video." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's your content producer now? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a really good, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a really good balance </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we kind of started it together </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I didn't... </garnt>
<garnt> We were just like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I won't pay you for editing fees </garnt>
<garnt> but you get 50% of whatever it makes. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we thought we'd
be in the red for a while </garnt>
<garnt> or we thought he'd be
in the red for a while, </garnt>
<garnt> but luckily, yeah, it took off </garnt>
<garnt> and now it's doing really really well </garnt>
<garnt> and it's killing it </garnt>
<garnt> and some of the videos get like more views </garnt>
<garnt> than my videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw that. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of them got like two million views </garnt>
<joey> and I was like what the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> Should have put this on my
main channel, goddammit. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah, they're doing really well. </joey>
<connor> it's cool, it's weird, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean we also met
Mudan in the UK as well. </garnt>
<connor> I got to catch up with him, </connor>
<connor> somehow he found two
days out of his schedule </connor>
<garnt> to program himself out of editing and... </garnt>
<connor> - He flew all the way from
Estonia to come hang out with us. </connor>
<garnt> - My God, he is a machine. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize this... </garnt>
<connor> I didn't appreciate this until like </connor>
<connor> actually speaking to him in person. </connor>
<connor> - He's insane.
- Where he is insane. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen someone with
like a more strict work ethic </connor>
<joey> than he does.
- Oh, yeah, </joey>
<garnt> the man never quits. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm surprised he still has emotion. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you have to like
throw humanity away </joey>
<joey> to keep up with him. </joey>
<joey> - He edits videos in full time speed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know.
- He watches the video </joey>
<joey> in full time speed
- He told me that. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I don't think human
brain can comprehend that. </joey>
<connor> - I am convinced he's just
jacked into the matrix, </connor>
<connor> 'cause how do you edit
in four times speed? </connor>
<connor> Like you don't do that
with a mouse and keyboard, </connor>
<joey> you do that in like Ghost of the show. </joey>
<joey> You like jack yourself in
and like he edits the video </joey>
<garnt> in his mind, that's how I'm convinced-- </garnt>
<connor> - He's one with premiere pro. </connor>
<joey> - He does editing speed
runs on his Twitch channel </joey>
<joey> Like he edits like whole of
my videos in like four hours. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I remember talking to him </garnt>
<garnt> when we were catching up
because he was with us </garnt>
<garnt> and like with a bunch of our mates </garnt>
<garnt> as we were like all catching up </garnt>
<garnt> and I was talking to him and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh so you're editing for like
Trash Taste, our specials </garnt>
<connor> After Dark, Connor's channel,
Connor's second channel </connor>
<connor> and some of Joey's videos </connor>
<connor> and I've heard some of Aki's
videos in the past as well </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, are
you close to burnout </connor>
<connor> and he was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, Garnt, I'm looking for more work. </connor>
<connor> Do you have more work for me?" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> - [Man] So like, he was
on his holiday, right? </connor>
<connor> He was like, "It's all
right, I can connect to my PC </connor>
<connor> through my phone, and I
can edit this for you." </connor>
<joey> At the airport and I'm
like, "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> - He's never disconnected.
- He's never disconnected. </joey>
<connor> - And he never quits.
- And he was like, </connor>
<joey> "Garnt, have you ever thought about </joey>
<joey> starting a stream channel?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Mudan, how are
you looking for more work </joey>
<garnt> right now?"
- He told that to me as well. </garnt>
<joey> And he was like, </joey>
<joey> "I see you've been uploading
a lot on your second channel. </joey>
<joey> Do you want me to edit those?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "No, I'm good, I'm good. </joey>
<joey> Enjoy your life please." </joey>
<garnt> - I was just like flabbergasted
that this guy is still </garnt>
<garnt> looking for more work after
how many goddamn channels </garnt>
<garnt> he's already editing for. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like a content black hole. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he just keeps
ingesting, it's never enough. </garnt>
<joey> It's just like infinite. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, 'cause I asked him like, </joey>
<joey> "Mudan, what is your limit? </joey>
<connor> Have you ever limit tested yourself?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "No, I want
to know, give me more, </connor>
<joey> I'm nowhere near close to my limit now. </joey>
<joey> - He's got the limitless pill.
- And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck, man." </joey>
<garnt> What is this machine
that I'm talking to, man? </garnt>
<connor> - He's like tested every
productivity app out there </connor>
<connor> to like find which one is
like the most productive. </connor>
<connor> So that he knows how he can
maximize his productivity. </connor>
<connor> He's insane, he's just
like a different breed. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a fucking T-100. </garnt>
<joey> Skynet didn't send back a
foot fucking terminator, </joey>
<joey> they just sent back Mudan. </joey>
<joey> Like edit every video
on earth, on YouTube, </joey>
<garnt> and he won't stop until
he like monopolizes </garnt>
<garnt> the entirety of any tube basically. </garnt>
<joey> - I think if every person was like Mudan, </joey>
<joey> we'd be at like intergalactic
travel stages right now. </joey>
<joey> We'd be so advanced as a society. </joey>
<connor> - We have the dice and spear. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> We'd have had that by now. </connor>
<joey> - We'd be like a level two society, </joey>
<joey> just like controlling the solar system. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - I also feel like we'd be very dystopian. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know though. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it was fun. </connor>
<connor> The whole thing was fun, </connor>
<garnt> it was really nice
getting to speak to him, </garnt>
<connor> instead of asking him to do work, </connor>
<connor> ask him to have a beer. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Just hanging out and just
like having a beer with him </joey>
<garnt> in person that was very nice. </garnt>

<garnt> (Connor belching) </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sorry.
- I'm just trying to think </joey>
<connor> of what i did while you guys were gone. </connor>
<joey> - What did you do while we were gone? </joey>
<joey> What did you get up to?
- Yeah, what did you do? </joey>
<joey> - Ah, fuck, what did do? </joey>
<garnt> I saw my family here. </garnt>
<connor> First time in two years </connor>
<connor> 'cause like we all finally got vaccinated. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we all made a rule, </connor>
<connor> we were like we're not
gonna see each other </connor>
<joey> until we're all fully vaccinated. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause my cousin, like my younger cousin's </joey>
<connor> only like three years old or something. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, God forbid I
didn't wanna give him COVID, </connor>
<joey> or any my family. </joey>
<joey> So we finally got vaccinated. </joey>
<connor> It's so weird because the
last time I saw my cousin </connor>
<connor> he's five now and he was
like two last time I saw him. </connor>
<connor> So it's just weird I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm having a conversation with this kid. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's so crazy fast
how like kids grow up. </connor>
<garnt> It's just like, oh, it's a
completely different person now. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've reached that age now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> And like I had a lot
of friends living here </joey>
<garnt> from since I've known in
like high school and uni </garnt>
<garnt> who were like, "I haven't
seen you in a while. </garnt>
<connor> Once the country opens
up we should catch up. </connor>
<connor> But it has to be a weekend </connor>
<connor> 'cause I have to take
care of my two kids." </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, have we really
gotten to that stage now? </joey>
<joey> I've really gotten to that age 'cause like </joey>
<joey> it was just my birthday
like about a week ago. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, it's starting
to get to that point. </connor>
<garnt> I mean you can relate Garnt,
'cause you're older than me. </garnt>
<garnt> but like I feel it's around... </garnt>
<garnt> - You're a boomer.
- You're a boomer. </garnt>
<joey> - Thanks for singling
me out though, go on. </joey>
<garnt> - But like I feel I don't know, </garnt>
<joey> at least to me, like around 27 is, </joey>
<garnt> because I just turned 27, </garnt>
<joey> it starts to get to the point
where it's not so much like, </joey>
<joey> oh, yeah it's my birthday. </joey>
<joey> It's more like, oh, it's my birthday. </joey>
<connor> - I've been like that for a while. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Age 8 to 15. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's not like... </joey>
<connor> There's no like just that kind
of like childish excitement </connor>
<connor> of like getting older anymore. </connor>
<connor> It slowly starts to turn into that, </connor>
<joey> oh, God I'm getting older stage. </joey>
<connor> - Does that happen when you get 30, </connor>
<connor> is that when that happens? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, like for me--
- As the only 30 year old here </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - As the only 30 year old here. </connor>
<connor> I remember like it didn't
didn't really hit me </connor>
<connor> until I was 29, I guess. </connor>
<connor> And so like every year like we... </connor>
<connor> When I lived in England we
had like this massive party </connor>
<connor> where we get to catch up with
all of our friends in England. </connor>
<connor> So we have this party every year. </connor>
<connor> And I remember it truly hit me, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we were at this party, </connor>
<connor> and we're there for a few days </connor>
<connor> so I was having a shower in the morning </connor>
<joey> and then it kind of just hit me that </joey>
<joey> this is the last time I'm
gonna have this catch up </joey>
<joey> before I'm 30, in my 20s. </joey>
<joey> And then I just had this like </joey>
<joey> full-on fucking existential
crisis in the shower. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I take long showers, </garnt>
<garnt> I take long showers anyway </garnt>
<garnt> but like it was just me. </garnt>
<connor> - That day that was a long shower. </connor>
<garnt> - Even for me that was
a long fucking shower. </garnt>
<garnt> I think Sydney like thought
I got kidnapped or something. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was just standing there just like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I didn't know how to process that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I took like an hour-long shower, </garnt>
<garnt> and then-
- Fucking hell! </garnt>
<connor> - Well your hands must have been spongy. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, they were, they were. </garnt>
<connor> The whole body was spongy. </connor>
<garnt> And then like after that
shower I was completely fine. </garnt>
<connor> - It washed away, down the drain. </connor>
<joey> - I washed my sins away, </joey>
<garnt> I was ready for my 30s afterwards. </garnt>
<joey> - I also knew that I was
like getting to that point, </joey>
<connor> 'cause me and like a bunch of my friends </connor>
<connor> who were all vaccinated, so safe. </connor>
<joey> We rented out this like log cabin, </joey>
<joey> in like the mountains in Chiba. </joey>
<connor> And it was really nice 'cause you know, </connor>
<connor> I hadn't really had it like
a nightlife for about a month </connor>
<connor> since everything was like closed down. </connor>
<connor> It was like there's no point
going out to like restaurants </connor>
<joey> or anything like that at night. </joey>
<joey> So it was finally nice to actually get out </joey>
<joey> and change of environment stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> especially with your friends. </joey>
<joey> And I knew I was also
getting to that point </joey>
<joey> 'cause all I received was
some pieces of clothing, </joey>
<joey> two bottles of wine and
a bottle of whiskey. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing)
And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I'm getting to the point where, </joey>
<joey> I see a bottle of whiskey
and I'm like pog jamming. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Yoh!" </joey>
<connor> - I guess 'cause after a certain age </connor>
<joey> you normally have everything
you want, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Anything I'd want is like, yeah,
you wanna buy me a Porsche? </joey>
<connor> That's what I want. </connor>
<joey> - It's just like a gift that
a mate doesn't already have. </joey>
<joey> It's either like in an
acceptable price range </joey>
<joey> just doesn't really exist. </joey>
<joey> - It just gets bigger and bigger. </joey>
<joey> - It's either like you buy
them a new job or a new car </joey>
<joey> or a new house. </joey>
<joey> Well, what do you want, you know? </joey>
<joey> I can't really afford that. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, like I'd say another thing </joey>
<joey> that happened to me in the UK </joey>
<garnt> that you've just reminded me of is, </garnt>
<garnt> I went to the Tesco's
to get my bottle of wine </garnt>
<garnt> then they asked me how old I was. </garnt>
<connor> - I never get ID'd, ever. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) And then I was
just like, "Oh, I'm 20." </garnt>
<garnt> - No way.
(all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I had a moment like that too </connor>
<connor> and someone asked me how old I was, </connor>
<connor> like 23, oh, shit, 25. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I legitimately forgot at one point </joey>
<connor> how old I was turning. </connor>
<connor> I was like am I turning 27 or 28? </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I don't remember. </connor>
<joey> I had to like do math
in my head to figure out </joey>
<joey> how old I was. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd literally like forgotten
that I had turned 30, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like I had not been
asked for ID since I turned 30. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I... </garnt>
<connor> By muscle memory I just
started saying 20 something </connor>
<connor> and I had like this Darren Brown moment </connor>
<connor> where I just forgot the
number and I was like-- </connor>
<connor> - Vsource music plays.
- Oh no, I'm 32. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "Can we see some ID?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh my God,
I get to show my ID again." </garnt>
<connor> - I never get ID'd, I wish I got ID'd. </connor>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah, 'cause-- </joey>
<connor> - I never get ID'd here but... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've never gotten ID'd in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason I started
getting ID'd again </garnt>
<garnt> when I went back to the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I look older than
you sometimes, I think. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean sometimes? </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes, sometimes. </connor>
<joey> - I think most days.
- I think most people </joey>
<connor> who tune in to Trash
Taste for the first time, </connor>
<connor> is like wait, Garnt's the oldest one? </connor>
<joey> - Everyone always thinks
that I'm older than I am, </joey>
<joey> which is fair enough. </joey>
<joey> Just means-- </joey>
<joey> - And everyone thinks Garnt's like 23. </joey>
<joey> - Just 'cause I'm fucking
miserable, that's why. </joey>
<garnt> I'm always complaining. </garnt>
<joey> I can't wait till I'm 50, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna complain about everything. </joey>
<joey> - It's the beard man, it's the beard. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, you have a good beard too. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but the thing is if
I shave this off, I look 17. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I look like a child... </connor>
<connor> There's plenty of Trash Taste episodes </connor>
<connor> where I don't have a beard. </connor>
<connor> And I look at it and I'm like whoa. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's just like
you shave your beard </garnt>
<garnt> and instantly you just lose five years. </garnt>
<connor> - Like 10, I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe you 10. </garnt>
<connor> - I look like a 12 year
old when I have no beard. </connor>
<joey> - Whereas I feel if Garnt came
to a Trash Taste recording </joey>
<joey> with a beard like ours, he'd
look like a fucking like, </joey>
<joey> - I've had like a five
o'clock shadow before </joey>
<joey> and yeah I don't know how that looks. </joey>
<joey> I just don't like it
when my beard's too long. </joey>
<joey> - You just don't age, man. </joey>
<garnt> (group chattering) </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, you could kill it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can kill it. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I'll try it one day. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe my mid 30s is the time. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You could have grown
one while you were away </connor>
<joey> and then come back, full
beard, "What's up, guys?" </joey>
<connor> - I have assimilated.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Next time we have a break
when we don't record Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> I'll just let my beard grow
out and it'll just be like, </connor>
<joey> like the dichotomy of like
one Trash Taste episode </joey>
<joey> for the audience to be like- </joey>
<joey> - What happened during this week? </joey>
<joey> - Wow, Garnt really aged
during this week, didn't he? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt just like does some
Doctor Strange bullshit, </joey>
<garnt> or some nonsense or something
like that, oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like a beard
could weirdly suit you. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just not a big fan of
beards on me personally, </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I also like... </joey>
<connor> There's this like patch
where a beard like can't grow </connor>
<connor> on my on my chin as well, </connor>
<garnt> so I don't know how weird that
would look if I grow it out. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I have a bit
of patchwork as well </joey>
<joey> around the place- </joey>
<garnt> - Well, 'cause like the reason
I have this patch is because </garnt>
<connor> when I was a kid I got... </connor>
<connor> Well it's not that big
of an exciting story </connor>
<connor> but my chin got cut open </connor>
<connor> because I was on the playground, </connor>
<joey> hit a kid, fell on the floor and then my- </joey>
<connor> - Split the chin
- Oh, shit. </connor>
<connor> - Split my chin open. </connor>
<connor> And so once that got closed
up there's just this patch </connor>
<garnt> on my chin that just won't grow hair, </garnt>
<connor> so I've always found it like- </connor>
<garnt> - Just stick it, just stick something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just stick something (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Or just grow it out and
just like kind of bumble it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, braid it. </joey>
<connor> - Braid it into the middle
so it just comes down like. </connor>
<connor> - Why not, why not, why not,
you've gotta give it a try. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, I'll probably will one day. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if we
should get into anime. </connor>
<connor> I watched an anime. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I forgot we're an anime podcast. </joey>
<joey> What did you watch? </joey>
<joey> Squid game?
(all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I watched Squid Game AKA Kaiji. </connor>
<joey> - I watched High Rise Invasion. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is that?
- Exactly, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is that. </joey>
<joey> I watched High Rise Invasion on Netflix. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that a new-
- Is that an actual anime? </garnt>
<joey> - Look it up, google. </joey>
<joey> It's got a Japanese name. </joey>
<joey> - High Rise Invasion? </joey>
<connor> - [Man] There's a manga. </connor>
<connor> - What's the manga called in Japanese? </connor>
<connor> (man speaking in foreign language) </connor>
<garnt> - When did this get released? </garnt>
<joey> What the fuck?
- Wait, can I see? </joey>
<joey> What is it? </joey>
<garnt> - I've never heard of this anime before. </garnt>
<joey> - [Man] It started as a manga but- </joey>
<connor> (Joey speaking in foreign language) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so what happened is that, </joey>
<joey> I was like, I told myself, </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna watch the first
anime I see on Netflix. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why?
- What the fuck is this? </garnt>
<joey> I've never seen this. </joey>
<joey> - And so I watched it, </joey>
<joey> and I was pleasantly surprised. </joey>
<joey> I quite enjoyed it.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't amazing, but it was good fun. </joey>
<joey> - It's a 6.6 on iMDb. </joey>
<joey> - And so when I started watching it, </joey>
<connor> it felt like the most 6.6 show. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was just good. </connor>
<connor> - I had a fun time.
- Just good. </connor>
<connor> - I had a fun time, it
was very interesting </connor>
<garnt> and stupid at times and
dumb but interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys should check it out. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me explain the plot to you actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please.
- Go on. </garnt>
<garnt> Whoa, Connor explaining the plot to us. </garnt>
<garnt> - Believe it or not </garnt>
<joey> this is gonna be the most
scuffed plot explanation </joey>
<joey> of any anime-
- We are used to it. </joey>
<joey> - So this main character,
forgot her name already, </joey>
<joey> wakes up on the top of
a high-rise building </joey>
<joey> and you can't go down the
stairs of the high-rise. </joey>
<joey> You can only cross like wooden bridges </joey>
<garnt> to get to other high-rise buildings. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's these dudes
that are wearing these masks </garnt>
<garnt> that are like budget
anonymous looking masks, </garnt>
<garnt> smiley masks and they're
trying to kill you. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're trying to... </garnt>
<garnt> They're not trying to kill you, </garnt>
<garnt> they're trying to get you
to jump off the building </garnt>
<connor> by making you have such despair </connor>
<connor> but that goes out the window
within like 10 seconds </connor>
<connor> and they're just starting to kill you. </connor>
<connor> So it's one of those things
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's one of those things
where they build it up </connor>
<connor> to be like a really big plot point, </connor>
<connor> they're like they wanna
make you feel despair </connor>
<connor> and jump yourself and
then immediately like- </connor>
<joey> - Why don't they just come
up to you and they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Could you jump off please?" </joey>
<joey> - Pretty please? </joey>
<joey> - And then immediately they then, </joey>
<connor> these masks people just
start killing everyone </connor>
<connor> and then it was like, wait
so that wasn't important? </connor>
<connor> And then these masks are
like controlling people </connor>
<connor> and are trying to find
out what's going on, </connor>
<garnt> and there's some other... </garnt>
<garnt> They're all (indistinct) so it's all... </garnt>
<garnt> All these characters-
- Oh, now I'm into it. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Why didn't you say so earlier, Connor? </joey>
<connor> - You can stop talking now. </connor>
<joey> - All these characters come
from a different world, </joey>
<joey> they wake up on high-rise buildings </joey>
<joey> and have to go from different high-rise </joey>
<garnt> and there's like masks that control them </garnt>
<garnt> and it's kind of shit but
it was interesting enough. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a fun time. </garnt>
<connor> You know what, it was nice watching a show </connor>
<connor> and not caring if it was
gonna be good or bad, </connor>
<garnt> and I enjoyed it. </garnt>
<connor> And the dub was very good, very good. </connor>
<garnt> - Fair enough.
- The dichotomy, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think like this
was the longest stretch </garnt>
<garnt> where I went not watching an anime at all. </garnt>
<connor> And actually picked up a JRPG </connor>
<connor> that I like got fucking </connor>
<connor> - Tales of Arise?
- Tales of Arise. </connor>
<connor> - Was it good? </connor>
<connor> - It was fucking amazing, man. </connor>
<connor> - Why did you have to say that? </connor>
<connor> Now I have to get it. </connor>
<joey> - The first time I played a JRPG </joey>
<joey> and like I'm just like-
- And actually completed it? </joey>
<connor> - No, I like, not only completed it, </connor>
<connor> I think I'm like close to 100% as well </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God
- Like it's the only </connor>
<connor> fucking JRPG where I
cared about it so much </connor>
<joey> and I didn't want the journey to end </joey>
<joey> that I 100 percented the
fucking fishing mini game. </joey>
<joey> - That that's how you know. </joey>
<joey> - I caught every fish in this game </joey>
<garnt> so I could see every skit
that there was available </garnt>
<connor> in the game, okay. </connor>
<connor> - How many hours have
you put in this game? </connor>
<garnt> - At the moment, about 80 hours. </garnt>
<joey> So for JRPG length that's actually-- </joey>
<garnt> - That's not too bad.
- That's not too bad. </garnt>
<joey> - Especially for a 100%
run, that's pretty short. </joey>
<connor> - We're talking 80 hours in
like the past two weeks, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, what else was he
going to do during quarantine? </connor>
<garnt> - What else was I gonna
do during quarantine? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like one thing that
really surprised me is that </garnt>
<garnt> it really got me to care
about game mechanics. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I'm here for
the story and characters. </garnt>
<connor> And then I just got really absorbed. </connor>
<connor> - JRPG fans find out
that games can be good. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I just got really
absorbed into the combat system </garnt>
<garnt> of this game. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, how did you trick my... </garnt>
<garnt> How did you trick my non-gamer brain </garnt>
<garnt> into caring about this shit? </garnt>
<garnt> Because like I've played
so many Tales games </garnt>
<garnt> and the reason I got it and Tales </garnt>
<garnt> was because it had like a
real-time combat system. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I played Berseria
and I didn't like it. </connor>
<connor> - Berseria?
- Berseria, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and that was in the time where </connor>
<garnt> I only really got into Tales games because </garnt>
<joey> every other JRPG was turn-based combat </joey>
<joey> with random encounters. </joey>
<joey> And Tales was just like no no no no, </joey>
<joey> how about you have a
real-time battle system </joey>
<joey> with enemies that you can see
when you get into a battle. </joey>
<joey> And then that kind of like, </joey>
<joey> as time gone on that
became more normalized </joey>
<joey> in a lot of JRPGs, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> you see the Modern Final Fantasy </joey>
<joey> and it's basically just an, </joey>
<joey> it's an action RPG with
some turn-based systems </joey>
<joey> implemented into it. </joey>
<connor> And so for the longest time
I still play Tales games </connor>
<connor> but they didn't grab me as much </connor>
<connor> as say back in the old school days </connor>
<connor> where this was the only
type of JRPG there was, </connor>
<connor> that had this type of system. </connor>
<connor> And so like, my love for the Tale series </connor>
<connor> had like waned a bit. </connor>
<connor> So when I got Tales of Arise, </connor>
<connor> I only got it 'cause
people were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, it's a new Tales game." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I'm a Tales fan, </connor>
<connor> maybe I'll just play this like-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm more of a Sonic guy.
- Yeah, I'm a Tales fan, </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna ignore that for a second. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was terrible. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm glad you said it before I did. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - He just kept saying Tales
and I just kept thinking- </connor>
<joey> - I was in my head I was
just imagining fucking... </joey>
<connor> - I'm a big Tales fan,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Like if I wasn't in quarantine, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't have played it </connor>
<connor> and then on the first day, </connor>
<connor> I played it for like a good 10 hours. </connor>
<connor> And I was like oh no, oh no, </connor>
<connor> I'm invested. </connor>
<connor> If there's one thing you
don't want to be invested in, </connor>
<connor> it's the JRPG because you just
have to basically write off </connor>
<connor> like two three weeks of your life, </connor>
<joey> if that happens.
- Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - And it was like, </joey>
<joey> it's been such a long time where you know, </joey>
<joey> like when you're so absorbed into a game </joey>
<connor> that every waking moment
you're not playing the game, </connor>
<connor> you're either playing the game </connor>
<connor> or you're thinking about playing the game. </connor>
<connor> - I miss that feeling. </connor>
<connor> - And it was fucking great. </connor>
<connor> And the combat system in this is, </connor>
<connor> closer to something like, Devil May Cry </connor>
<connor> than it is like previous Tales games. </connor>
<connor> You can do like ridiculous
amounts of combos in this game. </connor>
<garnt> Can I go off about the game mechanics? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you care about the
game mechanics at all? </garnt>
<connor> - Sure, I mean, it's better
than you talking about </connor>
<garnt> aero game.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I'd love to hear how you like it. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so most Tales
games that I played before </connor>
<connor> it's just like button
mashing, like you press- </connor>
<connor> - That's what I didn't like about it </connor>
<connor> the last time I played it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and you can get
through a lot of this game </connor>
<connor> through just button mashing </connor>
<connor> and then like, there's this
really weird difficulty curve </connor>
<connor> where the later parts of
the game, you were like, </connor>
<connor> before in every Tales games </connor>
<connor> you can just get away with
like tapping one button, </connor>
<connor> tapping special attack,
anything like that. </connor>
<connor> But then they've layered
so many different systems </connor>
<connor> onto this combat system from
like previous Tales games, </connor>
<connor> that you realize you can
just start layering shit </connor>
<connor> over like things over things,
over things, over things. </connor>
<connor> So they introduce you to like, </connor>
<connor> you can only do a certain amount of moves </connor>
<connor> before your character goes
back into a rest state. </connor>
<connor> So you can only do like
three basic attacks </connor>
<joey> and enough special attacks
before your meter runs dry </joey>
<joey> but then if you juggle the enemy, </joey>
<connor> you add more basic attacks on top of that. </connor>
<connor> And then on top of that, you
have group attacks as well, </connor>
<connor> where people in your party
can also join in on an attack </connor>
<connor> and then what I didn't realize is that </connor>
<connor> Tales added this system, </connor>
<connor> where you can switch to
another person mid battle. </connor>
<connor> So you don't have to pause the game </connor>
<connor> to switch to another character, </connor>
<connor> you can literally, it's
a tap of one button, </connor>
<connor> you can switch to another person. </connor>
<connor> So you can basically chain combos, </connor>
<connor> ends combo with one person </connor>
<connor> then switch to like, </connor>
<connor> do a special attack with another person, </connor>
<garnt> switch to that person, </garnt>
<garnt> and so the system awards people </garnt>
<garnt> who are able to change really good combos. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if you get your
combo meter long enough, </garnt>
<garnt> then you can do basically
a finishing attack. </garnt>
<connor> - It looked kind of like
Genshin a little bit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's that's the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically like, it
was a lot like Genshin </garnt>
<garnt> except not having just one person, </garnt>
<connor> but having four people
in stage at one time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in the sense that your chain </connor>
<garnt> when you're playing Genshin </garnt>
<connor> from how much more that you change. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it's like way
more in depth than Genshin. </garnt>
<garnt> I would say it does have some similarities </garnt>
<connor> to the Genshin combat system </connor>
<connor> but it's like way more in-depth </connor>
<connor> and you can get combos
that are like way longer </connor>
<connor> than Genshin. </connor>
<garnt> You can get like 100 hit combos sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> - The only thing that I found really funny </connor>
<connor> and I don't know if
this is the whole game, </connor>
<connor> but I was watching someone
stream it on Twitch </connor>
<garnt> and they were fighting this
dragon, and during this fight, </garnt>
<garnt> every single character was
saying their voice lines, </garnt>
<garnt> at every single point. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<connor> I can't hear anything. </connor>
<connor> Everyone is just screaming
in their own attacks? </connor>
<joey> Is that happening all the time? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty standard
for a Jap, you know. </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't hear anything, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't hear what anyone was saying </joey>
<joey> because everyone was
shouting their attacks, </joey>
<joey> I was like what is this? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's the same with
like, Xenoblade as well, </joey>
<joey> like when you're fighting. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, that shit I can't
watch 'cause that annoys me. </connor>
<joey> Xenoblade annoys me watching Xenoblade, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I'm just hearing everyone, </connor>
<connor> (Connor imitating gaming sounds) </connor>
<joey> - And it's like four
people at the same time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Don't you like that? </joey>
<joey> - No, 'cause I can't hear
what everyone's saying. </joey>
<joey> It's just noise. </joey>
<joey> - You don't have to hear
what they're saying. </joey>
<connor> - I can't, even if I
wanted to, I can't hear it. </connor>
<joey> - It's not like they're
giving important information. </joey>
<connor> - I just wish that it
was like, I don't know, </connor>
<joey> from a viewing experience it
was very annoying, at least. </joey>
<joey> From a gaming, it's
probably don't give a shit </joey>
<joey> to put to focus. </joey>
<connor> - I think if you're
watching it as a viewer </connor>
<connor> it might get a little bit annoying </connor>
<joey> 'cause that's the only
thing you're focusing on. </joey>
<joey> But again, it's not
like they're gonna drop </joey>
<joey> huge narrative plot
points as they're going, </joey>
<joey> (Joey imitating gaming sounds) </joey>
<joey> I'm your dad. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing)
- I know, I know. </connor>
<garnt> I was just like this is too loud, shut up. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause on top of that as well, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes the characters
will have conversations </garnt>
<joey> with each other.
- That's what I saw as well. </joey>
<joey> As they're screaming. </joey>
<joey> - As they're screaming their attacks. </joey>
<joey> I mean there's a lot of things going on. </joey>
<joey> I love that, I love that about Tales. </joey>
<joey> - There's kind of campy about it. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the anime side that I live for. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there's something super
campy about it that I love. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, one person is being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, that was a good shot." </garnt>
<joey> And the other one's like, "Ah!" </joey>
<joey> He's like, all right,
you're not listening, cool. </joey>
<connor> - It seemed pretty cool though. </connor>
<garnt> It seemed like a lot better
combat system than before. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't trust people who
prefer turn-based combat </garnt>
<connor> over that, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "What's wrong with you? </connor>
<connor> Who hurt you?" </connor>
<connor> - I mean... </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't say anything. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<joey> Who is it, who is it? </joey>
<joey> Who in this studio
likes turn-based combat? </joey>
<joey> - I didn't say anything. </joey>
<connor> - I absolutely despise turn-based combat. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hate it. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Turn-based is good. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's so boring. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I'm with Connor on that one. </garnt>
<garnt> Except for Persona. </garnt>
<garnt> - We haven't figured a way to make it fun </garnt>
<joey> so we keep using the same shitty thing </joey>
<connor> because we know it sort of works </connor>
<joey> but like no one's happy about it. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I don't like turn-based combat. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I'm
just used to it so much </joey>
<connor> to the point where I like think about it- </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing though, </joey>
<connor> I think that's why people-
- I get it. </connor>
<joey> If you didn't grow up with
it, it's fucking annoying. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I think it's just 'cause, </connor>
<connor> it's a thing that we haven't
figured out a better way </connor>
<garnt> and I still feel that some games, </garnt>
<garnt> the whole real-time combat in a way, </garnt>
<garnt> is still kind of junk at times. </garnt>
<garnt> It sounds like it's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really good. </garnt>
<connor> - Sounds like they finally
figured it out a little bit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's really good because
they teach you the basics </garnt>
<garnt> and then they don't teach you all these </garnt>
<garnt> more advanced techniques that you can do </garnt>
<garnt> to basically extend your combos </garnt>
<garnt> and like make flashier moves, </garnt>
<garnt> but they give you gameplay
incentives, like I said, </garnt>
<connor> like if you get a combo for long enough </connor>
<connor> without stopping it, then
you can do a finishing move </connor>
<connor> on an enemy. </connor>
<connor> And when they're high health, </connor>
<connor> it's harder than when they're low health. </connor>
<connor> So the common meter builds up faster </connor>
<connor> when they're low health. </connor>
<connor> So like when you sometimes
you start off a battle </connor>
<connor> and depending on how well
you can get your combo off, </connor>
<connor> because when when you kill one
enemy with a finishing move, </connor>
<connor> that makes it easier to do the next enemy </connor>
<connor> and the next enemy and the next enemy, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like a domino effect, right? </connor>
<connor> So, depending on the difficulty, </connor>
<joey> if you start off a battle well, </joey>
<joey> you can clear the enemy so fast </joey>
<joey> or you can like get KO'd really easily, </joey>
<joey> depending on like how well
you start off your attacks </joey>
<joey> and your combos. </joey>
<joey> Which is just something that
I never experienced before </joey>
<joey> in a Tales game, because Tales was always, </joey>
<joey> I'm playing because I like it
and it's anime and it's JRPG. </joey>
<joey> And then the combat here is just to, </joey>
<connor> make me forget about the fact
that I just hate grinding </connor>
<connor> and combats and like
- Yeah, I don't like grinding. </connor>
<connor> - And turn-based battles, </connor>
<connor> but this one was just,
it's legit good game. </connor>
<connor> I can see why it's like the closest thing </connor>
<garnt> Tales has got to like
a mainstream release, </garnt>
<joey> because it is a legit
good game that I think </joey>
<garnt> a lot of people who don't
even like JRPGs would like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've been tempted ever
since they announced it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like I can't do it to myself. </garnt>
<connor> I have so many fucking JRPGs lined up </connor>
<connor> that I still need to play. </connor>
<garnt> I still haven't played
the like Nier Replicant. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't played that either. </garnt>
<garnt> - I bought that on Steam and
it's just been sitting there. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, I'll get to it eventually. </joey>
<connor> - That's Steam, that's how it is. </connor>
<joey> - But I'll get to it eventually
and then they were like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, there's five more JRPGs. </connor>
<connor> - I bought Sega Bass Fishing, </connor>
<joey> Sega Bass Fishing </joey>
<joey> and I never played it.
- Sega Bass Fishing? </joey>
<joey> - A fishing game.
- Oh! </joey>
<joey> - Sega Genesis type.
- Why? </joey>
<joey> - Why not, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - Because it's Sega Bass Fishing. </joey>
<joey> - I actually think we should
do a Trash Taste special, </joey>
<connor> we do high score on Sega Bass Fishing. </connor>
<connor> Look at that game, look at that. </connor>
<connor> - Can we just go real fishing? </connor>
<joey> I'd rather go real fishing. </joey>
<connor> - I'd rather just go real fishing. </connor>
<garnt> - And then play Sega Bass Fishing. </garnt>
<connor> - I also really wanna play </connor>
<joey> the new Nickelodeon fighting game. </joey>
<connor> - They actually made it
into like a serious fighter. </connor>
<joey> - And apparently someone's
already figured out </joey>
<connor> that some characters are just </connor>
<connor> fucking broken beyond belief.
- Of course they have. </connor>
<connor> We're gonna begin patch notes
for days and tier lists. </connor>
<joey> Spongebob is STR, Patrick is DTS. </joey>
<connor> - Spongebob bottom tier.
- Bottom tier is (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<connor> Did you also hear the news just yesterday? </connor>
<connor> - I know you're gonna say it.
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Of Sora getting
confirmed for Smash Bros? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - And the internet just breaking. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen the
internet break that hard. </connor>
<joey> - I'm happy for those fans who like Sora. </joey>
<joey> I was rooting for Master
Chief, personally. </joey>
<joey> - Aki literally broke down crying </joey>
<connor> as if she lost a family member. </connor>
<connor> - Does Aki play Smash? </connor>
<connor> - She does, but I didn't
know she played... </connor>
<joey> 'Cause she never played with me. </joey>
<joey> But apparently she's
played like the 3DS variant </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> Like the older game. </connor>
<connor> But now, I know there's
gonna be just like a whole </connor>
<connor> wave of new smash players. </connor>
<garnt> - It's one of those things
where I'm happy for those fans </garnt>
<garnt> who got it, but I don't really care. </garnt>
<connor> I could care less- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I never played Kingdom Hearts. </connor>
<joey> - No, me neither.
- Me neither. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Were you hyped? </joey>
<joey> - I mean I was hyped just
purely on the base of like </joey>
<joey> just thinking to myself how the fuck, </joey>
<joey> like they must have thought
for tooth and nail with Disney </joey>
<connor> to get that. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> Maybe smash is big enough where
they would have been like... </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, I'm sure. </joey>
<joey> Like Sakurai's done enough now, </joey>
<connor> where he's just like,
"Do you know who I am?" </connor>
<garnt> - Also they'll be releasing
Kingdom Hearts on the Switch </garnt>
<connor> which is probably one of the
biggest reasons why it's... </connor>
<connor> - I mean like I was more
surprised about Minecraft Steve. </connor>
<connor> - That did break Twitter,
literally, it broke Twitter. </connor>
<joey> - That broke Twitter as well. </joey>
<joey> - Because like Sora I was just... </joey>
<connor> As someone who's not
that invested in Smash </connor>
<connor> or Kingdom Hearts I was like, I see it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it wasn't that
big of a surprise for me </connor>
<connor> where I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck! </connor>
<connor> Where did this come from?" </connor>
<connor> It was just like, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, I mean they had a cloud on there, </garnt>
<garnt> they had (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - See this is why I want
a Master Chief, man. </connor>
<garnt> It would have been so out of left field. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Master Chief would
have been out of left field. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro, imagine it, the
fucking announcement comes, </garnt>
<joey> you hit the fucking halo music, bro. </joey>
<connor> This is full for memes. </connor>
<connor> I do not actually want... </connor>
<connor> I do not care if he is in it or not, </connor>
<connor> but I just want the meme potential- </connor>
<joey> - That's what most people
were saying about Sans </joey>
<connor> until they added a skin.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I just want Master Chief. </joey>
<connor> - They added a doom guy though as a skin. </connor>
<connor> - No, fuck off.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - One of those skins is dooms guy. </joey>
<connor> - As a skin though, come on, man. </connor>
<connor> Doom guy could have been anything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, doom guy could have been anyone. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] It's a final update as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the final update, so
there's no more characters. </joey>
<connor> - Well the next Smash in
future, whenever that happens </connor>
<joey> we better get the Master Chief. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, Nickelodeon
did a fighting game, </joey>
<connor> so who knows. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I want the
Master Chief in Smash. </connor>
<garnt> - What is this Nickelodeon fighter game? </garnt>
<connor> - It's shit. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically, </connor>
<connor> they took all the Nickelodeon characters </connor>
<joey> and turned it to Smash. </joey>
<joey> - But it's actually like,
a well-designed game </joey>
<joey> from what I've heard. </joey>
<connor> I don't know, I don't really care. </connor>
<joey> - I saw a video of some guy just saying </joey>
<joey> how broken Spongebob was and- </joey>
<joey> - I mean he's the flagship character. </joey>
<joey> - And I never thought I'd see the word </joey>
<joey> Spongebob needs to get nerfed </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> written in text but like
I saw it and I was like, </connor>
<connor> wow, what a time to be alive. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, man. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, like, I'm super happy. </joey>
<connor> Like, I personally, have
never really sat down </connor>
<joey> and played the Kingdom Hearts game. </joey>
<connor> I only know so much about it </connor>
<connor> because I live with a Kingdom Hearts fan, </connor>
<joey> but like, I'm happy for
the Kingdom Hearts fans. </joey>
<joey> - I just know that every time </joey>
<joey> you talk to a Kingdom Hearts fan </joey>
<connor> they try to explain the story,
I'm just like, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's like the you know, </garnt>
<connor> it's like as a fake fan it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I understand how it feels getting-- </connor>
<connor> - They just love it. </connor>
<joey> (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad they have something. </joey>
<joey> I wish I had something that I got there- </joey>
<joey> - I probably know more
about the Kingdom Hearts law </joey>
<connor> just purely because of Aki. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I had to sit
down and watch her play </connor>
<connor> all of Kingdoms Hearts 3
and every turning point, </connor>
<joey> I was like, "May I ask a question?" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> May I ask several questions? </connor>
<joey> - I love the memes of like Mickey Mouse </joey>
<garnt> wearing like a black hood. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand what's going on. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't understand the context there. </joey>
<joey> - That's king mickey. </joey>
<joey> - But like Mickey Mouse
is wearing a black hood </joey>
<connor> and I'm like all right, </connor>
<connor> I should just like- </connor>
<joey> - And he gets into the
darkness and he fights enemies. </joey>
<connor> - [Man] The void. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, this is totally unrelated </connor>
<connor> but it's just reminding me of this, </connor>
<connor> the PaRappa the Rapper
memes with the daffy duck, </connor>
<joey> have you seen that one?
- I think so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I slammed my penis
in the car door memes, </joey>
<joey> have you seen that?
(all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's really weird
when you just say that. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I spoke to Emily and Didus </joey>
<joey> and we were all like, </joey>
<joey> have you guys seen </joey>
<garnt> the daffy duck where he slams
his penis in the car door </garnt>
<garnt> with PaRappa the Rapper? </garnt>
<joey> And we were like, "Yes,
we love that meme." </joey>
<joey> I was like, yes! </joey>
<joey> It's such a dumb meme. </joey>
<connor> I'll show you later.
- All right. </connor>
<joey> - It's very weird when you just say that. </joey>
<garnt> - When I hear that out of
context, I'm just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one of those memes
that passed very fast </garnt>
<garnt> but I found it so funny </garnt>
<joey> and I realized I'm such a child </joey>
<joey> and that is so funny. </joey>
<joey> - You're like crying. </joey>
<joey> - I know, there's something in my eye. </joey>
<connor> It's just so funny.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just the memory of this meme, </connor>
<connor> is just breaking this man. </connor>
<connor> - I just had to talk about, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It reminded me of the, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I just love though like, </connor>
<joey> I'm not too invested in Smash anymore </joey>
<joey> but every time they announce a
new character I'm like, okay. </joey>
<joey> I always like try and keep up to date </joey>
<joey> with what the community is saying. </joey>
<connor> - I imagine that's how
it feels to like the NBA </connor>
<connor> and have the draft
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's just like all of the predictions </joey>
<joey> I see from Smash fans, it's
just fucking hilarious. </joey>
<connor> Because with this last-
- You can bet, </connor>
<connor> You can bet on the characters. </connor>
<connor> - With this last drop, </connor>
<connor> there was three main predictions. </connor>
<joey> It was like, Sora, obviously, </joey>
<joey> Master Chief, obviously. </joey>
<joey> Third one was fucking Goku. </joey>
<connor> - And Crash Bandicoot as
well, I saw it as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Crash Bandicoot, but like Goku, </joey>
<joey> there was like an
alarming amount of people </joey>
<garnt> who were like, Goku confirmed for Smash </garnt>
<connor> - I'd be hyped for Goku.
- And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'd be hype but I just
can't imagine a game </connor>
<connor> where Goku beats up Mario.
- And Sonic. </connor>
<connor> - And Sonic, it just sounds fucking weird. </connor>
<joey> - Are you kidding me, that sounds amazing. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds amazing?
- I'd get hyped over that. </joey>
<garnt> - What's that game where you
bet on characters that fight? </garnt>
<garnt> - Salty bets.
- Is that what it is? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, Salty Bets, that's it. </garnt>
<joey> It turns into Salty Bets. </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds like a Salty Bets </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Salty Bets was just like
decades ahead of its time. </garnt>
<garnt> Hanson and Mickey is fighting Alucard. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, sure, I'm down.
- Who will win? </joey>
<connor> And then Hanson and Mickey
comes back from One HP </connor>
<connor> and destroys Alucard </connor>
<connor> and you're like that checks out, </connor>
<connor> that sounds good. </connor>
<connor> Oh, my Lord. </connor>
<joey> Well, that's been fun
- Yeah, it has been fun. </joey>
<connor> - It's nice being back.
- It's good. </connor>
<joey> I'm just happy that I get to
see you guys again every week. </joey>
<joey> It's been too long. </joey>
<joey> I missed you guys, what can I say. </joey>
<joey> - We gotta get back in the rhythm again. </joey>
<joey> It's been a while, it's been a while. </joey>
<joey> - We'll get there, we'll get there. </joey>
<joey> - But you know what else I'm
glad about, the patreons. </joey>
<connor> - Damn, that felt good. </connor>
<connor> - It's been so long since
I've heard that, oh, my God. </connor>
<joey> - It's been a while
guys, it's been a while. </joey>
<connor> - Look at these lovely people who- </connor>
<connor> - Wonderful patreons who've
stuck around for the many weeks. </connor>

<garnt> - It's like ingrained in here, man. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] It really is, it really is. </joey>
<joey> - It is genuinely good to be back. </joey>
<joey> I was like, this is my
first day out of quarantine </joey>
<joey> and most people, when
they've been stuck inside </joey>
<connor> for like two weeks, </connor>
<connor> they wouldn't be excited
to go back to work, </connor>
<connor> but I was like genuinely excited </connor>
<connor> to go back to the office, man. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Hell yeah, I
get to see my boys again." </connor>
<garnt> Get to go to the office,
