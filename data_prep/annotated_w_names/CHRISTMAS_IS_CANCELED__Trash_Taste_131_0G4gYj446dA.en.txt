<garnt> I'm with the boys as per usual Merry </garnt>
<garnt> Christmas Merry Christmas Merry </garnt>
<joey> Christmas Happy Hanukkah Mary Kwanzaa </joey>
<garnt> whatever whatever holiday you celebrate </garnt>
<connor> so I thought for Christmas I would gift </connor>
<garnt> myself a new phone because this phone is </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely shattered how the [ __ ] did </garnt>
<garnt> you do that I was so I had it it fell </garnt>
<garnt> out my pocket while I was doing an IR </garnt>
<garnt> stream with you yes yeah and they've </garnt>
<garnt> smashed and now it is like pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> it's like usable 10 of the time it took </garnt>
<garnt> some what kind of works but it's just </garnt>
<garnt> frustrating all right so I thought well </garnt>
<garnt> I got a new phone what'd you get how </garnt>
<joey> hard can that be well let's let's let's </joey>
<joey> hold up on that before we get it okay </joey>
<joey> just tell me what's good I don't know so </joey>
<garnt> I you know originally I wanted like the </garnt>
<garnt> the Z fold whatever but I realized that </garnt>
<garnt> I can't mount it to my bike if I do </garnt>
<garnt> because there's no because it would be </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] around yeah and they don't </garnt>
<garnt> mean bad flimsies well no because like </garnt>
<garnt> if you want a bike that goes on your </garnt>
<garnt> phone it's like because it's just one </garnt>
<garnt> like panel yeah you can just have these </garnt>
<garnt> like mounts that stick to it really </garnt>
<joey> nicely yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> all there's no mounts right now and I </joey>
<joey> was like well should I I'm going to wait </joey>
<joey> for the mountain either right yeah no </joey>
<joey> and so I was like all right whatever </joey>
<connor> I'll go for the pixel so uh in Japan </connor>
<connor> right I was like you know what </connor>
<connor> I'm with um I'm with SoftBank I was like </connor>
<connor> okay well I'll just go to SoftBank </connor>
<garnt> because I have a I've uh so this phone </garnt>
<garnt> was a Sim free phone right so I bought </garnt>
<garnt> it from Google yeah and then I went to </garnt>
<garnt> SoftBank and I got a Sim free or sorry a </garnt>
<connor> SoftBank uh SIM card yeah yeah yeah so I </connor>
<garnt> thought I could just go to SoftBank </garnt>
<connor> and get a new Google pixel 7 but oh no </connor>
<garnt> of course oh of course no no no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> no no no no no you would like to make a </garnt>
<connor> purchase so here's what happened right </connor>
<garnt> here's how it all went without doing </garnt>
<garnt> paperwork yeah so yeah first of all you </garnt>
<joey> can't even just turn up the phone store </joey>
<joey> in Japan you have to book it's a new </joey>
<joey> system they introduced for kovid and </joey>
<joey> they haven't removed it yeah so you </joey>
<garnt> can't just rock up at a store and buy a </garnt>
<garnt> phone now you have to book yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which sucks because it's like what if my </garnt>
<garnt> phone breaks and I can't I don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> wait like two days yeah so anyway I make </garnt>
<garnt> this booking I say I want to buy the new </garnt>
<garnt> Google pixel uh Seven Pro whatever </garnt>
<garnt> even though I already don't really like </garnt>
<garnt> this pixel but I'm like oh well I won't </garnt>
<garnt> be burned a third time right so so I go </garnt>
<garnt> to SoftBank and yeah again I just want </garnt>
<garnt> to buy a new phone I already have a SIM </garnt>
<garnt> with this provider yeah I just want a </garnt>
<connor> new phone </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> I go in and also right now they told me </connor>
<garnt> I couldn't have tethering on my phone </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't buy the phone from </garnt>
<garnt> softbanks I thought oh cool well okay </garnt>
<garnt> I'll buy it from then this time and I'll </garnt>
<garnt> get tethering so I go in I'm like can I </garnt>
<garnt> have the pixel and they were like uh no </garnt>
<garnt> I was like what do you mean I was like </garnt>
<garnt> I'll I'll buy it all in cash I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get like a like a loan on it </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just trying to buy the phone you </garnt>
<connor> know like </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> in this name it's like hard and that's </connor>
<connor> how you know like it's gonna be tough </connor>
<joey> and I'm like why that's the polite </joey>
<joey> Japanese way of saying [ __ ] off yeah I'm </joey>
<connor> like why why can't I not buy this and </connor>
<connor> they're like okay so right now even </connor>
<connor> though your sim is with us and you'll be </connor>
<joey> buying the phone with us it still </joey>
<joey> wouldn't turn tethering on because the </joey>
<joey> Sim we just don't want to allow </joey>
<joey> tethering on I'm like okay okay I'm like </joey>
<joey> fine I didn't really want it that much I </joey>
<joey> mean it would have been nice but I guess </joey>
<garnt> like I'll just I'll just get I'll just </garnt>
<garnt> get a you know maybe I can this I was </garnt>
<joey> like why are you being like in there </joey>
<garnt> about it it's not like I wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> tether anyway </garnt>
<garnt> but actually I was like actually wait </garnt>
<garnt> could I could I actually get a new SIM </garnt>
<garnt> card that is for this new phone </garnt>
<garnt> and could I then have tethering and they </garnt>
<garnt> were like No And I was like what they </garnt>
<garnt> were like oh because your Visa is </garnt>
<garnt> expiring in a month so we can't give you </garnt>
<garnt> a new sim plan wow and I was like oh but </garnt>
<garnt> I already have a plan with you they're </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah yeah and I was like and you're </garnt>
<garnt> not going to cancel that like no I'm </garnt>
<joey> like so I can't so I can't get a new </joey>
<joey> plan </joey>
<joey> yeah that is the exact same plan so they </joey>
<joey> won't let me start a new plan that </joey>
<garnt> allows me to tether with my same number </garnt>
<garnt> and everything it's no different they </garnt>
<garnt> won't let me do it because my Visa is </garnt>
<joey> about to expire now I'm like hey I'm </joey>
<garnt> renewing it yeah yeah on the back yeah </garnt>
<joey> like no sorry like too many foreigners </joey>
<joey> have ran away so they changed the rules </joey>
<joey> and a lot of bad apple ruins the whole </joey>
<joey> world I'm like what the [ __ ] I'm like </joey>
<connor> all right fine I guess I don't I don't </connor>
<garnt> need that at all all right fine can I </garnt>
<garnt> just get a new phone they're like no I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> why can I not get a new phone and </garnt>
<joey> they're like oh they're just trolling </joey>
<joey> you they're like oh because if you buy </joey>
<joey> this phone it won't work with this Sim </joey>
<joey> I'm like why not I'm like wait so you're </joey>
<joey> telling me the SoftBank phone won't work </joey>
<joey> with the SoftBank Sim I have and he's </joey>
<joey> like yeah yeah when it won't work I'm </joey>
<joey> like why and he's like oh because you </joey>
<garnt> have a SIM free phone right now and this </garnt>
<garnt> this SoftBank Sim is a Sim free SoftBank </garnt>
<garnt> Sim and I'm like okay and he's like so </garnt>
<garnt> that that won't work on our phone </garnt>
<joey> because our phone only accept except </joey>
<garnt> SoftBank Sims and I'm like I have a </garnt>
<joey> SoftBank Sim he's like no no you so you </joey>
<connor> have a free SoftBank Sim I'm like what </connor>
<connor> do you mean by that he's like oh this </connor>
<connor> only works on free phones unlocked </connor>
<connor> phones I'm like </connor>
<connor> so you're telling me the SoftBank Sim I </connor>
<garnt> have won't work on your SoftBank phone </garnt>
<connor> he's like no sir I'm like what are you </connor>
<joey> insane do you realize how stupid this is </joey>
<garnt> they have to be trolling at that point </garnt>
<joey> they're just like we really don't want </joey>
<connor> to give this guy I'm like I'm like what </connor>
<connor> do you he's like yeah so if you buy a </connor>
<connor> phone right now it will not work with </connor>
<connor> your current Sim unless you get a sim </connor>
<connor> that can only work on this phone so I'm </connor>
<joey> like how does that make any [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> sense are they trying to sell you a </joey>
<connor> phone or they wouldn't sell me the phone </connor>
<connor> at all no these because I had to have a </connor>
<connor> A or a plan only for their carrier but </connor>
<joey> like did they not give you like other </joey>
<joey> options being like but what you can do </joey>
<joey> is they were like get the [ __ ] out oh my </joey>
<connor> God they were like sorry nothing no can </connor>
<joey> do yeah </joey>
<joey> I mean you went through all that trouble </joey>
<garnt> after a booking yeah and I'm like this </garnt>
<garnt> like I saw your Visa like illegal </garnt>
<connor> immigrants obviously obviously you don't </connor>
<connor> deserve a phone I'm just like okay fine </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] me so my phone's broken I can't do </connor>
<garnt> anything about it okay so now I I then I </garnt>
<garnt> afterwards I was like fine I'll go to </garnt>
<garnt> I'll go to like one of the other </garnt>
<garnt> characters areas and I'll see what I can </garnt>
<garnt> do yeah yeah and they were like oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because your Visa is expiring well it's </garnt>
<joey> about to expire on paper it looks like </joey>
<joey> there's no no carrier will will let you </joey>
<joey> join so basically even though I already </joey>
<joey> have two more Sims with docomo for my </joey>
<joey> streaming bag they wouldn't give me one </joey>
<joey> but they did however docomo they did say </joey>
<joey> they were like hey once you if you buy </joey>
<joey> an unlocked phone from Google again and </joey>
<joey> you come back to us we can give you a </joey>
<joey> Sim the tethers hey talk about the goat </joey>
<joey> yeah I was like all right and they said </joey>
<joey> best of all because you have you already </joey>
<joey> have two sims with us if you have a </joey>
<joey> third with us we'll give you 10 discount </joey>
<connor> all the Sims and I was like oh music in </connor>
<connor> my ears so I'm gonna I'm gonna [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cancel my softbanks in the moment I get </connor>
<garnt> right I get I get my Visa honestly I </garnt>
<connor> think I think like locked phones are a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] scam why why yeah why why are </garnt>
<connor> phones locked to a network this is right </connor>
<connor> and this is what I've always bought </connor>
<garnt> unlocked phones yeah I'm like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to deal with this this locked </garnt>
<garnt> contract [ __ ] yeah but Japan has </garnt>
<garnt> designed a system that will punish you </garnt>
<garnt> for trying to do that like that </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you can do it and some </garnt>
<garnt> providers do it but all the big </garnt>
<garnt> corporations and the big networks really </garnt>
<garnt> don't want you to do it they do </garnt>
<garnt> everything in their power to not make </garnt>
<garnt> you do it which is fine </garnt>
<garnt> if it wasn't hard enough already to get </garnt>
<connor> a sim plan like it's it's hard like in </connor>
<connor> the UK you can you can order a Sim which </connor>
<connor> I did like uh for some of my friends I I </connor>
<connor> ordered them Sims from the UK that they </connor>
<connor> shipped to Japan the company shipped it </connor>
<connor> to Japan ready so that when you come to </connor>
<joey> the UK it'll work it's unlocked work on </joey>
<joey> any phone I think I think the issue with </joey>
<joey> a lot of these like Japanese companies </joey>
<garnt> is the fact that their main like Market </garnt>
<garnt> base is just Japanese people who are </garnt>
<garnt> probably never going to use another SIM </garnt>
<garnt> like they're just like in Japan the most </garnt>
<garnt> they'll travel is like [ __ ] I mean </garnt>
<garnt> why would they need why would you wait </garnt>
<joey> so you're going to buy a phone but why </joey>
<connor> would you need another Sim you're not </connor>
<connor> going anywhere they've made a system so </connor>
<connor> stressful even compared to like the like </connor>
<garnt> English contract and stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> um that is so [ __ ] to deal with that </garnt>
<garnt> you'll just never question it and you'll </garnt>
<garnt> just keep yeah get upgrading your phone </garnt>
<connor> you'll be like I don't want to deal with </connor>
<connor> it having to do this [ __ ] again yeah </connor>
<joey> this just sucks it's just a simple like </joey>
<garnt> solution right yeah yeah you don't want </garnt>
<connor> to deal with it where it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's kind of all about brand loyalty at </connor>
<connor> that point which I feel like is </connor>
<garnt> ingrained in a lot of them is to go man </garnt>
<connor> I travel your life </connor>
<joey> when I bought my other two sims they </joey>
<connor> were like no questions asked give this </connor>
<connor> man two SIM cards you know let's just do </connor>
<joey> it right now I do also find it </joey>
<joey> interesting how like going back to you </joey>
<garnt> having a book an appointment at the </garnt>
<garnt> SoftBank because of like covert </garnt>
<garnt> restrictions </garnt>
<garnt> are we not beyond that point at this </garnt>
<garnt> point Japan isn't like Japan Japan is </garnt>
<garnt> still incredibly still so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> paranoid about it because like I because </garnt>
<garnt> I went back to the gym recently after </garnt>
<garnt> and uh you know and like the local gym I </garnt>
<connor> I went to like you can you know they're </connor>
<connor> obviously like oh you can like use the </connor>
<connor> app to see like how many people are at </connor>
<connor> the gym right now in case you don't want </connor>
<garnt> to be like you know yeah full or </garnt>
<garnt> anything or you don't you know your </garnt>
<garnt> machines aren't available I'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> that's great that's fantastic so before </garnt>
<garnt> I leave the house I go okay let's see </garnt>
<garnt> how many people are there and I usually </garnt>
<garnt> try to go like during the night because </garnt>
<garnt> that's when people yeah that's when it's </garnt>
<garnt> emptier so I went in and the gym I go to </garnt>
<garnt> split into two floors and it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> free weights are on one floor and then </garnt>
<garnt> the machines are on another floor and </garnt>
<garnt> it's and on the map it shows you like </garnt>
<joey> okay there are this many people on this </joey>
<joey> floor there's many people on this floor </joey>
<joey> so one of the nights I was like oh okay </joey>
<joey> cool there's no one in the free weights </joey>
<joey> room so I'll just go there empty the </joey>
<joey> entire night right but I don't know if </joey>
<joey> this is the same with the gym you guys </joey>
<joey> go to but like now they've made it so </joey>
<joey> that if you're on like a cardio like </joey>
<joey> like a running machine or like a bike or </joey>
<connor> anything you don't have to wear a mask </connor>
<connor> oh not on my gym you still have to wear </connor>
<joey> them oh really okay so in my gym it's </joey>
<garnt> like if you're on the running machine or </garnt>
<garnt> you're on like a bicycle or like any </garnt>
<garnt> cardio stuff so that you can [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> breathe properly yeah you can take the </garnt>
<garnt> mask off but if you're on a machine or </garnt>
<joey> you're in free your weights you have to </joey>
<connor> have a mask it's so so dumb that Anytime </connor>
<connor> Fitness at least one near me you still </connor>
<garnt> have to wear a mask on the cardio oh </garnt>
<garnt> really and like some people do it </garnt>
<connor> yeah please just don't bother me because </connor>
<joey> I can't remember the message yeah it's </joey>
<joey> the same but like so I was like all </joey>
<joey> right I'll just go to the free weights </joey>
<garnt> room whatever right it's empty as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> right and you have to wear a mask even </garnt>
<garnt> in the free weights room right yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like it's like 10 p.m I know no </garnt>
<garnt> one's gonna come in no one's here yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] it I'll just take the mask off </garnt>
<garnt> so I can actually breathe right </garnt>
<garnt> just yesterday I get this text from the </garnt>
<garnt> gym no a text a text an automated </garnt>
<garnt> message text that basically reads uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so there have been reports that uh </garnt>
<garnt> you were at the gym uh on this day at </garnt>
<connor> this time not wearing a mom no and I'm </connor>
<garnt> like and are you serious yeah and it was </garnt>
<connor> like and it was like uh you know we uh </connor>
<connor> you know we've revoked your credit card </connor>
<connor> access </connor>
<garnt> you're now not allowed to spend it you </garnt>
<garnt> wanna Blacklist </garnt>
<garnt> and no basically he was like dystopian </garnt>
<garnt> it was so like it was so passive </garnt>
<garnt> aggressive too because it was like </garnt>
<garnt> you're not in trouble but it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> a warning you know it's like we we </garnt>
<garnt> require all uh you know gym goers to </garnt>
<joey> wear a mask where it's necessary well </joey>
<joey> and I'm like </joey>
<joey> bro this room was empty who am I gonna </joey>
<garnt> infect yeah I yeah I mean was there </garnt>
<garnt> someone who reports to you or did was </garnt>
<garnt> there someone who was like who was like </garnt>
<joey> looking on the security probably someone </joey>
<garnt> who just like the next day went on to </garnt>
<garnt> the security camera and was like oh this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Foreigner's not wearing a mask </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna send a passive aggressive </connor>
<connor> tweet to them okay maybe they have ai </connor>
<joey> that can tell when you're not wearing a </joey>
<joey> mask probably I need to turn on the </joey>
<connor> lights in the back okay oh [ __ ] oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> we are dumb and forgot to turn on our </garnt>
<garnt> purple lights </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think any of us are anti-mask </garnt>
<garnt> but I think when it comes to exercise I </garnt>
<garnt> think you know there should be some </garnt>
<garnt> leeway there where it's like hey </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you're doing cardio yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I just yeah and it is annoying that at </garnt>
<joey> least Anytime Fitness in Japan it </joey>
<joey> doesn't well at least there's like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] millions of signs right yeah </joey>
<joey> same don't worry but most people I've </joey>
<garnt> seen don't some people do it's weird </garnt>
<joey> seeing who does and doesn't in Japan </joey>
<garnt> right as a foreigner it's like all right </garnt>
<garnt> people expect me to not follow the rules </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like whatever but it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> it's odd seeing which Japanese people uh </garnt>
<garnt> follow the rules and I've noticed the </garnt>
<garnt> more ripped someone is in the gym in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan the less likely they are to wear </garnt>
<garnt> their mask I'm not kidding they're </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely who's going to tell them </garnt>
<garnt> who's gonna stop I'm not kidding you the </garnt>
<garnt> absolute Giga chat's in the gym don't </garnt>
<garnt> wear masks I'm not this is not this is </garnt>
<garnt> okay I I'm this is not me </garnt>
<garnt> being like do real men don't wear it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I've just noticed that the more rip </garnt>
<garnt> someone is in Japan the more the mess </garnt>
<garnt> might be like down here or down here </garnt>
<garnt> I know you know and people who tend to </garnt>
<garnt> be more timid I've noticed that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's weird that's weird I've noticed </garnt>
<connor> that I'm not saying that like Google </connor>
<joey> shreds don't worry okay that's probably </joey>
<joey> why I got the text message because the </joey>
<joey> guy looked at the security camera I'm </joey>
<connor> like this [ __ ] skinny [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna [ __ ] up his social credit </connor>
<connor> scores </connor>
<garnt> it must be AI That's counting how many </garnt>
<garnt> people are in there next it's pretty </garnt>
<garnt> easy so it might be AI That's just if </garnt>
<joey> it's an automated message yeah but like </joey>
<garnt> I don't know it's just like I've never </garnt>
<garnt> gotten a message like that and I was </garnt>
<garnt> just like dumb fan I'm like first of all </garnt>
<garnt> there was no one there so how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> did they know and second like okay I get </garnt>
<garnt> it if there was like you know other </garnt>
<garnt> people in the room right that are in </garnt>
<garnt> close vicinity but for one this is an </garnt>
<garnt> empty ass room it was empty the entire </garnt>
<garnt> time I was there like before I came </garnt>
<joey> after I left no one ever came in no one </joey>
<joey> even came close also what the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> the point of there being five air </joey>
<joey> purifiers in this tiny room yeah I mean </joey>
<garnt> like I feel like Japan is like Japan's </garnt>
<garnt> like because I know this is with a few </garnt>
<connor> places now where Japan's at this point </connor>
<connor> where it's kind of like in this limbo </connor>
<connor> phase where people don't know yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> people don't know whether to take you </garnt>
<garnt> know the same Corona precautions </garnt>
<garnt> whether to stick with them or not </garnt>
<garnt> because I've noticed some establishment </garnt>
<garnt> like you go to like restaurants and </garnt>
<connor> stuff and all the signs are still up </connor>
<connor> over like the same like covid </connor>
<connor> precautions that would like there deep </connor>
<connor> during the pandemic were the </connor>
<garnt> establishments follow them or not is </garnt>
<connor> completely a coin flip yeah right now </connor>
<connor> you know which thing I I really want to </connor>
<connor> die and I hope this never I just want </connor>
<connor> this to stop right it's you only go to a </connor>
<joey> restaurant or a cafe yeah and they have </joey>
<joey> this in Japan I don't think they did </joey>
<joey> this anywhere else they had the screen </joey>
<joey> dividing you and your friend yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and so I hate that and so </joey>
<joey> I to me like again I'm I'm all for </joey>
<joey> taking precautions to separate you from </joey>
<joey> other customers because yeah you didn't </joey>
<joey> come in with them but if you come in </joey>
<connor> with say like uh someone you're dating </connor>
<connor> or your partner who you're married to </connor>
<connor> yeah and then they put this screen in </connor>
<connor> between you both in my head I'm like </connor>
<connor> what is this like I don't understand </connor>
<joey> it's like I'm visiting my partner in </joey>
<garnt> jail </garnt>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> again I don't if that was like fine but </connor>
<joey> it's like if I want to share food it </joey>
<joey> becomes impossible oh yeah because you </joey>
<joey> have to go around yeah yeah and don't I </joey>
<garnt> swear to God if you touch it in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> they freak out yeah because you know </garnt>
<joey> maybe you have a big enough table where </joey>
<garnt> you're like ah [ __ ] it you move it and </garnt>
<joey> then like yeah </joey>
<garnt> and they're like what are you doing put </garnt>
<garnt> it back and it's like oh what I mean he </garnt>
<connor> just committed Warfare it's weird though </connor>
<connor> and I've been in other restaurants where </connor>
<joey> they'll be they'll just literally see </joey>
<joey> you coming together and they'll just </joey>
<joey> move it for you yeah it's so bizarre and </joey>
<joey> it it feels like incredibly inconsistent </joey>
<connor> which is what makes it annoying yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and and you know like we did um I </connor>
<joey> uh I had my fourth shot recently I don't </joey>
<joey> even know if America's doing fourth </joey>
<joey> shots right or the only is the UK doing </joey>
<garnt> fourth shot I have no idea it's covered </garnt>
<garnt> boosters well you know Japan became my </garnt>
<garnt> mail and it was like you should do it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like fine I'll go do it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah why not yeah you know who doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> want more protection sure just </garnt>
<garnt> collecting them all right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so I go and um get this thing I sit </garnt>
<garnt> down and uh this elderly guy starts </garnt>
<garnt> talking to me </garnt>
<connor> um in Japanese but then he starts he </connor>
<connor> asks me if I speak English and I was </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah I speak English then he </connor>
<connor> starts speaking to me in like fluent </connor>
<connor> English and he's like he's like 70 </connor>
<joey> nearly 80 I think yeah that's like the </joey>
<joey> shiny Pokemon of Japan yeah </joey>
<connor> smooth this most awesome pronunciation </connor>
<connor> of English ever and I was like oh wow </connor>
<garnt> you start talking and you know you're </garnt>
<garnt> having a good time we're like laughing </garnt>
<garnt> joking and then they they're like some </garnt>
<garnt> person came over like stop talking not a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of talk it was maybe you could be </garnt>
<garnt> like for covert reasons you could be </garnt>
<garnt> spreading it I'm like are we still at </garnt>
<garnt> that stage where are we worried about </garnt>
<garnt> this like we're wearing masks like is </garnt>
<garnt> this apparently we're like whispering to </garnt>
<garnt> each other and then he get this old man </garnt>
<garnt> goes yeah </garnt>
<garnt> Japan is too strict sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> I'm an old Japanese he goes so </garnt>
<garnt> frustrated he was like shaking his head </garnt>
<garnt> when she told him off it was so funny I </garnt>
<connor> was like oh man this guy is like he's </connor>
<garnt> the energy of a young person yeah that's </garnt>
<connor> probably why I can speak English right </connor>
<connor> yeah he's the voice of reason excuse me </connor>
<garnt> obviously if an old Japanese guy speaks </garnt>
<garnt> English they've they've traveled around </garnt>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> what's up it's it's um it's interesting </connor>
<garnt> I mean it's weird seeing which aspects </garnt>
<garnt> of covert precautions they cling on to </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and I don't necessarily feel </garnt>
<garnt> like it's of any </garnt>
<connor> any real impact more of maybe like a </connor>
<connor> comfort thing yeah I don't really </connor>
<connor> understand a lot of the thought process </connor>
<garnt> I mean it's gotten to the point right </garnt>
<garnt> now where I think at this stage in the </garnt>
<garnt> pandemic a lot of a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> establishments that do these kind of </garnt>
<garnt> kind of things it's kind of more like </garnt>
<garnt> Theater which is quite sure which is </garnt>
<garnt> like which is why some people choose to </garnt>
<garnt> do it some people would choose not to </garnt>
<garnt> enforce it and it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> dependent on the establishment because </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah the I went to a restaurant the </garnt>
<joey> other day where they still had the </joey>
<joey> screen like like uh disconnecting me and </joey>
<joey> whoever you're sitting down with yeah </joey>
<joey> and you know if you just ask them hey </joey>
<garnt> can we remove this they were like they </garnt>
<joey> would just go okay yeah yeah okay okay </joey>
<connor> sometimes they do sometimes they do </connor>
<connor> sometimes they do not want they are like </connor>
<joey> absolutely but that's the thing right </joey>
<garnt> it's like it would be less frustrating </garnt>
<garnt> if they're at least consistent with it </garnt>
<garnt> if like if if it was like in the heart </garnt>
<garnt> of the pandemic where it's like there is </garnt>
<garnt> no [ __ ] there was no excuse It's </garnt>
<garnt> like this is this this is this and these </garnt>
<garnt> are the steps you want to take then it's </garnt>
<garnt> like okay well there's nothing I can do </garnt>
<garnt> about it I might as well live with it </garnt>
<connor> yeah but like now as you said it's like </connor>
<connor> there are sometimes where I walk into </connor>
<connor> like a company right and like one </connor>
<connor> company you know I might be like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> I forgot my mask they won't say anything </connor>
<connor> another one I walk in without my mask </connor>
<connor> and they just follow the freak the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> out and I'm like can you at least be </joey>
<joey> consistent with this [ __ ] yeah yeah I </joey>
<connor> went into a combini to buy a mask so I </connor>
<garnt> lost my mess and then they were freaking </garnt>
<garnt> out yeah yeah and I was like oh no no </garnt>
<garnt> I'm buying a mess yeah and they were </garnt>
<garnt> like how do we what is this protocol how </garnt>
<garnt> do we ah I can see the like gears </garnt>
<garnt> turning yeah like oh no because you know </garnt>
<garnt> often times yeah your mask yeah it's </garnt>
<joey> like it's like you just put your mess in </joey>
<garnt> your pocket on it maybe it fell out or </garnt>
<garnt> you know you dropped it somewhere you </garnt>
<garnt> put it in the car you know you've got to </garnt>
<garnt> buy a new mask yeah yeah it's like dude </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just buying a mask man chill out </garnt>
<joey> yeah like I'm trying to follow and </joey>
<connor> adhere to the rules but sometimes it's </connor>
<connor> like it's it feels like you said it </connor>
<garnt> feels more like theater and it's in it's </garnt>
<garnt> well I I think it's it's also compounded </garnt>
<garnt> by the fact that you know the country's </garnt>
<garnt> open now and there's no way to </garnt>
<garnt> distinguish us between like people who </garnt>
<garnt> have lived here during the pandemic and </garnt>
<garnt> tourists you know what I mean so it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of I've because I've noticed </garnt>
<garnt> this a lot where before you know people </garnt>
<garnt> kind of treated you all the same </garnt>
<garnt> um because they knew you know you you </garnt>
<garnt> knew kind of like the rules here because </garnt>
<garnt> you must have been living here right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but now they must come in with the </garnt>
<garnt> Assumption of you just came in this </garnt>
<garnt> country yesterday you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> anything you know what I mean and I I've </garnt>
<garnt> noticed that subtle like yeah Behavior </garnt>
<joey> shift within like the past few weeks oh </joey>
<joey> my God I I recently had something like </joey>
<joey> that so I I recently did like a collab </joey>
<joey> for this like Japanese Channel </joey>
<garnt> um whereas like they were interviewing </garnt>
<garnt> me in Japanese and I went to this like </garnt>
<connor> Studio to go do it and it was run by </connor>
<connor> like Tokyo television or whatever sounds </connor>
<connor> like a proper production thing </connor>
<connor> everything it was really cool but like I </connor>
<garnt> walk into the studio and and I can see </garnt>
<garnt> the set and it's like a like a long kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like semi-circle table with three </garnt>
<garnt> seats and I'm in the middle but there's </garnt>
<garnt> the huge [ __ ] plastic devices yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right like that that's on on TV or </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and I'm like oh okay I mean well </garnt>
<garnt> it's Japanese TV so it's whatever the </garnt>
<garnt> problem was for one no one in this room </garnt>
<garnt> is wearing a mask and second of all I </garnt>
<garnt> walk in and I get introduced to the host </garnt>
<garnt> and the co-host and I just like straight </garnt>
<garnt> up shake hands with them none of us </garnt>
<garnt> wearing a mask and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> so if I can come this close to someone </garnt>
<garnt> without a mask and touch them and then </garnt>
<connor> immediately sit down and I'm protected </connor>
<joey> by these barriers I'm like I think we're </joey>
<connor> getting things the other way around like </connor>
<garnt> I think the way that it in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> the way that the thought process is </garnt>
<garnt> behind that is that </garnt>
<garnt> because like you know there's still </garnt>
<garnt> acting shows going on right there's no </garnt>
<garnt> dramas yeah um and they're not wearing </garnt>
<joey> masks show they don't have these plastic </joey>
<garnt> dividers yeah they're acting as if like </garnt>
<joey> it's in like a different world yeah I </joey>
<joey> think the reason why reality shows and </joey>
<garnt> current TV shows in Japan that uh very </garnt>
<garnt> like all based on like real things or </garnt>
<garnt> reality </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's this kind of way of </garnt>
<connor> messaging being like hey we are still </connor>
<joey> taking this seriously yeah </joey>
<connor> which but it's like in a pseudo way </connor>
<connor> because obviously like dramas and stuff </connor>
<connor> aren't held to that same standard just </connor>
<garnt> because they're like I think it's </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't view it as something </garnt>
<garnt> that's real yeah yeah exactly but it's </garnt>
<garnt> weird because obviously it's real and </garnt>
<garnt> these actors are interacting yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> it's obviously like people don't </garnt>
<garnt> actually care about the precautions it's </garnt>
<garnt> like they just want to make them they </garnt>
<garnt> want to think that it it's being </garnt>
<garnt> considered because like being next to </garnt>
<garnt> someone with a plastic divider here in </garnt>
<joey> the same room I don't it doesn't do </joey>
<garnt> anything no it's just all for sure </garnt>
<joey> what are you trying to show you're </joey>
<joey> trying to show that you're trying to </joey>
<joey> take kovid like seriously yeah taking </joey>
<connor> precautions it's like well yeah you know </connor>
<connor> really you're kind of half-assing yeah </connor>
<joey> if you were actually taking precautions </joey>
<joey> to stop it then you wouldn't do the show </joey>
<connor> to begin with yeah signal that you you </connor>
<joey> are still considering right which is </joey>
<garnt> weird but at that point it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> you know like an empty attempt you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like Yeah Yeah we're </garnt>
<garnt> definitely making sure no one's getting </garnt>
<joey> sick by putting these [ __ ] flimsy </joey>
<joey> pieces of plastic that are definitely </joey>
<connor> not stopping anything it's also like a </connor>
<garnt> prime example of how </garnt>
<garnt> Japan is quite slow to adopt and then </garnt>
<garnt> get rid of things like they were quite </garnt>
<garnt> slow to adopt all these precautions yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like it did actually take a while </garnt>
<garnt> while we were here compared to the </garnt>
<garnt> Western World and then now that they're </garnt>
<garnt> not no longer necessary or at least not </garnt>
<garnt> as necessary we're seeing that it also </garnt>
<garnt> is way harder to get rid of something </garnt>
<garnt> where people get accustomed to it in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan yeah like people out of just pure </garnt>
<connor> comfort and having to deal with this </connor>
<connor> every day are being much more like </connor>
<connor> reluctant to get rid of it and these </connor>
<connor> systems because I don't know if people </connor>
<connor> necessarily even like them here I don't </connor>
<connor> I don't really understand because a lot </connor>
<connor> of people I've spoke to given they're </connor>
<connor> probably more foreign leaning like in </connor>
<connor> terms of mindset they they don't really </connor>
<joey> like it but also it's it's odd I think </joey>
<joey> it's not so much a matter of liking it </joey>
<garnt> or disliking it I think it's just a </garnt>
<garnt> matter of I think I and I don't speak on </garnt>
<garnt> behalf of all Japanese people but I </garnt>
<garnt> think the general consensus is is kind </garnt>
<garnt> of just like well there's nothing we can </garnt>
<garnt> do about it like it or dislike it we </garnt>
<joey> have to adhere adhere to it right so </joey>
<joey> it's like what can we do we I can say my </joey>
<garnt> opinion about this it's not going to </garnt>
<garnt> change anything yeah I I honestly you </garnt>
<garnt> like don't know because even </garnt>
<garnt> pre-pandemic Japan was one of the few </garnt>
<garnt> countries that really embraced Mars </garnt>
<garnt> culture to begin with you know there </garnt>
<garnt> will be people wearing masks even before </garnt>
<garnt> the pandemic existed and it was a normal </garnt>
<connor> thing to see in Japan was it as common </connor>
<connor> no but there was already this mindset </connor>
<garnt> that was ingrained to be like to take </garnt>
<connor> precautions you know wear a mask and now </connor>
<garnt> like after the pandemic that's just </garnt>
<garnt> exasperated that idea to the point where </garnt>
<garnt> it's become more than just a precaution </garnt>
<joey> but just become a habit I mean yeah </joey>
<joey> Japan is still you know even before the </joey>
<joey> pandemic they were still taking like </joey>
<joey> influenza shots every year yeah like no </joey>
<connor> one outside of Japan takes him oh no </connor>
<connor> they uh they do in uh America oh really </connor>
<joey> flu shots but is it like common place </joey>
<joey> where it's like it's I think yeah I </joey>
<connor> think they do it every year yeah really </connor>
<joey> it's I think it's other countries like </joey>
<joey> at least in the UK and Australia I don't </joey>
<joey> think we do no but in America they get </joey>
<joey> flu shots every year really because we </joey>
<garnt> got we got like a message from our </garnt>
<garnt> company that was like Hey if you want </garnt>
<garnt> your flu shot this year you can come get </garnt>
<garnt> it oh and I was like what yeah I've </garnt>
<joey> never had a flu no I've never taken it </joey>
<joey> yeah what do you mean like I've been </joey>
<joey> fine yeah but apparently in America it's </joey>
<connor> you get it every year oh wow okay I </connor>
<connor> didn't know I didn't know that either </connor>
<connor> until I was I think I've taken like flu </connor>
<connor> shots when I was a kid or something like </connor>
<connor> probably as a kid yes yeah I'm not sure </connor>
<garnt> if it's common in the UK um I've never </garnt>
<joey> heard of like normal healthy and healthy </joey>
<joey> adults yeah I thought it was normally </joey>
<joey> for elderly and then for younger people </joey>
<joey> yeah that's what I thought as well um </joey>
<joey> but yeah I don't know I mean the reason </joey>
<garnt> why we obviously we spoke about this so </garnt>
<garnt> much because it is just genuinely </garnt>
<garnt> interesting and we're living it and </garnt>
<garnt> seeing it change all the lack of change </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the gym stuff is annoying yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> really wish yeah because they they </garnt>
<garnt> already I don't know about your </garnt>
<garnt> treadmills in your gym but they've like </garnt>
<joey> constructed these like plastic like </joey>
<joey> boxes like they're like covers around </joey>
<joey> the entire treadmill oh like a yeah like </joey>
<connor> a it's like something you'd see out of </connor>
<joey> like a like a like an infection movie </joey>
<joey> like a pod it's literally like they've </joey>
<connor> built like a plastic pod from shower </connor>
<joey> poles and plastic what the [ __ ] no our </joey>
<joey> one is literally just the one it's </joey>
<joey> literally flimsy plastic it's my dream </joey>
<joey> is literally that and then they make you </joey>
<garnt> wear a mask in it and to be fair like I </garnt>
<garnt> said most people I've seen half mess </garnt>
<garnt> skin </garnt>
<garnt> like they're not doing it uh and I've </garnt>
<garnt> never seen anyone get told off for it in </garnt>
<garnt> my previous gym this is given this was </garnt>
<joey> like height of the pandemic because you </joey>
<joey> know sometimes bro you're [ __ ] dying </joey>
<joey> on that tread oh yeah and you're like </joey>
<joey> Brian to gasp for air yeah you pull the </joey>
<joey> thing down one time I was on it going </joey>
<joey> ham this must have been like 20 20. dude </joey>
<garnt> like tapped me on the back and was like </garnt>
<garnt> dude mask put it up and I was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> okay sorry and I was like man that sucks </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I can't keep running man </garnt>
<joey> it's like when you breathe in deeply </joey>
<joey> like the [ __ ] cloth yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's like I you know I think </garnt>
<garnt> there's people who are like dude you </garnt>
<garnt> can't breathe in this thing that's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you can but when you're running </garnt>
<garnt> all right I there is definitely an </garnt>
<garnt> argument there yeah when you're trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get that amount of airflow I mean I I </garnt>
<garnt> think one of the biggest reasons I </garnt>
<garnt> stopped going to the gym when was </garnt>
<joey> because it just wasn't enjoyable </joey>
<garnt> yeah so it's just like especially me </garnt>
<garnt> doing cardio with my asthma as well I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like it's just it just stop being </garnt>
<joey> like you stop feeling like I was making </joey>
<joey> progress and you just felt like I was </joey>
<joey> tortured torturing myself and I was like </joey>
<joey> a big reason why I just stopped going </joey>
<joey> and then I was like I'll go in The Mask </joey>
<joey> mandate is lifted for the gym and it </joey>
<joey> just if it will ever at this point never </joey>
<garnt> did so I was like it's weird that it's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of kept on in the gym yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> I've genuinely thought the gym would be </garnt>
<garnt> one of the first places that they would </garnt>
<garnt> stop doing it because like in Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> schools and stuff right when they do </garnt>
<garnt> exercise they don't have to wear masks </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so I kind of thought oh okay </garnt>
<connor> well that's that's like a government </connor>
<garnt> kind of and again that's why it's so </garnt>
<garnt> annoying it's like be consistent with </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] yeah it's like if you're doing </garnt>
<garnt> physical exercise whether it's in a gym </garnt>
<garnt> whether it's in a schoolyard whether </garnt>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] out on the street you're </garnt>
<garnt> just running along the sidewalk it's </garnt>
<garnt> either mask on for everyone or mask on </garnt>
<connor> for no one yeah that's right I think you </connor>
<connor> know it's been kind of frustrating </connor>
<garnt> because at least in other countries us </garnt>
<garnt> and the UK it was kind of like on or off </garnt>
<garnt> it was like yeah we're telling you to </garnt>
<garnt> wear masks yeah or you don't wear masks </garnt>
<garnt> we're in Japan it's kind of like here </garnt>
<garnt> you do here you don't don't do it here </garnt>
<garnt> you have to wait for a moment here like </garnt>
<joey> the whole dance of like in Japan let's </joey>
<joey> say you're walking outside yeah and you </joey>
<joey> know you don't have to wear a mask </joey>
<joey> outside and then you can go inside say a </joey>
<joey> restaurant if you put your mask on for </joey>
<joey> like 10 seconds and then you sit down as </joey>
<joey> you're walking down the moon you sit </joey>
<joey> down you're allowed to take your mask </joey>
<connor> off yeah and then it's like okay what is </connor>
<joey> this </joey>
<garnt> because we all know once you sit down </garnt>
<garnt> covert's like oh wait yeah I'll wait </garnt>
<connor> till you finish your meal </connor>
<connor> yeah I don't know I don't get it again I </connor>
<joey> I don't think any of us are trying to </joey>
<garnt> come off as like complaining about like </garnt>
<garnt> like I think I'm I'm happy to comply and </garnt>
<garnt> wear a mask wherever is happy to help </garnt>
<garnt> and stop spread of it as long as rules </garnt>
<connor> are consistent yeah you just have some </connor>
<connor> goddamn consistency and make some </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] sense yeah and let me run </connor>
<connor> without a mask yeah exactly that's why </connor>
<connor> I've been trying to like cycle more </connor>
<connor> because I'm just like dude I'm so done </connor>
<connor> being like doing exercise inside you've </connor>
<garnt> leveled up you've gone from like indoor </garnt>
<garnt> exercise to like now outdoor exercise </garnt>
<connor> right but the one thing that's better </connor>
<connor> about indoor exercising it's way more </connor>
<connor> convenient yeah it's easier to keep </connor>
<garnt> track of let's say you know if you're </garnt>
<garnt> cycling you can't even like make a route </garnt>
<garnt> that comes back to your house yeah or </garnt>
<joey> wherever you are right it's kind of like </joey>
<connor> the Gym's easy you rock up run the </connor>
<joey> treadmill lift the rock well that's why </joey>
<joey> I just do weights at the gym now like if </joey>
<garnt> I'm doing just like cardio stuff I I </garnt>
<joey> have a [ __ ] indoor bike that in my </joey>
<garnt> house so I just I'm on that yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> we all did our health checkup recently </garnt>
<joey> didn't we I haven't done it yet you </joey>
<garnt> haven't done it I I missed myself </garnt>
<garnt> because I thought okay because like it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't my fault like on on the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> company slack it was like okay you're </garnt>
<garnt> Joey your [ __ ] one is on the the 21st </garnt>
<garnt> of November and I'm like all right got </garnt>
<garnt> it nailed it putting it in my calendar </garnt>
<garnt> put on both my calendars and I'm like </garnt>
<connor> all right I got this day locked all good </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I'm like the night before </connor>
<connor> I was like okay I should probably open </connor>
<connor> up the the papers just to you know </connor>

<garnt> shopping yet no don't remind me bro God </garnt>
<garnt> I just do you know what's like at this </garnt>
<garnt> stage do you know the question that's </garnt>
<garnt> scares me the most now it's not it's not </garnt>
<garnt> me asking people what they want to </garnt>
<garnt> Christmas or going Christmas shopping </garnt>
<garnt> but when you get to December and you get </garnt>
<garnt> about 10 questions from either your </garnt>
<garnt> friends or family asking you what do you </garnt>
<garnt> want for Christmas for Christmas I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like I have no [ __ ] clue </garnt>
<garnt> well that's why like my parents took the </garnt>
<garnt> easy route since like I was in high </garnt>
<garnt> school and they're just like here's some </garnt>
<garnt> cash just buy what you want and like you </garnt>
<garnt> know some people will be like oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> so like you know heartless like you know </garnt>
<garnt> your parents should be thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> what to get you you know like a gift and </garnt>
<garnt> you know making mean something and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like no if anything like I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what I want so like it's better if I </garnt>
<garnt> just get the cash and I just buy what I </garnt>
<garnt> want you know so it's whatever but like </garnt>
<garnt> I but if I do that for other people then </garnt>
<garnt> it pisses them off so I'm just like well </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] what am I supposed to do because </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so bad at buying gifts </garnt>
<joey> awful buying gifts but I realize I'm </joey>
<joey> also awful at buying gifts for myself </joey>
<joey> for myself yeah and I'm I'm like the </joey>
<garnt> number one culprit of like when someone </garnt>
<garnt> asks me what do I want I'm like I don't </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] know the problem with me as well </joey>
<joey> is that like because I either just want </joey>
<joey> like you know the things that I want the </joey>
<garnt> short list of things that I want in my </garnt>
<garnt> head for like the immediate future or </garnt>
<garnt> like the far future is always like the </garnt>
<garnt> two extremes right so it's like when </garnt>
<garnt> hockey's like oh what do you want for </garnt>
<garnt> for like as a gift you know what do you </garnt>
<garnt> want me to give you and I'm like ah I'm </garnt>
<garnt> debating between a house and a chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> bar </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like there's nothing in </garnt>
<garnt> between that I want it's like if I have </garnt>
<garnt> a house that'd be great yeah well get me </garnt>
<garnt> a moss block I kind of I'm craving a </garnt>
<joey> moss bar right now it's like well you </joey>
<garnt> know I know exactly what you mean like </garnt>
<joey> everything you want is not like </joey>
<joey> Christmas gift it's not it's not in the </joey>
<joey> budget yes it's not it's either too </joey>
<garnt> cheap or way too like or like a life </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] goal </connor>
<connor> what is that like the perfect price of a </connor>
<garnt> Christmas gift in your mind it depends </garnt>
<garnt> on who you're giving it to yeah right </garnt>
<connor> yeah because like I kind of tear it out </connor>
<garnt> in my hair yeah </garnt>
<connor> no I tear it out I'm like if it's family </connor>
<connor> members then okay you know the budget </connor>
<connor> can be I don't know anywhere between 50 </connor>
<garnt> to 200 right like depending on what it </garnt>
<garnt> is if it's like a mate right that you </garnt>
<garnt> you know you might see every now and </garnt>
<garnt> then like then you know you can usually </garnt>
<connor> get some pretty good gifts between like </connor>
<garnt> 20 25 dollars right yeah so that's </garnt>
<connor> that's what I kind of aim it to do but </connor>
<connor> then there's that mental game right of </connor>
<joey> like all right I'm getting my friend </joey>
<joey> something that's like around 25 what if </joey>
<joey> they give me something that's way more </joey>
<garnt> expensive it's the game of like </garnt>
<joey> Christmas chicken right it's it's like </joey>
<joey> you don't want to be that guy who just </joey>
<joey> gets like a really cheap gift and the </joey>
<joey> mate gets like a really expensive </joey>
<joey> exactly but also you don't want to be </joey>
<joey> that mate who's a bit overbearing and I </joey>
<garnt> was just like well got a gift that's way </garnt>
<garnt> too overly expensive you're right you </garnt>
<connor> know what I mean yeah it's tough I think </connor>
<connor> that I </connor>
<joey> in my mind is like let's say I got you </joey>
<joey> an 80 gift I got you a 200 gift yeah I </joey>
<joey> don't view it as okay I value God more </joey>
<joey> yeah so yeah maybe I found a gift that </joey>
<joey> was perfect for Joey that was 80 bucks </joey>
<joey> right that sucks that I found the </joey>
<joey> perfect gift for Grant there was more </joey>
<garnt> than I wanted to spend yeah but I don't </garnt>
<garnt> think God would ever buy it for himself </garnt>
<garnt> and I think this is a great gift so then </garnt>
<garnt> it's like okay in my head these two are </garnt>
<garnt> like both the perfect gift but obviously </garnt>
<garnt> the price is different yeah yeah so that </garnt>
<joey> that's how I kind of look at it yeah but </joey>
<connor> it's tough it is tough because then you </connor>
<joey> don't want they might not view it that </joey>
<joey> way yeah and especially like if you're </joey>
<joey> on the receiving end of that as well </joey>
<garnt> it's like oh you know oh my friend could </garnt>
<garnt> be like oh I got you this perfect gift </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a 200 wine decanter or </garnt>
<connor> something yeah oh I got you a tender </connor>
<garnt> stubby holder Merry Christmas it's like </garnt>
<joey> it's like it's like you know they like </joey>
<connor> that [ __ ] but it's like well I I think </connor>
<joey> it's all good when it seems like you </joey>
<joey> didn't put nearly as much effort as they </joey>
<joey> do oh yeah not necessarily monetarily </joey>
<joey> but like they're like oh yeah I put way </joey>
<connor> less thought into mine yeah and you put </connor>
<connor> way too much thought into yours the </connor>
<garnt> thing it's like oh the thing is there's </garnt>
<garnt> been points where I I have received like </garnt>
<connor> expensive gifts right but it's like </connor>
<connor> price isn't always the thing that's the </connor>
<connor> most valuable when it comes to like gift </connor>
<connor> giving if there's a gift that's perfect </connor>
<connor> for someone like it could be cheaper it </connor>
<garnt> could be more expensive I've like showed </garnt>
<garnt> out for like a gift that's more </garnt>
<connor> expensive when I think a mate would like </connor>
<connor> or make a family yeah </connor>
<garnt> we'd really really enjoy this and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that yeah um but also </garnt>
<garnt> I've received like cheap gifts that were </garnt>
<garnt> just like perfect for me </garnt>
<garnt> um that's that I could tell they put </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of thought into yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and I feel like there's that's the </garnt>
<garnt> real kind of </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's the real trickiness of </garnt>
<joey> like gift giving okay here's a question </joey>
<joey> I want to ask then do you guys like </joey>
<garnt> getting surprise gifts yeah </garnt>
<joey> I am no surprise as in like as in like </joey>
<joey> gifts where it's like you want exp it's </joey>
<joey> not like a even even if it's like </joey>
<connor> because like for me ever since I was a </connor>
<connor> kid whether it's like birthday or </connor>
<connor> Christmas or anything like that any kind </connor>
<connor> of Celebration I want to know what I'm </connor>
<garnt> getting </garnt>
<garnt> no I hate it I hate it yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> sorry you hate not knowing what you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna get yeah not knowing what I'm </garnt>
<joey> gonna I hate receiving surprise gifts </joey>
<connor> why </connor>
<joey> it makes me feel okay if there's one </joey>
<joey> thing that I hate even though even </joey>
<garnt> though I know it's even though I know </garnt>
<garnt> most people don't think like this right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this is just a me problem I just </garnt>
<garnt> hate feeling like I'm indebted okay </garnt>
<joey> like even if they expected nothing from </joey>
<garnt> Return they were just giving it to me </garnt>
<garnt> out of the kindness of my heart and I </garnt>
<connor> know it and I know that and I know the </connor>
<connor> surprise gift but what occasion okay </connor>
<connor> even even if it's like no occasion right </connor>
<connor> like it's like you know uh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> friend just came back from somewhere </connor>
<garnt> you're not expecting any kind of gift </garnt>
<garnt> but they're like hey I got you something </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like it's cool receiving it </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm like oh [ __ ] they care for </garnt>
<garnt> me yeah but now I feel bad because now </garnt>
<garnt> I'm indebted and I feel like I need to </garnt>
<joey> return the favor it is so nice if they </joey>
<connor> would be like yeah someone is giving </connor>
<connor> their surprise gift they're not the type </connor>
<connor> of person who would then expect </connor>
<garnt> something bad no no </garnt>
<connor> would you want the solution then to be </connor>
<connor> them not give you a gift what is the </connor>
<garnt> solution to this problem the solution </garnt>
<garnt> would be for me to like reprogram my </garnt>
<garnt> brain to not okay such a [ __ ] idiot </garnt>
<connor> so what do you prefer having this </connor>
<garnt> anxiety of debt or not receiving the </garnt>
<garnt> gift but like uh which one's more </garnt>
<joey> powerful </joey>
<joey> see that's the tough part right and </joey>
<garnt> that's why I think my solution </garnt>
<joey> personally is for me to be the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> to give special gifts no no that's </joey>
<joey> that's my my solution yeah my solution </joey>
<joey> if I give people gifts before me I will </joey>
<joey> never feel indebted that is my solution </joey>
<joey> and it's it's I mean I've had this Howie </joey>
<joey> this much of the same answer I've had </joey>
<joey> this before because I know Malin feels </joey>
<joey> the same way and every time I give </joey>
<joey> Maiden a gift she has the exact same </joey>
<joey> look in her eyes as I do when I receive </joey>
<garnt> the gift yeah I know I'm like it's like </garnt>
<joey> an Asian thing </joey>
<garnt> even if it was something that say like </garnt>
<garnt> they hand made it because I've received </garnt>
<garnt> like handmade gifts from like my friends </garnt>
<garnt> before right of like some cool [ __ ] and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like and and you know there's no </garnt>
<garnt> monetary value to that because it's not </garnt>
<garnt> something they bought right it's </garnt>
<garnt> something they've made right so I think </garnt>
<garnt> it's more so just the fact that they </garnt>
<garnt> went through the effort to think about </garnt>
<garnt> me and to get something that they think </garnt>
<garnt> I would like yeah that makes me feel bad </garnt>
<joey> no it's it's not it's not even it's not </joey>
<joey> even does that make sense to me it's not </joey>
<garnt> even like anything to do with like </garnt>
<garnt> monetary value or anything like that it </garnt>
<joey> could be like a one dollar thing I'd </joey>
<garnt> still feel bad </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> if you uh </garnt>
<garnt> if for me like </garnt>
<garnt> if you need to borrow like five pounds </garnt>
<garnt> five dollars off of me yeah does do you </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember that [ __ ] and you were </garnt>
<garnt> like I am going to pay this back one day </garnt>
<connor> or can it sometimes like oh absolutely I </connor>
<connor> I make a like a subconscious thing of </connor>
<connor> like okay uh you know next time you're </connor>
<connor> paying I'll be like oh yeah by the way </connor>
<connor> yeah you owe me five bucks but I'll be </connor>
<connor> like just whatever figure it out I keep </connor>
<connor> a very rough balance in my head of who </connor>
<joey> who's oh is what no if I if I borrow </joey>
<garnt> money off anyone I like write that [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> down on my phone I'm like I owe this </garnt>
<garnt> person this much money yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like I'm a [ __ ] Lannister the </garnt>
<garnt> debt is being paid no no shame whether </garnt>
<connor> they like it or not I find that people </connor>
<joey> are way more forgetful when it's like oh </joey>
<joey> hey I'll get you a coffee and then you </joey>
<garnt> don't think like oh he spent five bucks </garnt>
<garnt> like he got me a coffee and then it's </garnt>
<garnt> very easy to forget that someone got you </garnt>
<garnt> a coffee even though that's the exact </garnt>
<garnt> same monetary value Plus work of </garnt>
<garnt> bringing it to you yeah yeah so like </garnt>
<garnt> that that's harder to keep track of </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah then that's normally how what </garnt>
<garnt> you you have like the the </garnt>
<garnt> um the very casual balance sheet between </garnt>
<joey> you and your friend that's in your head </joey>
<joey> it's like okay he bought me five coffees </joey>
<joey> I am three drinks or something you know </joey>
<joey> right yeah so you kind of like pay it </joey>
<joey> back right that's how I'm more so like </joey>
<joey> because when do I actually need to </joey>
<joey> borrow cash I don't it's like can you </joey>
<garnt> get this drink yeah yeah yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> more so what my life comes down when </garnt>
<garnt> have you when's the last time you ever </garnt>
<garnt> asked for cash </garnt>
<connor> I mean like a very long time I did like </connor>
<garnt> a week ago yeah but I paid it back like </garnt>
<garnt> immediately yeah yeah but that that's me </garnt>
<connor> as well when that's like 500 bucks </connor>
<connor> that's different </connor>
<joey> it's not it's not it's not quite though </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<connor> can you you've got a spare tennis I have </connor>
<connor> the same energy of like can I have the </connor>
<garnt> 500 bucks and I'll give it you back oh </garnt>
<connor> my God it sounds like a car was because </connor>
<garnt> I forgot to get ATM out of the crane </garnt>
<connor> game all right okay 500 bucks for crane </connor>
<garnt> games right now yeah I'll pay you back </garnt>
<garnt> later I don't know where this came from </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't matter if it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> surprise gift or even if it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> a casual favor or something if I if I </garnt>
<garnt> feel like oh someone a favor they're </garnt>
<garnt> like that that that keeps me up at night </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm just like when I'm when is </garnt>
<joey> this when am I gonna feel like okay I'm </joey>
<joey> 100 comes down to uh viewer money though </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure and how you how you </joey>
<joey> valued because you know time equals </joey>
<joey> money yes we I think you don't want </joey>
<garnt> someone's time energy or like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> money and how you viewed it and how </garnt>
<garnt> you've been brought up viewing it I </garnt>
<garnt> think it definitely ties into that like </garnt>
<garnt> if you look back at how you were taught </garnt>
<garnt> about money it's probably the same kind </garnt>
<connor> of mindset as like um now with the gift </connor>
<connor> giving of like right if somebody gives </connor>
<connor> you something you give it back yes you </connor>
<joey> know if somebody I mean that is like </joey>
<garnt> super ingrained into Japanese yeah okay </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it's money I just what was </garnt>
<connor> that was that of a distilled into you </connor>
<connor> where money if someone lends you money </connor>
<connor> or you work you have to work for your </connor>
<connor> money you have to do like I think all </connor>
<connor> comes down to that where you put a </connor>
<connor> certain value on time and money in your </connor>
<connor> head because you're because you're </connor>
<connor> raised to and you value that and so I </connor>
<connor> think that that carries on in in odd </connor>
<garnt> ways and odd course I think that's right </garnt>
<garnt> no I I I I I don't think so because to </garnt>
<garnt> me I'm I'm like trying to like </garnt>
<garnt> psychoanalyze myself right now I never </garnt>
<garnt> want to feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not valuing our friendship or our </garnt>
<garnt> relationship as much as they value I I </garnt>
<garnt> never want them to feel like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> value our friendship or our relationship </garnt>
<garnt> as much as I do so whenever someone goes </garnt>
<garnt> out of their way to do something nice </garnt>
<garnt> for me I'm like that that's I you know </garnt>
<connor> I'm [ __ ] touch because I'm like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> but yeah but then I guess that that </connor>
<connor> means you're then you're saying that the </connor>
<connor> value of the friendship or what value </connor>
<connor> you bring to it is is you can Define it </connor>
<connor> with objects or monetary like value just </connor>
<garnt> saying if you give me a gift and I don't </garnt>
<garnt> give you one back I didn't value the </garnt>
<garnt> friendship as much as you whereas I </garnt>
<garnt> disagree because a lot of people can get </garnt>
<garnt> way more fulfilling things out of a </garnt>
<garnt> friendship like you might have like </garnt>
<garnt> let's say you know you've helped me out </garnt>
<garnt> way more than you realize and then I </garnt>
<garnt> give you a gift in my head that's not me </garnt>
<garnt> saying hey now you owe me one it's like </garnt>
<garnt> no no I know that a lot yeah but that's </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm saying like that means you're </garnt>
<garnt> viewing it the way you're subconsciously </garnt>
<connor> looking at it is like okay there is this </connor>
<joey> has value and this is how the Friendship </joey>
<joey> works I think I think I think is tied to </joey>
<joey> the whole there might be a little bit of </joey>
<joey> that but I think in my head there's more </joey>
<joey> so the matter of like I would rather you </joey>
<joey> spend that money and time on yourself or </joey>
<connor> other people other than me yeah because </connor>
<connor> you guys said you feel bad </connor>
<joey> I feel bad because I in my head I'm like </joey>
<garnt> that could be a gift or a money span or </garnt>
<garnt> time spent finding that gift or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> or time spent making the money to buy </garnt>
<connor> that gift that you could use on yourself </connor>
<connor> or other people in your life sure </connor>
<connor> appreciation yeah yeah and that's why </connor>
<garnt> and that's why like that's that's what I </garnt>
<garnt> mean by I feel bad because it's like I </garnt>
<garnt> already for the most time I already </garnt>
<garnt> value the relationship that I have with </garnt>
<garnt> this person just them being a maiden </garnt>
<garnt> then you know [ __ ] with me right and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<connor> you know like you know them like you </connor>
<connor> know [ __ ] vibing with me right it's </connor>
<garnt> like just the fact that you're my friend </garnt>
<garnt> is like more than enough for me right so </garnt>
<garnt> it's like I would rather as a friend I </garnt>
<garnt> would rather you I mean I appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> getting the gift no matter how much it </garnt>
<connor> costs right no matter how quick or long </connor>
<connor> it took to get that gift but in my head </connor>
<connor> I'm like I already appreciate you enough </connor>
<connor> as a friend and as a friend I would </connor>
<connor> rather see you use that time and money </connor>
<joey> on other people than me yeah because I </joey>
<connor> don't need it so you know for the most </connor>
<connor> part yeah yeah I agree with that </connor>
<connor> um I think </connor>
<connor> so going back to like I think a lot of </connor>
<garnt> everyone has a different thing that they </garnt>
<garnt> really put a lot of weight on you know I </garnt>
<garnt> think that like as I've got older uh and </garnt>
<garnt> had to balance more friendships and seen </garnt>
<garnt> how they work in more adult situations </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like okay some people when they like </garnt>
<garnt> really appreciate a friendship they'll </garnt>
<garnt> go out there they make gifts some people </garnt>
<garnt> will go out of their way to arrange a </garnt>
<garnt> really cool hangout and they'll do </garnt>
<garnt> everything right yeah some people really </garnt>
<garnt> value maybe how quickly you text back or </garnt>
<garnt> how quickly you stay in touch right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like everyone has like value that </garnt>
<garnt> they assign to certain things yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just about being an adult is trying </garnt>
<garnt> to figure out hey this friend he really </garnt>
<garnt> likes it when I reply to text quickly or </garnt>
<garnt> this friend really appreciates it when I </garnt>
<garnt> give them a gift that you know they </garnt>
<garnt> didn't think about or this friend really </garnt>
<garnt> appreciates it when I take them out for </garnt>
<garnt> a good time and so I think it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like you're probably in a different </garnt>
<garnt> category where you value something else </garnt>
<garnt> more in a friendship than a gift yes and </garnt>
<garnt> to you a gift seems like oh [ __ ] I gotta </garnt>
<connor> I have to give this back to show that I </connor>
<connor> appreciate you where it's like no I can </connor>
<connor> I would normally show it in my own way </connor>
<connor> which might be I'll hang out with you </connor>
<connor> and chat with you for hours and yeah </connor>
<connor> you're the first person I want to go to </connor>
<joey> for this type of topology you know what </joey>
<joey> I mean yeah it's weird it's it's cheesy </joey>
<garnt> but it's like to me it's like your </garnt>
<connor> presence is a gift me too me right it's </connor>
<garnt> like it's like just the fact that you're </garnt>
<garnt> there and you're my friend I agree more </garnt>
<garnt> than anything it's it's cheesy but I </garnt>
<joey> feel the exact same way when I'm just </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] I've just just just being </garnt>
<joey> around me is enough of them that you're </joey>
<joey> my friend is like all that I could ask </joey>
<connor> for I'm sure you've probably met that </connor>
<connor> type of person who's always buying gifts </connor>
<garnt> even though like they're broke yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and like that's just like I think that's </garnt>
<garnt> just like a personality trait where yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they really value being able to </garnt>
<garnt> physically show that they they enjoy the </garnt>
<garnt> friendship or whatever it is yeah that's </garnt>
<joey> how in their head it's like fulfilling </joey>
<connor> to kind of give back like physically </connor>
<joey> with like an item by the way is there </joey>
<joey> any friends of ours watching this </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<garnt> I say if </garnt>
<garnt> you give I'm not gonna be like get the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] out of here right like I'll take it </garnt>
<garnt> but like </garnt>
<garnt> I'll take it okay just know that you </garnt>
<connor> don't have to here's the thing no no no </connor>
<garnt> we're all pretty we all do pretty pretty </garnt>
<connor> good money-wise yes it becomes way </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] harder to buy gifts to people </connor>
<garnt> who can buy things yes this has been a </garnt>
<connor> me issue no matter what </connor>
<joey> I said let's say I have all the money in </joey>
<joey> the world how do I buy you a gift card </joey>
<garnt> when I know if you want something you're </garnt>
<garnt> just gonna buy it </garnt>
<garnt> cause you can afford it but that's why </garnt>
<connor> that's why I I'm not going up to to </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] stupid money yeah I'm not going </joey>
<joey> to do that but that's why again I value </joey>
<garnt> just like you being there and when I </garnt>
<garnt> need you or you know when you want to </garnt>
<garnt> hang out and stuff like that I I value </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of relationship in a </garnt>
<joey> friendship so much more than I ever have </joey>
<garnt> in my life yeah like okay I think I </garnt>
<garnt> think this goes back to like another </garnt>
<garnt> thing as well I don't know if this is </garnt>
<garnt> like Anyway related right but I think </garnt>
<garnt> one thing I've always just not hated but </garnt>
<garnt> just felt a little bit uncomfortable </garnt>
<garnt> with was kind of like being the center </garnt>
<connor> of attention and I I I don't know it's a </connor>
<garnt> podcast I don't know how ironic this is </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how ironic this is you're </garnt>
<garnt> about 130 episodes </garnt>
<garnt> I still had a bunch of shows but I </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hate being the center of </garnt>
<garnt> attention I don't know because like </garnt>
<joey> there's a very clear distinction between </joey>
<joey> a center of attention when performing </joey>
<joey> yeah and the center of attention in your </joey>
<joey> personal life yes and to me right I love </joey>
<joey> being the center of attention when I'm </joey>
<joey> when I'm I'm performing or doing stuff </joey>
<joey> I'm sure we all do yeah well it's ego </joey>
<garnt> stroke very nice yeah personal life it's </garnt>
<garnt> like all right sometimes yeah sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> no yeah I sometimes like it sometimes </garnt>
<connor> I'm like no yeah yeah but like for </connor>
<connor> example for example what I mean for </connor>
<connor> example like birthday parties right like </connor>
<garnt> do do you like having a birthday party </garnt>
<connor> for your birthday specifically set up </connor>
<connor> all right all right for you I got an </connor>
<connor> opinion right right you know what I mean </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean no I think the </connor>
<garnt> birthday party the entire Vibe is up to </garnt>
<garnt> whoever's organizing it or you yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> you can make a birthday party feel like </garnt>
<garnt> a normal party just with the excuse that </garnt>
<garnt> it's my birthday yeah you know and </garnt>
<garnt> that's how I like it where it's like hey </garnt>
<garnt> let's all get together it's just an </garnt>
<garnt> excuse to get everyone in the same room </garnt>
<joey> yeah I'm not about to be like hey guys </joey>
<joey> let's toast to me tell me what you love </joey>
<joey> about me show me your presence there are </joey>
<joey> people like that but I don't know and </joey>
<garnt> that's where I'm like bro come on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I I love that Vibe like that </garnt>
<connor> birthday party Vibe where it's just like </connor>
<connor> any excuse for everyone </connor>
<connor> together everyone you come out in the </connor>
<connor> same room and just hang out but I've </connor>
<garnt> also had birthday parties and been to </garnt>
<garnt> birthday parties where it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> guys it's this guy's birthday guys </garnt>
<garnt> so this guy's and I just I I hate that </garnt>
<garnt> feeling having a day that is just </garnt>
<garnt> centered around you basically I just I </garnt>
<garnt> just I it was I think it's selfish it </garnt>
<garnt> was something that just never I never </garnt>
<garnt> felt comfortable with you know what I </garnt>
<joey> mean you see it's selfish and I think </joey>
<joey> like a lot of people argue being like </joey>
<connor> well it's the one day of the year you </connor>
<connor> can be selfish no right so you know </connor>
<garnt> everyone's having a birthday 24 7. you </garnt>
<garnt> know what I mean you're not special </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah you can have a day why are you </garnt>
<garnt> gonna make the day about you all right </garnt>
<garnt> like you can it can be your day without </garnt>
<garnt> me without putting down everyone else </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah before someone turns out to </garnt>
<joey> your party they're probably doing chores </joey>
<joey> doing laundry they don't give fact that </joey>
<joey> it's your birthday you know what I mean </joey>
<joey> like everyone's just you know hey I'll </joey>
<garnt> especially as an adult I just think that </garnt>
<connor> like you it can be your day without </connor>
<joey> making it like everyone you forcing on </joey>
<joey> everyone else that it's your day yes </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah I agree I think you can have a </joey>
<connor> nice day have the perfect day you want </connor>
<connor> yeah but you know just just let that see </connor>
<joey> like that's what I that's what I really </joey>
<joey> appreciated about my birthday this year </joey>
<garnt> right because like it was while we're on </garnt>
<garnt> tour and we were doing a show in Ohio </garnt>
<garnt> of all days and uh </garnt>
<garnt> and like and to me that was like the </garnt>
<garnt> perfect scenario for like a birthday </garnt>
<garnt> party right because it was like it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like the entire show was about oh </garnt>
<garnt> it's Joey's birthday today [ __ ] it </garnt>
<garnt> was like just a thing that was just </garnt>
<garnt> tacked on at the end I didn't even </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] know about it I got a python in </garnt>
<garnt> my face yeah </garnt>
<garnt> in my opinion that was like the best </garnt>
<garnt> birthday party yeah because it's like I </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't the center of attention I was </garnt>
<joey> just like a little tack on thing where </joey>
<garnt> it's like by the way yeah it's Joey's </garnt>
<garnt> butt yeah you know because the re the </garnt>
<garnt> reason I bring that up is you know </garnt>
<garnt> having a day centered around you gives </garnt>
<joey> me the same kind of feeling of just like </joey>
<joey> getting a surprise gift or something </joey>
<joey> where it's just like I I'm getting now </joey>
<joey> all the eyes are on you yeah yeah I'm </joey>
<joey> I'm getting attention from like people </joey>
<joey> around me and everything like that and </joey>
<joey> I'm just like I I was just comfortable </joey>
<joey> just chilling and just just hanging out </joey>
<joey> and not saying it's exactly the same </joey>
<joey> thing like I'm trying to like trying to </joey>
<garnt> like understand why but I'm just saying </garnt>
<garnt> kind of gives me like the same feeling </garnt>
<garnt> of just like oh I didn't expect this um </garnt>
<garnt> not that I'm ungrateful about it it's </garnt>
<garnt> just I don't know how to handle it or </garnt>
<garnt> deal with it and that's completely just </garnt>
<garnt> a me thing it's it's a complete judgment </garnt>
<connor> like that as well yes I was gonna say I </connor>
<garnt> was like because it feels like weirdly </garnt>
<connor> like it's very easy to be like hey I'm </connor>
<connor> on camera all day I got so much </connor>
<garnt> attention I'm like this time </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna have some attention today </garnt>
<garnt> meanwhile I post 15 Vlogs and then </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] stream for six seconds you know </garnt>
<garnt> what I mean like I feel like it's a bit </garnt>
<garnt> ironic for me to be like no I'm good I </garnt>
<garnt> was like you know I think I get enough </garnt>
<joey> in my mind is probably it is pretty stem </joey>
<joey> from I get enough attention I'm chill </joey>
<joey> with that yeah yeah but I wonder if I </joey>
<connor> didn't do this would I want more </connor>
<joey> attention I think yeah no I've been kind </joey>
<joey> of the same as like not not ever since I </joey>
<joey> was a kid or anything because I feel </joey>
<connor> like it's not up until a certain age </connor>
<connor> where you become self-aware about that </connor>
<connor> kind of [ __ ] where you start you realize </connor>
<connor> being like Oh okay maybe I don't want </connor>
<connor> all the attention for my like you know </connor>
<connor> because like when you're [ __ ] the </connor>
<connor> inverse yeah well like when you're </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] five years old right like you're </connor>
<connor> not gonna be like guys play pins on me </connor>
<connor> I'm not I'm not the host or anything </connor>
<connor> just go have fun like you know of course </connor>
<connor> you know like you don't have that kind </connor>
<connor> of self-awareness but like it's not </connor>
<connor> until I feel like you're around I want </connor>
<connor> to say like 13 14 like when you enter </connor>
<connor> like high school or middle school where </connor>
<connor> you start to realize you either turn </connor>
<joey> into the kid that wants to be the center </joey>
<connor> of attention or you turn into the kid </connor>
<joey> that doesn't yeah man I had this </joey>
<garnt> fantastic English teacher okay I was </garnt>
<joey> just right she was like the best English </joey>
<joey> teacher man was she angry though like </joey>
<joey> but like you know when some I don't know </joey>
<joey> if you ever had these teachers then they </joey>
<joey> they were super angry but not because </joey>
<joey> they were just life wasn't going their </joey>
<joey> way they were [ __ ] angry because you </joey>
<joey> weren't listening and they were very </joey>
<garnt> passionate about it right right she </garnt>
<joey> cared so much about English and teaching </joey>
<garnt> it yeah and it was like she was </garnt>
<garnt> terrifying she was by far the scariest </garnt>
<garnt> teacher like all the like everyone was </garnt>
<garnt> scared of her and she used to go off and </garnt>
<garnt> I for some reason you always stuck with </garnt>
<garnt> me it was like if a kid was like making </garnt>
<garnt> noise and [ __ ] she would just tear into </garnt>
<garnt> them in front of the whole class and be </garnt>
<garnt> like oh </garnt>
<garnt> oh Charlie is it because you don't have </garnt>
<garnt> enough attention at home that you want </garnt>
<garnt> to try and get some attention in the </garnt>
<connor> classroom </connor>
<garnt> she would just destroy them go into them </garnt>
<garnt> that's all with these kids I'm like 12. </garnt>
<joey> oh [ __ ] hell that's something when a </joey>
<connor> kid traumatized kid would just like do </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] she'd be she would always just </connor>
<connor> rinse how they wanted attention they </connor>
<connor> weren't getting it at home so it's like </connor>
<connor> oh so you're not getting enough at home </connor>
<connor> so you decide to ruin my classroom </connor>
<connor> trying to get attention then your </connor>
<connor> pathetic life or something like that you </connor>
<connor> go off dude excuse me holy [ __ ] she's </connor>
<connor> awesome she was so good at teaching </connor>
<garnt> English yeah it's very fun okay no I get </garnt>
<connor> it now I okay yeah I'm I'm proud of the </connor>
<connor> code so the point was that yeah they're </connor>
<garnt> stuck with me and the kids want </garnt>
<garnt> attention and that you realize you don't </garnt>
<garnt> want attention to what you do and what </garnt>
<garnt> you're doing yeah okay that's why I </garnt>
<garnt> brought that out right what what up what </garnt>
<garnt> gives me happiness </garnt>
<connor> God is justlyn right now he's like I </connor>
<connor> figured out yeah I've I've just I've </connor>
<garnt> just been it's like Will Smith I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like why I've just been trying to like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] psychoanalyze my mind to be like </garnt>
<garnt> why am I so why am I such a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> idiot why am I so [ __ ] difficult with </garnt>
<garnt> the simplest of things right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah for me like what actually gives </garnt>
<garnt> me happiness is making the people around </garnt>
<connor> me happy seeing the people around me </connor>
<connor> happy so when protagonists so so when so </connor>
<connor> when the goal is to make me happy and to </connor>
<garnt> like when people are like actively </garnt>
<garnt> trying to make me happy by just doing a </garnt>
<garnt> nice thing or something that just feels </garnt>
<garnt> weird to me because my happiness comes </garnt>
<garnt> from just seeing people around me happy </garnt>
<joey> right yeah that is the most harm </joey>
<garnt> protagonists </garnt>
<joey> happiness comes from giving you a gift </joey>
<garnt> that's the Paradox I'm stuck in right </garnt>
<connor> now Connor I don't know how to escape </connor>
<connor> by being upset about receiving the gift </connor>
<garnt> you're making them upsets </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad you feel better no I feel </garnt>
<connor> pressured you feel pressured yeah maybe </connor>
<connor> you gotta make them upset yeah maybe </connor>
<garnt> actually it's it's and again that's why </garnt>
<garnt> it's a mean problem it's it's literally </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like like I said I'm not upset it's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like you just break me where you </garnt>
<garnt> just putting me into like a logic Loop </garnt>
<garnt> right I'm just like I don't know what to </garnt>
<garnt> feel I know I should feel free and then </garnt>
<garnt> like and then like I get blue screens </garnt>
<garnt> that's me with social interaction like </garnt>
<connor> yeah I don't know it's it's I always try </connor>
<garnt> and like psychoanalyze and try and </garnt>
<garnt> figure out why the [ __ ] I like think </garnt>
<garnt> certain ways or do certain things I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah what what made me think this </garnt>
<garnt> way because yeah you hear what other </garnt>
<joey> people think and I'm like oh why do I </joey>
<joey> not why do I not yeah why do I not think </joey>
<joey> that way yeah why do I not why like why </joey>
<connor> is it where that I differed in terms of </connor>
<garnt> that yeah trying to figure it out and </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's normally always something I'm </connor>
<connor> trying to I'm trying to think if there's </connor>
<garnt> like a weird birthday party in my </garnt>
<garnt> childhood that just traumatized me and </garnt>
<garnt> to have like my own birthday but did you </garnt>
<garnt> guys ever have like your own like </garnt>
<connor> special birthday parties as a kid I </connor>
<connor> don't know if that's like a thing right </connor>
<joey> yeah I'm just trying to think it might </joey>
<joey> maybe the way I thought about it is that </joey>
<garnt> like I used to have a childhood friend </garnt>
<connor> who had a birthday two days before mine </connor>
<garnt> right and so a lot of birthday parties </garnt>
<connor> were joint books I remember this yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah so that might maybe be like a </joey>
<joey> subconscious reason I don't want to be </joey>
<connor> the center of attention this was in the </connor>
<joey> age where like you don't get to choose </joey>
<garnt> who's coming to the birthday party yeah </garnt>
<joey> everyone invites everywhere yeah I have </joey>
<connor> like really weird memories like very </connor>
<garnt> vague though </garnt>
<garnt> I [ __ ] know why it's because my </garnt>
<garnt> birthday is like end of May which is </garnt>
<garnt> deep during exam season no matter what </garnt>
<connor> before that before what about before </connor>
<joey> that yeah before example like when </joey>
<joey> you're in like elementary school because </joey>
<connor> my birthday was in summer so I never got </connor>
<connor> to spend it anyone I was like yeah </connor>
<garnt> so I just got I just got used to never </garnt>
<garnt> having a birthday party for a lot of my </garnt>
<garnt> like I say teenage years especially </garnt>
<connor> right yeah I didn't have any you didn't </connor>
<garnt> I think I had like really tiny ones with </garnt>
<connor> like the close friends because when it's </connor>
<connor> in school you can do like much bigger </connor>
<garnt> ones yeah because like you I yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> would go to like people's birthday party </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone would be there and then </garnt>
<garnt> you just got used to like oh okay you </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to have like a birthday party or </garnt>
<garnt> something well sorry revising for exams </garnt>
<joey> or sorry way on holiday or something </joey>
<joey> like that I'm just trying to think I </joey>
<joey> literally can't remember a single </joey>
<joey> birthday party between the age of 10 and </joey>
<garnt> 18. I'm trying to remember because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember those birthday parties I </garnt>
<garnt> remember are the most extravagant and </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen yeah I think sausage rolls </garnt>
<connor> that they felt like the most extravagant </connor>
<connor> because I've always like sausage rolls </connor>
<connor> and crisps and then like some like a </connor>
<connor> sandwich to just like dig in did you </connor>
<garnt> ever like did you ever like ever have </garnt>
<garnt> like a birthday party where you went to </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] McDonald's or like some </garnt>
<garnt> place yes </garnt>
<garnt> the McDonald's flavor yo that was the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> hell yeah there was no playpen really we </connor>
<joey> had to play pen like 10 minutes drive </joey>
<garnt> from my house and that was like where </garnt>
<connor> I'd say up until maybe the age of </connor>
<garnt> six or seven was like just just </garnt>
<joey> McDonald's playpen party and then a </joey>
<connor> genius branding of them I think after </connor>
<connor> that I [ __ ] love McDonald's from age </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] City yeah and then literally </joey>
<joey> yeah the other birthday party that I </joey>
<garnt> remember really vividly was uh I went to </garnt>
<garnt> I I think it was like seven or eight it </garnt>
<garnt> was like right after the playpen era um </garnt>
<garnt> the playpen Arc of my birthdays it was </garnt>
<garnt> uh my dad organized a day where we went </garnt>
<garnt> to go see the premiere of Finding Nemo </garnt>
<garnt> let's hope yeah and so my dad would make </garnt>
<garnt> these like invitation cards right and he </garnt>
<garnt> would send them off to like the parents </garnt>
<connor> like and being like you have been </connor>
<connor> invited this is the exclusive </connor>
<garnt> Joey's eighth birthday premiere of the </garnt>
<garnt> red carpet of finding [ __ ] Nemo and </garnt>
<garnt> and then literally just after that it's </garnt>
<connor> just a blank period of I don't remember </connor>
<garnt> what my birthday buddy and then when I </garnt>
<joey> was my 18th birthday party I just got </joey>
<connor> stupidly wasted I mean actually you know </connor>
<connor> what I think about it I can barely </connor>
<joey> remember anything from my childhood </joey>
<joey> that's a problem that's a different </joey>
<connor> problem that's straight up I'm thinking </connor>
<connor> about it now I can I can scarcely </connor>
<connor> remember I I have bits and pieces well </connor>
<joey> you remember you're a member of like all </joey>
<joey> the I think everything you've talked </joey>
<joey> about you're concerning your childhood </joey>
<connor> has all been on trash days right like </connor>
<connor> just like a lot of core memories like </connor>
<joey> beating the French kid yeah that's a </joey>
<connor> very cool memory yeah I have a bunch of </connor>
<connor> other scattered memories but I couldn't </connor>
<garnt> tell you what that's well that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> why trash days is such a weird entity </garnt>
<garnt> because most of the time I don't </garnt>
<connor> remember this [ __ ] and then we're having </connor>
<connor> like this random ass conversation and </connor>
<garnt> they're just like [ __ ] like I just </garnt>
<connor> get a flashback yeah some birthday </connor>
<connor> parties I just started getting like </connor>
<connor> flashbacks too and I was like oh yeah I </connor>
<garnt> remember one of the hypest things </garnt>
<garnt> because like </garnt>
<garnt> um you know I mean I might think about </garnt>
<garnt> my parents weren't like broke or </garnt>
<garnt> anything but my mama just didn't believe </garnt>
<garnt> in spending money on certain things yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> um I'll put it that way I'm almost gonna </garnt>
<garnt> kill me </garnt>
<garnt> um so like if we ever went to the cinema </garnt>
<joey> it was like no you're not allowed to get </joey>
<garnt> any of the snacks or anything like that </garnt>
<joey> oh [ __ ] no not at all right just get to </joey>
<garnt> come in and we'll bring maybe a snack or </garnt>
<garnt> two from Tesco's or something yeah which </garnt>
<garnt> is fair enough I think that's yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> know if I want to get that yeah but I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when Goblet of Fire came out I </garnt>
<garnt> got to go and so on my friends birthday </garnt>
<garnt> parties to go and watch it yeah and they </garnt>
<garnt> were like hey any of the sweets whatever </garnt>
<garnt> you want and I was like what </garnt>
<garnt> for real and that was like the hype </garnt>
<garnt> issue that was generally the highlight </garnt>
<joey> of like my young like life I just </joey>
<joey> remember that [ __ ] so much oh man how </joey>
<joey> awesome that was that was so good the </joey>
<joey> other like Ben and Jerry's pick and mix </joey>
<joey> oh I wish I never go outside not even </joey>
<connor> birthday parties but it wasn't me I had </connor>
<connor> to go to one of the rich kids to get it </connor>
<joey> yeah I didn't even think like I had a </joey>
<connor> rich kid friend who did that or anything </connor>
<connor> like I just remember when I was like I </connor>
<connor> was a last minute because someone else </connor>
<connor> checked out oh okay </connor>
<connor> I feel that you kidding me kidding me </connor>
<connor> because the other thing I remember about </connor>
<garnt> like Cinemas is like we used to the the </garnt>
<garnt> supermarket below the cinema we used to </garnt>
<garnt> just buy a shitload of like candies and </garnt>
<garnt> chips and stuff like that just shove </garnt>
<connor> them in someone's bag and you weren't </connor>
<garnt> allowed to do it yeah yeah and like I </garnt>
<connor> remember one of like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> managers I guess or whatever was just </connor>
<connor> like you know someone in like the 40s or </connor>
<connor> 50s whatever was just like what year </connor>
<joey> it's like pointed to my friend with the </joey>
<joey> bag and he's like what's in there my </joey>
<joey> friend's like </joey>
<joey> jacket like why are you going to jackets </joey>
<garnt> like it's cold in the cinema it's like </garnt>
<joey> all right well he I think he knew but he </joey>
<connor> was like you're 14 years </connor>
<connor> why would you I I bro I don't wanna I </connor>
<joey> was like I'm sorry bro I'm not paying 12 </joey>
<joey> for a [ __ ] box pump like if somebody </joey>
<connor> is going to links to bring snacks in </connor>
<joey> they they were never gonna buy the </joey>
<garnt> popcorn yeah exactly so you've taken </garnt>
<garnt> away their snacks or not laying them in </garnt>
<garnt> it's not gonna make them buy popcorn </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe like one out of ten but like </garnt>
<connor> is that really the you really want to </connor>
<garnt> piss everyone off yeah I don't know it's </garnt>
<garnt> also like to do with birthdays I don't </garnt>
<garnt> think like I never had like that rich </garnt>
<garnt> friends but did you have that rich </garnt>
<garnt> person in your classroom who wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> exactly a friend but for their birthday </garnt>
<garnt> party they just invited everyone in </garnt>
<garnt> their class yeah yeah yeah oh I didn't </garnt>
<connor> have that did you never have no most of </connor>
<connor> people invited everyone I wish because </connor>
<connor> you know they were these type of kids </connor>
<connor> that would have bouncy castles </connor>
<garnt> this is this is on another [ __ ] level </garnt>
<garnt> man yo you go there like they bought </garnt>
<joey> their friendship man you know bro I'm </joey>
<garnt> jealous I would have milked the [ __ ] out </garnt>
<garnt> of him if that was the case I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> have that at all because like I think </garnt>
<garnt> like bouncy castles and stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> like it was never like a birthday thing </garnt>
<garnt> it was always like uh like like a local </garnt>
<garnt> like Carnival type of thing where it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like like twice a year in this </garnt>
<joey> random open field they'd just be like </joey>
<joey> yeah let's just see what happens if we </joey>
<connor> put 20 bouncy castles here you know I </connor>
<connor> have so many memories scattered of like </connor>
<garnt> being forced to go to like dinners with </garnt>
<garnt> people my parents I don't I have no idea </garnt>

<garnt> parents they would always have like I </garnt>
<connor> don't know like my family is big but </connor>
<connor> what's even bigger is my family's </connor>
<joey> Network so I would always have like yeah </joey>
<joey> my mum would always have a friends that </joey>
<joey> she could visit or well my dad would </joey>
<joey> have like a friend in Thailand or in </joey>
<joey> England that they were visiting </joey>
<joey> obviously when I was a kid I would have </joey>
<garnt> to go with them all right I would go to </garnt>
<garnt> the I would go to my parents friend's </garnt>
<garnt> house and I just remember like the my </garnt>
<garnt> biggest thing was just </garnt>
<garnt> it was the one place I didn't want to be </garnt>
<garnt> because I was like why you take me away </garnt>
<joey> from my [ __ ] games to make me sit </joey>
<joey> down and drink tea and go to this house </joey>
<joey> or whatever and just sit here and do the </joey>
<joey> people I don't know don't talk to people </joey>
<joey> I don't know you know yeah that's </joey>
<joey> horrible but did I remember do you </joey>
<joey> remember like how easy it was to </joey>
<connor> entertain yourself when you were a kid </connor>
<connor> oh yeah I don't know a lot of memories </connor>
<connor> of being bored I'm trying to remember </connor>
<connor> because I all I can remember is being </connor>
<connor> bored but then I think about it and I </connor>
<connor> look at Kids now and I'm just like man I </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I [ __ ] miss being a kid where </garnt>
<joey> it was like just so easy to like </joey>
<joey> entertain yourself and I tried to think </joey>
<joey> back I think I'm not entertained tonight </joey>
<garnt> kids have it easy now yeah yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> that because of all the technology they </garnt>
<joey> have access to right like we had what a </joey>
<joey> Game Boy Advance maybe if you were lucky </joey>
<connor> if your parents love you enough so </connor>
<connor> there'd be some things where my parents </connor>
<joey> wouldn't let me take the Game Boy and </joey>
<joey> they wanted me to like kind of interact </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah yeah and I would be like </joey>
<garnt> why okay okay okay okay question </garnt>
<joey> question how do you guys feel about </joey>
<joey> hawks just like city parks like he </joey>
<joey> doesn't like Park like in general yeah </joey>
<connor> just just like as as in as a place to go </connor>
<connor> to you know waste an afternoon or </connor>
<garnt> something like that well for as an adult </garnt>
<connor> as an adult and a kid well as an adult I </connor>
<joey> think it's fine every now and then you </joey>
<connor> know across yeah especially in Tokyo </connor>
<joey> because you [ __ ] need it yeah because </joey>
<garnt> you don't see grass otherwise </garnt>
<joey> London has so much [ __ ] parks and </joey>
<joey> like lovely scenery and like Tokyo is </joey>
<joey> like how about one park but you have to </joey>
<joey> pay to get in yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> or your yogi park where everyone on </joey>
<connor> Earth in Japan goes to and it's like </connor>
<garnt> yeah this is [ __ ] yeah yeah I don't know </garnt>
<joey> like because I've I've been waiting to </joey>
<joey> have a hot take on Parks I just saw I </joey>
<joey> like I don't know if it's just parks in </joey>
<garnt> Japan or or anything like that I just </garnt>
<garnt> don't like them like </garnt>
<joey> I just like for me like for me wait wait </joey>
<garnt> did you like parks in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> not really why not what'd you do in them </garnt>
<garnt> let's walk it's not like a cinema it's </garnt>
<joey> not like there's something to just walk </joey>
<joey> you enjoy it you got to make your own </joey>
<joey> fun </joey>
<connor> you're like permanently online </connor>
<garnt> what do you mean what do you do you just </garnt>
<connor> go to the park you chill out you walk </connor>
<garnt> you breathe in do you like walking </garnt>
<garnt> walking's fine but I can walk anywhere </garnt>
<joey> can't the type of [ __ ] walk </joey>
<joey> outside being like what's the quest </joey>
<garnt> for Parks right my favorite parks for </garnt>
<garnt> example is if there's like an activity </garnt>
<garnt> to do at the park like maybe like a </garnt>
<connor> playground or something oh you know </connor>
<connor> maybe I would can't like on a playground </connor>
<garnt> no no I don't know because </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> the reason I bring this up and it's this </garnt>
<garnt> this is why I'm like married to cities </garnt>
<garnt> because we have exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> opinions we we we started like walking </garnt>
<garnt> around which we explore like we explore </garnt>
<garnt> like part of our neighborhood and </garnt>
<joey> there's a park that we've never been to </joey>
<joey> yeah and we're like oh maybe we should </joey>
<joey> explore the park that's what that's what </joey>
<joey> people do on this case right that's what </joey>
<joey> humans act like right on on days we uh </joey>
<joey> it's like humans do this thing called </joey>
<joey> Walking In the Park yeah yeah yeah so we </joey>
<garnt> try it out so we go in the spark and you </garnt>
<joey> have to pay to get in this park so we're </joey>
<garnt> like okay it must be a pretty big park </garnt>
<joey> right yeah which one uh I don't remember </joey>
<connor> the park name it's it's near to where I </connor>
<connor> live so I don't really want to doctor </connor>
<connor> myself yeah um but clearly he doesn't </connor>
<connor> care there's not a lot of parks in </connor>
<joey> trouble you have to pay yeah under the </joey>
<garnt> big ones yeah uh so we pay you to get in </garnt>
<garnt> and we've paid to get Parts before </garnt>
<garnt> normally what we like to do is we like </garnt>
<garnt> to cycle around the park there's </garnt>
<garnt> normally a lot it's normally big enough </garnt>
<garnt> to have like us like a bike rental and </garnt>
<garnt> we just cycle around that to me is like </garnt>
<garnt> Japan yeah in Japan is there I don't </garnt>
<joey> know there isn't anywhere near where I </joey>
<garnt> live I remember I remember there was one </garnt>
<garnt> pretty famous one that's massive thank </garnt>
<connor> you </connor>
<garnt> I'm not sure if it's in Tokyo or saitama </garnt>
<garnt> I'll have to double check it but it's </garnt>
<joey> not it's definitely not in like the </joey>
<joey> center Center yeah you know that's </joey>
<joey> that's the kind of Park experience I </joey>
<connor> liked </connor>
<connor> um sure maybe I just say walking right </connor>
<connor> because me and Sydney it sounds like you </connor>
<connor> hate walking me and me and Sydney are </connor>
<garnt> just walking around and being like </garnt>
<garnt> where's the fun when does the fun start </garnt>
<garnt> you just take it in you breathe you know </garnt>
<connor> it's like good for you to look at green </connor>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> we had this we at this moment where we </garnt>
<garnt> were just like walking around uh we were </garnt>
<garnt> just walking around and we were just </garnt>
<garnt> like you know she was just like walking </garnt>
<garnt> around like asking us like uh why do </garnt>
<garnt> people go to pogs just like just like </garnt>
<garnt> asking each other why do people enjoy </garnt>
<connor> parks and everything like that and then </connor>
<connor> and then we walked we walk past and </connor>
<connor> there was there was this one kid just </connor>
<connor> having the [ __ ] time of his life just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> like collecting leaves and [ __ ] just </connor>
<connor> like jumping in them yeah like </connor>
<connor> collecting them again oh yeah and we </connor>
<connor> were just like [ __ ] that kid I wish I </connor>
<connor> was that kid [ __ ] no because kids below </connor>
<connor> like eight can entertain themselves with </connor>
<joey> anything yeah they have fun with their </joey>
<joey> imagination </joey>
<garnt> this is the bonus yeah I was like good </garnt>
<garnt> God damn it I wish I was having that </garnt>
<garnt> much fun no dude bro that's so nice just </garnt>
<garnt> chilling just walking around a block and </garnt>
<garnt> just you know having like that 20 </garnt>
<connor> minutes are just just nothing yeah there </connor>
<joey> was just some days where I'm just like I </joey>
<joey> don't have it often uh because I'm a lot </joey>
<garnt> like where I'm like the majority of the </garnt>
<garnt> time when I go outside I'm I'm there to </garnt>
<garnt> fulfill a quest but like sometimes some </garnt>
<joey> days man you just wake up or you're </joey>
<joey> doing some [ __ ] and you're just like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I just need to get out yeah you you </connor>
<connor> just grab you grab a coffee yeah you </connor>
<joey> just go out around the park just walk </joey>
<joey> out of your house just go in a random </joey>
<joey> direction for like it doesn't even have </joey>
<joey> to be long 10 15 minutes and that just </joey>
<joey> refreshes your mind it's so nice no I I </joey>
<garnt> I get that because like to me so it so </garnt>
<connor> why don't you just do that but do it in </connor>
<connor> a park like why are you expecting like a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] QuickTime event or something </garnt>
<garnt> because because like okay okay we're </garnt>
<garnt> waiting for that one NPC </garnt>
<connor> what are you hoping what did you expect </connor>
<garnt> the park to be I don't know it just </garnt>
<joey> feels it just it's always felt weird for </joey>
<garnt> me you know having to go to a place to </garnt>
<garnt> feel happy okay I I I love I love like </garnt>
<garnt> the feeling you guys are talking about </garnt>
<connor> but like yeah so to me like that's </connor>
<joey> that's </joey>
<garnt> spontaneous you know that's that's </garnt>
<joey> spontaneous I love for example so you're </joey>
<joey> asking why people go to the park on </joey>
<garnt> routine </garnt>
<garnt> yes it's is it for like is it for the </garnt>
<connor> environment there's a lot of studies </connor>
<garnt> been done but like just being around </garnt>
<garnt> like nature or seeing a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> green nature yeah uh is just generally </garnt>
<garnt> quite healthy and it's a kind of a </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many studies on it but and </garnt>
<connor> again I don't know any of the top of my </connor>
<connor> head but it's very relaxing it's good </connor>
<connor> for you yeah uh and you should do it </connor>
<joey> yeah that's why I I used to love in </joey>
<garnt> Australia I used to love going on like </garnt>
<garnt> bushwalks yeah like you know just like </garnt>
<garnt> through the rainbow it's relaxing I love </garnt>
<connor> that because like it's like it's not </connor>
<garnt> exciting and every direction you look </garnt>
<garnt> it's just trees but it's nice I do it </garnt>
<connor> um not semi-regularly like every few </connor>
<connor> weeks I go to the park just walk yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah like coffee because for me I think </garnt>
<garnt> I think what's always like weird not </garnt>
<garnt> weirded me out but one one thing that I </garnt>
<garnt> I've never like got Parks like </garnt>
<garnt> personally is just because it always </garnt>
<garnt> felt like so artificial you know in </garnt>
<garnt> terms of like I love the feeling of </garnt>
<garnt> waking up and just exploring nature and </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that and that's why I </garnt>
<garnt> really value it on like trips where we </garnt>
<garnt> go to somewhere where it is an actual </garnt>
<garnt> like you know beautiful place yes where </garnt>
<garnt> you just can wake up go to the </garnt>
<garnt> countryside and you just get that kind </garnt>
<garnt> of feeling Parkers have always been like </garnt>
<garnt> I go there and I never </garnt>
<garnt> ever I never ever get that feeling of </garnt>
<garnt> the same Tranquility it's just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> this is if I walk for like 10 15 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna reach the end and go back to </garnt>
<garnt> City I mean it's just like obviously in </garnt>
<connor> like parks and mainly for cities right </connor>
<garnt> where it's just so much concrete yeah </garnt>
<joey> drab gray yeah it's to I mean it is you </joey>
<joey> know it's gonna make you feel more </joey>
<garnt> livable that's why like you know </garnt>
<garnt> Japan had figured out they were like oh </garnt>
<garnt> wait we should probably should have </garnt>
<garnt> built more trees in our cities because </garnt>
<garnt> the newer parts of Tokyo all have trees </garnt>
<garnt> yes everywhere yeah because you realize </garnt>
<garnt> like subconsciously in your brain you're </garnt>
<garnt> like oh this is so much nicer because </garnt>
<garnt> there's nature with the concrete yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know it does something in your brain </garnt>
<connor> where you just feel like oh this is more </connor>
<joey> pleasant yeah that's why I in my opinion </joey>
<garnt> some of the best cities I've been to are </garnt>
<garnt> the ones that are built around the </garnt>
<garnt> nature or it's built within the nature </garnt>
<garnt> not so much like Tokyo where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> let's just take all the nature away </garnt>
<garnt> replace with buildings yes and then </garnt>
<joey> maybe every now and every [ __ ] 10 20 </joey>
<connor> meters we'll plan one skinny ass I think </connor>
<connor> the most parks to City ratio I think </connor>
<garnt> yeah I could be wrong why don't you </garnt>
<garnt> could check that Kai yeah and I think </garnt>
<garnt> this comes back to when I was a kid </garnt>
<garnt> because I I always it always weirded me </garnt>
<garnt> out as a kid where it was just like the </garnt>
<garnt> concept of just plopping in Greenery in </garnt>
<garnt> like a concrete jungle and I mean I get </garnt>
<garnt> it now as an adult to be like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you need a change of environment or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that yeah but I just like </garnt>
<garnt> to me as a kid it was I I never I never </garnt>
<garnt> went to a park for that if I was going </garnt>
<garnt> to a park I was playing footy or I was </garnt>
<garnt> going to the playground activity and as </garnt>
<garnt> an adult I still mentally like I link up </garnt>
<garnt> I link parks to like the same kind of </garnt>
<garnt> mental barrier where it needs to be </garnt>
<garnt> going there for a singular activity I </garnt>
<joey> mean there's nothing wrong with this </joey>
<joey> with in your age to want to go to the </joey>
<joey> park to play footy with your mates oh no </joey>
<joey> yeah but also yeah it's important for </joey>
<joey> cities to have communal spaces yes right </joey>
<garnt> in Tokyo where the [ __ ] can you go yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's like an open space </joey>
<garnt> like nothing nothing you have to go </garnt>
<connor> outside it's like yeah Tokyo is like you </connor>
<joey> know you can't do anything you have to </joey>
<joey> go towards like [ __ ] uh mitaka like </joey>
<connor> yeah you know it's it's good to have </connor>
<joey> options yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you're probably walking on the </joey>
<joey> touristy spots and the biggest one is </joey>
<joey> Hyde Park obviously that's very touristy </joey>
<connor> yeah but you know even where like yeah I </connor>
<connor> mean I lived in London London parks are </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] massive to the point to the </joey>
<joey> point where you forget that it's a park </joey>
<joey> right right I think that's also played </joey>
<joey> into the fact that there are a lot of </joey>
<garnt> like small parks in Tokyo as well yes </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just I'm just like this ain't a </garnt>
<garnt> park this is a patch of grass because </garnt>
<connor> there's some trees in it you know we'll </connor>
<garnt> have oh this is the park there's two </garnt>
<garnt> football pitches a pond and a bunch of </garnt>
<joey> other [ __ ] yeah yeah enough space for </joey>
<garnt> you to do whatever you want like yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's valued a lot more I think in oh </joey>
<joey> definitely Europe than so well not that </joey>
<garnt> it was valued a lot more I think it just </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't in the city planning when Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> was being developed like it was not all </garnt>
<connor> about developing space for commercial </connor>
<joey> use yeah yeah and they were like oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> just trying to build as much </joey>
<joey> infrastructure in a small amount of </joey>
<connor> space as possible right yeah yeah but </connor>
<connor> then obviously now we figured out out </connor>
<joey> that hey if you build a city with more </joey>
<garnt> trees and more green that people are </garnt>
<joey> happier yeah like I think it is like </joey>
<joey> there is a correlation between how happy </joey>
<joey> oh absolutely and how yeah yeah how much </joey>
<joey> uh nature there is there or accessible I </joey>
<connor> guess in Tokyo it's like everyone's like </connor>
<connor> I don't want to just leave Tokyo well </connor>
<connor> that's such a [ __ ] that's why like I </connor>
<connor> could never live in like Central Tokyo </connor>
<connor> and that's why I don't live in central </connor>
<connor> Tokyo because it's like every time I go </connor>
<garnt> to Central Tokyo I'm like this is drab </garnt>
<garnt> as [ __ ] like there's no Greenery like I </garnt>
<garnt> and again as someone who grew up next to </garnt>
<joey> a [ __ ] National Park if I don't see </joey>
<joey> even a little bit of greenery I just </joey>
<connor> Panic oh you've seen Wales [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> nothing yeah exactly Fields I like it </joey>
<joey> but that's it yeah that's what you want </joey>
<garnt> that's what you want yeah even living in </garnt>
<garnt> Brighton I would love to take drives </garnt>
<garnt> like down to like the South Downs and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that you know just just </garnt>
<garnt> get like I don't know to to me that is </garnt>
<garnt> what an escape is you know I it to me </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a commitment to get into like </garnt>
<garnt> a proper environment to reset myself and </garnt>
<joey> I really really like that so so if you </joey>
<joey> and Sydney don't like Parks what do you </joey>
<joey> do sorry so if you you and Sydney don't </joey>
<joey> like Parks or like don't like walking </joey>
<joey> through Parks what is like the </joey>
<joey> equivalent that you guys do I know we </joey>
<joey> just have light in nature yeah so how do </joey>
<garnt> we see nature yeah how do you experience </garnt>
<joey> it I mean normally we just through my 4K </joey>
<garnt> TV I mean normally we just take like a </garnt>
<garnt> weekend trip outside of Tokyo or if we </garnt>
<garnt> have a date that we normally have an </garnt>
<garnt> activity we're doing on that date the </garnt>
<garnt> activity isn't going to a park the </garnt>
<garnt> activity if we go to a park the activity </garnt>
<garnt> is going to a park to do X or to do y or </garnt>
<garnt> to cycle around if that makes sense </garnt>
<garnt> right to me like it's it's gonna sound </garnt>
<garnt> weird but just walking to me I don't </garnt>
<garnt> really count that as an activity it's </garnt>
<garnt> just a thing that I do </garnt>
<joey> if I'm walking I need a destination to </joey>
<joey> walk to I can't get that I can't just be </joey>
<garnt> walking for the sake of walking no I </garnt>
<connor> don't know if that makes any sense I </connor>
<garnt> like walking for the second walking I I </garnt>
<joey> get uh I get gone in that sense like I </joey>
<garnt> also like I'm I'm stuck I'm slowly </garnt>
<garnt> starting to get better at it because Aki </garnt>
<garnt> is definitely the type of person who </garnt>
<garnt> just wants to like walk with no </garnt>
<garnt> destination yeah and I'm like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's fun when I do it with you but not </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm by myself </garnt>
<garnt> then I'm just like well [ __ ] I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> wasting time at this point like I would </garnt>
<garnt> be doing something else at this time </garnt>
<garnt> even though I know in my head this is </garnt>
<garnt> good for me yeah right and it's and it's </garnt>
<garnt> a good escape from all the other [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> I'm doing but I think again I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like perpetually just bound to my work </garnt>
<joey> in that sense where I'm trying to escape </joey>
<joey> and yet in my head I'm just like </joey>
<garnt> free emails right now yeah I don't know </garnt>
<connor> I know sometimes it's about the journey </connor>
<connor> not the destination but always about the </connor>
<connor> journey it is always about the Journey </connor>
<connor> of the destination but sometimes I need </connor>
<connor> that destination to make me appreciate </connor>
<connor> the journey just just to just so I can </connor>
<connor> have that mental that mental thing of </connor>
<connor> just okay I know where I'm going and </connor>
<connor> then I could just you know zone out and </connor>
<garnt> just appreciate the journey I appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> that a lot of people are just like I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just going to do whatever and uh we'll </garnt>
<garnt> find out what the destination is along </garnt>
<garnt> the way uh I cannot do that [ __ ] [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> give me a destination give give me an </garnt>
<garnt> end point give me a goal to work towards </garnt>
<garnt> even if it's just like the most Bare </garnt>
<garnt> Bones like simple goal yeah and that </garnt>
<garnt> would just like allow me to like just </garnt>
<joey> just tell me I need to like go to a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] Family Market yeah it's better </garnt>
<garnt> it's better I know there's one around </garnt>
<garnt> the corner but I'm like you know what </garnt>
<garnt> I'll skip that one go to the next one </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah to make the journey worth it </joey>
<garnt> even that is fine look you can you can </garnt>
<garnt> put me here and the destination here and </garnt>
<garnt> go this [ __ ] route and I'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> okay let's go that route but if you just </garnt>
<garnt> if you just tell me oh let's just go up </garnt>
<garnt> here and just see where we go I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> no give me a destiny just tell me where </garnt>
<garnt> we go tell me where we're ending up is </garnt>
<garnt> it a family more is it are we going for </garnt>
<garnt> the are we going for the family chicken </garnt>
<garnt> just just let me know I don't know yeah </garnt>
<connor> I mean I guess it's strange I guess I </connor>
<connor> don't really mind because in my head I'm </connor>
<garnt> like oh I should a form of light </garnt>
<garnt> exercise yeah right so I'm like oh </garnt>
<connor> that's fine then um you know I'm just </connor>
<garnt> like if in my head if it's exercise I'm </garnt>
<joey> like oh yeah cool no no and like you </joey>
<joey> know I see it that way as well but again </joey>
<garnt> it's like I I'm more determined to go </garnt>
<garnt> through that exercise if I knew where I </garnt>
<garnt> was going yeah and it's like and it </garnt>
<garnt> could be like super [ __ ] fast super </garnt>
<connor> short it doesn't matter just the fact </connor>
<connor> that I have a goal to reach makes me </connor>
<joey> work for the goal and it makes it worth </joey>
<connor> working towards the goal yeah I think I </connor>
<connor> also just I think the reason why I like </connor>
<connor> IRL streaming as well is that I can kind </connor>
<garnt> of pseudo exercise while doing it just </garnt>
<garnt> walking around all the time yeah did you </garnt>
<garnt> just content machine you know I want to </garnt>
<garnt> make content I want to min max </garnt>
<garnt> everything yeah I just like the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that I can just do create content and be </garnt>
<garnt> some somewhat active at the same time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's kind of nice for sure </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like oh okay I don't feel </garnt>
<joey> like such a slob and I can go home and </joey>
<connor> relax and I feel like oh that was not </connor>
<connor> bad I was good yeah but then when you </connor>
<joey> get home and you're like [ __ ] I have to </joey>
<connor> make contact although I normally drink </connor>
<connor> when I do IRL so I cancel any better </connor>
<garnt> yeah because like talking about you know </garnt>
<garnt> touching grass and we're going going on </garnt>
<garnt> like adventures and everything like that </garnt>
<garnt> I think I get Slice of Life anime now </garnt>
<garnt> like it's just could you repeat that I </garnt>
<joey> think I think I think I get it now </joey>
<joey> because every time like welcome to the </joey>
<joey> club hey hey hey finally a fellow Slice </joey>
<garnt> of Life enjoy right here because like </garnt>
<joey> YouTube tutorial anime like what the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] I mean a lot of people do like that </garnt>
<joey> but not even explain why I'll explain </joey>
<joey> I'll explain because for for the longest </joey>
<joey> time I didn't really like I didn't </joey>
<garnt> really like understand the appeal of </garnt>
<garnt> like watching a lot of Slice of Life </garnt>
<garnt> anime like especially like and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like that yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then me and Sydney like we we </garnt>
<garnt> we've I've talked about this before we </garnt>
<garnt> have this yearly trip to yamanashi where </garnt>
<garnt> we explore it's like it's really really </garnt>
<garnt> quiet area we explore the area and </garnt>
<garnt> something and most of the most the time </garnt>
<garnt> we just just do nothing we just like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> chill and just take in the atmosphere </garnt>
<connor> there's not much to do in yet yeah </connor>
<connor> there's nothing to do no there's not </connor>
<garnt> much to do I haven't seen you can drink </garnt>
<joey> wine that's it yeah that's all you drink </joey>
<garnt> wine and watch my mouth Fuji that's </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah you you can drink wine and </garnt>
<garnt> just take in the atmosphere and I'm just </garnt>
<connor> like that is me that is me I'm not </connor>
<connor> complaining because that's what I like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah I'm a fan of both those yeah </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like </connor>
<garnt> damn it's fun doing nothing you know it </garnt>
<garnt> feels really really good just having </garnt>
<garnt> this nice experience of just like just </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah kind of just doing nothing and </garnt>
<connor> just taking the chance and the </connor>
<connor> environment in right let's go to that </connor>
<connor> and I'm like damn I felt this somewhere </connor>
<garnt> before why ever felt this before Oh this </garnt>
<garnt> is the exact same feeling I get when I </garnt>
<joey> watch every [ __ ] Slice of Life anime </joey>
<joey> like why is it fun to watch people doing </joey>
<garnt> nothing yeah yeah and I'm like holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> I think I get anything I'm watching </connor>
<joey> people do nothing no no no it's it's </joey>
<joey> this idea I think the appeal of Slice of </joey>
<joey> Life comes from there where it's like </joey>
<joey> you know I think a lot of the reason why </joey>
<garnt> science lab especially in Japan is so </garnt>
<garnt> popular is because the main demographic </garnt>
<garnt> of people who watch Slice of Life are </garnt>
<garnt> people who have nine to fives super busy </garnt>
<garnt> schedules yeah always working always </garnt>
<garnt> have something on their mind and their </garnt>
<garnt> one Escape is to just be have this </garnt>
<garnt> Mutual feeling of I'm doing nothing </garnt>
<garnt> thing but it's relaxing yeah right and </garnt>
<garnt> maybe they themselves don't want to be </garnt>
<joey> in a position where you know maybe they </joey>
<joey> don't have the money all the time to </joey>
<joey> actually go out to the inaka and I </joey>
<joey> wonder because that's enough in my head </joey>
<joey> when I still watch animates like my </joey>
<joey> brain is being engaged right yeah </joey>
<joey> even even watching Slice of Life though </joey>
<garnt> yeah even watching really yeah because </garnt>
<connor> I'm watching it and I'm like this is </connor>
<joey> still doing more than nothing oh no in </joey>
<joey> my head when I was Slice of Life I am </joey>
<joey> like brain turn off mode I'm just like </joey>
<connor> I'm just like watching moving images </connor>
<garnt> so I don't to me I'm watching it I'm </garnt>
<connor> like this is requiring effort to watch </connor>
<garnt> yeah and I I'm I'm just bored yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because it gives me like it just gives </garnt>
<garnt> me that like same relaxing freeing </garnt>
<garnt> feeling I'm trying to like verbalize </garnt>
<garnt> kind of the you know kind of the </garnt>
<garnt> experience you get when you go to a </garnt>
<garnt> place like this in the middle of nowhere </garnt>
<garnt> Japan because I'm sure there are other </garnt>
<connor> place like it's it's it's it's not it's </connor>
<joey> off of Japan it's like that I believe 40 </joey>
<connor> out of the 47 prefectures I like that </connor>
<connor> nearly all of the prefixes I'm not like </connor>
<garnt> I'm not trying to say that oh doing </garnt>
<garnt> nothing and taking the environment </garnt>
<garnt> that's a Japanese thing only Japanese </garnt>
<joey> people have figured out how to do that </joey>
<joey> you know but they've certainly perfected </joey>
<joey> it though they have certainly perfected </joey>
<joey> it it's it's definitely what I'm saying </joey>
<joey> they're like we have optimized doing </joey>
<garnt> nothing </garnt>
<garnt> no I get it it's like I just think like </garnt>
<garnt> I think the word you're looking for is </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> what I like about it's again it's like </joey>
<joey> that feeling of like </joey>
<joey> um because you know I think in a lot of </joey>
<joey> ways like for me what I like about Slice </joey>
<joey> of Life is that a lot of Slice of Life </joey>
<garnt> is you know based around a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> the the inaka and like you know in the </garnt>
<garnt> mountains of Japan or like in places </garnt>
<garnt> where there's like not a whole lot </garnt>
<garnt> happening and so yeah the countryside </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like the countryside like and all </garnt>
<garnt> these characters have to find a way to </garnt>
<garnt> do certain things and for me it's kind </garnt>
<garnt> of special because I spent a lot of my </garnt>
<garnt> childhood like that in Japan like when </garnt>
<garnt> my grandma lived in the middle but [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere in Miyagi we had to make our own </garnt>
<garnt> fun like we were just surrounded by rice </garnt>
<garnt> fields we were like all right the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> are we doing today right so I think I </garnt>
<connor> relate heavily to that feeling and it's </connor>
<connor> like kind of looking at my childhood </connor>
<connor> through like roast into glasses in a </connor>
<connor> sense but like even as an adult I </connor>
<connor> sometimes watch Slice of Life you know </connor>
<connor> like I recently uh you know caught up on </connor>
<connor> like Euro Camp right yeah and I'm like </connor>
<connor> why is this still fun to watch for me </connor>
<joey> even though technically nothing is </joey>
<joey> happening it's because again it's it's </joey>
<joey> like that feeling of like being content </joey>
<joey> with the fact that nothing's happening </joey>
<garnt> but that's what's so nice about it I I </garnt>
<garnt> think because I've realized I I don't </garnt>
<joey> know what it is about Japan right but </joey>
<connor> Japan has just perfected Vibes unlike it </connor>
<joey> just no matter where you go whether it's </joey>
<garnt> like the city or the countryside locally </garnt>
<connor> a true Instagram all right it's just </connor>
<garnt> literally that Tick Tock meme in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> it's just [ __ ] Vibes right I I don't </garnt>
<connor> know why I don't know why I wonder if </connor>
<connor> that's because you never had the time or </connor>
<joey> disposable income in the UK to going on </joey>
<joey> these trips Maybe </joey>
<connor> huh because there are some places in </connor>
<connor> Europe in the UK that are pretty [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> chilled too oh no yeah I'm not saying </garnt>
<joey> this is a Japan only thing right I'm </joey>
<joey> just I'm just saying that Japan did it </joey>
<joey> Japan it's it's so easy it's so easy to </joey>
<connor> find in Japan yeah get your phone </connor>
<connor> replaced until you have to get your </connor>
<connor> photos </connor>
<joey> you know yeah it's like I had a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> time of SoftBank so you know what I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna do to lie down watch some Slice of </connor>
<connor> Life I think how you're describing how </connor>
<garnt> you view size of life that's how I watch </garnt>
<joey> documentaries right right it turns my </joey>
<garnt> brain off yeah and I just listen really </garnt>
<joey> I wonder if that's how people watch </joey>
<joey> Trash toast </joey>
<joey> we might be a slice of Life show to some </joey>
<connor> people yeah because I you know I just </connor>
<joey> watch documentaries I'll leave them on </joey>
<joey> the background sometimes I don't really </joey>
<garnt> need to focus and it kind of makes me </garnt>
<garnt> zone out and kind of chill out yeah in a </garnt>
<garnt> weird way don't know why but how you </garnt>
<garnt> describe a slice of life that's how it </garnt>
<garnt> sounds to me but Slice of Life for me </garnt>
<garnt> just stresses me out that nothing's </garnt>
<connor> happened it stresses me out that they're </connor>
<joey> not doing anything right that it's not </joey>
<joey> moving yeah I think like for example </joey>
<joey> like that's why I really enjoyed </joey>
<garnt> non-numbiory because like that is like </garnt>
<garnt> what my childhood was like in a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> ways right like when I was visiting </garnt>
<garnt> Japan that's just what it was it was you </garnt>
<garnt> go out with your friends you'd find your </garnt>
<garnt> own phone nothing [ __ ] happens at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of the day but it was still good it </garnt>
<garnt> makes you feel this kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> yearning Nostalgia even if you've never </garnt>
<garnt> grew up in Japan yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely and that's kind of that's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like what I feel even though I </garnt>
<garnt> have no [ __ ] roots in Japan but </garnt>
<joey> watching these shows and uh especially </joey>
<joey> going to places like this I'm like why </joey>
<joey> do I feel nostalgic even though I have </joey>
<joey> no attachment to this place you know </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's it's it's super it's it's </joey>
<joey> weird super weird it's super weird but </joey>
<garnt> like I said like I said like Japan is a </garnt>
<garnt> country of Vibes and I think there's a </garnt>
<garnt> reason why it's become one of the most </garnt>
<joey> instagramable countries on Earth you </joey>
<joey> know like I'm not saying like I said I'm </joey>
<connor> not like trying to like hype Japan up to </connor>
<joey> be like oh you're like normal things </joey>
<joey> Japanese thing like you know like but </joey>
<joey> it's funny because in a lot of ways it's </joey>
<joey> true for a lot of people in a lot of </joey>
<garnt> ways it is true I don't know why this </garnt>
<garnt> country is so [ __ ] aesthetic whether </garnt>
<joey> it be like I remember I remember </joey>
<garnt> randomly I think it was like when we </garnt>
<garnt> went to the [ __ ] junkadelic the last </garnt>
<garnt> time right with all three of us yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> uh it's this you know Mexican placing um </garnt>
<garnt> uh in nakamegara that we've talked about </garnt>
<garnt> in past trash Fest episode well like </garnt>
<joey> last time we went you know we had this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing you know Mexican meal </joey>
<joey> and then as we were walking back from </joey>
<joey> John cadelic to nakamego station I </joey>
<joey> remember God just randomly just stopped </joey>
<joey> and went </joey>
<joey> why is Japan so [ __ ] aesthetic it's </joey>
<garnt> just like out loud I'm like you good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's just like that country where </garnt>
<garnt> no matter what angle you take you you </garnt>
<garnt> just you just like snap a picture </garnt>
<joey> instantly instagramable you know and it </joey>
<joey> doesn't matter </joey>
<joey> yeah you go to like a place like golden </joey>
<connor> guy and I'm just like [ __ ] this this </connor>
<connor> looks cool this looks so [ __ ] like a </connor>
<connor> lot of this stuff does look cool yeah </connor>
<connor> and I'm like that looks totally </connor>
<connor> different from like just going out to </connor>
<garnt> the countryside and it's just it's a </garnt>
<garnt> different kind of vibe but it's still </garnt>
<garnt> Vibes exactly it's still Vibes basically </garnt>
<garnt> Japan is like Lo-Fi the country I just I </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I Slice of Life </garnt>
<connor> ages ago Silver Spoon oh yeah I hated it </connor>
<joey> really oh I love I love it I thought </joey>
<joey> something was gonna happen I love silver </joey>
<connor> and nothing happened </connor>
<connor> and I was like what the [ __ ] I love it </connor>
<joey> because what is the point I love it </joey>
<connor> because nothing happens </connor>
<connor> that's just [ __ ] storytelling because </connor>
<joey> something happens but that's the point </joey>
<connor> they're not it's it's like how you make </connor>
<connor> a story with no story yes like what they </connor>
<joey> perfected and it's like who wanted this </joey>
<joey> well that's like that's like going on to </joey>
<connor> a Lo-Fi playlist and being like Oh the </connor>
<connor> musicianship is [ __ ] no I like that it's </connor>
<joey> like it's like it's like oh there's </joey>
<joey> there's no musicianship in this </joey>
<connor> whatsoever It's like because they're not </connor>
<connor> trying I I admire people who enjoy Slice </connor>
<connor> of Life I feel like there's just a </connor>
<garnt> mental barrier that is stopping me from </garnt>
<garnt> enjoying this whole genre </garnt>
<garnt> um and I don't understand yeah and I </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I just I just felt like annoyed </garnt>
<garnt> when I I think I watched like four </garnt>
<garnt> episodes of Silver Spirit why'd you </garnt>
<garnt> waste my time </garnt>
<joey> like I thought I thought something was </joey>
<garnt> gonna happen right so before I knew it </garnt>
<joey> was a genre yes yes so I watched it and </joey>
<garnt> I was like waiting for some plot yeah </garnt>
<joey> how do you say that because I think </joey>
<joey> Silver Spoon is one of the best Slice of </joey>
<joey> Life </joey>
<joey> in terms of the job in terms of what the </joey>
<garnt> genre has to offer yeah well I I think </garnt>
<garnt> you have to be in it you definitely have </garnt>
<garnt> to be in a certain </garnt>
<connor> mood to watch slices what mood no Story </connor>
<garnt> please I want no Story the mood to just </garnt>
<garnt> zone out and just Revel in like just a </garnt>
<connor> nice comfy feeling I mean if you ask me </connor>
<connor> why I zone out documentaries I'm like I </connor>
<joey> don't know I don't know see because I'm </joey>
<joey> the opposite with documentaries I'm </joey>
<joey> forced to listen and my it's like an </joey>
<joey> active thing because I want to </joey>
<connor> understand what's happened I feel like </connor>
<connor> I've watched so many documentaries now </connor>
<connor> where just the formulas feel so familiar </connor>
<connor> that I'm like okay I can kind of figure </connor>
<connor> out everything that's going on right </connor>
<joey> very quickly I feel for a lot of </joey>
<garnt> people's Slice of Life I guess is like </garnt>
<garnt> the the comfort food of anime right </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like it's like I don't want </garnt>
<garnt> to think about it I just I know I like </garnt>
<garnt> this thing even though it doesn't you </garnt>
<garnt> know offer me anything new in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> an experience right it's just like it's </garnt>
<garnt> just something to have because I like it </garnt>
<garnt> and that's fine I think what's really </garnt>
<connor> nice about slice of life is just it's a </connor>
<connor> nice escape from just the Daily Grind of </connor>
<connor> life you know it's you you get away from </connor>
<connor> that daily ground because what you do </connor>
<connor> normal and I may not do that huh does </connor>
<joey> normal anime not give you the Escape of </joey>
<joey> a no because it puts you into I feel a a </joey>
<joey> world that is not maybe not the same in </joey>
<joey> terms of like the quality but in terms </joey>
<garnt> of like the the just the amount of [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that's going on it's like that's another </garnt>
<garnt> thing you have to like follow and </garnt>
<garnt> maintain and you know understand right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like you know you'd watch any show </garnt>
<garnt> and be like okay there's a world and </garnt>
<garnt> there are these characters involved in </garnt>
<connor> this world that have to do certain </connor>
<connor> things and there's this evil thing and </connor>
<connor> blah blah blah right there's so many </connor>
<connor> things that's engaging right and and </connor>
<connor> it's like I'm not saying that's bad or </connor>
<connor> anything like but I need to be in a mood </connor>
<connor> sometimes I'm in a mood where I'm like </connor>
<connor> yes I want something that has a </connor>
<joey> convoluted story with a convoluted </joey>
<joey> characters convoluted relationships but </joey>
<joey> sometimes I don't want to think about </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] sometimes I just want to turn </joey>
<joey> my brain off and watch cute girls doing </joey>
<garnt> cute things </garnt>
<garnt> do you ever go on trips and just do </garnt>
<connor> nothing every ship I do is nothing right </connor>
<joey> so why do you enjoy that </joey>
<connor> turn the brain off you know you finally </connor>
<joey> get to there you go there's the answer </joey>
<joey> but like I don't get that from watching </joey>
<joey> some people go on trips some people </joey>
<connor> watch last night I wish I wish I could </connor>
<joey> do that from a TV show but I think </joey>
<joey> that's but I think that's why a lot of </joey>
<connor> it's a different kind though like just </connor>
<joey> in my brain of watching your </joey>
<connor> documentaries not the same as going on a </connor>
<joey> trip and yeah yeah just relaxing and not </joey>
<joey> thinking about anything but I guess </joey>
<joey> that's why you know there might be a </joey>
<joey> reason why Slice of Life is so popular </joey>
<joey> in Japan is because some people you know </joey>
<joey> who work the salary of man life yeah who </joey>
<joey> work the nine to five six days a week </joey>
<garnt> can't afford to go on these also </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes it's just about like it's </garnt>
<garnt> about the small things you know it is </garnt>
<connor> about like okay </connor>
<connor> like the smallest interaction can bring </connor>
<garnt> you likes okay so actually I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> I just remember like something that </garnt>
<garnt> happened to me on this trip and it just </garnt>
<garnt> like it just it was just such a such a </garnt>
<connor> nice by the way my argument is not don't </connor>
<connor> watch Slice of Life go outside that's </connor>
<garnt> not my eyes I I no we got that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like that doesn't surprise me </garnt>
<connor> I mean for the longest time I didn't </connor>
<connor> like slices but for me I don't know </connor>
<connor> maybe it's the older I'm getting </connor>
<joey> um and the more I my uh likes and what I </joey>
<joey> want is revolved more about actually </joey>
<joey> going outside yeah doing stuff no I </joey>
<joey> totally get that as well I don't know </joey>
<joey> why maybe there's some scientific reason </joey>
<garnt> that when I you know because I used to </garnt>
<joey> be like online 24 7. and I'd never want </joey>
<garnt> to do anything else yeah but now I don't </garnt>
<joey> know I don't know if it's about job or </joey>
<joey> what that we're online all the time </joey>
<joey> that's a big reason why I don't watch as </joey>
<joey> much anime as I used to because like for </joey>
<joey> me now it's like yes there's a part of </joey>
<joey> it where it's like yeah sometimes I have </joey>
<joey> enjoyment from watching anime and </joey>
<garnt> there's sometimes where I do want to </garnt>
<garnt> watch anime like you know I wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> finish Euro camp and I did and it was </garnt>
<garnt> great but now I have other interests </garnt>
<garnt> where a lot of it involves me going </garnt>
<garnt> outside and doing real life stuff yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like is that me falling out of </garnt>
<joey> anime or is that just me growing up as a </joey>
<joey> person and my interests change I don't </joey>
<garnt> yeah I don't know I don't know yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean going back to slice of life I still </garnt>
<garnt> don't like every Slice of Life like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah I still will never ever ever </garnt>
<garnt> be able to get into chaon for example </garnt>
<garnt> don't you dare [ __ ] slander </garnt>
<garnt> I feel so boring I feel like there's </garnt>
<connor> only a handful of Slice of Life that </connor>
<connor> that I actually enjoy and I've noticed a </connor>
<connor> pattern that all every Slice of Life I </connor>
<connor> enjoy are like replications of stuff </connor>
<garnt> that I've experienced before yes like </garnt>
<garnt> I've never been a cute anime girl </garnt>
<garnt> drinking tea and you know like trying to </garnt>
<garnt> form I mean I've had apart from the </garnt>
<garnt> forming a band bit that's the uh that's </garnt>
<garnt> the only thing I can relate to so </garnt>
<garnt> whenever it's anything but that I'm like </garnt>
<joey> because I have those memories of forming </joey>
<garnt> a band and hanging out with Batman's </garnt>
<garnt> granted none of us were cute anime girls </garnt>
<garnt> and none of us drank tea you know we did </garnt>
<garnt> other things instead of that but it that </garnt>
<garnt> that feeling of like you know just doing </garnt>
<garnt> cool musical [ __ ] together with a group </garnt>
<joey> of friends and the troubles and you know </joey>
<joey> small turmoils that at the end of the </joey>
<joey> day don't really [ __ ] matter because </joey>
<joey> he's just a bunch of kids all right like </joey>
<joey> that's the part of K on that I connected </joey>
<garnt> with and that's why I enjoyed it [ __ ] it </garnt>
<garnt> I saw chaotic like pissed me off I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like you're trying to trying to stop ban </garnt>
<garnt> you were eating tea and drinking like </garnt>
<garnt> you're you're eating cake drinking tea </garnt>
<garnt> every [ __ ] day no wonder your music </garnt>
<garnt> career is [ __ ] but I do do some [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> work just a [ __ ] bad practice man </garnt>
<joey> Jesus Christ come on see I can't get mad </joey>
<garnt> at that because that's exactly how my </garnt>
<garnt> high school bands went I think we </garnt>
<joey> practice maybe 15 minutes yeah like most </joey>
<garnt> of the time we're just [ __ ] around my </garnt>
<garnt> band practice like when okay in like </garnt>
<garnt> fully wire band never popped in my in my </garnt>
<garnt> band experience this is my [ __ ] bad </garnt>
<garnt> experience yeah had nowhere to like </garnt>
<garnt> practice our instruments right because </garnt>
<garnt> we lived in the city and you can't make </garnt>
<garnt> so some you can't make noise so we had </garnt>
<joey> to hire out a studio in order to like in </joey>
<joey> order to also time mattered yeah so time </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] mattered yeah we had two hours </garnt>
<garnt> to practice we are [ __ ] right in [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> we were [ __ ] practicing we were like </garnt>
<garnt> booking our next get them big and </garnt>
<joey> working towards that so so I was just </joey>
<garnt> like no there is no time to [ __ ] around </garnt>
<joey> no for me it was for me it was oh it's </joey>
<garnt> the weekend let's go to the drummer's </garnt>
<garnt> house because the drum set's already </garnt>
<garnt> there put up a big [ __ ] mattress on </garnt>
<garnt> the doors and the wall so that it's like </garnt>
<garnt> sound proof practice for maybe I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know an hour and then just my friend </garnt>
<garnt> being like you wanna go play the new </garnt>
<garnt> Mario Kart yeah let's go do that that </garnt>
<garnt> was our band practice so I'm like you </garnt>
<garnt> know what you know what you know what a </garnt>
<joey> whole cup of tea time I relate I relate </joey>
<connor> I'm not drinking tea but I'm playing </connor>
<joey> some [ __ ] money is probably the most </joey>
<joey> alien thing to me in existence </joey>
<garnt> it's like I don't get like liking uh you </garnt>
<garnt> know giving obsessed with cute anime </garnt>
<garnt> girls yeah I already get it I don't like </garnt>
<garnt> music and I don't like Slice of Life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like the trifecta of all the </garnt>
<joey> things I don't like about anime </joey>
<connor> and so that's true when people are like </connor>
<connor> dude you gotta watch Kyle and I'm like </connor>
<connor> it looks awful for me like this looks </connor>
<joey> like the worst thing I could watch it </joey>
<joey> probably is for you yeah like this is </joey>
<garnt> torture yeah yeah I'm not 100 no but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like I was saying before I think </garnt>
<garnt> it's all about like </garnt>
<garnt> on a trip on a journey like the smallest </garnt>
<garnt> interactions the smallest things can </garnt>
<garnt> just like be like a happy story so I </garnt>
<garnt> remember I remember on this trip uh </garnt>
<garnt> we're in like this town in like the butt </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] in the middle of nowhere we we want </garnt>
<garnt> to lunch or whatever so we're like oh </garnt>

<garnt> asks the magical words </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> we go where the quest begins yeah and we </garnt>
<garnt> go die job and everyone's like oh thank </garnt>
<garnt> God that's normally how it goes it does </garnt>
<garnt> so it's not me how it goes but </garnt>

<joey> are you looking for trouble yeah the </joey>
<garnt> cowboy going not too thank God all right </garnt>
<garnt> we're good boys yeah and so as soon as </garnt>

<connor> do you say in Japanese to be like </connor>
<connor> what what's going on yeah and so the </connor>
<connor> closest thing he goes is like </connor>
<garnt> konnichiwa's </garnt>
<joey> which could be the most like passive </joey>
<garnt> aggressive way of just being like um an </garnt>
<garnt> excuse me yeah because like in English </garnt>
<joey> I'd be like hello mate are you okay and </joey>
<garnt> see if you just in like the closest </garnt>
<joey> thing we could think of is </joey>
<joey> yeah what are you doing there and then </joey>
<garnt> so he takes his hat off it's it's the </garnt>
<garnt> sushi chef we didn't recognize it didn't </garnt>

<garnt> I was just like I was just like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know that little interaction just </garnt>
<garnt> brought me so much joy right now it's </garnt>
<connor> just I agree with this when it's your </connor>
<garnt> life that's a slice of your own life I </garnt>
<joey> don't want to vicariously look through </joey>
<connor> it I don't want to [ __ ] watch someone </connor>
<connor> else succeed in life yeah have a good </connor>
<connor> time I'm praying for a good time I want </connor>
<garnt> to go out and have it </garnt>

<garnt> go home and you watch a slice life and </garnt>
<garnt> you're like that's like me for real it's </garnt>

<joey> yeah uh and they were like oh uh our SIM </joey>
<joey> cards don't work and on the top right </joey>
<garnt> corner it says docomo so I think that </garnt>
<garnt> they can help me right and I'm like they </garnt>
<garnt> can't help you </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like they're not gonna help you I'm </garnt>
<joey> Gonna Save You 30 minutes I'm gonna say </joey>
<joey> 30 minutes just leave yeah </joey>
<garnt> it turned out they bought their SIM </garnt>
<garnt> cards online and and they they can call </garnt>
<garnt> each other yeah you can't it's the way </garnt>
<garnt> that they don't give out phone numbers </garnt>
<garnt> that's the point where it's like how </garnt>
<garnt> many layers do I need to go down to </garnt>
<connor> explain yeah this [ __ ] ain't worse </connor>
<garnt> hey you because they were they wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> call each other and I was like yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> can't do that no you can't get a phone </garnt>
<joey> number in Japan unless you live here and </joey>
<garnt> you you get a SIM card so I basically </garnt>
<joey> just feel like yeah I'll be honest you </joey>
<garnt> can have the data that works nice you </garnt>
<joey> won't be able to call each other save </joey>
<joey> yourself 40 minutes grab a WhatsApp </joey>
<joey> use that yeah I was like this they're </joey>
<joey> not gonna be able to help you I'm like </joey>
<joey> babe they don't do these Sims you they </joey>
<joey> had data only Sim and they thought they </joey>
<joey> had calls because the advertising on the </joey>
<joey> plan they bought said calls but it was </joey>
<joey> kind of like a Skype thing and I was </joey>
<connor> just like don't bother literally the </connor>
<garnt> dichotomy of the two different </garnt>
<garnt> experiences </garnt>
<garnt> you're not welcome here you have a great </garnt>
<joey> Slice of Life experience or you can </joey>
<connor> we're talking about </connor>
<garnt> them I was like hey I'm a customer I </garnt>
<garnt> paid the monthly and I've been here for </garnt>
<joey> an hour waiting for to get something to </joey>
<garnt> happen so I don't know man maybe you </garnt>
<joey> should just enjoy your day maybe you </joey>
<joey> should just have a good time yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like maybe you want to call each </joey>
<joey> I'm like you'll be fine no you'll be </joey>
<joey> right just just move together as a group </joey>
<joey> you'll be a player I have noticed that </joey>
<garnt> the more from like Tokyo southwards </garnt>
<joey> people are more fun more North not so </joey>
<joey> fun I think so people are way more </joey>
<joey> chilled the more south you go in Japan </joey>
<joey> yeah I mean yeah much south I mean I </joey>
<joey> guess West yeah Western South way more </joey>
<connor> chill Southwest yeah yeah because you </connor>
<connor> start going to like Tokyo people get </connor>
<connor> more chill also like are super chill </connor>
<connor> super outgoing and then people get more </connor>
<connor> chill and then you shoot people are </connor>
<joey> really chill yeah well everyone is </joey>
<connor> really willing to talk really outgoing </connor>
<joey> more North you go the less willing bro </joey>
<garnt> people in Hokkaido do not want to talk </garnt>
<connor> no no so I feel like it's it's kind of </connor>
<joey> yeah she's kind of like more West yeah </joey>
<joey> I've noticed it's like like even </joey>
<connor> Japanese they don't really want to speak </connor>
<connor> to other jobs no they really don't want </connor>
<joey> to talk </joey>
<joey> it's such a weird cultural difference I </joey>
<connor> don't know if it's like the cold makes </connor>
<garnt> people not want to talk </garnt>
<garnt> I think it is the weather I don't want </garnt>
<joey> to open my mouth </joey>
<joey> I'm going to speed I'm going to speak </joey>
<garnt> from my experience at least whenever you </garnt>
<garnt> go to a country that is more known for </garnt>
<garnt> like hotter climate things just move </garnt>
<garnt> slower right I think so yeah things move </garnt>
<garnt> slower and but like </garnt>
<garnt> the the offset of that is that people </garnt>
<joey> will just see more chill you know I'll </joey>
<joey> never forget what you said about </joey>
<joey> Australia when you went you were like </joey>
<joey> it's like the UK but everyone's happy </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah I mean it's true it's true </garnt>
<connor> there's more children it's it's like </connor>
<connor> it's interesting yeah it's probably it's </connor>
<garnt> probably the weather to be honest yeah </garnt>
<garnt> the weather certainly helps yeah I mean </garnt>
<joey> like maybe but it's like there are some </joey>
<joey> parts of like like Southwest uh Japan </joey>
<garnt> where it's like the weather is not that </garnt>
<garnt> great right so me I'm sure the weather </garnt>
<garnt> is a fashion but it might be like some </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like actual cultural route of </garnt>
<joey> spanning however many generations that </joey>
<joey> is just ingrained into the the local </joey>
<connor> culture there I don't know it's like you </connor>
<connor> shoes really chill everything everyone </connor>
<garnt> talked to yeah just Vibes yeah a lot </garnt>
<garnt> more outgoing than when we were in </garnt>
<garnt> al-Qaeda it was like the complete </garnt>
<garnt> opposite yeah do not want to talk no no </garnt>
<joey> well I feel like Hokkaido especially </joey>
<joey> during the winter it's just like you </joey>
<joey> every man for themselves yeah you have </joey>
<connor> to make your time is more it felt like </connor>
<garnt> they were more open to it in winter </garnt>
<joey> because it was like more touristy right </joey>
<joey> when I was there in summer it was like a </joey>
<garnt> completely different vibe really just </garnt>
<joey> like what do you hear get out you know </joey>
<garnt> welcome here get out </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know that's not bad but you just </garnt>
<garnt> feel like no one wants to talk which is </garnt>
<garnt> fine I'm not gonna be like hey let's </garnt>
<garnt> talk but it's like even just like little </garnt>
<garnt> conversations you know maybe the combini </garnt>
<joey> like you know when I went to Starbucks </joey>
<joey> in case you requests the people were way </joey>
<joey> more talkative asking questions oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah what are you up to and it's like oh </joey>
<joey> this doesn't happen yeah Tokyo bro I </joey>
<joey> mean there's no time for that [ __ ] in </joey>
<connor> Tokyo everyone's like get out get your </connor>
<connor> food Ramen [ __ ] off eat it you know in </connor>
<connor> Okinawa everyone [ __ ] talks to you oh </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's like you could be in the </connor>
<connor> middle of the [ __ ] forest and they'll </connor>
<connor> just be like so what are you up to today </connor>
<garnt> I was like oh I'm not used to this </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's great Vibes yeah </joey>
<joey> um yeah especially like tropical </joey>
<joey> climates you know okinawan's like </joey>
<garnt> tropical climate I can see that but I'm </garnt>
<garnt> betting I'm betting it's very hard to </garnt>
<joey> get [ __ ] done there that's yeah it's not </joey>
<joey> a not a whole lot happens over there but </joey>
<joey> that's but that's kind of like why I </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> I I know we're making a full circle here </joey>
<joey> but like I feel the most like Slice of </joey>
<joey> Life anime experience when I'm in </joey>
<joey> Okinawa oh dude because nothing happens </joey>
<joey> there but I like the fact that nothing </joey>
<joey> happens there it's it's it kind of </joey>
<joey> military other than that but like it </joey>
<joey> kind of moves at its own time where it's </joey>
<joey> like it's like you know you could be </joey>
<joey> going through the whole day in Okinawa </joey>
<garnt> doing nothing you you walk around even </garnt>
<garnt> in the city in like naha and everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> just kind of like vibing like no one's </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't seem like anyone's like busy </garnt>
<garnt> or like you know on the clock or </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that or like stressed out </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's just like yeah we're just </garnt>
<garnt> here we're just just chilling just </garnt>
<garnt> living our life you're doing good bro </garnt>
<garnt> all right sick yeah it's like shoot well </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's just like that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> the vibe I get and it's like because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when we stayed uh when we went </garnt>
<garnt> to our friend's place uh who lives in </garnt>
<garnt> all you know whose parents live in </garnt>
<garnt> Okinawa yeah and it's like the most like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] traditional Japanese house ever </garnt>
<garnt> right like just like literally the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> you see in like non-non Bureau like </garnt>
<garnt> Slice of Life [ __ ] it's that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> house and I remember just like while I </garnt>
<garnt> was in that house everything just moved </garnt>
<garnt> really slowly and I didn't care about </garnt>
<garnt> what time it was or what we were doing </garnt>
<garnt> we were just like chatting and chilling </garnt>
<garnt> in the living room and just like you </garnt>
<joey> know my friends like Dad like collects </joey>
<joey> all this suck and he was just like </joey>
<joey> showing us all this [ __ ] I'm like I you </joey>
<joey> know it's not like I was like super </joey>
<connor> engrossed in what he was talking about </connor>
<connor> but it was like you know what </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] with this this is kind of nice and </joey>
<connor> I don't know why I like that because you </connor>
<garnt> guys have like a sanctuary someplace you </garnt>
<connor> go to that </connor>
<connor> the toilet </connor>
<connor> that's surely that's yours you spend </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] 19 in your life ain't no way </garnt>
<connor> it's the toilet for you you [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> speed run that [ __ ] with those 10 </connor>
<garnt> minutes </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] like I'll see you </garnt>
<garnt> next year when he's on the toilet yeah </garnt>
<joey> no I'm talking because the toilet's like </joey>
<garnt> the hyperbolic I'll see you in 20 years </garnt>
<garnt> I'm talking about like a place that you </garnt>
<garnt> can go to and it's always going to be </garnt>
<garnt> like the same it's always going to give </garnt>
<garnt> you like Comfort whenever you need to </garnt>
<garnt> like take a break or something like that </garnt>
<garnt> can can be like Parks it can be Parks </garnt>
<connor> I don't know for me it's not necessarily </connor>
<garnt> the place it's more like how I'm what </garnt>
<garnt> I'm feeling and what I'm doing and as </garnt>
<garnt> opposed to the place I feel like then if </garnt>
<connor> I put too much weight on a place and </connor>
<connor> then it changes or whatever I'll be like </connor>
<garnt> no that's that's the thing right because </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be sad that's the reason I brought </garnt>
<garnt> it up because I know a few people have </garnt>
<garnt> like their own Sanctuary most of the </garnt>
<garnt> time it's their home especially if </garnt>
<garnt> you've you know moved out your country </garnt>
<garnt> without your house your Sanctuary is </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like your home and I'm wondering </garnt>
<garnt> if you guys have ever had that moment </garnt>
<garnt> where you're just like really looking </garnt>
<garnt> forward to coming back home come to a </garnt>
<garnt> place you haven't been to for a long </garnt>
<garnt> time but you've valued for a long time </garnt>
<garnt> but then something small changes and </garnt>
<garnt> you're like I hate it I hate it how dare </garnt>
<garnt> this small thing change even though </garnt>
<garnt> that's the natural course of Life yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like how dare my favorite restaurant </garnt>
<joey> near my house like [ __ ] closer like </joey>
<garnt> that yeah and you're like how like it </garnt>
<joey> like nothing hurts more like perfect </joey>
<garnt> like yeah so like my grandma's house for </garnt>
<garnt> example in Japan is like a great example </garnt>
<garnt> of that I haven't been back since she </garnt>
<garnt> moved before the pandemic started yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and when I say she moved I literally </garnt>
<garnt> mean she moved from an apartment that </garnt>
<garnt> was like here to the apartment literally </garnt>
<garnt> across the road so in terms of local </garnt>
<garnt> area nothing has changed right but I'm </garnt>
<garnt> going back like at the end of the month </garnt>
<garnt> so you know to celebrate New Years and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just dreading I'm like it's the same </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not the same something </garnt>
<garnt> something about this is not the same not </garnt>
<garnt> the same even though it is the same and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like it's still in this it's </garnt>
<garnt> still in the same town it's literally </garnt>
<joey> across the road like if I wanted to go </joey>
<joey> to the old apartment it's like a 30 </joey>
<joey> second walk it's right there but I'm I'm </joey>
<joey> just dreading there's a part of me </joey>
<joey> that's dreading where I'm just like </joey>
<joey> it's not gonna be like it was before </joey>
<garnt> wasn't it and yeah especially going to </garnt>
<garnt> your Grandma's place yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> something that always felt like it never </garnt>
<garnt> changed like your grandparents place </garnt>
<garnt> that was always that was always the same </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] when you were a kid growing up </garnt>
<joey> teenager yeah I like my Grandma's place </joey>
<joey> in Australia That's My Sanctuary because </joey>
<garnt> I'm like that [ __ ] hasn't changed in </garnt>
<garnt> like 50 years yeah he's been living </garnt>
<joey> there her whole life I'm like that's </joey>
<joey> good but my grandma here I'm just like </joey>
<garnt> you've changed </garnt>
<garnt> how dare you change maybe I'm weird I </garnt>
<garnt> always liked you when it changed I was </garnt>
<garnt> like really you're you're upgrading or </garnt>
<joey> you're changing things yeah that's cool </joey>
<joey> but don't you feel like I don't know </joey>
<joey> don't you feel like you'd lose like even </joey>
<joey> a little bit of like that Nostalgia yeah </joey>
<connor> and I mean yeah sure but like does that </connor>
<garnt> I mean for me it's like I don't really I </garnt>
<garnt> don't really mind it's whatever </garnt>
<garnt> Nostalgia certain types of people man </garnt>
<garnt> Nostalgia is overrated I [ __ ] love </garnt>
<garnt> them </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah that's what I gave game </garnt>
<garnt> devs have been milking us dry with </garnt>
<connor> Nostalgia dude with the dog [ __ ] remake </connor>
<connor> that's why they're powering they're </connor>
<garnt> taking that and shoving it back in </garnt>
<garnt> if you never look back you can never </garnt>
<garnt> tell how far you've gotten man </garnt>
<connor> nostalgia's [ __ ] in fact man like </connor>
<garnt> this is Nostalgia looking back or is it </garnt>
<garnt> is it or is it missing or wanting that </garnt>
<joey> Feeling Again of it it's a bit of both </joey>
<connor> I'd say yeah </connor>
<connor> I'm retrospective I don't think I just </connor>
<joey> don't indulge it's looking but I think </joey>
<joey> Nostalgia is like a combination of </joey>
<joey> things it's it's the whole looking back </joey>
<joey> and being like ah you remember the good </joey>
<garnt> old days but also it's the looking back </garnt>
<garnt> and being like I remember my not not </garnt>
<garnt> where the world was at that point in </garnt>
<garnt> time but where I was in that point yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and it's like sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> don't miss that [ __ ] sometimes you're </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm glad I'm an adult now with </garnt>
<connor> Expendable income and I can do whatever </connor>
<garnt> the hell I want yeah whatever I want but </garnt>
