<connor> more or hotter it's gonna be the weekly </connor>
<garnt> thing or just like review like possible </garnt>
<joey> cancellation of the week cancellation </joey>
<garnt> and today on the chopping block today i </garnt>
<garnt> just i just found it funny that uh after </garnt>
<joey> all this time you actually go out your </joey>
<joey> way to watch anime again i think one </joey>
<joey> time i tweet about anime </joey>
<joey> joey </joey>
<garnt> joey has the first anime take in like </garnt>
<connor> what like six months and then uh what </connor>
<garnt> was the take </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> remind me okay </joey>
<connor> okay so </connor>
<connor> let me let me bring you up to speed </connor>
<garnt> right because this is a multi-layered </garnt>
<connor> okay okay this is like a multi-layered </connor>
<garnt> meme multimedia angles to cancel okay so </garnt>
<connor> it started off the the layer first </connor>
<garnt> starts at the caisson episode right that </garnt>
<garnt> which is of us recording it just went up </garnt>
<garnt> right and yeah you know thankfully a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of people loved it it was a great </garnt>
<garnt> episode right yeah but on one segment of </garnt>
<garnt> that show and there's a highlight clip </garnt>
<garnt> of it uh is where we talk about the jews </garnt>
<garnt> of kaisen anime yeah i think it's </garnt>
<garnt> because we were talking to caisson about </garnt>
<garnt> like what anime she's watched recently </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that </garnt>
<garnt> weeks ago for us um and so i was like </garnt>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> after me finally having seen it </garnt>
<garnt> you know a while back i was like oh i'll </garnt>
<garnt> uh you know i think this might be a </garnt>
<garnt> perfect time right now since we're </garnt>
<joey> already talking about the anime to you </joey>
<joey> know kind of go into it a little bit </joey>
<joey> talk about it right give our thoughts on </joey>
<joey> it how hot takes if you will yeah uh and </joey>
<garnt> my hot take of dudes to kaisen was me </garnt>
<garnt> saying i thought it was okay </garnt>
<joey> and uh and then followed by i just </joey>
<connor> preferred demon slayer yeah that's a </connor>
<connor> show right and there's a [ __ ] high </connor>
<connor> likelihood i mean you are a clown for </connor>
<connor> that opinion i gotta admit </connor>
<garnt> maybe i don't know a new season though </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of tough right right maybe </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah okay at the time of </garnt>
<connor> recording that was clown take but now </connor>
<joey> okay maybe not i mean it was a clown </joey>
<joey> take those because it's literally </joey>
<garnt> because in the clip i'm pretty sure i </garnt>
<garnt> said something along the lines of jesus </garnt>
<garnt> kaisen had everything that you know i </garnt>
<garnt> thought i was going to like but for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason whatever it was i can't even give </garnt>
<garnt> like a like a proper </garnt>
<garnt> viable like you know </garnt>
<garnt> reason for it to just say that for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason it just didn't really click in my </garnt>
<garnt> head yeah never did i say that the show </garnt>
<garnt> was like mid or that the show was bad in </garnt>
<connor> any way i just said i thought it was </connor>
<connor> okay yeah yeah twitter </connor>
<connor> went </connor>
<connor> ballistic over that </connor>
<connor> there were like a couple of how how </connor>
<connor> ballistic we talking i mean after a few </connor>
<connor> angry people or like i mean yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> you know twitter does what's what it </garnt>
<garnt> does best right it gets [ __ ] you know </garnt>
<garnt> just overblows everything out of </garnt>
<garnt> proportion but like i even had a couple </garnt>
<garnt> of people tweeting at me like videos </garnt>
<garnt> from like small and youtubers being like </garnt>
<garnt> joe you're getting canceled and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> oh god what now </garnt>
<garnt> is it for something i liked on twitter i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know and i went to look at it and </garnt>
<garnt> it was like joey's hottest take on jews </garnt>
<garnt> and kyson and on the thumbnail it just </garnt>
<garnt> says he thought it was okay and i was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh my god i can't even call a show </garnt>
<garnt> okay anymore without being cancelled </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] is this and then so </garnt>
<garnt> that's layer one yeah okay okay layer </garnt>
<garnt> two </garnt>
<garnt> is when i started watching demon slave </garnt>
<garnt> season two recently right and i made a </garnt>
<garnt> tweet you know first tweet in six months </garnt>
<garnt> about anime where i say something along </garnt>
<garnt> the lines of uh i started watching </garnt>
<garnt> season two of demon slayer happy to say </garnt>
<garnt> zany is still the worst character in the </garnt>
<garnt> show </garnt>
<garnt> all the zenitsu fans went ballistic </garnt>
<garnt> as they do of course they do as they do </garnt>
<connor> you know calling your best boy </connor>
<connor> they stand up wearing those diapers yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly yes </connor>
<connor> and then and then but </connor>
<connor> but then some people took it back to </connor>
<joey> that you know recent [ __ ] clip of me </joey>
<joey> talking about jesus christ and saying </joey>
<joey> that demons better than jesus christ and </joey>
<joey> they had the audacity to be like oh now </joey>
<joey> he's backpedaling </joey>
<joey> now he's backpedaling now he said he he </joey>
<garnt> hyped up demon slayer so much even </garnt>
<garnt> comparing it to jesus christ and saying </garnt>
<garnt> it was better than jesus christ and now </garnt>
<garnt> he's saying that oh it's it's the demon </garnt>
<garnt> slayer is not a good show which i never </garnt>
<garnt> said </garnt>
<garnt> mind you i just said zany to [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sucks because he does </garnt>
<garnt> right he does and it's like and it's </garnt>
<connor> like if anything i'm [ __ ] enjoying </connor>
<connor> season two right now season two has been </connor>
<connor> great i feel season two's like kind of </connor>
<joey> brought back the hype for demon slayer </joey>
<connor> for a long time yeah right i wasn't that </connor>
<connor> hype but season two is made yeah </connor>
<joey> definitely like the like the movie you </joey>
<joey> know as moon oh god is this going to be </joey>
<joey> another [ __ ] hot take as as okay as i </joey>
<connor> thought the movie was </connor>
<connor> no okay okay i'll agree with you i </connor>
<connor> thought the season two has blown the </connor>
<garnt> movie yeah out of the way you know i'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna say because like i recently just </garnt>
<garnt> finished my anime with the you know man </garnt>
<garnt> made of the year video i feel like anime </garnt>
<connor> has gotten uh so much better now that </connor>
<connor> just saying something is okay </connor>
<connor> is now detrimental to the anime right </connor>
<connor> right it's not even bad anymore yeah </connor>
<connor> like calling something mid is an insult </connor>
<connor> and someone calling something okay is an </connor>
<garnt> insult i feel like it's a copy pastor </garnt>
<garnt> now where everyone is like attack on </garnt>
<garnt> titan is mid it's basically a copyright </garnt>
<connor> right like everyone everyone that keeps </connor>
<connor> saying that exact phrase yeah not no </connor>
<connor> elaboration no attack on titan is mid </connor>
<connor> because it's such easy bait yeah it </connor>
<connor> it's literally fake but everyone does </connor>
<connor> but the thing is i didn't even say jesus </connor>
<garnt> and kaisen is okay for bait i just </garnt>
<garnt> legitimately think it's just okay </garnt>
<connor> i really like jesus </connor>
<connor> yeah and and that's fine right like </connor>
<connor> there were parts of jesus christ i </connor>
<joey> really enjoyed but i don't i personally </joey>
<joey> didn't enjoy it as much as other people </joey>
<garnt> or as i thought i was going to well do </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like saying something is okay </garnt>
<joey> or mid is even more of an insult than </joey>
<joey> saying something is bad nowadays because </joey>
<joey> i feel like maybe i i feel like i've </joey>
<joey> just like at least in like discussing </joey>
<joey> shows or anime or whatever or manga i </joey>
<joey> feel like you you don't see as many </joey>
<joey> people just saying something is straight </joey>
<joey> up bad anymore right people just say oh </joey>
<joey> it's mid it's just mid yes okay look </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> i get the word mid mid is insulting yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah he's admitted so little effort to </joey>
<joey> articulate how you feel about a show you </joey>
<connor> can't even you can't even like </connor>
<connor> get the energy to even describe what you </connor>
<joey> don't like about it </joey>
<garnt> i feel like the the word average when </garnt>
<connor> talking about a show there's like </connor>
<garnt> there's like a a contention between like </garnt>
<connor> okay being like you know taking more in </connor>
<connor> a positive way yeah and then mid being </connor>
<connor> taken in like a negative way right but </connor>
<connor> they both mean the same thing </connor>
<garnt> technically speaking mid is just short </garnt>
<garnt> for middle </garnt>
<garnt> which is okay </garnt>
<joey> yeah neither good or bad just okay right </joey>
<joey> but like i feel now people take the word </joey>
<joey> okay and put like a negative spin on it </joey>
<connor> which yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like if uh </connor>
<connor> let's say uh </connor>
<connor> you had a wedding right yeah and you're </connor>
<connor> like mom did you like the wedding she's </connor>
<connor> like it was okay </connor>
<connor> i would be annoyed i would be like what </connor>
<connor> do you mean my wedding was just uh i </connor>
<connor> invited you i put on a spread right but </connor>
<joey> i feel okay but i feel it's free but i </joey>
<joey> feel but i feel it's kind of on you to </joey>
<connor> compare your own wedding to jesus </connor>
<connor> how strongly i feel how about my best </connor>
<garnt> friend okay yeah i was like how did we </garnt>
<garnt> get from jiu-jitsu guys into a wedding </garnt>
<connor> because i'm just thinking like let's </connor>
<connor> just say you are you you put your heart </connor>
<connor> and soul out of the sub that you like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah okay </connor>
<garnt> i'm gonna go to sydney today and be like </garnt>
<joey> sydney i know we're getting married this </joey>
<joey> year but like justin tyson right i mean </joey>
<garnt> it's it's kind of it's kind of more </garnt>
<garnt> important </garnt>
<connor> i pulled my heart into jiu-jitsu i said </connor>
<garnt> more than i did the wedding i hope so </garnt>
<connor> you know there's someone out there that </connor>
<connor> would say that i hope somebody asked me </connor>
<connor> how was god's wedding because i know i </connor>
<connor> know what i'm going to say </connor>
<joey> i already know what i'm going to say i </joey>
<joey> prefer jesus </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know just uh so so my uh my </joey>
<garnt> advice to all of you who perhaps want to </garnt>
<joey> share your opinion about anime don't use </joey>
<connor> the word okay from now on it can get you </connor>
<connor> canceled no it's just because it's </connor>
<joey> because of who we are right it's cause </joey>
<garnt> like now we we have this little show we </garnt>
<joey> do this little thing this little show </joey>
<garnt> show you know and uh it's all it's i </garnt>
<garnt> think there's a lot more eyes on us yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so people </garnt>
<joey> want to want to get angry uh </joey>
<garnt> you know because a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> people are getting annoyed at this stuff </garnt>
<garnt> aren't the people who like actually like </garnt>
<garnt> watch trash taste yeah </garnt>
<connor> outside of trash taste maybe have like </connor>
<connor> some followers who've watched trash </connor>
<garnt> taste maybe say some of the clips or </garnt>
<joey> whatever and they're like you won't </joey>
<garnt> believe what they these these guys who i </garnt>
<garnt> don't already watch or engage with said </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> they don't know how we we behave or how </garnt>
<garnt> we like go towards the topic or how we </garnt>
<connor> tackle it it's just like he just said </connor>
<garnt> this thing i disagree with it i'm gonna </garnt>
<joey> get angry what's what's like really </joey>
<joey> weird especially about my jewish kaisen </joey>
<joey> hot take hot take is the fact that i </joey>
<garnt> called usually kyson okay </garnt>
<joey> months ago on my own channel yeah no one </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] batted a knife </joey>
<connor> right it's weird because like i feel </connor>
<connor> we've got to that point now where </connor>
<connor> uh like not super small twitter accounts </connor>
<garnt> but some twitter accounts with some </garnt>
<garnt> decent followings will be like </garnt>
<garnt> this clown take on trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> also kind of cool i'm like oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> awesome that people feel like i'm </garnt>
<connor> they're big like we're big enough where </connor>
<connor> they can just openly like criticize us i </connor>
<joey> mean yeah like go ahead </joey>
<joey> it is it is humbling to think that my </joey>
<connor> offhand comment about an anime has like </connor>
<connor> stirred up this much controversy </connor>
<connor> it's kind of cool but at the same time </connor>
<joey> it's like can you not cancel me for </joey>
<connor> saying that a show is okay i could at </connor>
<connor> least sleep over here if someone gets </connor>
<connor> angry </connor>
<joey> sleeping over and i just think it's a </joey>
<connor> little like you know i'm glad i you know </connor>
<connor> imagine uh </connor>
<connor> back four or five years ago if i'd said </connor>
<connor> the same [ __ ] no no one would give up oh </connor>
<connor> okay i think like i'm glad that people </connor>
<connor> care sometimes it's annoying it's a </connor>
<joey> little too much i love it thank you for </joey>
<connor> caring about my dumb opinion about a </connor>
<connor> show i don't care about joe's opinion </connor>
<joey> i don't even care about my opinion i </joey>
<garnt> just said it well i i think the argument </garnt>
<garnt> is that you know we are you know </garnt>
<garnt> creators who have a platform and an </garnt>
<garnt> influence i mean that's why they call </garnt>
<garnt> people like us influencers right </garnt>
<connor> you know i mean i'm i have the i got </connor>
<connor> like that evil voice going for me so i </connor>
<connor> feel like it works yeah someone calls me </connor>
<joey> an influencer yeah it's just like the </joey>
<joey> one thing i don't like about that word </joey>
<connor> is that it can apply to </connor>
<garnt> so many things you know like a cult </garnt>
<garnt> leader is technically an influencer as </garnt>
<garnt> well those are the influences yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they're the og influencers right like i </garnt>
<joey> don't know if i want to be bunched up in </joey>
<connor> those games i'm kidding by the way i i i </connor>
<connor> actually like the word i like to think </connor>
<connor> that i make something that's somewhat </connor>
<garnt> entertaining and good yeah i'm just a </garnt>
<joey> dude on the internet no no yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i'm with a bunch of hot days yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i mean i i feel like you know i i </garnt>
<garnt> get it to a certain extent where we do </garnt>
<garnt> have to you know be careful about some </garnt>
<garnt> of the stuff we say right because we you </garnt>
<garnt> know there are some topics that i feel </garnt>
<joey> we do have to like navigate it's very </joey>
<joey> you know very careful of course because </joey>
<joey> there are other creators out there who </joey>
<joey> do have a platform and uh their word </joey>
<joey> they say [ __ ] and uh their words have a </joey>
<joey> tangible effect on the real world and </joey>
<garnt> the community they talk to but at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time </garnt>
<garnt> there there are some things that i just </garnt>
<connor> like i it blows my mind that people care </connor>
<connor> this much about right right </connor>
<garnt> and you know like one of one of the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest things that i don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> is you know people take this people will </garnt>
<garnt> people will take this you know one </garnt>
<garnt> minute two minute clip from trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> or from one of our streams because it's </garnt>
<garnt> happened to me a bunch of times right uh </garnt>
<garnt> where </garnt>
<garnt> where i will see this clip being </garnt>
<garnt> circulated where it's like a one or two </garnt>
<garnt> minute clip from the podcast on my </garnt>
<garnt> stream that's like not scripted it's </garnt>
<garnt> just in a conversation that's most of </garnt>
<garnt> the time doesn't even have anything to </garnt>
<garnt> do with the take that i'm saying in that </garnt>
<garnt> one clip because it's like one or two </garnt>
<garnt> minutes yeah yeah yeah and they will </garnt>
<garnt> take this clip and then spin it to like </garnt>
<connor> a whole new level of </connor>
<connor> like you've planned it all out yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's a [ __ ] mastermind move </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and like and like i think of </connor>
<connor> this in context right and i'm thinking i </connor>
<connor> don't think people who watch our show or </connor>
<connor> people who are super fans of the show is </connor>
<connor> going to be influenced by a one minute </connor>
<connor> clip of us talking about this one </connor>
<connor> subject right that most of the time </connor>
<connor> doesn't even have to do with the overall </connor>
<connor> conversation it's just like it's just </connor>
<connor> most of the time just like an offhand </connor>
<connor> comment or something yeah i don't think </connor>
<garnt> that's gonna [ __ ] influence anybody </garnt>
<connor> yeah like on that on that segment where </connor>
<connor> joe you you spoke about jesus christ and </connor>
<connor> i was like no you're you're a clown </connor>
<connor> right it's good you know how if you're a </connor>
<garnt> viewer it's like how can you argue that </garnt>
<garnt> then </garnt>
<garnt> you're being influenced to be like juju </garnt>
<garnt> kaisen is mitt or okay because like </garnt>
<garnt> there's an active argument going on </garnt>
<garnt> where you're saying no it's it's not </garnt>
<garnt> you're wrong so like what do you think </garnt>
<connor> well right you take away from that it's </connor>
<connor> not oh i'm going to think to carson's </connor>
<joey> mid even if you're like a super fan </joey>
<joey> right it's so stupid </joey>
<connor> that's what i think i like about you </connor>
<garnt> know those kinds of discussions on the </garnt>
<connor> show especially when like you know to to </connor>
<garnt> or all of us are like arguing against </garnt>
<garnt> each other right is that like it gives </garnt>
<garnt> so many different points of views where </garnt>
<garnt> like it's up to the viewers now who you </garnt>
<garnt> want to agree with right and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's not so much it's not so much me </garnt>
<garnt> saying hey because i think jesus christ </garnt>
<garnt> is okay you should also think that way i </garnt>
<garnt> mean if you want to think that way </garnt>
<garnt> that's on you right but it's not like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm coming out here you know [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> starting a demo of being like everybody </garnt>
<garnt> stand up and rise jesus christ is just </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i just don't get it like you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's fine to be influenced by certain </garnt>
<garnt> things but at the same time </garnt>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> it's just a sharp well i think it's a </joey>
<garnt> good problem to have in our job of </garnt>
<garnt> course of course people would uh </garnt>
<garnt> spend a lot lot many years trying to get </garnt>
<garnt> to the point where we're very fortunate </garnt>
<garnt> where you know people watch trash tanks </garnt>
<garnt> and people care i feel very lucky that </garnt>
<connor> people want to get angry about small </connor>
<joey> things like jokes yeah that's fine is it </joey>
<joey> is it you know is it a contention for </joey>
<joey> cancellation though i'm not sure about </joey>
<connor> that yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know it goes back to like online </connor>
<connor> hate day as well i mean i've gone to the </connor>
<connor> point now where it doesn't really bother </connor>
<garnt> me that much at all really it's got it's </garnt>
<garnt> interesting i don't i think this is just </garnt>
<garnt> because i've been online for so long now </garnt>
<garnt> where now i'm just kind of like </garnt>
<connor> at equilibrium with it i'm like i don't </connor>
<joey> know yeah it's it's i wouldn't even say </joey>
<garnt> it's because like i'm okay with it now </garnt>
<garnt> or i'm like numb to it i guess it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i think i think jessica negri said it </garnt>
<garnt> best </garnt>
<garnt> uh she said when someone asked her about </garnt>
<garnt> like how do you deal with like internet </garnt>
<garnt> hate yeah like how do you get over it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and she said like you never get </garnt>
<joey> over it it still hurts but you just </joey>
<garnt> learn to live with it like to to me to </garnt>
<garnt> me because we have talked about this a </garnt>
<garnt> few times but to me like you know </garnt>
<garnt> without getting to like the online hate </garnt>
<garnt> thing the thing that like the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that annoys me then just people actually </garnt>
<garnt> actually just like hating on me and </garnt>
<garnt> hating on my content for example is just </garnt>
<garnt> when when people are like trying to put </garnt>
<garnt> words in my mouth yeah to be like to be </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> gant said this or god said this and that </garnt>
<garnt> means x you know or that means x y z and </garnt>
<connor> that that to me there's nothing that </connor>
<connor> wants to make me reply more than people </connor>
<connor> who are spreading this idea that i you </connor>
<garnt> know maybe others </garnt>
<joey> it is right it is it is </joey>
<garnt> because at that point like it's i've </garnt>
<garnt> seen some like instances where like you </garnt>
<garnt> know i say one thing right and then it </garnt>
<garnt> just like spirals out into this like </garnt>
<garnt> insane story about like how i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> killed a child or some [ __ ] right like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like that level of like how did you </garnt>
<garnt> take this one little piece of </garnt>
<garnt> information and spin it in a way that </garnt>
<garnt> it's just couldn't be further from the </garnt>
<garnt> trip like you're basically writing a fan </garnt>
<garnt> fiction at that point </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like it's like what and then </garnt>
<garnt> there are people who look at that and be </garnt>
<joey> like oh yeah that's that sounds like </joey>
<joey> something he'd say i'm like what </joey>
<garnt> i've been thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> because i i swear to god i don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> they like i i don't know if the anime </garnt>
<garnt> community was always like this because </garnt>
<garnt> like to me there are there are some </garnt>
<garnt> there are some topics that i always like </garnt>
<garnt> used to love arguing about you know </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i felt like to me you know there are </garnt>
<garnt> some things where you really have to be </garnt>
<joey> careful about what you say in terms like </joey>
<joey> religion politics and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> you know that's the reason why we never </joey>
<joey> talk about that we've spoken about a </joey>
<joey> little bit yeah yeah yeah and uh we </joey>
<garnt> never actually try and avoid it </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you just want to have like a </joey>
<joey> fun argument on someone where you can </joey>
<garnt> you can just [ __ ] on your opinion and </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to worry about about it </garnt>
<joey> because you know that at the end of the </joey>
<joey> day the topic doesn't really matter that </joey>
<joey> much right and to me like as as an anime </joey>
<joey> fan anime was always one of those topics </joey>
<joey> for me until like quite recently and i </joey>
<garnt> don't know if that's just my perception </garnt>
<garnt> because like another topic i would say </garnt>
<garnt> is you can easily argue with anyone </garnt>
<garnt> about is food everyone loves arguing </garnt>
<garnt> about food we do it all the [ __ ] time </garnt>
<garnt> because it's fun and it's fun because </garnt>
<garnt> people understand that people have </garnt>
<garnt> different tastes and opinions right and </garnt>
<garnt> to me like anime was always </garnt>
<garnt> at that same level as i can easily argue </garnt>
<garnt> about anyone with anime and not have to </garnt>
<garnt> worry about you know hurting their </garnt>
<garnt> feelings too much because i i just </garnt>
<garnt> assume we all everyone in our community </garnt>
<garnt> has like an understanding that dude you </garnt>
<garnt> can have your own taste you can have </garnt>
<joey> your own it's mutual agreement that at </joey>
<joey> the end of the day even if this one </joey>
<connor> random internet person doesn't think </connor>
<connor> that your favorite show is as good as it </connor>
<connor> is it's like well that's not going to </connor>
<joey> deter me from the fact that i still like </joey>
<connor> the show it's just changed just because </connor>
<joey> of the scale of trash taste right it's </joey>
<garnt> like you know there's nothing like this </garnt>
<garnt> back in the day you know back in podtaku </garnt>
<joey> what was the like average viewer count </joey>
<garnt> like i think our most viewed podcast </garnt>
<garnt> ever was like 100k </garnt>
<connor> which you know back then was crazy </connor>
<joey> crazy yeah you know obviously the scale </joey>
<garnt> is completely different now yeah anime </garnt>
<joey> has also been somewhat more democratized </joey>
<connor> in a way like democratized </connor>
<joey> yeah definitely more it's more available </joey>
<connor> to more eyes it's a lot easier to get a </connor>
<connor> hold of yeah </connor>
<joey> you know and discourse about it is way </joey>
<joey> more open and people are way more open </joey>
<connor> to talk about it so i think that's why </connor>
<connor> it's some of the reasons why </connor>
<joey> so the problem is it's getting popular </joey>
<connor> well essentially i mean </connor>
<garnt> you could almost say it's becoming </garnt>
<garnt> mainstream insider because i i was i i </garnt>
<garnt> always had this like image that </garnt>
<garnt> the anime community felt like it was </garnt>
<garnt> about like 10 5 10 years behind what we </garnt>
<garnt> saw with the gaming community right </garnt>
<garnt> because it felt like maybe gaming the </garnt>
<garnt> gaming industry also had this shift </garnt>
<garnt> where games used to be just this fun </garnt>
<garnt> things you numb your numb your brain out </garnt>
<garnt> to didn't really matter that much you </garnt>
<garnt> know you could just have your fun with </garnt>
<garnt> it and then now games mean like </garnt>
<garnt> games are a big business </garnt>
<connor> and it's the same yeah i know that some </connor>
<garnt> people gave zelda breath the while like </garnt>
<garnt> a seven out of ten when it came out and </garnt>
<connor> they got controversy for that </connor>
<garnt> because they didn't give it a nine or </garnt>
<joey> ten or something so basically they got </joey>
<joey> canceled for saying breath of the wild </joey>
<joey> was just okay </joey>
<joey> we've had the same thing it's the same </joey>
<joey> thing again isn't it incredible how one </joey>
<joey> word can completely change everything </joey>
<joey> like there's such a huge difference in </joey>
<joey> like insinuation between calling </joey>
<joey> something good and calling something </joey>
<connor> just good it could be the attitude </connor>
<connor> towards it as well you know sometimes i </connor>
<connor> think uh </connor>
<connor> sometimes </connor>
<connor> i can understand sometimes the way you </connor>
<connor> talk about anime could definitely like </connor>
<connor> you're so like you're like yeah it's mid </connor>
<connor> and i can understand why why you piss </connor>
<garnt> people off because you sound like you </garnt>
<garnt> won't even entertain the conversation </garnt>
<garnt> you're like i [ __ ] hate the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> you even brought this up to me it was </garnt>
<connor> mid stop talking to me about it so i can </connor>
<connor> understand why sometimes people can get </connor>
<connor> annoyed by that yeah because they're </connor>
<connor> like i wish joey just even listened to </connor>
<connor> me it's like me trying to get approval </connor>
<connor> from my parents it's like i wish my </connor>
<connor> parents just gave it a chance it's like </connor>
<connor> no no it's like you're like [ __ ] you're </connor>
<connor> like it's mid you know i think maybe </connor>
<connor> that's what annoys people i yeah and and </connor>
<connor> look i can completely get that as well </connor>
<connor> and that is my bad to be fair but at the </connor>
<connor> same time it's like you know sometimes i </connor>
<connor> don't even bother engaging in these </connor>
<joey> conversations because i already know how </joey>
<garnt> it's going to end i i i i get you i get </garnt>
<garnt> you because it's just it's just happened </garnt>
<garnt> so many times that i've done this for </garnt>
<joey> almost nine years yeah i know how a </joey>
<connor> conversation like this is gonna end i i </connor>
<connor> mean i've known you for ages so yeah i </connor>
<connor> could say i know how you are with these </connor>
<joey> conversations yeah i could say i could </joey>
<joey> give out all these like well thought out </joey>
<joey> constructed arguments about why i think </joey>
<connor> the show was okay and people will be </connor>
<joey> like but but but but but but i don't </joey>
<joey> agree with that and i'm like oh my gosh </joey>
<connor> what more can i say so what you're </connor>
<connor> saying is if trash day started six years </connor>
<connor> ago you might have got more enthusiastic </connor>
<joey> debate oh yeah dude </joey>
<joey> this would actually be an anime podcast </joey>
<joey> no no no no i don't </joey>
<connor> you know going back to the hate thing </connor>
<connor> what's uh because you always get asked </connor>
<connor> right by new creators or something or </connor>
<connor> anyone uh how do you deal with online </connor>
<garnt> hey what's what's the advice that you </garnt>
<garnt> give someone because i've been i've been </garnt>
<garnt> mulling this over a lot recently because </garnt>
<garnt> i think my opinion on it has changed </garnt>
<garnt> quite a lot </garnt>
<garnt> since the last time we talked about this </garnt>
<garnt> i think so i think i had this like </garnt>
<garnt> perspective shift uh recently and i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why um but i was like </garnt>
<garnt> i the whole thing of uh living with it </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff is totally valid advice and i </garnt>
<garnt> think that's also good but i don't know </garnt>
<connor> what happened but now i look at it and i </connor>
<connor> don't really care at all when i see it </connor>
<connor> because to me in my head i they're never </connor>
<connor> angry at like me as a individual person </connor>
<connor> when i read that it's like they're angry </connor>
<connor> at like what they think is me </connor>
<connor> right right they're not angry at if they </connor>
<garnt> sat with me and spoke with me they </garnt>
<garnt> probably wouldn't feel that way right </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah but they angry at the idea of </garnt>
<garnt> me and and more often than not it's like </garnt>
<connor> they were never going to give me a </connor>
<connor> chance anyway because i'm just i must be </connor>
<joey> a personality they don't like yeah see </joey>
<joey> but like i feel that way of thinking </joey>
<connor> about things is only </connor>
<connor> was has only been constructed because </connor>
<garnt> you've been doing this for so long yeah </garnt>
<connor> definitely and like i don't think there </connor>
<connor> are very very few people who can come </connor>
<connor> right into this industry from the jump </connor>
<connor> and have this like enough </connor>
<garnt> self-confidence in themselves and their </garnt>
<garnt> content and their self-image on the </garnt>
<garnt> internet to be like well that's not </garnt>
<connor> about me that's just about their image </connor>
<connor> of me right and i feel like you know </connor>
<connor> especially when i started off like i </connor>
<connor> didn't have that kind of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> confidence right now sure a lot of </connor>
<connor> people didn't where you know so like </connor>
<garnt> anything like the moment your name gets </garnt>
<garnt> mentioned in something and even if it's </garnt>
<garnt> not exactly the most like detrimental </garnt>
<garnt> thing you know jab at your personality </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> i think people just not used to this and </garnt>
<garnt> having this like random amount of people </garnt>
<garnt> coming up to you and being like by the </garnt>
<garnt> way your kind of [ __ ] you know is a </garnt>
<connor> thing that we're not really used to </connor>
<connor> right because the human wasn't involved </connor>
<garnt> how many people just walk down the </garnt>
<connor> street and have a random person be like </connor>
<connor> excuse me you're [ __ ] like no </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't happen right but on the </garnt>
<connor> internet that's normal and i think new </connor>
<garnt> york yeah </garnt>
<connor> that said like people on the internet </connor>
<connor> have internet have gotten way too used </connor>
<joey> to saying things not getting punched in </joey>
<garnt> the face for it yeah they're like </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely there's no repercussions so </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you know they they just think </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's just free range to say the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i want </garnt>
<garnt> and i was about to say like you know and </garnt>
<garnt> yes in a sense it is kind of free range </garnt>
<garnt> to say whatever you want but you know </garnt>
<garnt> with the repercussions you know like you </garnt>
<garnt> can say whatever you want as long as </garnt>
<garnt> you're willing to pay for the </garnt>
<joey> repercussions if they come back to you </joey>
<garnt> right and they're very well might you </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah because like i actually had to </garnt>
<joey> like train my mom up for this like </joey>
<joey> recently because she she's not getting </joey>
<joey> hate but sometimes she goes through like </joey>
<joey> the trash taste videos and like you know </joey>
<joey> some of the streams and like the </joey>
<joey> comments and she like finds these </joey>
<joey> comments and like </joey>
<connor> god i want to reply right now i want to </connor>
<connor> tell them that they're wrong i'm like </connor>
<connor> mom do not do that </connor>
<connor> do not do that that's even worse </connor>
<connor> my mom does like because my mom my mum </connor>
<connor> reads like so many comments and like she </connor>
<connor> does she doesn't understand how to like </connor>
<garnt> how to deal with online hate especially </garnt>
<garnt> to like her own son so she's just she's </garnt>
<garnt> just like well sometimes she'll just </garnt>
<garnt> like send me send me like a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] comments being like look at all </garnt>
<garnt> these people saying wrong information </garnt>
<joey> about you i want to reply is that i </joey>
<garnt> wanted like a southeast asian thing </garnt>
<garnt> because aki's mom does exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> where she had to be like mom stop </garnt>
<joey> sending me this [ __ ] stop replying to </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] just leave it i'm fine </joey>
<garnt> i literally have to explain to her it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like if a school bully said </garnt>
<garnt> something to me and and you come up to </garnt>
<joey> the school bully in front of everyone </joey>
<garnt> and be like don't talk don't talk about </garnt>
<garnt> my son like that </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like mom this looks even worse than </garnt>
<garnt> even if i reply to her personally okay </garnt>
<connor> oh no </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> how did she take it how did she take it </connor>
<garnt> i mean she i mean i told her not to do </garnt>
<garnt> it i'm just like don't you just just </garnt>
<joey> don't read it mom just i i understand </joey>
<joey> what you're going through everyone who's </joey>
<joey> a content creator goes through this at </joey>
<joey> the beginning but you just gotta </joey>
<garnt> understand that people are gonna get </garnt>
<joey> just gonna stay stuff and actually </joey>
<joey> couldn't be more the opposite of that </joey>
<joey> like my parents would be like oh you </joey>
<joey> know my dad would be like oh yeah some </joey>
<garnt> people were saying [ __ ] about your last </garnt>
<garnt> video and i'm like really he's like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but they're all dicks don't worry about </garnt>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> bro i'm sweating for the day where i'm </joey>
<joey> just waiting for the day where i wake up </joey>
<connor> on twitter one day and then i wake up to </connor>
<connor> like a screenshot that's been spread </connor>
<connor> viral about my mum replying to like one </connor>
<connor> of my haters comments be like yo have </connor>
<connor> you seen what god's mom said to this </connor>
<garnt> person and i'm like for [ __ ] that's fine </garnt>
<joey> i just want to say tweet i just want to </joey>
<garnt> see it from your mom being like what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] did you say to you little [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> now </connor>
<connor> i'll have you know i have 300 confirmed </connor>
<connor> kills </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> oh my god i love that </connor>
<joey> i i think we should uh we need some </joey>
<joey> comments from your mom i think that's </joey>
<joey> yeah definitely i think that'd be good </joey>
<connor> we should have a segment we read out </connor>
<connor> your mum's required comments </connor>
<garnt> have your parents ever like look through </garnt>
<garnt> your comments or look through your </garnt>
<connor> videos to see what people are saying </connor>
<connor> about you i think so i think my mom one </connor>
<garnt> time was like really sad about it she </garnt>
<garnt> was like why are they saying mean things </garnt>
<garnt> there's on this one thing about you </garnt>
<garnt> right she's like don't worry about it </garnt>
<joey> it's not a big deal she's like it's so </joey>
<joey> cute though yeah she was way more upset </joey>
<joey> about it than i was yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] you know uh </joey>
<garnt> obviously because it's not normal to see </garnt>
<joey> people bad-mouth your </joey>
<garnt> son yeah of course it's not a normal </garnt>
<connor> thing you get to experience yeah it's </connor>
<joey> quite a visceral emotion i mean i i'd be </joey>
<joey> lying if i said if if my kid was in that </joey>
<joey> situation i wouldn't do the same thing </joey>
<connor> right oh yeah i'd probably want to punch </connor>
<joey> punch someone yeah i'd be like don't </joey>
<garnt> worry you made my kids they're just </garnt>
<garnt> dicks yeah yeah like honestly i i kind </garnt>
<garnt> of get it i'm the same i guess because i </garnt>
<joey> i feel like more anger when i see you </joey>
<joey> know people's [ __ ] talking sydney </joey>
<joey> when i when i see people oh yeah it's </joey>
<connor> the same like </connor>
<connor> if i see one person's [ __ ] talking when </connor>
<garnt> i'm bros i'm just like [ __ ] that yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah i wanna i wanna [ __ ] call them </joey>
<joey> out now and i guess like if in that vein </joey>
<garnt> like the one i think the one thing i </garnt>
<garnt> hate more than people taking my [ __ ] out </garnt>
<garnt> of context right and trying to cancel me </garnt>
<garnt> for something completely not related is </garnt>
<garnt> when they just like drag my friend into </garnt>
<garnt> it and especially people who like don't </garnt>
<garnt> matter at all i'm like okay you can say </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] about me right like i'll take care </garnt>
<garnt> of her that'll be my problem yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> don't drag people who have nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> with this [ __ ] yeah don't drag in my </garnt>
<garnt> girlfriend or my friends or like my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] mom or anything like this got </garnt>

<garnt> creators uh it's healthy you know and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like to me being able to talk to </garnt>
<garnt> other content creators about it it's a </garnt>
<garnt> healthy way to get </garnt>
<garnt> all of this like toxicity out of </garnt>
<garnt> yourself and just you know get on with </garnt>
<connor> your life yeah you know i think uh </connor>
<connor> before trash takes definitely we need to </connor>
<garnt> talk to another content creator every </garnt>
<garnt> now and then just rent yeah just need it </garnt>
<garnt> because it's better to rent to another </garnt>
<joey> content creator than do it on a video or </joey>
<garnt> a stream oh yeah definitely okay all </garnt>
<joey> right i got a i got a question have you </joey>
<joey> guys ever like tried to explain when </joey>
<joey> you're like going through some </joey>
<connor> controversy or something's going on and </connor>
<connor> you have to try and explain it to </connor>
<connor> someone who just does not understand </connor>
<connor> youtube and it's just really involved oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah it doesn't work </garnt>
<connor> i'm just like don't worry about it it's </connor>
<garnt> a little annoying right now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah no like no hate against anyone </garnt>
<garnt> we explain this to because to to their </garnt>
<garnt> credit they tried their hardest to </garnt>
<garnt> understand what's going on but like i </garnt>
<joey> don't get it </joey>
<joey> yeah i i remember i had to like pretty </joey>
<joey> early on in my career when like you know </joey>
<joey> i was getting that like you know the </joey>
<connor> first initial wave of like you know </connor>
<connor> you're you're you're notable enough in </connor>
<connor> the community now where people outside </connor>
<connor> of your community will find you yeah </connor>
<connor> corpse party was made something like </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> but like you know when you when you </connor>
<garnt> first start to get that first wave and </garnt>
<garnt> you're like oh [ __ ] i don't know who to </garnt>
<garnt> talk about i don't know i'm getting </garnt>
<garnt> cancelled blah blah blah even though it </garnt>
<garnt> was like barely nothing right i remember </garnt>
<garnt> i was talking to one of my schoolmates </garnt>
<garnt> about it being like yeah so like </garnt>
<garnt> these bunch of people like coming into </garnt>
<joey> my you know comment section saying that </joey>
<joey> i suck and blah blah blah i remember one </joey>
<joey> of them was just straight up like just </joey>
<joey> tell them the [ __ ] off </joey>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> thought about that </garnt>
<joey> not an option unfortunately when you're </joey>
<garnt> it's with one of me and uh many others </garnt>
<garnt> you know who i'm up against not not </garnt>
<garnt> really that easy is it yeah because it </garnt>
<joey> really was that easy if if only because </joey>
<joey> like i remember like every time i've </joey>
<joey> tried to explain something that's been </joey>
<joey> going on in this in like the youtube's </joey>
<joey> field some controversy you're just like </joey>
<joey> oh okay so um this person said this and </joey>
<connor> it piss is pissing a bunch of people off </connor>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] twitter is getting angry </connor>
<connor> and then you talk to the person they're </connor>
<garnt> like uh why why people getting angry and </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like </garnt>
<connor> um i said this anime was bad </connor>
<connor> so this person said this anime was bad </connor>
<connor> and these group of people got pissed off </connor>
<connor> about it and then they go so why they </connor>
<garnt> pissed why why were they pissed off </garnt>
<garnt> about it and then you keep going layers </garnt>
<garnt> and layers deep until you get to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where you they just forget what the </garnt>
<joey> original like people are getting angry </joey>
<joey> for now or to the point where you like </joey>
<joey> the more arguments come through and the </joey>
<garnt> more layers down it goes you just start </garnt>
<garnt> to realize wait it's not a problem </garnt>
<joey> there's no problem to begin with i'm </joey>
<garnt> just making it yeah i mean like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember back in the day where drama </garnt>
<garnt> could be addressed with like one just </garnt>
<garnt> one short twit longer and now it's got </garnt>
<garnt> to a point where you need like a four </garnt>
<garnt> hour breakdown to like to like </garnt>
<garnt> understand like the full depth of some </garnt>
<garnt> of this drama and i like i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> when that shift happened when it was </garnt>
<garnt> just like okay now now you need a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] thesis like it's a full-on </garnt>
<garnt> dissertation to like to like break down </garnt>
<garnt> the like a play-by-play of like the </garnt>
<garnt> entire months </garnt>
<garnt> the entire month leading up to this one </garnt>
<joey> tweet except instead of one professor </joey>
<joey> like marking it down it's the entirety </joey>
<joey> of the internet being like but did you </joey>
<joey> use correct citations for it </joey>
<garnt> no marx do we have the receipts do you </garnt>
<joey> have the receipts </joey>
<joey> yeah it's uh it's it's crazy it's crazy </joey>
<joey> how uh </joey>
<joey> how especially that side of this the </joey>
<joey> internet has evolved especially like i </joey>
<joey> think i think drama culture is kind of a </joey>
<joey> thing now where oh it's definitely well </joey>
<joey> i i see some content creators who you </joey>
<joey> know start off </joey>
<joey> start off doing their own thing and then </joey>
<joey> i don't know how or why but </joey>
<joey> a lot of a lot of people i've seen have </joey>
<joey> just slowly shifted into just like </joey>
<joey> drama channels you know maybe </joey>
<joey> intentionally maybe not intentionally </joey>
<joey> but it seems like every other upload </joey>
<joey> seems to be talking about some kind of </joey>
<garnt> drama or some kind of consciousness </garnt>
<joey> that's going on </joey>
<connor> it's very good for business though oh </connor>
<joey> definitely it's </joey>
<joey> one of those things where if you're in </joey>
<garnt> drama that isn't really drama like it's </garnt>
<garnt> something you you let's say yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> you said you have a bad take on anime or </garnt>
<garnt> something right those kind of </garnt>
<garnt> drama are just generally just </garnt>
<garnt> good for you </garnt>
<garnt> because there's no real downside because </garnt>
<garnt> nobody nobody who actually watches you </garnt>
<garnt> gives a [ __ ] that you said a show is bad </garnt>
<garnt> i you know like when i said 86 i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> like 86 right there's a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> mad about that yeah but i doubt there </garnt>
<garnt> was many people who are like i can't </garnt>
<garnt> watch trash taste or connor ever again </garnt>
<garnt> because he said my favorite show is bad </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right but maybe other people who </garnt>
<garnt> are like maybe some people who are </garnt>
<garnt> watching you or some people outside of </garnt>
<garnt> it see this drama and think this is </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] stupid uh i might go </garnt>
<garnt> check them out or i'm more familiar with </garnt>
<garnt> their name through this drama because </garnt>
<joey> because drama has a really good way of </joey>
<joey> i feel like a click on a drama video is </joey>
<joey> like much more engaging than a normal </joey>
<joey> class oh yeah so when you get like a a </joey>
<joey> million views on a drama video yeah the </joey>
<joey> million views on that drama video and </joey>
<connor> maybe that's a generic gaming video </connor>
<connor> they're not equal like the drama </connor>
<connor> engagement and how much people are </connor>
<connor> invested is so much more yeah and </connor>
<connor> especially if it's something that paints </connor>
<connor> you in a good light or paints you in a </connor>
<connor> way that makes it look like you didn't </connor>
<connor> really do anything yeah then it's just </connor>
<connor> it's great for you because that now </connor>
<connor> you're just gonna get people who are </connor>
<connor> more invested in you people who think </connor>
<connor> that you've been done wrong and then </connor>
<connor> they're gonna support you more yeah so </connor>
<connor> when these people do this [ __ ] and they </connor>
<connor> try and drag you in the drama this is </connor>
<connor> why a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of big twitch streamers get into </connor>
<connor> this kind of drama very often because it </connor>
<connor> is really good for solid solidifying </connor>
<connor> your bass viewership they they want to </connor>
<connor> support you they will they will help you </connor>
<connor> and then people who see it and think oh </connor>
<connor> they weren't really in the wrong they </connor>
<connor> might come and check you out and feel a </connor>
<connor> bit more strongly about you because they </connor>
<connor> want to support you because they feel </connor>
<joey> like this is some [ __ ] that was done </joey>
<joey> to you i feel like drama videos like </joey>
<garnt> especially in like multiple successions </garnt>
<garnt> right on the same drama like every day </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's almost like the world's </garnt>
<garnt> most engaging let's play yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> in a sense where it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you're more likely if you're really into </garnt>
<joey> like a drama video you're more likely to </joey>
<garnt> come back to that part than </garnt>
<joey> i think i think it's just the modern day </joey>
<joey> reality tv show oh definitely because </joey>
<joey> like here's the thing do you think do </joey>
<garnt> you think people actually care about </garnt>
<garnt> drama do you think people like no only </garnt>
<joey> when it's like you know clearly like </joey>
<joey> there is a wrong person who did a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> thing right but like like 90 percent of </joey>
<connor> youtube drama is not yeah i think there </connor>
<garnt> is a there will be a core audience that </garnt>
<garnt> does feel betrayed </garnt>
<garnt> um but i think the majority people are </garnt>
<garnt> there just for the popcorn yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> because like i remember like the most </garnt>
<garnt> recent drama i can remember happening </garnt>
<garnt> off the top of my head right now uh is </garnt>
<joey> the one that involved pokemane and ninja </joey>
<garnt> right oh yeah and like obviously that </garnt>
<joey> got like a lot of views um </joey>
<joey> a lot of views when it came out and a </joey>
<joey> lot of people were discussing it but i </joey>
<connor> remember like my first initial reaction </connor>
<connor> to hearing about this drama that was </connor>
<connor> going on was </connor>
<connor> okay what the [ __ ] happened </connor>
<connor> it was so hard as a content creator i </connor>
<garnt> was like trying to like [ __ ] piece </garnt>
<garnt> together who was mad at who who did </garnt>
<garnt> wrong to who how did it lead to this </garnt>
<joey> situation and they were like like it </joey>
<joey> took philly d five minutes to explain it </joey>
<garnt> and that's a lot for philly d </garnt>
<garnt> and like i'm just like one minute russia </garnt>
<connor> is invading one minute for that yeah </connor>
<joey> five minutes of pokemon </joey>
<connor> it was like that i was like oh my god it </connor>
<joey> was like the majority of the video it </joey>
<garnt> was crazy like i had i had like an </garnt>
<garnt> easier time understanding some of like </garnt>
<garnt> the world situation going on right now </garnt>
<garnt> and the world politics then then then </garnt>
<garnt> like how this drama started and the </garnt>
<garnt> evolution of this drama it was like so </garnt>
<garnt> surreal like trying to trying to figure </garnt>
<garnt> out why like what was going on right </garnt>
<garnt> because if me as a content creator who </garnt>
<garnt> knows the content creators within this </garnt>
<joey> drama was like having trouble figuring </joey>
<joey> out because i wasn't there right at the </joey>
<joey> beginning yeah i can't imagine how a </joey>
<joey> general audience feels you know where </joey>
<joey> they're just feats where like it seems </joey>
<joey> like people are just seeing people talk </joey>
<joey> about this on their timeline and they </joey>
<joey> don't even like they don't even know </joey>
<joey> like that you get to a point where you </joey>
<joey> kind of are waiting for someone to tell </joey>
<garnt> you who you should be angry at right or </garnt>
<joey> who who's in the wrong and that's the </joey>
<joey> problem is that i feel 90 of drama is </joey>
<joey> not so much about like trying to uncover </joey>
<joey> the details and you know like gathering </joey>
<garnt> the receipts and doing like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> criminal investigation into who started </garnt>
<garnt> it and who's the culprit who's the </garnt>
<garnt> victim it's literally just you see a </garnt>
<garnt> piece of drama like the pokemon in ninja </garnt>
<garnt> one right yeah and 90 of the audience </garnt>
<garnt> just goes </garnt>
<garnt> okay so who am i rooting for yeah give </garnt>
<garnt> me give me two people to root for give </garnt>
<joey> me two people to fight for all right </joey>
<joey> it's ninja and pokeman all right uh well </joey>
<joey> i like that person better just from the </joey>
<joey> one thing i've heard about them so i'll </joey>
<connor> just root for them yeah because that's </connor>
<connor> not always the case but yeah a lot of it </connor>
<garnt> is like that though you have to admit a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of it's like that it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're not in that </garnt>
<garnt> community or don't give a [ __ ] about </garnt>
<garnt> that community yeah you know like you </garnt>
<garnt> know like if a bunch of like you know uh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> fashion youtubers right get into some </garnt>
<garnt> drama right like that's what they want </garnt>
<garnt> though yeah but that's what they write </garnt>
<garnt> right but like i'm not going to care </garnt>
<garnt> about the details all i'm going to care </garnt>
<garnt> about is okay so who are the two people </garnt>
<garnt> in question yeah and what is the general </garnt>
<garnt> consensus on these two people who are </garnt>
<garnt> fighting right like that's all it is to </garnt>
<joey> me like other than that i don't give a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] personally yeah yeah i i don't you </connor>
<connor> know even though it's good for business </connor>
<garnt> i don't think a lot of these uh twitch </garnt>
<garnt> streamers try to get into this stuff </garnt>
<garnt> some of them some of them maybe do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i know that i don't try to but i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> uh brash uh </garnt>
<garnt> with my words and also not very good at </garnt>
<garnt> coming like explaining my arguments on </garnt>
<connor> the spot as we all know from trash taste </connor>
<garnt> yeah sign up getting into these things a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of people aren't good at explaining </garnt>
<joey> their arguments on the spot which i </joey>
<joey> think is where the problem stems from </joey>
<joey> right because you know i i would like to </joey>
<connor> think that we're all like very well </connor>
<connor> spoken and you know on the ball </connor>
<garnt> when i want to be yeah you can be you </garnt>
<garnt> can be but like it's hard it's hard </garnt>
<garnt> where you have so many hours of content </garnt>
<garnt> around yourself just talking and just </garnt>
<garnt> not just trash taste but twitch </garnt>
<garnt> streamers as well and especially with </garnt>
<garnt> twitch streamers where they are </garnt>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> on camera live in an audience like eight </garnt>
<garnt> hours a day plus you know there's going </garnt>
<garnt> to be a time where someone where you are </garnt>
<garnt> not as careful with your words where you </garnt>
<garnt> slip up a bit and that's just going to </garnt>
<garnt> happen you know it's uh </garnt>
<connor> it's it's it it would happen to anyone </connor>
<garnt> in the same situation you know </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> you know you know something that uh </connor>
<connor> twitch streaming is uh made me feel a </connor>
<connor> lot more i feel like i </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<garnt> i really feel a lot </garnt>
<garnt> more strong about the viewers who like </garnt>
<garnt> uh turn up like everyday to this [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know why because like you </garnt>
<garnt> know when you're youtubing i see that </garnt>
<garnt> that [ __ ] uh who's a ninja guy who </garnt>
<garnt> comments on every video that guy without </garnt>
<garnt> mustache there's like there's like 500 </garnt>
<garnt> of these channels right you're like </garnt>
<garnt> alright the same people can't whatever </garnt>
<garnt> but like on twitch it's like all right i </garnt>
<garnt> know a bunch of the names of people who </garnt>
<garnt> like turn up every single time there's </garnt>
<garnt> this uh person called like blue sky days </garnt>
<garnt> who every single stream gives me five </garnt>
<garnt> subs and i feel like they've made it </garnt>
<garnt> into a ritual </garnt>
<connor> thank you i really appreciate it uh yeah </connor>
<connor> but like to me it's like </connor>
<connor> again going back to the hate stuff as </connor>
<garnt> well it's like all right when i </garnt>
<garnt> think about getting sad about some </garnt>
<garnt> people not liking what you do or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever i'm like okay but like how much </garnt>
<garnt> more would it hurt me if i had to </garnt>
<garnt> explain to say that person who maybe </garnt>
<garnt> turns up all the time be like hey by the </garnt>
<garnt> way uh i'm quitting uh i don't like this </garnt>
<joey> because some people said mean things </joey>
<joey> about me i feel like seeing that person </joey>
<joey> be like oh </joey>
<joey> you're gonna quit but i like watching </joey>
<joey> your stuff that would hurt me way more </joey>
<joey> than anything anyone could say oh yeah </joey>
<joey> of course of course connor's fell off </joey>
<connor> ratio you know whatever </connor>
<connor> that that you know that that nothing </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah of course of course i mean to </garnt>
<garnt> me like i i feel the same with like some </garnt>

<joey> know giving me [ __ ] for saying that jude </joey>
<connor> zukaisen was okay i'm sorry i have to i </connor>
<joey> was considering him in the podcast </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> it's just okay that is offensive to </connor>
<garnt> everything i i hold dear </garnt>
<garnt> the more you say it the more offensive </garnt>
<garnt> stop </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how this is happening </garnt>
<joey> am i supposed to rephrase it it was </joey>
<connor> average </connor>
<connor> it wasn't everything i'm not even </connor>
<joey> why do you think i don't want to start </joey>
<connor> these conversations these are the kind </connor>
<connor> of people that will say it's average and </connor>
<connor> then give love life a seven out of ten </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean it's like i can't </connor>
<connor> stand this oh i mean i i don't even want </connor>
<connor> to get into love like dude he's kidding </connor>
<connor> me [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> we're very fortunate that uh you know on </connor>
<garnt> youtube it's hard to have uh </garnt>
<garnt> not hard but it can be quite difficult </garnt>
<joey> to be friends have a good friendship </joey>
<joey> with other youtubers for a long period </joey>
<joey> of time because of the nature of the job </joey>
<joey> definitely they're just uh you know </joey>
<joey> things change people get busy people </joey>
<garnt> move people get on with their life do </garnt>
<garnt> different content fall off ratio all </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of stuff you know like the </garnt>
<garnt> work so you know very very lucky there </garnt>
<garnt> were some good friends and we've been </garnt>
<garnt> friends for very long time we all happen </garnt>
<garnt> to kind of be around the same kind of </garnt>
<connor> sphere and do the same thing same time </connor>
<connor> it all kind of worked out very lucky and </connor>
<joey> i think yeah that's like another thing </joey>
<joey> as well is that like i think </joey>
<joey> you know like if we're going back to </joey>
<garnt> like you know uh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] helpful advice for like people </garnt>
<garnt> starting off right like another one that </garnt>
<garnt> i get often as well is that like oh what </garnt>
<garnt> do i do about like collabing and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> you know because like you know i feel </garnt>
<garnt> that's like the easiest way to grow out </garnt>
<garnt> your channel from an early stage and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like yes in a sense if you do it right </garnt>
<connor> um but you know </connor>
<connor> you shouldn't be like a channel with 200 </connor>
<connor> subs and [ __ ] dming felix to like </connor>
<connor> collab with you right like that's you </connor>
<connor> know you got to know your boundaries and </connor>
<connor> stuff like that and also like another </connor>
<connor> piece of advice that i saw uh on twitter </connor>
<connor> the other day which i thought was very </connor>
<connor> true was that um you know i think a lot </connor>
<connor> of like youtubers have this like weird </connor>
<garnt> especially those starting off have this </garnt>
<garnt> like weird misunderstanding that they </garnt>
<garnt> think everyone who collabs with them is </garnt>
<connor> also a friend of theirs </connor>
<connor> and that is just unfortunately not true </connor>
<connor> a lot of people who just see it as </connor>
<connor> business who just want to do this </connor>
<garnt> one-time thing or just to do this thing </garnt>
<garnt> to benefit </garnt>
<garnt> themselves but also you know the person </garnt>
<garnt> they're collabing with yeah and it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's almost unhealthy to see </garnt>
<garnt> a person who you collab with as just </garnt>
<garnt> your mate yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there's a very big difference between a </garnt>
<garnt> collaborator and an actual friend yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i think like once you've like really </garnt>
<garnt> fully started to understand that at an </garnt>
<garnt> early stage and really gone and thought </garnt>
<garnt> to yourself okay who is actually my </garnt>
<joey> friend </joey>
<joey> like someone who will hang out with me </joey>
<joey> when the cameras are not rolling </joey>
<joey> and who is someone that is just there </joey>
<garnt> for the clout do you have a hard time </garnt>
<garnt> drawing that line like </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<joey> no no </joey>
<connor> it's like you know i </connor>
<joey> i've done this for long enough now i </joey>
<joey> know i know just like being an adult </joey>
<joey> right you just kind of god forbid i have </joey>
<joey> to be an adult uh you know you kind of </joey>
<joey> learn just uh you you know you vibe with </joey>
<joey> people sometimes you don't vibe with </joey>
<joey> people sometimes someone is really like </joey>
<joey> you really love what they make and you </joey>
<joey> really like </joey>
<joey> how they go about it </joey>
<garnt> and sometimes you hang out with them and </garnt>
<garnt> it just didn't it didn't click you know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's kind of weird the conversation </garnt>
<garnt> was a little like oh okay and other </garnt>
<garnt> times it's like holy [ __ ] like i i got </garnt>
<garnt> on so well with this person but then </garnt>
<garnt> maybe you feel that way and they don't </garnt>
<garnt> which is then this is an experience </garnt>
<garnt> thing we have to learn all right okay </garnt>
<garnt> even if i really like that person i like </garnt>
<garnt> hanging out with them i want to talk to </garnt>
<joey> them again it's like all right you got </joey>
<garnt> to be like normal about it </garnt>
<joey> let's hang out next day let's do it you </joey>
<joey> know yeah yeah yeah yeah i spaced it out </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know how we got to like </joey>
<joey> that uh i don't know how we became super </joey>
<joey> close but i i </joey>
<garnt> because i remember there was definitely </garnt>
<garnt> a time when i was like yeah these guys </garnt>
<garnt> are cool but i don't want to like burden </garnt>
<garnt> them </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to like text them too much </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember like when i met gom </garnt>
<connor> we didn't really talk in between hanging </connor>
<connor> out it was kind of like we'd hang out </connor>
<connor> and then it was like a </connor>
<joey> thing i don't really know i mean you </joey>
<garnt> sent me a [ __ ] email </garnt>
<connor> i don't know how that worked i would </connor>
<garnt> have put that right in the trash yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i'm the type of guy who really </garnt>
<connor> connects with someone hanging out yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i'm saying </garnt>
<garnt> like personally or physically you know </garnt>
<connor> like i i need to touch your face you </connor>
<garnt> should lick your sweat suck your gadgets </garnt>
<garnt> if you're a jojo </garnt>
<joey> i didn't know what you were talking </joey>
<connor> about there </connor>
<joey> was sexually harassing </joey>
<joey> you are not a friend of mine until i </joey>
<connor> suck your dick </connor>
<connor> god is harvey wyatt </connor>
<garnt> i i was i was i was going to mention i'm </garnt>
<connor> the type of guy who might not talk so </connor>
<garnt> much like online or wrong no no no no </garnt>
<connor> like joking </connor>
<connor> does not sexually harass people </connor>
<garnt> why it was just like like visual like </garnt>
<garnt> whiplash for me because i was trying to </garnt>
<garnt> make this poignant point and kind of </garnt>
<connor> just goes god sucks dick he's like sweat </connor>
<garnt> what did i say what did i say confirm </garnt>
<connor> that was a weird time at the onsen </connor>
<connor> pretty sure i was told that's how you do </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> yeah because i remember we you know we </joey>
<joey> didn't message too much but we had a fun </joey>
<joey> time hanging out whenever we did hang </joey>
<joey> out in person and uh we just ended up </joey>
<joey> hanging more times in person and i guess </joey>
<joey> it just happened naturally right but i </joey>
<joey> mean yeah going off going from what you </joey>
<joey> said about you know being friends versus </joey>
<joey> collaborators i </joey>
<joey> like even me as someone who doesn't </joey>
<joey> collab too much i mean i barely clap at </joey>
<joey> all um but even me as a content creator </joey>
<joey> i can already i you know there are some </joey>
<joey> content creators who you enjoy their </joey>
<joey> content and you really respect the work </joey>
<joey> that they do but you know there are some </joey>
<connor> people that you just think yeah i </connor>
<connor> probably wouldn't get along with you </connor>
<connor> i love the work you do but i probably </connor>
<connor> would not get along with you and on the </connor>
<joey> opposite end there are also other people </joey>
<joey> who you don't like their content but </joey>
<joey> you're like maybe i can get along with </joey>
<joey> this guy </joey>
<garnt> definitely seems seems like it seems </garnt>
<garnt> like a chill dude or something yeah </garnt>
<joey> absolutely and you know it's that whole </joey>
<garnt> thing of like separating the artist from </garnt>
<garnt> the odd right which is you know </garnt>
<garnt> way easier said than done in a lot of </garnt>
<connor> cases yeah it's just tough </connor>
<garnt> yeah i also it just feels like it's been </garnt>
<joey> so long since i've been able to like </joey>
<joey> meet a lot of new content creators who </joey>
<joey> i've watched because of the past two </joey>
<joey> years you know because we've only been </joey>
<joey> able to meet people in japan right and i </joey>
<garnt> feel like now normally like you get you </garnt>
<garnt> get a point every year where you get to </garnt>
<joey> this opportunity to fly out to america </joey>
<garnt> or fly out to somewhere to conventions </garnt>
<joey> and actually meet fellow content </joey>
<joey> creators and i just feel like i've </joey>
<joey> forgotten what i've forgotten what that </joey>
<joey> feels like now yeah i've forgotten what </joey>
<joey> it feels like just to like just to have </joey>
<joey> that like first people just just have </joey>
<garnt> like the first awkward meeting of just </garnt>
<garnt> oh hey i i watch your stuff yeah i like </garnt>
<garnt> what you do you know i mean like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like thanks </garnt>
<garnt> i miss just getting to speak english to </garnt>
<connor> people </connor>
<garnt> i just want to speak english to someone </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember the first time you met </garnt>
<garnt> someone online who you knew online but </garnt>
<garnt> you'd never like met in real life </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember what that feeling's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<garnt> cause it's always like i i know like one </garnt>
<joey> of the biggest things i first notice </joey>
<joey> it's always height always hype oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah they are never the height you </joey>
<joey> expect them to be oh yeah you know </joey>
<joey> that's that's that's true on my end as </joey>
<garnt> well because every time someone meets me </garnt>
<joey> the fir that's the first comment every </joey>
<joey> time it's either height or depending on </joey>
<garnt> if you're a content creator who shows </garnt>
<garnt> their face or not it's also like how </garnt>
<garnt> they look as well yeah i definitely got </garnt>
<garnt> that when uh when i first met john super </garnt>
<garnt> eye patchwolf because you know he's in </garnt>
<garnt> almost all his videos he never shows his </garnt>
<garnt> face yeah so for the longest time people </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know what he looked like yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then you know obviously when he first </garnt>
<garnt> blew up everyone was like all the </garnt>
<garnt> antitubers were like this guy's </garnt>
<garnt> content's [ __ ] amazing it's great i </garnt>
<garnt> would love to meet him and then when we </garnt>
<garnt> heard that he was coming to ax everyone </garnt>
<garnt> was like it was like a [ __ ] ax guest </garnt>
<garnt> he was like yo hype super high </garnt>
<garnt> vegetables coming to ax dude let's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] go and then you you know you you </garnt>
<garnt> go to the gathering yeah and there's a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of faces there that you think </garnt>
<garnt> might be super impactful right but you </garnt>
<garnt> don't know who right because you've </garnt>
<garnt> never seen his face yeah yeah and then </garnt>
<garnt> when you meet him finally </garnt>
<joey> i remember the the first thing i said to </joey>
<joey> john i was like i'm sorry if this is </joey>
<joey> weird but you're like really hot </joey>
<garnt> i mean he is he is </garnt>
<garnt> my god if i was a chick i would be head </garnt>
<garnt> over heels here's the sigma male yeah he </garnt>
<joey> really is </joey>
<joey> and luckily he took it in like a good </joey>
<garnt> way [ __ ] that [ __ ] jawline man </garnt>
<joey> dude john john please that man </joey>
<joey> like dude he could break bricks with </joey>
<garnt> that jaw yeah like it's it's crazy how </garnt>
<garnt> hot he is why aren't you more on camera </garnt>
<joey> i know you need to show your face more </joey>
<connor> john you're a good-looking dude although </connor>
<connor> he did buy a dell computer that was </connor>
<connor> gonna oh yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> that was a great that was a great yeah </garnt>
<joey> that was a good video </joey>
<garnt> imagine a dell computer yeah yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't be me but like you know </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to like looks as well but </garnt>
<garnt> also like physique and yeah as you said </garnt>
<garnt> like height you know like i get my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] height pointed at all the </garnt>
<joey> goddamn time and i'm like i never </joey>
<connor> thought that would be a weird thing yeah </connor>
<connor> did you ever meet up with people </connor>
<connor> online often like before youtube was </connor>
<joey> everything you ever used to do no not </joey>
<joey> really </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like i got into i made </garnt>
<joey> online friends because of youtube yeah </joey>
<joey> same yeah and like not not the other way </joey>
<joey> around um so it's </joey>
<joey> we're now with more especially during </joey>
<garnt> the pandemic with more people making </garnt>
<joey> friends online i'm sure a lot more </joey>
<garnt> people are going to be experiencing this </garnt>
<garnt> experience but yeah but like yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> it was like an alien experience to me </garnt>
<garnt> the first times the first time i did and </garnt>
<garnt> like it's still it's still weird you </garnt>
<garnt> never i never get used to meeting </garnt>
<garnt> someone who i know online and maybe </garnt>
<garnt> especially if they're like a content </garnt>
<garnt> creator you know and it feels so weird </garnt>
<garnt> now because i'm a content creator and </garnt>
<garnt> i've been on the other side of it and i </garnt>
<garnt> still like sometimes i just don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how to approach someone who i whoms i </garnt>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> that's it's so weird it's like it's that </joey>
<garnt> feeling of meeting that content creator </garnt>
<garnt> that you've only seen in video yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and and the first thing that pops into </garnt>
<garnt> your mind is i've only ever seen you </garnt>
<garnt> behind a screen like like that mentality </garnt>
<joey> never dies </joey>
<joey> it's so weird even though i'm also in </joey>
<joey> that same position now to that other </joey>
<garnt> person it's so weird to say with the one </garnt>
<connor> of my first thoughts is oh that's what </connor>
<connor> the back of their head looks like </connor>
<connor> i don't know why why is that because </connor>
<connor> because it's just not an angle you've </connor>
<joey> ever seen so it's just it's just weird </joey>
<connor> it's just so surreal seeing like just </connor>
<garnt> just this angle i'm just like is that </garnt>
<garnt> that person and she's like oh wait no it </garnt>
<connor> is that person oh okay </connor>
<connor> i kind of get one remember this uh i </connor>
<garnt> should remember this really painful </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] cringe thing i did right right i </joey>
<garnt> was at an ax party right yeah you know i </garnt>
<garnt> was chilling and you know it's where you </garnt>
<garnt> kind of bump into people that you </garnt>
<garnt> somewhat recognize or maybe you know </garnt>
<garnt> them you've searched them once you know </garnt>
<garnt> you go over and say hi and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> i was at this party and there was a </garnt>
<garnt> group of people like maybe like five </garnt>
<garnt> uh content creators influencers whatever </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna call yeah uh that i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> really know but there's one person who i </garnt>
<garnt> saw them and i was like oh i i know that </garnt>
<garnt> person i spoke to them in the uk so i </garnt>
<connor> went over to go say hi right and i was </connor>
<connor> like oh hi and i see you how you doing </connor>
<connor> we like we hung out in the uk uh turns </connor>
<connor> out it wasn't that person i had mistaken </connor>
<connor> them and i thought it was then and i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you know this [ __ ] even that this </connor>
<connor> i'd never like been [ __ ] i hadn't </connor>
<joey> even drank that much it was like i had </joey>
<garnt> two drinks just got that yeah yeah one </garnt>
<garnt> one or two drinks yeah and i'd even </garnt>
<garnt> though i like wasn't drunk at all i i </garnt>
<garnt> somehow sobered up even though i hadn't </garnt>
<garnt> i was still sober </garnt>
<garnt> um well yeah sorry about that um </garnt>
<connor> i was like yeah i know you and stuff you </connor>
<connor> and she's like </connor>
<connor> it's not me and i'm like oh </connor>
<connor> i'm like because i you really look like </connor>
<connor> this person i really </connor>
<connor> really thought you were this person and </connor>
<connor> i was like okay i could have i could </connor>
<connor> have maybe i could have maybe died on </connor>
<connor> this sword and get out my phone be like </connor>
<garnt> look this yeah you look really like this </garnt>
<garnt> but but no it wasn't and uh yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> a really awkward thing where i was like </garnt>
<connor> oh that's really embarrassing i'm really </connor>
<garnt> sorry about that yeah you guys have a </garnt>
<connor> good time yeah ignore me and then i </connor>
<connor> walked away really awkwardly like why </connor>
<joey> am i so cringe </joey>
<joey> i mean i'm sure uh have you have you </joey>
<joey> like met fans who have kind of been like </joey>
<connor> that as well like yeah i don't care i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm indifferent towards it but i know i </connor>
<joey> mean i guess that's how they feel right </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i guess when it's other </connor>
<connor> it was like five content creators it's </connor>
<connor> like great now they're all gonna think </connor>
<connor> i'm like this [ __ ] weirdo just </connor>
<connor> approaches people and goes are you this </connor>
<joey> person </joey>
<connor> it's me it's me look i think i have like </connor>
<connor> like i'm blind </connor>
<connor> and then when i got when i when i went </connor>
<garnt> home whatever and i i i followed them so </garnt>
<connor> was it another content creator or was it </connor>
<connor> it was another content okay </connor>
<connor> okay you happen to be in like the same </connor>
<connor> field and stuff as well and it was also </connor>
<connor> really awkward because uh you know i'm </connor>
<connor> sure they uh they they recently followed </connor>
<connor> me on twitter and i wonder if they </connor>
<connor> remember me going up to them like three </connor>
<connor> years ago yes if i ever meet them i'm </connor>
<joey> gonna ask them again if they remember my </joey>
<garnt> my favorite interaction of that that's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of similar i was on the opposite </garnt>
<garnt> end though yeah it was uh in singapore </garnt>
<garnt> afa when i went with god </garnt>
<garnt> and uh there was this one moment </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't i'll never [ __ ] figure i'm </garnt>
<garnt> sorry if you watch this show but uh some </garnt>
<garnt> like this guy i was walking with gone </garnt>
<garnt> and alan and sydney through the </garnt>
<garnt> convention hall yeah because i was on my </garnt>
<garnt> way to something and this dude just like </garnt>
<garnt> like spots me from across the hallway </garnt>
<garnt> right and he's like looking me dead in </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] eyes right so i'm like oh he </garnt>
<garnt> clearly knows me right yeah i just kind </garnt>
<garnt> of you know just waved to him or </garnt>
<joey> whatever and he came up to me and he was </joey>
<garnt> like oh my god are you gigging </garnt>
<connor> i remember that crap i was standing </connor>
<joey> right behind you and imagine me </joey>
<garnt> imagine me this kid so [ __ ] excited </garnt>
<joey> right saying calling me geek and me </joey>
<garnt> having to go </garnt>
<garnt> no but he is </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> the guy's just like yep </joey>
<garnt> i don't even know how to feel about this </garnt>
<joey> you know there was there was a split </joey>
<joey> second where i'm like this is a bit </joey>
<garnt> right but like this is a joke </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like should i be happy or a </garnt>
<garnt> friend i'm not sure but i kind of feel </garnt>
<garnt> both right now happy that obviously </garnt>
<garnt> someone you know someone recognized me </garnt>
<garnt> but someone knows me uh but i'm happy </garnt>
<garnt> that i was literally standing right here </garnt>
<garnt> and they go to joey and goes i love you </garnt>
<garnt> all joey hello </garnt>
<joey> again at first i thought it was like </joey>
<joey> kind of just like a joke right being </joey>
<garnt> like oh i'll just say it's joey hahaha </garnt>
<garnt> funny and you know i was waiting for him </garnt>
<garnt> to be like no i'm just kidding and then </garnt>
<garnt> actually turn towards god yeah but he at </garnt>
<joey> the moment i kind of pointed to god and </joey>
<joey> he looked at god and just his smile just </joey>
<garnt> dropped </garnt>
<joey> like like he was like oh god i have made </joey>
<garnt> a horrible mistake </garnt>
<garnt> i am so sorry to the both of you i mean </garnt>
<garnt> he knew he still knew me though but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i guess he just mixed me and god's user </garnt>
<garnt> names up yeah you might have just said </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he was a nice kid so whatever but </garnt>
<garnt> it was one of the funniest interactions </garnt>
<joey> i've seen </joey>
<garnt> just experience have you ever had that </garnt>
<garnt> point where you you were talking to you </garnt>
<garnt> talked to a fan or something and they </garnt>
<joey> said oh i loved when you did x video and </joey>
<joey> you think yourself i didn't do that </joey>
<joey> video i didn't do that video my favorite </joey>

<joey> sometimes </joey>
<garnt> if we're like having more than a five </garnt>
<garnt> minute conversation </garnt>
<joey> i didn't make that video but sometimes </joey>

<garnt> comment and they leave and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> i won't ruin their day yeah i won't ruin </garnt>
<connor> that day i don't want to i don't want to </connor>
<joey> think they messed up yeah i don't care i </joey>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<joey> my favorite for those that i never have </joey>
<joey> the heart to tell them is when they're i </joey>
<connor> guess they're like really trying to sell </connor>
<joey> you on the point that they've been a fan </joey>

<connor> for this kid because you know i didn't i </connor>
<connor> didn't care that he confused me but this </connor>
<connor> guy looks so embarrassed </connor>
<connor> and his face </connor>
<connor> he had never seen a face drop that fast </connor>
<connor> because we've taken the photo and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> too on his phone and i'm like you can go </connor>
<joey> ahead and delete that i won't i won't be </joey>
<joey> mad yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i signed this thing as well yeah i </joey>
<connor> signed his goblin slayer book and then </connor>
<connor> he tells me he loved my work on goblins </connor>
<connor> what was that a goblin or something </connor>
<garnt> i didn't know what i did on goblin </garnt>
<garnt> slayer </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know if i should be an offender </garnt>
<garnt> because i i remember i remember like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember having this one conversation </garnt>
<garnt> once with a fan you know sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> get into like pretty intense </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with fans about some of </garnt>
<garnt> your videos or something when you know </garnt>
<garnt> when you get when you have the time to </garnt>
<garnt> so i remember this one fan at like i </garnt>
<garnt> think it was like ax or one of the anime </garnt>
<joey> conventions and we got we got into this </joey>
<joey> conversation about bleach right </joey>
<joey> and at this point i've said my takes </joey>
<joey> about bleach a lot whether on my videos </joey>
<joey> my first video was a bleach video in </joey>
<joey> other videos and um and podcasts or </joey>
<joey> turkeys just okay huh did you say it was </joey>
<joey> just okay i mean i i uh i've i've i'm </joey>
<garnt> not gonna i'm not gonna open that box of </garnt>
<joey> worms right now but like i remember </joey>
<joey> worms </joey>
<joey> of worms i'm not gonna open that kind of </joey>
<joey> worms right now but remember we're </joey>
<joey> having this like this [ __ ] intense </joey>
<joey> conversation about bleach and he kept </joey>
<joey> saying things like i remember when you </joey>
<joey> said this about the mundo arc and uh and </joey>
<joey> like this about tte kubo like like can </joey>
<joey> you like expand that because like i i </joey>
<joey> don't agree with this and we all like </joey>
<joey> having this full debate about this right </joey>
<garnt> and i remember thinking </garnt>
<garnt> i don't remember saying this about </garnt>
<garnt> bleach but i might have said that about </garnt>
<garnt> bleach so i'm just going to entertain </garnt>
<garnt> the idea right right of this argument </garnt>
<garnt> he's like of this debate that he's </garnt>
<garnt> having about me and so we go into this </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 minute [ __ ] debate about </garnt>
<garnt> bleach right and then at the end i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like yeah i finally understand your </garnt>
<garnt> fall of bleach video now and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> that was john's video </garnt>
<garnt> and at that point i just i just i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even have the heart to tell him because </garnt>
<garnt> i was like we've been talking about a </garnt>
<garnt> video that i didn't make for 10 [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> minutes </garnt>
<joey> and having a fun debate about it </joey>
<joey> how did he not realize that your voice </joey>
<joey> and john's voice is like completely </joey>
<garnt> different i how did i not realize that </garnt>
<garnt> he was talking about a video that i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't make because the thing is i've </garnt>
<garnt> talked so much [ __ ] about bleach now i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like that sounds like something i </garnt>
<garnt> might have said i've talked a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> things about police i might have said </garnt>
<joey> that if it wasn't it wasn't you arguing </joey>
<garnt> europeans it was you agreeing with john </garnt>
<connor> i was arguing john's opinion without me </connor>
<joey> even </joey>
<joey> step aside john i got this i got your </joey>
<connor> bag bro </connor>
<connor> i hope john appreciate it </connor>
<garnt> no i've only showed that guy a lesson i </garnt>
<garnt> did i did uh john i'm fighting the good </garnt>
<garnt> fight john i'm fighting the [ __ ] good </garnt>
<joey> fight he's got his boxing gloves on for </joey>
<joey> you man like he's fighting </joey>
<connor> oh back </connor>
<connor> god it's also that thing where like i </connor>
<connor> have said so much stuff in my years of </connor>
<connor> being online yeah that i have forgotten </connor>
<connor> a good chunk of any jokes or anything </connor>
<garnt> i've made and i've had those awkward </garnt>
<garnt> moments where someone will make a uh </garnt>
<connor> we'll reference a video of mine yeah </connor>
<garnt> from like five </garnt>
<garnt> four years ago and i'll be like </garnt>
<connor> what did you say </connor>
<garnt> like i said they said the thing and i </garnt>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> why did </connor>
<connor> no the worst is when they ask you to say </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<connor> being like i love this video that you </connor>
<connor> made can you say that one line and i was </connor>
<connor> like i know i say it uh no but it's when </connor>
<garnt> you don't remember what they're talking </garnt>
<garnt> about when it's like a video from like </garnt>
<garnt> from a let's play from like six years </garnt>
<garnt> ago it's like say that one thing you </garnt>
<joey> said in corpse party episode 42 and i </joey>
<connor> was like </connor>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> remind me how it goes again that's oddly </joey>
<connor> specific why would someone ask you that </connor>
<joey> i've had that </joey>
<joey> last year i mean i've made over a </joey>
<joey> thousand videos earlier i don't remember </joey>
<garnt> every single one i made yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> gotten like it's been extrapolated even </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] more with trash taste now oh </connor>
<connor> yeah well i will get comments or </connor>
<connor> i'll get like people i'm so excited to </connor>
<connor> have people bring up my opinion that i </connor>
<garnt> totally forgot because i've had </garnt>
<garnt> conversations with people i've met here </garnt>
<garnt> um who obviously watched trash taste and </garnt>
<joey> they were like i'm like remember and </joey>
<joey> they say to me remember when you said </joey>
<joey> this and i'm just like did i say that </joey>
<joey> i mean that kind of sounds like </joey>
<joey> something i said uh i don't remember </joey>
<joey> when i said it but uh like like the </joey>
<joey> bleach video i'm just going to assume </joey>
<joey> that you're right and i did say that so </joey>

<joey> idea </joey>

<connor> precipitation in the air i should miss </connor>

<connor> so especially when you get those like </connor>
<garnt> you know it'll be like a few months or </garnt>
<garnt> even like a year later and you know </garnt>
<garnt> someone will say like they'll be like oh </garnt>
<connor> i met connor x and x you're so nice and </connor>
<garnt> i'm like </garnt>
<connor> oh that makes my day mad even though </connor>
<garnt> that might become a meme now someone </garnt>
<connor> will be like i me i met connor at his </connor>
<connor> twitch chat he was so nice he called me </connor>
<connor> an idiot </connor>
<connor> i don't know i like being a dick online </connor>
<connor> with any person i'm like oh man i just </connor>

<joey> actually someone's like oh connor was so </joey>
<joey> rude or something and i i'm like i don't </joey>
<joey> think i was i'm i really would be rude i </joey>
<joey> could scarcely be rude to myself let </joey>
<garnt> alone like someone else i'm only rude to </garnt>
<garnt> my best mates yeah yeah that's basically </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean sometimes you have to </garnt>
<joey> you know if you're if you're being </joey>
<joey> ushered to somewhere </joey>
<joey> of course you have to be like sometimes </joey>
<joey> people will shout like oh jack i'll take </joey>

<connor> right now actually i have to have to go </connor>
<joey> there you know there's only one of me </joey>
<joey> and many people who you know some of </joey>
<connor> them thankfully </connor>
<connor> i hate being like no i can't take a </connor>
<joey> picture yeah i want to yeah yeah but uh </joey>
<connor> you know handlers and staff and whatnot </connor>
<connor> and one percent problems yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> living in a good life duty calls yeah </joey>
<connor> sometimes it's so hard people wanting to </connor>
<joey> take a photo with me god oh oh hello i </joey>
<connor> can't imagine ah what do i do with all </connor>
<connor> this i'm very </connor>
<garnt> before before like you moved to japan </garnt>
<garnt> did you guys get called out by your </garnt>
<garnt> username more or by your real names did </garnt>
<garnt> anyone actually call you by like </garnt>
<connor> always </connor>
<connor> or sebastian occasionally that remember </connor>
<garnt> like yo sebastian remember that one time </garnt>
<connor> we were in little tokyo right we were in </connor>
<connor> l.a </connor>
<garnt> and we were shelling and then like we </garnt>
<garnt> were all about to like we finally were </garnt>
<garnt> done with our delicious uh i think i </garnt>
<connor> think i didn't even have </connor>
<connor> uh japanese food i remember bibimbap </connor>
<joey> which is yeah yeah it was like the like </joey>
<connor> korean barbecue place right yeah so we </connor>
<garnt> were leaving and it was good we were </garnt>
<connor> chatting and some girls screamed like </connor>
<garnt> sebastian and i was like </garnt>
<connor> and i was really just embarrassed </connor>
<connor> because you guys were [ __ ] laughing </connor>
<garnt> at me because they called me sebastian </garnt>
<garnt> because because it was it was that </garnt>
<garnt> moment of like we all turned around and </garnt>
<connor> we were like oh i wonder which the bat </connor>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> connor's just like </joey>
<connor> this is like in the period where i was </connor>
<connor> trying my goddamn hardest to get away </connor>
<joey> from this like a reminder i mean yeah i </joey>
<joey> don't care if someone did it you can </joey>
<connor> call me sebastian </connor>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] i think for me the </joey>
<joey> i think it happened early on where like </joey>
<garnt> of course people at first were calling </garnt>
<garnt> me anime man or whatever but like i </garnt>
<garnt> think i from really early on because too </garnt>
<connor> many people were getting my usernames </connor>
<joey> wrong yeah and also the fact that i </joey>
<connor> didn't like my username what were they </connor>
<connor> calling you then if it was wrong oh </connor>
<joey> there was anime guy anime dude </joey>
<connor> it's not that hard </connor>
<garnt> like every time i hang out like i was </garnt>
<joey> next to joey i swear he would get like </joey>
<joey> anime man maybe only like seventy </joey>
<garnt> percent of the time if that there's been </garnt>
<garnt> so many variations </garnt>
<joey> but there but there were people who </joey>
<joey> would like get my actual name wrong as </joey>
<joey> well like i've been called john i've </joey>
<joey> been called the one that the one that i </joey>
<joey> couldn't [ __ ] believe and i </joey>
<joey> remembered to this day was adorable taco </joey>
<joey> thon some dude legit came up to me and </joey>
<connor> said hey josh </connor>
<connor> we're like 100 confidence 100 confidence </connor>
<joey> and i was like respect to that guy i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i couldn't even like be you know i </joey>
<joey> couldn't be like it's it's joey because </joey>
<joey> i was actually just dumbfounded i'm like </joey>
<connor> you did not just [ __ ] call me that do </connor>
<connor> you not like josh do you have a vendetta </connor>
<joey> against strong oh nothing against josh </joey>
<joey> i've got mates called josh but i'm not </joey>
<joey> josh </joey>
<connor> why did the name josh specifically annoy </connor>
<joey> you more than john </joey>
<joey> i think it's because there's only ever </joey>
<joey> been that one guy who called me josh </joey>
<connor> watch it now next next day x or whatever </connor>
<joey> you're gonna be josh the anime guy i </joey>
<joey> understand you know like anime guy or </joey>
<joey> like anime dude or you know like </joey>
<joey> a different derivative of the word man </joey>
<joey> right because it's a pretty you know </joey>
<connor> it's a pretty generic name right the </connor>
<connor> anime is pretty [ __ ] easy well i i'd </connor>
<garnt> like to think so actually like i think </garnt>
<garnt> i've gotten my like people have gotten </garnt>
<joey> my name like my my my internet handle </joey>
<joey> yeah like wrong almost as much times if </joey>
<joey> they've got as they've got it right yeah </joey>
<joey> probably yeah uh because i mean i think </joey>
<joey> the biggest thing is obviously people </joey>
<joey> think my name's gig uk yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like oh i love you i love it i </joey>
<garnt> love i love uh i love your work gig uk </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like how long have you been </garnt>
<connor> watching my stuff </connor>
<connor> i think i think youtube should implement </connor>
<connor> those uh pronunciation brackets that you </connor>
<garnt> have on those like miriam dictionary </garnt>
<joey> they need like the google translate like </joey>
<garnt> say the words is my name that hard to </garnt>
<garnt> pronounce because i swear i've had so </garnt>
<garnt> many mispronounced </garnt>
<garnt> mispronunciations of my name and it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't even piss me off i just find it </garnt>
<connor> funny right yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't ever say anything i'm just like </connor>
<garnt> whatever we'll just well at least yours </garnt>
<garnt> is just a mispronunciation mine is </garnt>
<garnt> literally just not the correct word </garnt>
<garnt> like there's only so many ways you can </garnt>
<garnt> like i didn't know you could pronounce </garnt>
<joey> man as dude </joey>
<garnt> or guy i i think it's just because i've </garnt>
<garnt> just like my entire life is a </garnt>
<garnt> mispronunciation of my name like </garnt>
<garnt> that's i'm just i'm just [ __ ] used to </garnt>
<garnt> it i i think the weirdest mispronounced </garnt>
<garnt> mispronunciation of my real name </garnt>
<garnt> actually yeah uh was actually when i was </garnt>
<garnt> in university so i remember in </garnt>
<garnt> university in freshers week especially </garnt>
<garnt> you meet a lot of new people very very </garnt>
<garnt> quickly okay yeah and obviously uh as </garnt>
<garnt> you all know gant is not a common name </garnt>
<garnt> at all right and you know so i've heard </garnt>
<garnt> like every [ __ ] mispronunciations of </garnt>
<garnt> my name by then and i remember like my </garnt>
<garnt> first day of uni i heard a new one right </garnt>
<garnt> so i go up to i go to a person and i say </garnt>
<garnt> hi my name's gant thinking they say </garnt>
<garnt> grant or you know garnet or one of like </garnt>

<garnt> and i remember somehow in freshers week </garnt>
<garnt> even though i did introduce myself to a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of people within that short time </garnt>

<connor> surname correct really it's the first </connor>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> yeah it's bizinger right but like my </connor>
<connor> favorite was the [ __ ] fccj uh panel </connor>
<connor> that we did </connor>
<connor> and the guy i think the guy called me </connor>
<joey> something like and here at the end of </joey>

<garnt> live stream with fccj is when he was </garnt>
<garnt> introducing my name and like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> he like introduced you he introduced </garnt>
<garnt> connor and then he i think he got to me </garnt>
<connor> yeah i remember and this is and i could </connor>
<connor> see like i could see the [ __ ] word </connor>
<connor> processing in his mind and there was </connor>
<connor> like this brief pause before he said my </connor>
<connor> name and it was like it was like i i </connor>
<connor> remember like the chat going he's gonna </connor>
<connor> say grant </connor>
<garnt> he's gonna pronounce it he's gonna </garnt>
<garnt> mispronounce it and i remember it was </garnt>
<garnt> just like a slight pause but that felt </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] that felt like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> that felt like an entire death note </garnt>
<garnt> scene that [ __ ] pause man </garnt>
<joey> you could have edited in like the aol </joey>
<joey> loadings </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> three seconds </garnt>

<garnt> viewer so please at least call me ghand </garnt>

<garnt> favorite movie yeah i think that's a </garnt>
<connor> movie from a great movie great movie </connor>
<garnt> my favorite nicholas cage it's an honor </garnt>
<garnt> to be confused with conor on her conair </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> that sounds like the cursive connor you </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<connor> it's like if sebastian pronounces connor </connor>
<connor> maybe maybe </connor>
<joey> that's that's what you should be like if </joey>
<joey> someone at a convention stops you being </joey>
<joey> like hey sebastian they should be like </joey>

<connor> the australian spelling for it because </connor>
<joey> there was also a place uh </joey>
<connor> near me that was called connor something </connor>
<joey> right um </joey>
<joey> but we spelt that one that is like a </joey>
<connor> very phonetic con isn't it </connor>

<joey> that kid zeus </joey>
<joey> zeus was his first name [ __ ] yeah dude </joey>

<joey> oh yeah it's great </joey>
<joey> you'll meet like australia is that one </joey>
<joey> place where you're like i can't believe </joey>
<joey> people like this exist yeah like on </joey>
<garnt> ironically i've always wondered what are </garnt>
<garnt> australian conventions like </garnt>
<joey> uh okay so i've only i mean there isn't </joey>
<joey> really a lot uh i've been to </joey>
<garnt> i've been to two different ones uh there </garnt>
<garnt> is supernova which is more like a comic </garnt>
<joey> con yeah and then there is smash which </joey>
<connor> is the big anime con in sydney right um </connor>
<connor> the smash stand for anything yeah the </connor>
<joey> sydney mongrel anime show </joey>
<connor> good night yeah yeah so the first time i </connor>
<garnt> went was in like 2013 </garnt>
<garnt> 14 something like that and there was </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like </garnt>
<garnt> 3 000 people 4 000 people it was a tiny </garnt>
<connor> convention um but the year that i went </connor>
<connor> uh before the pandemic where i was a </connor>
<connor> guest at there was like almost like 30 </connor>
<garnt> 40 000 people so it's like clearly grown </garnt>
<garnt> yeah massively </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of but like i i honestly think </garnt>
<garnt> like in terms of like the actual like </garnt>
<garnt> vibe of the con and stuff like that i </garnt>
<garnt> don't really see it as that much </garnt>
<garnt> different to like a us con or any other </garnt>
<garnt> like english speaking convention because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like everyone can't experience yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's just yeah yeah i mean not actual </garnt>
<connor> cut switches yeah not actually we're not </connor>
<connor> actually like so we're not throwing </connor>
<garnt> clothes on well australian [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean like even then though </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh i don't know it i i mean </garnt>
<garnt> obviously i i felt a little more at home </garnt>
<garnt> because you know i was talking to people </garnt>
<garnt> with the same accent yeah but um and you </garnt>
<garnt> know because like that was like my first </garnt>
<garnt> con ever i was like my home turf but um </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in terms like a con experience i </garnt>
<garnt> guess like yeah i didn't really see it </garnt>
<garnt> as that much more different to like a </garnt>
<garnt> standard like american con i guess like </garnt>
<garnt> the people i feel just like weebs in </garnt>
<garnt> general or like anime fans in general </garnt>
<garnt> like no matter where you are kind of </garnt>
<garnt> they kind of all give off like the same </garnt>
<garnt> vibe of like you know a lot of them are </garnt>
<garnt> just kind of like chill and down to </garnt>
<garnt> earth and just want to like chat with </garnt>
<garnt> you yeah i guess you know because like </garnt>
<connor> in </connor>
<connor> australia like a lot like america is </connor>
<connor> like you know a lot of stranger </connor>
<garnt> friendliness is still pretty prevalent </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah so it's like you know people </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really have at least not a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people didn't really have problems you </garnt>
<garnt> know coming up to me and talking to me </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that just as like hey you </garnt>
<garnt> know joke or something like you know </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean you i mean you guys will </garnt>
<garnt> definitely [ __ ] have a great time if </garnt>
<garnt> we ever end up going to smash right now </garnt>
<garnt> or an australian convention it's just </garnt>
<garnt> you know every now and then you will </garnt>
<garnt> meet those like very stereotypical loud </garnt>
<garnt> aussies who you know are just like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah you know like that's that </joey>
<garnt> level right but that's good that sounds </garnt>
<joey> that sounds like a laugh yeah i feel </joey>
<joey> though those kinds of people you </joey>
<garnt> wouldn't really find in a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> anime cons you'll you'll see them at the </garnt>
<garnt> pub right but you know i very rarely </garnt>
<connor> have i seen an anime fan dude it's my </connor>
<joey> convention do you love going to the pub </joey>
<joey> after that it's close yeah you just yeah </joey>
<joey> like kirito </joey>
<connor> downing like a stella you're like what's </connor>
<connor> going on i don't remember this part </connor>
<garnt> it's like you know chicken like an </garnt>
<garnt> arsenal cosplay is like doing a shoei </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like that people who like to </garnt>
<garnt> drink </garnt>
<joey> i didn't unfortunately see that but i </joey>
<garnt> wish i did do a lot of people get drunk </garnt>
<connor> at aussie conventions because that's a </connor>
<joey> big thing about british conventions way </joey>
<connor> more than like so much it is like it is </connor>
<connor> like all they do it's it's more than the </connor>
<joey> actual convention itself it's just </joey>
<joey> people are just like oh there's anime </joey>
<garnt> here cool let's get a [ __ ] pint i </garnt>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> it's hard to say at least in sydney i </joey>
<joey> don't think it's would be as much as in </joey>
<garnt> the uk just because </garnt>
<garnt> like drinking or eating out in sydney is </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] expensive like you know </garnt>
<garnt> like a pint of beer is like you know </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ten dollars australian and like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like places in sydney right </garnt>
<garnt> like in the city um ten aussie dollars </garnt>
<garnt> or yeah like ten real dollars ten </garnt>
<connor> dollars ten dollars for real currency </connor>
<connor> yeah ten dollars </connor>
<garnt> so you know and i think to like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> kids who come to these conventions you </garnt>
<garnt> know like ten dollars is a lot of money </garnt>
<garnt> right like that's cool that's ten </garnt>
<connor> dollars you can spend on anime emoji at </connor>
<connor> the corner yeah of course um so i didn't </connor>
<connor> see as many drunk people as i thought </connor>
<connor> there was gonna be yeah but a lot of the </connor>
<connor> parents were getting drunk that's for </connor>
<joey> sure </joey>
<connor> you know they were like hey they've had </connor>
<joey> a hard day yeah </joey>
<joey> like an hour to get into the city and </joey>
<joey> being like all right kids have fun at </joey>
<garnt> your japanese convention </garnt>
<garnt> daddy and i are gonna go over to the pub </garnt>
<garnt> and get shit-faced while we wait for you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like i'm taking care of the kids </garnt>
<connor> yeah like in between like signings and </connor>
<garnt> stuff you know i'd take a step outside </garnt>
<garnt> and you know you look over at the like </garnt>
<garnt> the terrace of some of these like pubs </garnt>
<garnt> like on the water and you know there's </garnt>
<joey> just a lot of parents clearly just like </joey>
<joey> waiting for their kids just being like </joey>
<connor> another people </connor>
<connor> yeah all right </connor>
<garnt> honestly i'd probably do the same uh </garnt>
<garnt> when i have kids you know yeah like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i i'm like an only child so i </garnt>
<garnt> never had this experience but i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like sydney talking about it all the </garnt>
<garnt> time where you know </garnt>
<garnt> your parents would just take you to </garnt>
<garnt> events and then you would just give all </garnt>
<garnt> the responsibility to the older sibling </garnt>
<joey> to take care of the [ __ ] taking out </joey>
<joey> the younger siblings and just like </joey>
<joey> here's a bunch of money [ __ ] off have </joey>
<joey> fun you know yeah i definitely have that </joey>
<garnt> that's the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> maybe i can't remember really maybe i </connor>
<garnt> was a little [ __ ] so yeah </garnt>
<joey> i i think i've very rarely had </joey>
<garnt> experiences like that because i think </garnt>
<garnt> like me and my sister didn't really like </garnt>
<garnt> share a lot of like the same like </garnt>
<garnt> interests when it like when we were </garnt>
<garnt> growing up i feel like as adults now </garnt>
<garnt> we're like starting to like share more </garnt>
<connor> of like the same likes on things but </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't really like remember going </garnt>
<joey> to like a lot of events with my sister </joey>
<joey> like we maybe went to like a few </joey>
<garnt> concerts but did your parents ever take </garnt>
<garnt> you to an event that you just didn't </garnt>
<connor> want to [ __ ] go to but you had to go </connor>
<connor> to because your parents were going oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> football matches my dad used to drag me </garnt>
<garnt> in football matches he's going to love </garnt>
<garnt> this bit now he's like i didn't drag you </garnt>
<garnt> you wanted to go no he would bribe me </garnt>
<garnt> with chocolate he would he would be like </garnt>
<garnt> i'll get i'll buy you a like a galaxy </garnt>
<garnt> bar which is like this is chocolate in </garnt>
<connor> the uk not like the small bars yeah like </connor>
<connor> the the this sized block one you know </connor>
<connor> we got some serious chocolate mileage </connor>
<connor> here he's like i'll buy it for you and </connor>
<connor> then i had to then this is the worst </connor>
<connor> part </connor>
<garnt> my dad will laugh at this is that when i </garnt>
<garnt> was like eight </garnt>
<garnt> he would take me to like the pub before </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right right where where it was </garnt>
<garnt> literally like it's like a football club </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah it's cheap it's dirty </garnt>
<garnt> it's absolutely rammed it stinks it's </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone is eating like pork </garnt>
<garnt> scratchings and downing like really </garnt>
<garnt> cheap pints i actually remember just </garnt>
<garnt> sitting there just like not </garnt>
<garnt> understanding anything </garnt>
<garnt> although that they would just ask me </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes stuff about football and i'd </garnt>
<garnt> be like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> wayne rooney yeah </garnt>
<garnt> she remember i never understood anything </garnt>
<garnt> right and uh one time i went to a match </garnt>
<garnt> and everton uh my my my dad's obsessed </garnt>
<garnt> with like everton family and stuff and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember they'd won because i was there </garnt>
<garnt> and my dad was like convinced that i was </garnt>
<garnt> the good luck charm yeah that's why we </garnt>
<garnt> won so i got dragged to more even though </garnt>
<joey> i i told them i hate it i do not want to </joey>
<joey> go i i absolutely despise this because i </joey>
<joey> would just stand there i mean it was </joey>
<joey> cold and it was so loud and i just </joey>
<joey> wanted to play my game boy yeah and i </joey>
<joey> had to watch these people kick and i was </joey>
<connor> like why is it 90 minutes long </connor>

<garnt> sell those like stupidly long hot dogs </garnt>
<garnt> at these football events yeah i remember </garnt>
<garnt> one time i i had one and uh my dad let </garnt>
<garnt> me like just hold on to it for like two </garnt>
<garnt> seconds and someone bumped into me and i </garnt>
<garnt> dropped it all right and then i just i </garnt>

<garnt> articulate all i remember was i was just </garnt>
<garnt> really sad that i dropped this hot dog </garnt>
<garnt> right right and you couldn't buy a new </garnt>
<garnt> one because it worked so my dad had just </garnt>
<garnt> given me like enough money to buy it and </garnt>
<garnt> it was like i couldn't you know i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know he'd like let me have it and i was </garnt>

<garnt> and i never really liked football yeah </garnt>
<joey> my brothers did though they liked going </joey>
<joey> uh and my older brother liked it a lot </joey>
<joey> but i just never liked it and i felt </joey>
<joey> like i was a failure to my dad because </joey>
<connor> he was like i just want you to like </connor>
<garnt> sports why can't you like sports why </garnt>
<garnt> can't you be a normal person and like </garnt>
<connor> sports i'm like the only kid in the uk </connor>
<connor> that didn't like football i was like why </connor>
<joey> why </joey>
<joey> i remember like because my my parents </joey>
<connor> were like really into like looking at </connor>
<connor> property right </connor>
<connor> and for the longest time i was like oh </connor>
<garnt> we're gonna are we gonna move house like </garnt>
<garnt> you know i would get excited i'm like no </garnt>
<garnt> no it's like no we're just looking what </garnt>
<garnt> and i was like </garnt>
<connor> we're literally window shopping houses </connor>
<connor> and they're like yeah and i was like two </connor>
<connor> or two like a 10 year old i was like </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> this [ __ ] is like the most privileged </connor>
<connor> non-privileged thing i've ever heard </connor>
<joey> well because it's like you know because </joey>
<connor> my dad is like you know heavily into </connor>
<connor> like stocks and like investing </connor>
<connor> he's an investor i'm watching i'm </connor>
<connor> watching a home in the sun because it's </connor>
<joey> an investment yeah he was an investor </joey>
<joey> right and also like my parents used to </joey>
<garnt> go a lot as well so that they could get </garnt>
<garnt> inspirations for like interior design </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like that because you know my </connor>
<connor> dad loved doing like renovations into </connor>
<connor> the house and stuff so he would get a </connor>
<connor> lot of like good ideas from that right </connor>
<connor> it makes more sense um yeah but like you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> to a 10 year old i don't know what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like all that [ __ ] is right like </connor>
<connor> you would think if your parents came up </connor>
<connor> to you and said son we're gonna go check </connor>
<garnt> out some houses today the first thing </garnt>
<garnt> you would think of as a ten-year-old is </garnt>
<garnt> yay we're moving right </garnt>
<garnt> and my sister who's like three years </garnt>
<garnt> younger than me was like oh we're moving </garnt>
<garnt> house that's so exciting yay so </garnt>
<garnt> naturally for the first couple of times </garnt>
<garnt> we'd go along with them right yeah until </garnt>
<garnt> we realized </garnt>
<joey> we're not moving </joey>
<garnt> we're just looking at we're him looking </garnt>
<connor> at them i have a question actually this </connor>
<joey> just came out you can't answer it rip </joey>
<connor> unfortunately it's about brothers </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> how did </connor>
<connor> because you know obviously let's say </connor>
<connor> there's two two siblings or three </connor>
<connor> siblings in my house how was it decided </connor>
<connor> who gets which bedroom </connor>
<connor> ah </connor>
<connor> in your house that's a good question </connor>
<garnt> well did you ever ask battle royale </garnt>
<joey> squid game because i squid game i am the </joey>
<garnt> middle son </garnt>
<joey> and i got the tiniest room oh okay right </joey>
<garnt> well i think for us we got lucky because </garnt>
<garnt> the house that i grew up in or i was </garnt>
<connor> born in was like bought just </connor>
<connor> at the same time as they got that house </connor>
<connor> so i basically got first dibs right </connor>
<connor> because my sister wasn't born yet oh so </connor>
<connor> you got to choose i wasn't well i mean </connor>
<connor> no i wasn't like a three-year-old being </connor>
<joey> like father this room is a little larger </joey>
<connor> than the other one well you know what's </connor>
<connor> funny that's exactly what my parents </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] did really they asked me when i </connor>
<connor> was like two or whatever which room i </connor>
<connor> wanted when you were two i don't know </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> to at an age where i can i cannot </connor>
<joey> comprehend what i am doing </joey>
<joey> it's a big space either way right for a </joey>
<joey> kid yeah like this is fine this is great </joey>
<connor> i think i literally chose like the harry </connor>
<connor> potter club </connor>
<connor> and i'm like i'm like mum yeah don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] believe what what two or </connor>
<connor> three-year-old connor cho why would you </connor>
<garnt> do that his mom comes out with the </garnt>
<connor> contract is this this you that's your </connor>
<garnt> name </garnt>
<connor> did you sign my blog </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this i would never </connor>
<joey> choose it you know i would have never i </joey>
<garnt> got the room which was right next to my </garnt>
<garnt> parents room because obviously i was the </garnt>
<garnt> firstborn child right yeah and then my </garnt>
<garnt> sister got the last room which just so </garnt>
<garnt> happened to be next to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> right right so i remember she would </garnt>
<garnt> complain being like you know because i </garnt>
<garnt> think our rooms were pretty much the </garnt>
<garnt> same size like it might have been minor </garnt>
<garnt> differences but it didn't really matter </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was roughly the same size but </garnt>
<garnt> i remember my sister used to complain </garnt>
<garnt> being like you know well at least you're </garnt>
<joey> not [ __ ] in a room where like every </joey>
<joey> time someone has to take a [ __ ] in the </joey>
<joey> middle of the night you get woken up by </joey>
<joey> it and i was like uh </joey>
<joey> yeah okay well that sounds like you but </joey>
<connor> also you're closest to the toilet so </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly that's what i said </joey>
<connor> if you have brothers and sisters or </connor>
<joey> whatever whatever how was it decided </joey>
<connor> which room was given to you can't relate </connor>
<connor> or were you all just shoved into one </connor>
<joey> room can't relate </joey>
<joey> well actually yeah when my when we were </joey>
<garnt> like really really little my sister and </garnt>
<garnt> i like you know obviously just slept in </garnt>
<garnt> the same room in the same bed right and </garnt>
<garnt> then yeah it's probably maybe when i was </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know six or seven that i </garnt>
<connor> finally got to pick one of the rooms but </connor>
<connor> like i don't remember there being like a </connor>
<connor> ritualistic [ __ ] squid game of like </connor>
<connor> well wasn't it fight to the death </connor>
<garnt> do you remember choosing the room no of </garnt>
<connor> course not i don't know i asked my </connor>
<garnt> parents later on last night i chose it </garnt>
<connor> i'm like why would you listen to me why </connor>
<connor> i don't i am not in the right mind </connor>
<garnt> make good decisions yeah i mean it was </garnt>
<garnt> probably massive to you when you chose </garnt>
<connor> it you know yeah yeah it was tiny yeah </connor>
<garnt> you could like there was no place to put </garnt>
<connor> more than like a single bed not that i </connor>
<joey> would ever need more than a year yeah </joey>
<connor> even if i wanted bigger there's actually </connor>
<connor> no space to put it anywhere yeah and so </connor>
<joey> it was just like but of course you </joey>
<garnt> talking about that right like you </garnt>
<garnt> obviously remember it different to your </garnt>
<garnt> parents right so i guarantee your </garnt>
<garnt> parents are gonna remember it and recall </garnt>
<garnt> it differently being like oh i </garnt>
<garnt> specifically remember connor [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> volunteering as tribute you know </garnt>
<garnt> they're like yes i will take the </garnt>
<garnt> smallest room for the family </garnt>
<garnt> going back to like weird events your </garnt>
<garnt> parents are taking you to so i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like i think the weirdest thing well not </garnt>
<garnt> the weirdest but the thing that sticks </garnt>
<joey> out to my mind right now is my parents </joey>
<garnt> or my mom once me once took me to a </garnt>
<garnt> meditation meet-up okay i think it was a </garnt>
<joey> meditation meet-up okay so i think what </joey>
<garnt> happened is so my mom's like buddhist so </garnt>
<joey> you know as a buddhist this was before </joey>
<joey> like i became like a monk or a kid monk </joey>
<joey> or anything like that um </joey>
<joey> so you know </joey>
<joey> sometimes you uh you pray or you </joey>
<joey> meditate for good karma and all that </joey>
<connor> stuff so sometimes my mom would go to </connor>
<connor> like these buddhist meetups or these </connor>
<connor> meditation meets up uh what you do at </connor>
<connor> this meetup is you go there and you </connor>
<connor> meditate for about an hour in like </connor>
<garnt> darkness right okay um with a bunch of </garnt>
<connor> other people or a bunch of other people </connor>
<connor> right so like i was about seven years </connor>
<connor> old when this happened right so i think </connor>
<garnt> like at that at that time like there was </garnt>
<garnt> no one to take care of me at home or </garnt>
<garnt> something i don't know why but my mom </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> god you're coming with me uh we're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> meditate and shift i remember her </garnt>
<garnt> framing it in a way where we're just </garnt>
<garnt> gonna meditate for a little bit like </garnt>
<garnt> like like like five minutes something </garnt>
<connor> that's what it was in my head right i </connor>
<garnt> didn't know how long i would be sitting </garnt>
<garnt> still for yeah at this meet-up i thought </garnt>
<garnt> because i she told me how to meditate </garnt>
<garnt> and we do it for like 10 to like 15 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes at most right that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> thought i was getting into so we get </garnt>
<garnt> there i remember like the guy the head </garnt>
<garnt> guy was just like hey thank you all for </garnt>
<garnt> coming um so we're going to be uh </garnt>
<garnt> sitting here i'm going to hit the gong </garnt>
<garnt> and uh we're going to turn off the </garnt>
<garnt> lights and we're going to just sit here </garnt>
<garnt> for an hour and after the hours on i'm </garnt>
<connor> going to hit the gong again android game </connor>
<connor> everything lights up </connor>
<connor> and so i remember thinking </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i've got to sit here in silence for an </connor>
<joey> hour </joey>
<joey> what i was seven years old i could i </joey>
<joey> couldn't like sit still for five minutes </joey>
<joey> let alone let alone the [ __ ] hour </joey>
<joey> it's like solving the god </joey>
<joey> so i remember so i remember like sitting </joey>
<joey> down i'm like i'm like [ __ ] panicking </joey>
<garnt> trying to figure out how the [ __ ] i am </garnt>
<garnt> going to sit here for an hour i look </garnt>
<garnt> over to my mom my mom's just like </garnt>
<garnt> already like [ __ ] in the zone yeah </garnt>
<garnt> she's she's already she's long gone </garnt>
<garnt> she's done it she's long gone she's in </garnt>
<garnt> another [ __ ] dimension right now </garnt>
<garnt> and so and so he hits and so hits the </garnt>
<garnt> gong luckily they have a clock in the </garnt>
<garnt> room so you can see how much time goes </garnt>
<garnt> past now what you're meant to do during </garnt>
<garnt> meditation is like you are meant to just </garnt>
<garnt> clear your mind right the point of an </garnt>
<garnt> hour is that it shouldn't feel like an </garnt>
<garnt> hour because to your mind it should be </garnt>
<garnt> as empty as possible so you shouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> really feel the passage of time or you </garnt>
<garnt> should feel it less than usual right </garnt>
<connor> that's that's that's the entire like </connor>
<connor> zone you're supposed to get in with </connor>
<connor> meditation um so i remember all right i </connor>
<connor> remember thinking all right you got this </connor>
<connor> you've meditated for 15 minutes you can </connor>
<connor> do an hour um and i remember sitting </connor>
<connor> there and to me i'm like i think about </connor>
<connor> 40 minutes has passed let me sneak over </connor>
<connor> at the clock i look over five minutes </connor>
<connor> has gone by i'm just like oh [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> start [ __ ] sweating i look i look </connor>
<connor> around are you seeing the clock in the </connor>
<connor> dark huh it was like one of the glow in </connor>
<connor> the dark oh yeah with like uh with like </connor>
<connor> a luminescence that makes it even harder </connor>
<connor> not to look as a kid yeah </connor>
<joey> so i'm just like so i come up with this </joey>
<joey> five-head </joey>
<joey> five-head strategy right because i'm at </joey>
<garnt> that point i was [ __ ] obsessed with </garnt>
<garnt> pokemon right so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah who wasn't so like i i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> back in the day i had like recorded like </garnt>
<garnt> an entire season of pokemon and that was </garnt>
<garnt> like my entire my only entertainment so </garnt>
<garnt> i had like watched this vhs this </garnt>
<joey> recording of pokemon like [ __ ] 10 20 </joey>
<garnt> times right </garnt>
<joey> 10 20 times so i think to myself how am </joey>
<joey> i going to get through an hour i got a </joey>
<garnt> five hit idea what if i just watch </garnt>
<garnt> three episodes of pokemon in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> and just and if i watch three episodes </garnt>
<garnt> of pokemon in my mind an hour would have </garnt>
<garnt> passed right so it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember so i remember this [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> serial experiments </joey>
<joey> so i like i like escape into the castle </joey>
<garnt> in my mind and i just started watching </garnt>
<garnt> i just started playing playing the </garnt>
<garnt> episodes of pokemon that i can remember </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately i think some gaps were </garnt>
<garnt> missed off because i i remember like </garnt>
<garnt> watching in my mind yeah three episodes </garnt>
<garnt> looking at the clock and then and half </garnt>
<garnt> an hour had gone by so i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay maybe time moves differently in my </garnt>
<garnt> mind </garnt>
<garnt> so i think i think i watched an entire </garnt>
<garnt> season of pokemon in my mind </garnt>
<joey> your mind was just like all right </joey>
<joey> cutting out all the filler right now </joey>
<garnt> only the important influence i think i </garnt>
<garnt> got through an entire [ __ ] season and </garnt>
<garnt> then i finally hear the gong and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm like thank [ __ ] and i remember </garnt>
<joey> afterwards like </joey>
<joey> some of my mom's friends comes over to </joey>
<joey> her and be like well i'm like so </joey>
<joey> impressed with your son like how do you </joey>
<joey> sit there for an hour like my son can't </joey>
<joey> concentrate anything for five minutes </joey>
<joey> i'm like i'm so impressed with your son </joey>
<garnt> and and i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> they don't know i just got they don't </joey>
<garnt> know i just watched pokemon for an hour </garnt>
<joey> while you are drenching and sweating </joey>
<garnt> they're like how does that just what </garnt>
<garnt> does that say again </garnt>
<garnt> oh ash was about to get to the indigo </garnt>
<garnt> league you and you stopped at the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] good point man </connor>
<connor> where the [ __ ] did you do that that's </connor>
<connor> insane this man literally opened up his </connor>
<joey> third eye by reciting pokemon in his </joey>
<connor> head </connor>
<connor> anime companies hate this one trick </connor>
<connor> to letting you re-watch the anime </connor>
<joey> you want to recite pokemon that's the </joey>
<joey> real secret to like reaching </joey>
<joey> enlightenment you don't empty your mind </joey>
<garnt> you just watch an entire season you just </garnt>
<garnt> watch one piece in your mind and you </garnt>
<garnt> just reach enlightenment could you do </garnt>
<connor> that now i could not do that now </connor>
<connor> i could watch a show and then couldn't </connor>
<connor> do that immediately after that well </connor>
<garnt> because that was back in the day when </garnt>
<connor> you were a kid and you had like that one </connor>
<connor> thing that you watched over and over oh </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you could just like </joey>
<garnt> recite it like i remember i could </garnt>
<garnt> probably like recite the entire movie of </garnt>
<joey> toy story or something in my mind </joey>
<garnt> because like i've watched it so many </garnt>
<joey> times </joey>
<joey> i have some movies like that too i could </joey>
<garnt> probably recite the entirety of pulp </garnt>
<garnt> fiction that's because i've seen it so </garnt>
<garnt> many [ __ ] times but right now </garnt>
<garnt> three and a half hour movie let's go if </garnt>
<joey> you need to meditate for that long </joey>
<garnt> when i need to meditate i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> i was like say what again say what again </joey>
<garnt> i dare you i'm double d [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> you know what they call quarter pound </joey>
<joey> with cheese in france </joey>
<garnt> did you never have that on the kids as a </garnt>
<garnt> kid just like some a game or something </garnt>
<garnt> that you played so many times that you </garnt>
<garnt> could just like recite it from memory </garnt>
<garnt> no no never not recite here i've </garnt>
<connor> probably played stuff a bunch but never </connor>
<connor> saying i could recite </connor>
<joey> from memory but are you the kind of </joey>
<joey> person who remembers song lyrics easily </joey>
<connor> no not at all i i actually cannot </connor>
<joey> remember song lyrics without looking at </joey>
<connor> the sheet right and even then it's like </connor>
<joey> it'll last like a day yeah because it's </joey>
<joey> really interesting there's like there's </joey>
<joey> two types of people where there's like </joey>
<joey> there's ones who are like you can listen </joey>
<garnt> to a song once and you just like </garnt>
<garnt> miraculously just remember how the </garnt>
<garnt> lyrics go and then there are people who </garnt>
<garnt> are just like i could listen to this </garnt>
<garnt> song 50 times </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like i'll recognize the lyrics </garnt>
<joey> if someone tells me </joey>
<garnt> but i can't recite it okay so i had just </garnt>
<garnt> like i had this like realization the </garnt>
<garnt> other day um because you know i've </garnt>
<garnt> obviously i've obviously given connor a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of [ __ ] for like hearing the beeps </garnt>
<garnt> and the boobs yeah um and then i just </garnt>
<garnt> had this realization that </garnt>
<garnt> i think i listen to this i think i </garnt>
<garnt> listen to music like beeps and boobs as </garnt>
<garnt> well right because </garnt>
<garnt> okay like lyrics mean nothing to me like </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's so it's so weird yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's so weird right where i i listen to </garnt>
<garnt> a song and </garnt>
<garnt> if lyrics aren't there right i i feel </garnt>
<connor> like something's missing because i do </connor>
<connor> think lyrics need is a part of the song </connor>
<connor> but to me lyrics are almost like another </connor>
<connor> instrument instrument to me it's it's so </connor>
<garnt> weird it's so weird where where like i </garnt>
<connor> don't listen to what they're saying and </connor>
<connor> even like even if </connor>
<garnt> you can take a song that i love and you </garnt>
<garnt> lay the lyrics out in front of me and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like i've never heard this song </garnt>
<garnt> in my life like what is what is this </garnt>
<joey> song well i would argue that the best </joey>
<joey> artists and the best singers and the </joey>
<joey> best bands i guess can yeah as you said </joey>
<joey> use their voice as an instrument </joey>
<joey> but then if you want to read into the </joey>
<joey> lyrics the lyrics are also profound </joey>
<joey> where unfortunately </joey>
<joey> very few artists can do that right where </joey>
<joey> it's either like you either concentrate </joey>
<joey> fully on the lyrics to be like here's a </joey>
<connor> deep poetic meaning behind understanding </connor>
<connor> this are you saying the voice is a part </connor>
<connor> of the song is that what you're saying </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah well yeah no [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's like another but but you know there </connor>
<connor> are a lot of artists who don't see it </connor>
<connor> that way and they just like it's like </connor>
<connor> it also depends on how the songs mix but </connor>
<joey> like some artists you hear and it's just </joey>
<joey> like oh </joey>
<joey> i wish i could hear the instruments </joey>
<joey> because it's just being drowned out by </joey>
<garnt> the singing </garnt>
<garnt> but like have you ever like </garnt>
<garnt> properly listened to the lyrics of a </garnt>
<garnt> song and it's like change the way you </garnt>
<garnt> think about a song because you probably </garnt>
<connor> actually read into it </connor>
<connor> like the the new weekend album is really </connor>
<garnt> good but like if you just actually </garnt>
<garnt> listen to what you're saying it's </garnt>
<garnt> depressing as [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> that rarely ever you're like vibing </garnt>
<connor> you're like dude this song is so good </connor>
<garnt> and he's like i'm [ __ ] depressed and </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] is going wrong and it's like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] this is so good </garnt>
<joey> wait what do you say </joey>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i can't i can't even get to that </garnt>
<garnt> moment because it like it it's really </garnt>
<connor> weird but like sometimes if there's like </connor>
<connor> a disconnect between how the song makes </connor>
<connor> me feel versus what the lyrics are </connor>
<connor> saying i always like go i always go </connor>
<garnt> towards what the song makes me feel yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah and and it's it's so it's so weird </joey>
<connor> because i don't know how much of this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] well actually </connor>
<connor> yeah it's that that's it i hear the </connor>
<connor> beeps in the boobs the beeps and the </connor>
<connor> boobs make me feel something and that's </connor>
<garnt> what i feel towards the song that i </garnt>
<garnt> hardly ever listen to lyrics at all </garnt>
<garnt> because it never changes how i feel </garnt>
<garnt> towards the song it's it's so weird </garnt>
<joey> you guys are literally that type of </joey>
<joey> people who would make a [ __ ] art </joey>
<joey> buzzfeed article being like top 10 songs </joey>
<joey> that have a dark meaning </joey>
<connor> engineering </connor>
<connor> i don't know you you i hear the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> the music it comes in and it just comes </connor>
<garnt> in like a </garnt>
<garnt> like a like a like a i don't know like a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] graph in my head it comes out </joey>
<garnt> the thing is i get that i totally get </garnt>
<garnt> that but i feel it like i i do have </garnt>
<garnt> emotions towards it yeah of course but i </garnt>
<garnt> don't give a [ __ ] what he's talking </garnt>
<joey> about right i'm like i'm just in taking </joey>
<connor> the noise and the noisy that makes me </connor>
<joey> feel something or it doesn't yeah which </joey>
<joey> is why i think for a lot of songs where </joey>
<garnt> there is like a stark contrast between </garnt>
<garnt> how the song makes you feel versus how </garnt>
<garnt> the lyrics make you feel yeah is what is </garnt>
<connor> like a bigger whiplash for people like </connor>
<joey> you guys right where it's like oh what </joey>
<connor> the hell live i don't know how i want to </connor>
<connor> preface live it is different there </connor>
<garnt> definitely is a lot more to it whenever </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> recorded album yeah i feel like that's </garnt>
<joey> why i find it so easy to you know listen </joey>
<joey> to a lot of japanese music or a lot of </joey>
<joey> like music in a language that i don't </joey>
<joey> understand yeah because it's they're </joey>
<joey> probably you know i i have no idea what </joey>
<joey> the lyrics they are spitting most of the </joey>
<joey> time but you know this part of me is </joey>
<garnt> like i feel i feel the emotion </garnt>
<joey> yeah i i feel the emotion that they're </joey>
<garnt> singing right now oh yeah i kind of get </garnt>
<joey> it even though i probably don't get it i </joey>
<joey> feel like i get it you know i can't tell </joey>
<joey> you like like i'd say 90 of anime </joey>
<joey> openings the lyrics are depressing as </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but but like just weaves that are </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like man </garnt>
<garnt> which is you know fine it's it's cool </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i find really interesting </garnt>
<garnt> though about people who can do that </garnt>
<garnt> right and it's like you know it's the </garnt>
<garnt> reason why i feel that in and of itself </garnt>
<garnt> like that discovery of like when people </garnt>
<joey> find out this really like bright and </joey>
<joey> like colorful and like very positive </joey>
<joey> sounding song actually has a really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dark meaning and then you know </joey>
<joey> and it's that realization of like oh </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i just got played </joey>
<joey> because i wasn't listening to the lyrics </joey>
<garnt> right like that's why i'm like because </garnt>
<garnt> we've we like had this idea to do a </garnt>
<garnt> music three by three for like ages and </garnt>
<garnt> i've like loki actually been [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> myself </garnt>
<garnt> why because like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the things one of the mediums i </garnt>
<garnt> find hardest to [ __ ] explain </garnt>
<garnt> is music because i literally are just </garnt>
<garnt> like um i mean this song this sounds </garnt>
<garnt> good this this song made me feel things </garnt>
<garnt> um and i just really like it um and and </garnt>
<garnt> people are like oh did you know the </garnt>
<garnt> meaning of that song i'm like i have no </garnt>
<joey> idea the meaning of that song yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> but it made me feel things yeah things </garnt>
<garnt> welcome to the beeps and the boobs </garnt>
<connor> ladies </connor>
<joey> i thought you were on my team </joey>
<connor> i feel betrayed welcome to the beeps and </connor>
<joey> boots oh glass glass vehicle and i feel </joey>
<joey> absolutely betrayed </joey>
<connor> god dammit the music episode would just </connor>
<joey> be joey talking for two hours yeah right </joey>
<joey> and then </joey>
<garnt> i like this one yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's why i almost don't want to do it </garnt>
<connor> because i think i'd probably just make a </connor>
<joey> video on my own you're gonna carry the </joey>
<joey> episode yeah exactly which might be the </joey>
<connor> shortest trash days episode of all time </connor>
<connor> yeah probably like 40 minutes in my life </connor>
<connor> and that's it yeah all right thanks for </connor>
<garnt> joining us </garnt>
<garnt> do you have an example of like a song </garnt>
<garnt> where the lyrics um where you where the </garnt>
<garnt> where you found more like reading into </garnt>
<garnt> the lyrics and the deeper meaning of </garnt>
<garnt> that song as opposed to just listening </garnt>
<garnt> to you know the initial beats the beeps </garnt>
<connor> and the boobs the beeps and the boobs i </connor>
<joey> mean like like i'll go into pink floyd </joey>
<connor> the wall </connor>
<connor> oh yes </connor>
<connor> but also like yeah i think there's like </connor>
<connor> a lot of like artists that you know </connor>
<connor> again it's like it's it's that </connor>
<garnt> brilliance of you know using the lead </garnt>
<garnt> singer as just like an instrument where </garnt>
<garnt> it's like if you're not listening to the </garnt>
<garnt> lyrics or anything like that it still </garnt>
<garnt> sounds great and it's still like sticky </garnt>
<garnt> in your head but then you but then one </garnt>
<garnt> day you're like you know i've listened </garnt>
<garnt> to this song like three or four times </garnt>
<garnt> but i never actually read the lyrics let </garnt>
<garnt> me read into the lyrics and then you </garnt>
<garnt> read into it you know a lot of it's very </garnt>
<garnt> like poetic and you know it completely </garnt>
<garnt> changes the way you view that song like </garnt>
<garnt> you know [ __ ] like great like you </garnt>
<garnt> know [ __ ] you know you know turning </garnt>
<garnt> japanese you know that song yeah no </garnt>
<garnt> turning japanese i think i'm doing it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i know that song's about </garnt>
<garnt> masturbation oh yeah but no one knows it </garnt>
<joey> because no one [ __ ] reads into the </joey>
<joey> lyrics they just see they just hear that </joey>
<garnt> and i was like oh yeah i love that song </garnt>
<garnt> this is what turning japanese is about </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's about masturbation i i've </joey>
<connor> never heard of these songs well like how </connor>
<joey> pumped up kicks is about school </joey>
<connor> shootings right i know that one i know </connor>
<garnt> like when people first discovered that </garnt>
<garnt> they were like oh my god i've been </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] debated right but it's catchy as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's catchy as [ __ ] it's crazy it's </garnt>
<connor> a jam of a song right it's like i don't </connor>
<garnt> know i find that to be like as someone </garnt>
<joey> who also writes music that is so much </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] harder than it looks yeah i know </garnt>
<garnt> i can imagine and i feel bad that i </garnt>
<garnt> don't or i have the inability to </garnt>
<joey> appreciate it because like but i feel </joey>
<joey> that's fine because like i feel with </joey>
<joey> those kinds of songs they're taking into </joey>
<joey> account how it sounds first </joey>
<joey> and then they think about the meaning </joey>
<garnt> afterwards right yeah i think the only </garnt>
<garnt> exception is with like rap music you </garnt>
<garnt> know where it is just like basically </garnt>
<joey> just lyrical poems to a beat right so </joey>
<garnt> that's where i actually have more of an </garnt>
<joey> understanding or like or like an image </joey>
<joey> in my head of oh man these lyrics go </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] hard but right yeah they do </connor>
<connor> listen to the lyrics yeah but try it </connor>
<connor> right yeah but like most of the times i </connor>
<connor> actually see the lyric sheets and it </connor>
<joey> almost like it almost like transforms it </joey>
<joey> that to a point where i don't even </joey>
<joey> recognize the song anymore it's always </joey>
<joey> like separate from the song itself it's </joey>
<joey> so weird if someone can explain this to </joey>
<joey> me like i'm like super curious </joey>
<joey> because i've just i i think i just i i'm </joey>
<garnt> incapable of </garnt>
<garnt> like getting the meaning of lyrics as </garnt>
<garnt> i'm listening to the song at the same </garnt>
<joey> time i recognize anything to do with the </joey>
<joey> fact that i'm the only musical trained </joey>
<garnt> one out of the three of us </garnt>
<connor> probably you probably appreciate it more </connor>
<garnt> yeah maybe to me it's all noise right i </garnt>
<connor> like it </connor>
<joey> yeah but it's noise i mean i i i can </joey>
<garnt> play musical instruments but i've never </garnt>
<joey> been like professionally trained right </joey>
<joey> right you know i think that's just what </joey>
<joey> it is right like i feel it's just </joey>
<garnt> because you've been trained to listen to </garnt>
<garnt> music in a different way yeah that you </garnt>
<garnt> can just perceive these smaller points </garnt>
<garnt> that other people would just perceive as </garnt>
<garnt> just the beeps and the boobs right i </garnt>
<garnt> mean to me like it's like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> people who you know go to a gallery and </garnt>
<garnt> look at art right it's like you've </garnt>
<garnt> clearly just been like a lot of them </garnt>
<garnt> have just been trained to look at this </garnt>
<garnt> thing in a completely different way that </garnt>
<garnt> you otherwise would have a very hard </garnt>
<garnt> time grasping right like you know you go </garnt>
<joey> to an art gallery with an art critic and </joey>
<joey> they'd be like yes i love the the flow </joey>
<joey> and the the texture and the feelings </joey>
<joey> that i get from it it's making me feel </joey>
<joey> this way and the average person looking </joey>
<joey> to be like oh yeah i like the color red </joey>
<joey> as well you know like </joey>
<joey> it's just i think it's just based on how </joey>
<garnt> you're trained yeah like like to me like </garnt>
<garnt> you know i can play musical instruments </garnt>
<garnt> and um stuff like that but i've never </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i've i've never thought i was i've never </joey>
<joey> like studied music theory or anything </joey>
<joey> like that so like when i like wrote </joey>
<joey> songs before it was more like </joey>
<joey> c major sound nice or something or </joey>
<joey> something like that i don't like you </joey>
<joey> know her her chords sound nice that was </joey>
<garnt> just like my process you know </garnt>
<joey> musically trained </joey>
<garnt> musically trained </garnt>
<garnt> god damn but yeah at this rate i don't </garnt>
<joey> know if we'll ever actually end up doing </joey>
<connor> a music three by three i'm down i just </connor>
<connor> gotta think of nine albums i like uh </connor>
<joey> right now i can are we doing albums or </joey>
