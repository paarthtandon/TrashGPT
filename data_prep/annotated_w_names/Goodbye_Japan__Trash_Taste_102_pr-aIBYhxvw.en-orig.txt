<garnt> I have to know don't do that nonsense </garnt>
<garnt> found him I have to do that nonsense </garnt>
<joey> founder and CEO but uh yeah so I've been </joey>
<connor> working on this brand thing for like a </connor>
<connor> year now great pitch </connor>
<connor> thank you for that to be that loud I'm </connor>
<connor> so sorry but yeah I've been working on </connor>
<connor> this for like a year now </connor>
<connor> um and you know like I've always been </connor>
<connor> known to like you know wear good clothes </connor>
<connor> yeah like I like you know I'm privileged </connor>
<connor> I'm privileged I'm privileged to wear </connor>
<connor> Google but you know I've always been </connor>
<connor> like interested in like clothing like </connor>
<connor> fashion you know like streetwear stuff </connor>
<connor> like that so I was like yeah there's so </connor>
<joey> much good street wear out there but like </joey>
<joey> nothing that was like really like </joey>
<joey> speaking to me personally right it's </joey>
<joey> like there's a lot of good brands and </joey>
<connor> whatnot but it's like so I was just like </connor>
<joey> I'll [ __ ] do it myself I'll make it a </joey>
<connor> pain in the ass yeah absolutely it was a </connor>
<connor> pain in the ass yeah yeah so like um </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's like a full-on proper brand </connor>
<joey> or anything and like the one thing I was </joey>
<joey> always scared of right is like whenever </joey>
<joey> YouTube is released clothes yeah it's </joey>
<joey> usually under the merch yeah yeah right </joey>
<joey> but like I didn't want this to be much </joey>
<joey> because it's like because you know these </joey>
<joey> designs and like all the designs are </joey>
<joey> going to be releasing have nothing to do </joey>
<garnt> with me or like the likeness of me or </garnt>
<joey> anything like that yeah I wanted to just </joey>
<garnt> be like something separate to me right </garnt>
<joey> that like in the case that like the </joey>
<joey> anime man or whatever just [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> implodes in on itself right in a couple </joey>
<joey> years time that this can still be around </joey>
<connor> right so he's like I'm already not </connor>
<connor> watching an anime exactly it's already </connor>
<connor> it's already on the Dire Straits all </connor>
<connor> right back up exactly it's already on </connor>
<connor> the Dire Straits I'm like you know what </connor>
<connor> like I'll I'll try something new I'll </connor>
<connor> try something like challenging yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> so uh yeah so by the time this episode </garnt>
<garnt> is out like all the Social Media stuff </garnt>
<garnt> is probably ready to go we literally </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know anything about it we we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know anything </garnt>
<joey> you don't know you don't understand how </joey>
<garnt> hard it was to keep it a secret I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's kept a secret from us </garnt>
<joey> like literally I started this before we </joey>
<joey> moved to this office are you serious </joey>
<joey> yeah like at the old office what yeah so </joey>
<connor> it's been like over a year now okay so </connor>
<joey> yeah I'm uh I'm very passionate about </joey>
<garnt> this and I wanted to do well and uh I </garnt>
<garnt> have so I have so many questions I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know where to start it's all </garnt>
<garnt> everything's designed by me as well like </garnt>
<garnt> sketched by me obviously I obviously I </garnt>
<joey> obviously got designers and everything </joey>
<joey> to clean it up and everything like all </joey>
<connor> the designs are done by me yeah and uh </connor>
<connor> yeah I hope people like it so check out </connor>
<connor> nonsense it's uh I'm gonna be and we're </connor>
<connor> gonna be doing this thing where we </connor>
<connor> release a new design every month okay </connor>
<connor> like one new design a month because I </connor>
<connor> thought like originally I was like </connor>
<joey> should I do like the usual thing where </joey>
<joey> it's like oh I drop you know like a </joey>
<joey> collection yeah a collection of the </joey>
<joey> collection but I was like no I'm selling </joey>
<garnt> it to people on the internet and the </garnt>
<garnt> people on the internet have the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> attention span of a goldfish somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> let's just like keep bringing stuff out </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so keep the drip dripping </garnt>
<joey> exactly keep it keep that tap just </joey>
<garnt> slightly open so that the water's just </garnt>
<connor> constantly drooping you know rather than </connor>
<joey> keeping it closed and then suddenly </joey>
<joey> being like here you go you know so yeah </joey>
<connor> that's the that's the plans for it </connor>
<joey> obviously I'm not like you know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> quitting anything else this is just like </joey>
<joey> another thing I'm doing on the side so </joey>
<joey> hey if you like it then uh check it out </joey>
<connor> I guess and then hopefully pre-orders </connor>
<connor> will start soon was there anything that </connor>
<connor> was uh surprisingly Difficult about </connor>
<joey> making your own clothing brands yeah </joey>
<joey> like well for one like you know </joey>
<connor> everything's designed by me but like I </connor>
<joey> can't do like graphic design yeah well </joey>
<joey> you know like I can't do like logo </joey>
<connor> design and stuff like that right so like </connor>
<connor> even just coming up with like you know </connor>
<joey> just like the font and stuff like that </joey>
<connor> for nonsense and like uh I don't know if </connor>
<joey> the logo is anywhere but like yeah like </joey>
<garnt> you know just something like that right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah even just coming up with like that </garnt>
<joey> font took me like two months well that's </joey>
<garnt> why graphic designers are like job </garnt>
<joey> I basically just described what a </joey>
<connor> graphic designer is damn this [ __ ] hard </connor>
<joey> job for this yeah right because like you </joey>
<garnt> know I'm not used to that with like </garnt>
<joey> video creating right yeah like usually </joey>
<garnt> it's like nine times out of ten I think </garnt>
<joey> of an idea and then I try and make it </joey>
<joey> work and then whatever I have you know I </joey>
<joey> have to work with right especially with </joey>
<joey> the kind of content I make so it's like </joey>
<joey> you know even if it's not like perfect </joey>
<joey> perfect yeah I have to get something out </joey>
<joey> there right otherwise I won't you know </joey>
<joey> I'll have the [ __ ] upload schedule of </joey>
<joey> you know 2015 gaunt essentially yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so it's like but like with this </joey>
<joey> I have to like really be careful with it </joey>
<joey> because I don't want to get a design out </joey>
<joey> there and it just looks like [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> you know because it's like my brand is </joey>
<garnt> on the line essentially how many fonts </garnt>
<garnt> did you have to go through </garnt>
<joey> uh like </joey>
<garnt> well I mean for one like the the actual </garnt>
<garnt> the official font for the brand is </garnt>
<garnt> completely custom yeah so I had to get </garnt>
<joey> like a like a typographer not a not a </joey>
<garnt> graphic designer a typographer I have to </garnt>
<joey> find a typographer to be like and like a </joey>
<connor> font specialist to be like here's the </connor>
<connor> brand here's what the brand is about </connor>
<connor> here's the kind of designs I want yeah </connor>
<connor> uh can you come up with just like a </connor>
<garnt> shitload of fonts yeah and we literally </garnt>
<joey> went through about 100 fonts and just </joey>
<garnt> decided that's what we want because the </garnt>
<garnt> thing about fonts is that it's something </garnt>
<joey> that like most people don't really </joey>
<connor> appreciate or think about until you have </connor>
<connor> to choose one like I remember like just </connor>
<joey> having to choose one just to use for </joey>
<connor> more like my YouTube videos or just yeah </connor>
<joey> right a logo or something I'm just like </joey>
<joey> where the [ __ ] do I even start and then </joey>
<garnt> you go through like the Photoshop like </garnt>
<garnt> fun and you like realize that's just </garnt>
<joey> calibri in it </joey>
<garnt> just like the aerial yeah yeah and then </garnt>
<garnt> you talk to Graphics yeah yeah and then </garnt>
<garnt> you talk to graphic designers and </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like they're just like </garnt>
<garnt> built different they see a font and they </garnt>
<joey> can like name the font yeah like they </joey>
<connor> can name the font they can name like the </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> so like I I got like a like you know </connor>
<connor> working with like a typographer and </connor>
<connor> everything like I gained like a whole </connor>
<connor> new appreciation for like graphic design </connor>
<connor> and typography because like yeah that </connor>
<connor> shit's hard as [ __ ] and I can see why </connor>
<connor> you know like in the case with like this </connor>
<connor> for example like just changing this </connor>
<connor> spacing the kerning between each of the </connor>
<connor> letters yeah makes like a completely </connor>
<connor> different design yeah and you wouldn't </connor>
<garnt> think otherwise though when you make </garnt>
<connor> like a YouTube thumbnail right yeah like </connor>
<connor> yeah just [ __ ] put the font there and </connor>
<connor> you're good right right kind of thing so </connor>
<garnt> it's like it made me appreciate like </garnt>
<garnt> subtle design yeah if anything and like </garnt>
<garnt> you know because I'm kind of going with </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of a combination between like </garnt>
<joey> street wear but also loungewear right so </joey>
<joey> like you could wear this like outside of </joey>
<joey> course and you know be great but you can </joey>
<joey> also it's comfortable enough where you </joey>
<joey> can wear it inside yeah as well so for </joey>
<joey> for you for you weebs out there that </joey>
<joey> don't go outside you can still wear it </joey>
<connor> this is like the longest trash taste ad </connor>
<connor> we've ever done </connor>
<joey> yeah no because like you know it's </joey>
<garnt> talking about like fonts and having to </garnt>
<garnt> choose fonts and just like being thrown </garnt>
<connor> into a world that you just don't </connor>
<garnt> understand sometimes that yeah you never </garnt>
<connor> knew that you know there was this much </connor>
<connor> thought into it like I remember like </connor>
<connor> recently uh this is like going off on a </connor>
<connor> tangent but I remember recently I've </connor>
<connor> just got like </connor>
<garnt> had like a binge not really a binge but </garnt>
<garnt> just like had my recommended taken over </garnt>
<garnt> by these really weird keyboard ASMR </garnt>
<garnt> videos I don't know I don't know if you </garnt>
<joey> guys know what I'm talking about I think </joey>
<garnt> I've seen a couple of them </garnt>
<garnt> because because uh because how uh how </garnt>
<garnt> how like how I basically discovered it </garnt>
<garnt> was just this random keyboard video </garnt>
<garnt> right and I was just like why is why is </garnt>
<joey> there a keyboard video of just someone </joey>
<joey> typing on my timeline it's like I click </joey>
<joey> on it just just uh because I think that </joey>
<joey> I think the video title was just listen </joey>
<joey> to the sound of this keyboard or </joey>
<joey> something right right and it's just like </joey>
<connor> him like oh or like him or her like just </connor>
<connor> pressing the keys right and just and the </connor>
<connor> title was just listen to the space bar </connor>
<garnt> right and it's pressing the keys right </garnt>
<garnt> and then he goes to the space bar </garnt>
<garnt> and it just sounded like a space bar I </garnt>
<garnt> was like it's just a space bar and then </garnt>
<garnt> I go to the comments section to be like </garnt>
<garnt> what what's what's going on and all of </garnt>
<garnt> the comments were just like I was I was </garnt>
<garnt> having a nice time until you press the </garnt>
<garnt> space bar and then I vomited and it was </garnt>
<garnt> just like the vomit emote or something </garnt>
<garnt> like that and I was just I've never been </garnt>
<garnt> put into a world that I just did not </garnt>
<joey> understand well I mean like I I kind of </joey>
<joey> felt that when uh I think it was Conor </joey>
<garnt> ride who got like I think one of your </garnt>
<garnt> fans made like a custom keyboard yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah but then they also you </garnt>
<garnt> know with the custom cable which looked </garnt>
<connor> sick as [ __ ] there was also this like </connor>
<connor> other smaller keyboard where you could </connor>
<connor> test out oh that was gone oh that was </connor>
<connor> gone it was like it was like a smaller </connor>
<garnt> keyboard where you could test out all </garnt>
<joey> the different types of keys yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> and like Hammers and I'm just like </garnt>
<joey> what's the difference </joey>
<joey> like I touched all of them and I was </joey>
<joey> like half of these sound the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> thing I think I think they as someone </connor>
<connor> who's like using the one of the </connor>
<joey> expensive keyboards because I don't </joey>
<joey> think it was given to me I would never </joey>
<joey> have gone out my way and </joey>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<garnt> now I get it because I use it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> before I didn't understand what the </garnt>
<garnt> difference was yeah right but I really </garnt>
<garnt> like the smoothness and like the subtle </garnt>
<connor> clicks yeah now that I've watched it </connor>
<garnt> it's a very slight click but it's really </garnt>
<garnt> nice yeah now that I'm like like 20 </garnt>
<joey> keyboard videos down I kind of get it </joey>
<joey> there's like a nice there's like it's </joey>
<joey> it's like the thunk sound yeah there's </joey>
<garnt> it's the thong sound where it's zero or </garnt>
<joey> have you just been conditioned maybe </joey>
<connor> I've just been conditioned I feel like </connor>
<garnt> I'm I'm one of you Cherry MX brand </garnt>
<garnt> switches can suck my dick there you go </garnt>
<garnt> uh welcome keyboard enthusiasts yeah I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like the Cherry switches I can actually </garnt>
<joey> tell they [ __ ] suck now I used to </joey>
<joey> have it wait listen like why why why it </joey>
<connor> sounds like like a car crashing every </connor>
<connor> time you [ __ ] press it in it's so </connor>
<garnt> goddamn loud Oh you mean like the clicky </garnt>
<garnt> one super super clicky okay [ __ ] those </garnt>
<garnt> ones they what like I had one in my old </garnt>
<garnt> office in the UK and since I went back </garnt>
<connor> to the UK it's probably like charity </connor>
<connor> Brown MX switches they're like the </connor>
<garnt> cheese I think it's like the Cherry blue </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> the gatrian ones the gatron is like </garnt>
<connor> gatron's where is that I've got the </connor>
<connor> gatron Black Ink one oh that's a good </connor>
<connor> one it's like oh it's [ __ ] good yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] good dude yeah I really </garnt>
<connor> like the gatron like milk yellow I </connor>
<connor> believe it's it's literally called milky </connor>
<connor> something milk because it it like it </connor>
<garnt> just has this like nice little thunk to </garnt>
<garnt> it and it's nice it's like ASMR right </garnt>
<joey> it's it's so smooth and it's so it's </joey>
<joey> milky it just sounds like one piece </joey>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> like what Lube he used and I was like I </connor>
<connor> don't need to know what you jacked off </connor>
<garnt> with but yeah I appreciate it yeah so so </garnt>
<connor> to explain like I'm also getting a </connor>
<garnt> custom keyboard made because a fan </garnt>
<connor> message me yeah um but like dude I mean </connor>
<connor> like I I did pay for the the thing yeah </connor>
<garnt> so he was like oh do you want to get a </garnt>
<garnt> keyboard made for you and it's being in </garnt>
<garnt> the process of being made and I was just </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah sure thinking that he was just </garnt>
<garnt> going you know he was just going to send </garnt>
<garnt> something that he recommended and he was </garnt>
<garnt> like no we're gonna do the entire </garnt>
<garnt> process right like what kind of what </garnt>
<garnt> kind of keyboard do you want you want </garnt>
<garnt> like a hundred percent you want a 75 </garnt>
<garnt> percent you want to like a fifty percent </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like what you are saying </garnt>
<garnt> numbers right now it's a keyboard what </garnt>
<connor> are you talking about I have a full </connor>
<connor> hundred percent keyboard keyboard and I </connor>
<joey> want every part there yeah why would I </joey>
<joey> only need 75 of the keyboard yeah I </joey>
<connor> don't like the number pad and all that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] on the side I don't I used to not </joey>
<joey> care but now that I have a keyboard that </joey>
<connor> doesn't have a number pad I understand </connor>
<joey> why it's unnecessary to have it because </joey>
<connor> I realized I realized until it was gone </connor>
<connor> I never [ __ ] used to know I know I </connor>
<connor> know some people like go ham on it and </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> I'm out here I'm totally fine with the </garnt>
<connor> top thing yeah so I just want to save </connor>
<garnt> room yeah I use number pads okay yeah </garnt>
<garnt> mostly because when you huh you just </garnt>
<garnt> mostly it's it's useful because it's all </garnt>
<connor> the numbers are just close enough yeah I </connor>
<connor> recognize it's the superior way to </connor>
<garnt> handle numbers it is it is but I I just </garnt>
<joey> like with the amount of like two-factor </joey>
<joey> authentication I have yeah you know what </joey>
<garnt> I mean like like I'm constantly using </garnt>
<joey> it's not that it is it is it is this </joey>
<garnt> well I definitely had a moment where </garnt>
<garnt> like you know I was like you know I </garnt>
<garnt> should probably start using the number </garnt>
<garnt> pad yeah my old keyboard because it's </garnt>
<garnt> there but then I had a moment where I </garnt>
<joey> was just like damn it's so hard to use </joey>
<joey> with my left hand I was just like doing </joey>
<joey> this and I'm like oh maybe I should just </joey>
<joey> take my hand off for now so just do this </joey>
<joey> why is it not on the left side it'd be </joey>
<joey> so much easier but then I was like oh I </joey>
<joey> could just let go of the mouse and </joey>
<garnt> perhaps just do this before you implying </garnt>
<garnt> that your right hand was like on your </garnt>
<garnt> dick you're like jacking off for you </garnt>
<garnt> like let me put in my credit card </garnt>
<joey> details well I'm like jacking up while </joey>
<joey> like playing run </joey>
<connor> I mean if you're like an accountant or </connor>
<joey> something right you got to be pressing </joey>
<joey> numbers all day then yeah it should make </joey>
<connor> sense but like I should be used to that </connor>
<connor> layout as well because it's like you </connor>
<connor> know every calculator is that layout </connor>
<connor> right so it's like why is it so hard for </connor>
<garnt> me to use when it's on a keyboard yeah </garnt>
<joey> even though on a calculator it's like </joey>
<garnt> basically second nature yeah like I I I </garnt>
<garnt> mean the the reason I like the number </garnt>
<garnt> pad is because buying a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> online you've got to enter your credit </garnt>
<garnt> card number a lot </garnt>
<connor> um log into your bank account details </connor>
<connor> how much should you buying yeah it is </connor>
<connor> like actually beneficial to have that </connor>
<garnt> real estate taken up </garnt>
<garnt> um like I don't know like I just have </garnt>
<garnt> enough I feel like I use it a lot </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes I need to log into my </garnt>
<garnt> bank and you know you when is when </garnt>
<garnt> you're entering purely just numbers it's </garnt>
<garnt> not like a password that's when the </garnt>
<garnt> number pad is useful and like when </garnt>
<connor> you're like entering the numbers on a </connor>
<connor> line marginally though marginally useful </connor>
<garnt> Mr optimization I thought I thought </garnt>
<connor> you'd be one of me man listen you're </connor>
<connor> trying to optimize two things at once </connor>
<connor> how fast can you type stuff in but also </connor>
<joey> the the space in your desk you know </joey>
<joey> right right I've got a lot of like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> on my desk because you know they've got </garnt>
<garnt> like God knows how many I got like two </garnt>
<garnt> audio interfaces I got a bunch of other </garnt>
<garnt> cables I will I will admit the aesthetic </garnt>
<garnt> looks better without them it's the the </garnt>
<connor> aesthetic looks better travels easier </connor>
<garnt> you know trying to put a number you can </garnt>
<garnt> put a key like a uh what are they called </garnt>
<garnt> a 75 half keyboards yeah 75 yeah 75 </garnt>
<connor> keyboard you can put that in the </connor>
<connor> backpack you can't put a full one in </connor>
<connor> your bag that's too big why would you </connor>
<connor> sometimes you're going somewhere maybe </connor>
<connor> you go into a lan event or something not </connor>
<joey> that I do anymore but you know what's </joey>
<joey> the last time you went to a lan event </joey>
<connor> University yeah I think like it was like </connor>
<joey> high school for me but also like you </joey>
<joey> know what if you don't like the the </joey>
<joey> keyboard on your laptop I get it because </joey>
<joey> sometimes the laptop keyboards suck and </joey>
<joey> then you want to bring them with you if </joey>
<joey> you're going to be like having a remote </joey>
<joey> setup right packing a full-size keyboard </joey>
<joey> in the backpack it's pain in the ass </joey>
<joey> I've never been that desperate I've </joey>
<joey> never been like every time I've touched </joey>
<connor> you don't realize you don't realize how </connor>
<connor> how good having like things smaller and </connor>
<connor> taking up less space is yeah but like </connor>
<connor> it's not it's not like my laptop </connor>
<connor> keyboard isn't so [ __ ] detrimental to </connor>
<garnt> me where I'm like I gotta pack another </garnt>
<connor> keyboard </connor>
<garnt> without a number pad than just use the </garnt>
<garnt> laptop keyboard if that makes less sense </garnt>
<garnt> more space now you take your more space </garnt>
<connor> I'm having like a remote setup yeah I'm </connor>
<joey> going to a place I'm going to be </joey>
<connor> streaming and we're playing games I </connor>
<joey> don't want to play games on the laptop </joey>
<joey> uh keyboard controller could bring in </joey>
<joey> control but some games don't use </joey>
<joey> controller well then don't play those </joey>
<garnt> games okay well but you're gonna play </garnt>
<garnt> these games Joe you're just being </garnt>
<joey> pedantic now for no reason just just </joey>
<joey> play a game that you can use I'm </joey>
<joey> not alone I've seen people do this so </joey>
<garnt> many times people don't want to use the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] keyboard on the laptop I'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> you're not alone but it's done there's </garnt>
<garnt> so many people who do this this is I've </garnt>
<garnt> never gotten to the point where okay I </garnt>
<garnt> have a remote setup right a remote setup </garnt>
<garnt> is not like your permanent setup right </garnt>
<connor> yeah but if if I really really really </connor>
<connor> need a keyboard I just buy like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] five dollar keyboard or </connor>
<garnt> something like that you know like it's </garnt>
<connor> yeah use the laptop one yeah no like I I </connor>
<garnt> like if if I really really wanted like a </garnt>
<connor> remote like a remote setup it's like the </connor>
<connor> ergonomics you know like using a laptop </connor>
<connor> keyboard for hours like actually [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> hurts your wrists using a keyboard for </joey>
<joey> hours hurts my wrist </joey>
<connor> that's why I'm trying to use controller </connor>
<joey> for everything a nice keyboard you know </joey>
<joey> good ergonomics doesn't doesn't hurt </joey>
<joey> your wrist yeah you bring the rest as </joey>
<joey> well yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> you got the rest too a lot just enough </joey>
<joey> rest you know my laptop it's amazing </joey>
<connor> right but I I have to like it's just </connor>
<connor> there's no support or anything I'm just </connor>
<joey> putting it I'll just bring the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> rest then I just feel like </connor>
<connor> uh the [ __ ] track pad and [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah it just doesn't work it doesn't </garnt>
<connor> work I just feel like the inside I've </connor>
<garnt> got someone in the office understands </garnt>
<connor> this point I just think like the whole </connor>
<garnt> point of a laptop is to be portable no </garnt>
<garnt> it is like and and like but at that </garnt>
<joey> point you might as well monitor if the </joey>
<garnt> keyboard fits in the bag it's portable </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean like you can't </garnt>
<garnt> bring a p the reason why laptop's </garnt>
<garnt> Portables because it's not a giant </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] case not because the keyboard is </joey>
<joey> like on him that's like one of the </joey>
<joey> reasons if I'm whipping it out in a cafe </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm gonna use the laptop keyboard </joey>
<joey> right I'm replying it you know it's not </joey>
<connor> a big deal if I'm streaming or gaming I </connor>
<garnt> want a [ __ ] keyboard but in how are </garnt>
<garnt> you like if you're at the point where </garnt>
<garnt> you're bringing a portable setup yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right like in which so tell tell them </garnt>
<garnt> tell me this tell me this hypothetical </garnt>
<garnt> situation where you need to set up an </garnt>
<garnt> entire stream setup because I'll tell </garnt>
<garnt> you it's not just a [ __ ] laptop you </garnt>
<garnt> need to bring your if you're bringing </garnt>
<garnt> your entire [ __ ] stream set up how </garnt>
<connor> much are you bringing like what do you </connor>
<connor> want to enter the UK last time I brought </connor>
<joey> it with me you know you just bring </joey>
<joey> because if I want to film stuff anyway I </joey>
<joey> bring a camera anyway the camera has two </joey>
<joey> uses I can film other stuff do you bring </joey>
<joey> lights no I don't bring lights you don't </joey>
<joey> need lights you know you can figure out </joey>
<joey> lighting it's not a big issue right it's </joey>
<garnt> it's just having a good camera a good </garnt>
<garnt> mic and then if you want to play games </garnt>
<garnt> or [ __ ] you bring a keyboard on a map </garnt>
<garnt> and a mouse you're not going to [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> use the uh the trackpad right no you're </connor>
<garnt> not going to use </garnt>
<garnt> a trackpad is like totally different </garnt>
<connor> than the mouse right right but I mean if </connor>
<connor> you have a 75 keyboard it's not that big </connor>
<garnt> but then like another thing is like are </garnt>
<garnt> you still gaming on the laptop or do you </garnt>
<connor> have like a monitor that you're using as </connor>
<connor> well uh on the laptop's fine the screen </connor>
<joey> I have on my laptop is pretty good and </joey>
<joey> that's not very ergonomic is it </joey>
<joey> like this desk over there my my other </joey>
<joey> keyboards here this one's there it's </joey>
<joey> further away because I have more room </joey>
<joey> now because the keyboard's not attached </joey>
<joey> to the thing so I can place the screen </joey>
<joey> where I want it to so it is ergonomics </joey>
<connor> does this just sound very pretentious no </connor>
<garnt> this is not this is this is if I wanted </garnt>
<garnt> like do it if you want to go portability </garnt>
<connor> why not go for a 50 keyboard then or 50 </connor>
<garnt> what or 24. what is the 50 how can you </garnt>
<garnt> remove less there is you would be </garnt>
<garnt> surprised you would be surprised </garnt>
<connor> smaller keys I already had fat fingers </connor>
<joey> too I need I need to like why don't you </joey>
<connor> just invent a keyboard which is just the </connor>
<connor> space bar and the arrow keys I don't </connor>
<connor> know who who uses the arrow keys yeah </connor>
<connor> well if you're playing games okay or </connor>
<connor> wasd I want all the letters you know </connor>
<garnt> it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's half of a pizza box you know what I </garnt>
<garnt> mean it's like not even it's tiny it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't take up room and your clothes </garnt>
<garnt> are the padding it's it's this isn't </garnt>
<garnt> hard why is this so crazy to you it's </garnt>
<connor> like I'm bringing a [ __ ] like pet dog </connor>
<garnt> in my bags is so unbelievable because </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just like at that point at </garnt>
<garnt> that point where you are not at that </garnt>
<garnt> point where you're bringing a streaming </garnt>
<garnt> setup a number pad is not that much more </garnt>
<connor> surface area okay but what I'm saying is </connor>
<connor> like that's just unnecessary like in </connor>
<joey> general like uh in any keyboard setup </joey>
<joey> keyboard in your like check-in well </joey>
<garnt> technically if you get a 50 keyboard </garnt>
<connor> you're removing unnecessary keys right </connor>
<garnt> you know you know that's that's the </garnt>
<connor> entire life </connor>
<garnt> it's called a preference Connor it's </garnt>
<connor> called a preference </connor>
<connor> I would argue right the reason why 75 is </connor>
<connor> no different from the 100 because you </connor>
<connor> don't lose anything right you have you </connor>
<connor> just have numbers twice I don't need </connor>
<connor> numbers twice I see numbers once this is </connor>
<joey> not why is this like you're saying like </joey>
<joey> removing the second numpad is not equal </joey>
<joey> to being like get rid of half of the </joey>
<joey> alphabet this is not the [ __ ] same at </joey>
<joey> all why I can't believe this is an </joey>
<garnt> argument you're making </garnt>
<joey> imagine in the hotel you're stuck for a </joey>
<connor> week yeah yeah you wanted you want the </connor>
<connor> TV screen to be your second monitor yeah </connor>
<garnt> leave your laptop there and you can sit </garnt>
<connor> at your bed with your wireless 75 yeah </connor>
<garnt> every every Hotel every Airbnb I do not </garnt>
<garnt> pack a keyboard wherever I go no that's </garnt>
<connor> fine but why are you clowning on me this </connor>
<connor> is not like a clown thing to do this is </connor>
<joey> a normal sounds incredibly pretentious </joey>
<joey> and tedious how is it pretentious what </joey>
<connor> because let me just get my 75 because </connor>
<connor> because everyone works differently I </connor>
<connor> can't go to a Starbucks and work like </connor>
<connor> that's not I I'd be like why is it so </connor>
<connor> pretentious gone you have to go to a </connor>
<connor> Starbucks to type you know what I mean </connor>
<garnt> like work from home </garnt>
<garnt> like like I don't see how this is </garnt>
<garnt> potential I'm losing my mind it's the </garnt>
<garnt> way that you're framing it as like this </garnt>
<garnt> is the superior way to type this is the </garnt>
<garnt> only keyboard that works </garnt>
<garnt> number pads irrelevant unnecessary </garnt>
<garnt> all I'm saying is you preference I I </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> I use it enough and optionally for me to </garnt>
<garnt> be able to justify that it is a </garnt>
<connor> convenience for me all right I like how </connor>
<connor> did this get to me being clowned on for </connor>
<joey> bringing keyboards how did this get </joey>
<connor> trash days baby that's not that's not </connor>
<connor> the reason you were clowning on me God </connor>
<connor> the reason you were trying to clown on </connor>
<joey> me is because I brought keyboard places </joey>
<joey> because it's funny </joey>
<garnt> it's it's it's it's a lot okay it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a lot I'm just like there's ah </garnt>
<garnt> I understand it's a preference you know </garnt>
<garnt> I understand it is a preference that you </garnt>
<connor> want to bring your keyboard have you </connor>
<connor> never thought like when you're like </connor>
<connor> trying to play games like you're like </connor>
<connor> why are my hands so [ __ ] close to the </connor>
<garnt> screen no I've I've because here's the </garnt>
<garnt> thing like I don't really I'm not a </garnt>
<joey> gamer yeah </joey>
<connor> right right so why don't you just say </connor>
<joey> that in the first place instead of </joey>
<joey> pretending like you were I never pretend </joey>
<joey> like because because I told you what I'm </joey>
<connor> using the keyboard for and then you're </connor>
<garnt> like no no that doesn't exist </garnt>
<connor> I also have a portable streaming setup </connor>
<joey> but I just don't need it I don't need a </joey>
<joey> keyboard I don't think to myself I am I </joey>
<joey> I am a carthus Mane in League of Legends </joey>
<garnt> I have a one percent keyboard it's the r </garnt>
<joey> key that's it okay that's you know like </joey>
<joey> yeah I just I like if I need to game </joey>
<joey> while I'm out and about I just bring a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] controller and just play games </joey>
<connor> that use a controller yeah but like what </connor>
<connor> if someone's like oh dude no you've </connor>
<connor> arranged a a game with someone the game </connor>
<joey> doesn't have controller then I'll use </joey>
<connor> the keyboard I'm not gonna [ __ ] have </connor>
<joey> a hissy fit over and be like where's my </joey>
<connor> 75 percent I wouldn't have a hissy fix I </connor>
<joey> would have brought it [ __ ] with me so </joey>
<joey> they wouldn't have been yeah but even </joey>
<garnt> what if you didn't I always bring it </garnt>
<joey> with me no it's not happening and if </joey>
<garnt> it's just a waste of space it's not a </garnt>
<garnt> waste of space it's it's thin it's small </garnt>
<joey> how is the keyboard a waste of space </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<joey> I just feel like you guys are just being </joey>
<joey> pedantic yeah because it's funny </joey>
<garnt> I mean I I feel like I feel like the </garnt>
<garnt> argument is are you a gamer are you not </garnt>
<joey> a gamer you know </joey>
<joey> 100 games you know I want to write a lot </joey>
<connor> of emails and stuff to the point of like </connor>
<connor> if I'm if I'm doing a lot of work you </connor>
<connor> know I'm typing for a few hours like </connor>
<connor> yeah I'm just gonna bring my own I just </connor>
<connor> it's because like for me it's like I I </connor>
<connor> will be so much less efficient using the </connor>
<connor> laptop long so I just won't be </connor>
<garnt> comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<connor> no I mean I'm I'm okay that's that is </connor>
<garnt> just that is just purely just you </garnt>
<garnt> looking for any like I don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm the scripter here I I </garnt>
<garnt> actually write more than you Connor yeah </garnt>
<garnt> actually he's right more than you it's </garnt>
<connor> the same like because you work one way </connor>
<connor> everyone must work the same way and </connor>
<garnt> you've re like like so if someone writes </garnt>
<garnt> a lot they're the ones that we should </garnt>
<garnt> ask like okay tell me about keyboard </garnt>
<garnt> ergonomics and how well no that's not I </garnt>
<garnt> I I I are you saying that you can't </garnt>
<garnt> write as efficiently if you don't have </garnt>
<garnt> the right keyboard and everything how do </garnt>
<garnt> you function how did you function before </garnt>
<garnt> like the 75 keyboards got popularized </garnt>
<connor> you know because it was writing with I'm </connor>
<connor> not doing wing dings I'm not right with </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] number pad can't what you want </connor>
<connor> this is nothing to do with the 75 now </connor>
<connor> what are you talking about and now we're </connor>
<garnt> talking about the difference between </garnt>
<garnt> laptop and keyboards yeah I I am I'm </garnt>
<connor> just I'm just like if also you know your </connor>
<connor> laptop doesn't have a number pad right </connor>
<garnt> yeah I know </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> I'm not saying that I'm not saying that </joey>
<connor> it doesn't matter </connor>
<connor> listen how you work is like totally up </connor>
<connor> to you right if you if you are a person </connor>
<connor> who gets really agitated by a certain </connor>
<connor> way and that's just like that bugs you </connor>
<joey> yeah I think that's just that's up to </joey>
<joey> you could you just knuckle down </joey>
<joey> sometimes and get on with it yeah you </joey>
<joey> can but I mean at the end of the day </joey>
<joey> it's if you're doing something creative </joey>
<joey> and it's something that you're Your Own </joey>
<joey> Boss with you're probably gonna work as </joey>
<connor> much as you want yeah and sometimes </connor>
<connor> Comfort is a factor in that and for me </connor>
<joey> that's what I need yeah but you're </joey>
<connor> gaming you're right if I am working </connor>
<joey> though as well it's the same thing I </joey>
<joey> just don't want to use it right right </joey>
<connor> that was the most long-winded dumbass </connor>
<joey> argument we've ever had on trash days </joey>
<connor> I just felt like I explained a very </connor>
<joey> valid point and then I got I got jumped </joey>
<garnt> on it </garnt>
<connor> totally a reasonable Behavior to to not </connor>
<garnt> want to use that okay okay because </garnt>
<garnt> because like maybe it's because I don't </garnt>
<garnt> have a custom keyboard yet but like I </garnt>
<joey> don't fully understand I don't take my </joey>
<connor> main keyboard I take some like 50 ones </connor>
<joey> I just needed one that's further away </joey>
<connor> and that I can set up to be more like </connor>
<garnt> wait so you don't even take your your </garnt>
<garnt> good </garnt>
<garnt> optimize custom keyboard not like the </garnt>
<connor> super expensive one no I just take like </connor>
<garnt> one that I do so you have several </garnt>
<connor> keyboards yeah yeah well I learned my </connor>
<connor> lesson because what my keyboard broke </connor>
<garnt> one time I couldn't do any work or </garnt>
<connor> couldn't stream or anything right and I </connor>
<garnt> you know I was [ __ ] and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> well this seems dumb so now I just </garnt>
<garnt> bought I have a spare keyboard </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like it's a good idea yeah </garnt>
<garnt> if your entire job revolves around doing </garnt>
<connor> like being able to use this one device </connor>
<connor> yeah you should probably have backups of </connor>
<connor> everything that could possibly break </connor>
<joey> that's fair enough but I don't think </joey>
<garnt> I've ever broken a keyboard before </garnt>
<connor> keyboards all the time you know maybe </connor>
<garnt> you've had a key that was acting up that </garnt>
<garnt> was pissing you off or yeah maybe the </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it happens all the time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah keyboards are like [ __ ] frail </garnt>
<garnt> things yeah yeah because to me like </garnt>
<garnt> houses break all the time I've got like </garnt>
<garnt> three backup mouses yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like this this comes down to the </garnt>
<garnt> conversation like me and Tech like even </garnt>
<connor> though I'm an engineer I'm I don't like </connor>
<connor> I just need a job to be done you know </connor>
<connor> what I mean I don't really care about </connor>
<connor> Aesthetics or like right stuff too much </connor>
<connor> I just like </connor>
<connor> Aesthetics I don't care about that you </connor>
<connor> don't well it's just about it's about </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> preference of like how I like it to work </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know yeah because like for </garnt>
<garnt> example like headphones for example I </garnt>
<garnt> literally don't like I I my preference </garnt>
<garnt> with headphones is to buy like the </garnt>
<joey> cheapest headphones I can possibly right </joey>
<joey> I'm the opposite with headphones yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah because I I know people are </garnt>
<connor> like really really really </connor>
<joey> India right in here yeah you don't use </joey>
<joey> headphones like clamshell headphones you </joey>
<joey> mean those are headphones right yeah oh </joey>
<garnt> sorry earphones yeah I only use </garnt>
<connor> earphones for like running yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> don't I prefer to use headphones every </connor>
<garnt> other time I don't like yeah to me like </garnt>
<garnt> headphones I don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> um I think it might be because I have </garnt>
<joey> like Jaw problems or something like if I </joey>
<joey> wear headphones for too long it just </joey>
<joey> like really starts to put pressure on my </joey>
<joey> drone stuff but like yeah with with </joey>
<joey> earphones and like this is going above </joey>
<joey> protect but like there are certain </joey>
<joey> things like earphones sunglasses where I </joey>
<garnt> try to buy the cheapest possible because </garnt>
<garnt> I've gone through too many or you know </garnt>
<garnt> like just sometimes you buy like you I I </garnt>
<joey> remember buying like at the end of every </joey>
<garnt> day you're like track all right next one </garnt>
<connor> no yeah because like sometimes I </connor>
<garnt> misplaced them or something but </garnt>
<connor> especially with sunglasses right yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's so it's so easy to misplace </garnt>
<garnt> sunglasses especially because you wear </garnt>
<joey> them out and sometimes utilize you don't </joey>
<joey> always have your case on you or </joey>
<joey> sometimes you you know you take it you </joey>
<joey> don't have a bag or anything you take </joey>
<joey> them off you like clip them on your </joey>
<connor> shirt and they just fall off sometimes </connor>
<connor> like I've I've had that happen too many </connor>
<connor> times and with earphones sometimes you </connor>
<garnt> just get sometimes you replace them </garnt>
<garnt> misplaced them or you like forget that </garnt>
<garnt> they're in your jean Pockets or </garnt>
<connor> something </connor>
<garnt> um so so the headphones kind of make you </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable because they're like put </garnt>
<garnt> pressure on your head yeah yeah it's the </garnt>
<garnt> same thing for me and the keyboard and </garnt>
<joey> the wrist though it just hurts my wrist </joey>
<joey> if I if I if I have to use that flat </joey>
<joey> thing for ages right because your wrist </joey>
<joey> is like why why are we doing this also I </joey>
<garnt> I'm like paranoid about getting any </garnt>
<connor> wrist injuries or carpal tunnels yes you </connor>
<garnt> know I want to get well you gain way </garnt>
<connor> more than that yeah </connor>
<connor> I I'm very cautious about like wrist </connor>
<connor> injuries so I I want the most ergonomic </connor>
<joey> setup once again like those like wrist </joey>
<joey> guard things then but I've seen a couple </joey>
<connor> streams yeah I mean that's that's they </connor>
<connor> normally have that on when it's too late </connor>
<joey> and they've already like done I know </joey>
<joey> some people who have it on like to </joey>
<connor> actually just prevent it I mean if you </connor>
<connor> have a good setup you shouldn't need </connor>
<garnt> that yeah but you know even people with </garnt>
<joey> good setups can sometimes you know game </joey>
<connor> a little too hard yeah but like </connor>
<connor> headphones like for me it's like I can't </connor>
<connor> have the in-ear ones because any every </connor>
<connor> single in your headphones for some </connor>
<joey> reason wants to like excavate your ear </joey>
<connor> yeah and get really in there yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and that hurts the [ __ ] out of my ears </connor>
<joey> oh so I can't use those yeah it's </joey>
<joey> probably because you don't have like the </joey>
<joey> right size buds right yeah I have one </joey>
<connor> that comes with a bunch of replaceable </connor>
<joey> ones but even then like airpods are </joey>
<connor> unironically are the ones that I like </connor>
<connor> the most because they don't really go in </connor>
<joey> your ear much yeah they kind of like sit </joey>
<connor> on top of it that's what I like them </connor>
<joey> most but I don't use apple so I don't </joey>
<joey> have them </joey>
<connor> um and that's why I use it like the </connor>
<joey> ovary ones also the sounds way nicer I </joey>
<connor> only use the over ear ones if it's like </connor>
<connor> in the winter because it also like keeps </connor>
<connor> my head warm but like in the summer here </connor>
<connor> especially I'm just like nope headphones </connor>
<connor> go away I should always use them yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah I do like I've seen you like </joey>
<joey> walking in like the Japanese some with </joey>
<joey> headphones on I'm like bro that looks </joey>
<connor> bad that is dedication yeah that's </connor>
<connor> dedicated listening that's the Comfort I </connor>
<joey> mean you your headphones have taken a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] beating it's like it's like I </connor>
<connor> remember seeing it just falling apart </connor>
<garnt> it's like falling apart man like holy </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what's because it's because I'm waiting </connor>
<garnt> for the right now I'm using the Sony WX </garnt>
<joey> um 1003 the worst naming system of all </joey>
<joey> time yeah yeah what the [ __ ] is going on </joey>
<joey> sort of string of numbers and letters </joey>
<garnt> and then like the the next one the fours </garnt>
<garnt> I I there isn't really a significant </garnt>
<garnt> upgrade yeah and I'm hoping the fives </garnt>
<joey> when they ever come out which I don't </joey>
<joey> even know if they will I'm like a decent </joey>
<joey> upgraded I'm kind of in that weird spot </joey>
<joey> where it's like they're they're like </joey>
<joey> broken and they're not working properly </joey>
<joey> yeah but but like because they're like </joey>
<garnt> you know 300 headphones yeah I want them </garnt>
<garnt> to last like five years yeah of course </garnt>
<joey> of course so if I buy the the fours now </joey>
<garnt> and then the fives come out and they're </garnt>
<garnt> like the most best upgrades and you can </garnt>
<garnt> hear God through them yeah I'm gonna be </garnt>
<joey> really pissed off that I bought these </joey>
<garnt> fours yeah and I just didn't wait a few </garnt>
<joey> months actually but I don't know I don't </joey>
<joey> even know if it's coming out I don't </joey>
<joey> even know they don't even answer </joey>
<joey> anything so I'm just waiting kind of </joey>
<joey> hoping you're waiting for something it </joey>
<joey> works definitely the one side is </joey>
<joey> completely broken so it keeps falling </joey>
<joey> out yeah [ __ ] </joey>

<garnt> you're the gamer right you talked about </garnt>
<connor> keyboards all right 144 Hertz monitors </connor>
<connor> all right okay if you if you genuinely </connor>
<connor> think there's no difference </connor>
<joey> is there a point if you don't play FPS </joey>
<connor> because I genuinely like i j because we </connor>
<garnt> have we have uh we have them in the </garnt>
<connor> office I've never used them I notice it </connor>
<connor> more with FPS games but like even normal </connor>
<connor> games that that are not like locked to </connor>
<joey> 60 look way better in 144. I think </joey>
<joey> that's a problem I only play games that </joey>
<connor> are locked to 60. because you're on the </connor>
<connor> switch Yeah right if you actually game </connor>
<connor> on your PC 144 Hertz is way it looks way </connor>
<connor> better than I don't know I'd rather have </connor>
<joey> 144 Hertz than like a more like higher </joey>
<connor> resolution right it's way nicer and </connor>
<joey> smoother and it looks good I don't know </joey>
<joey> why resolutions milky after like 2K I </joey>
<joey> can't [ __ ] tell the difference like I </joey>
<joey> I I I I I I especially barely look any </joey>
<connor> different from 2K to me yeah I feel way </connor>
<connor> more different from 60 to 120 hertz 144 </connor>
<garnt> Hertz yeah because I feel the difference </garnt>
<garnt> with FPS I just don't play FPS you know </garnt>
<garnt> so I was just like what other game types </garnt>
<garnt> would really like really make me feel </garnt>
<garnt> the difference because I've already </garnt>
<connor> craft any any game where you're you know </connor>
<connor> you're moving around you're controlling </connor>
<joey> a character moving Minecraft's probably </joey>
<joey> the only one where I've probably like </joey>
<joey> somewhat slightly seen it right you </joey>
<connor> might notice it's more fluid it looks </connor>
<joey> good you'll notice when you go back that </joey>
<joey> it's like not quite the same it's not </joey>
<joey> bad it's not like you know if if you you </joey>
<connor> haven't got a lot of money right and </connor>
<connor> you're choosing between like a better PC </connor>
<garnt> or like a monitor that makes you like </garnt>
<connor> come instantly yeah just get a better PC </connor>
<joey> get better parts or something yeah right </joey>
<connor> like it's kind of like the cherry on top </connor>
<connor> but there's no point buying a monster PC </connor>
<connor> if you're then not also going to get a </connor>
<connor> good monitor right right because you're </connor>
<joey> you're basically buying like an engine </joey>
<joey> with a car that can't fit it like it's </joey>
<joey> like okay well I mean it's a point you </joey>
<joey> know a lot of people will have like </joey>
<joey> 3080s and still use 60 FPS monitors and </joey>
<joey> I'm like you know </joey>
<joey> you've put like rockets on a scooter </joey>
<joey> it's like it's just too much yeah like </joey>
<connor> you're overpowering it I don't know I </connor>
<garnt> mean I game a lot so I guess I yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I mean I I am that guy who has a </garnt>
<garnt> 3080 and uh and he's a 60 FPS but like </garnt>
<connor> that's because it's like a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> monster to render when I'm editing yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's the only other like yeah yeah if </garnt>
<connor> you're not gaming if you're doing I </connor>
<garnt> definitely use it like that more than </garnt>
<joey> the gaming yeah like like I've </joey>
<garnt> definitely not noticed anything massive </garnt>
<garnt> massive difference rendering and editing </garnt>
<garnt> like that's like I I don't I don't need </garnt>
<connor> 60 FPS if you're streaming it's also </connor>
<garnt> very good yeah yeah it is uh the Nvidia </garnt>
<garnt> cards have dedicated video chips that </garnt>
<connor> are completely separate to the gaming </connor>
<garnt> yeah so you can you can game and stream </garnt>
<connor> at the same time and it doesn't affect </connor>
<connor> the performance sure but it does a </connor>
<garnt> little bit no that's because of how </garnt>
<garnt> other things going on what do you think </garnt>
<garnt> about so so do you care about the </garnt>
<garnt> keyboard thonk then like I mean the ASMR </garnt>
<connor> yes I do I mean I I like what I have </connor>
<garnt> right now I maybe I should we don't can </garnt>
<joey> remind me to record something </joey>
<connor> I'm on the fence right now because I'm </connor>
<joey> gonna be getting my custom keyboard </joey>
<joey> within like a few months so maybe I'm </joey>
<joey> gonna be like man Conor was right this </joey>
<joey> entire time </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah because like I remember </joey>
<joey> going on this video and just looking at </joey>
<joey> the comment section and I'm just like </joey>
<joey> I've seen less horny comments on PornHub </joey>
<joey> comments you know like my God like you </joey>
<connor> I've I literally feel like everyone is </connor>
<connor> coming from like the sound of these keys </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like yeah that's a nice </connor>
<connor> dining key I guess it's weird because </connor>
<connor> it's like it feels like almost like </connor>
<garnt> Play-Doh at first because you're so used </garnt>
<garnt> to the really harsh clicks yeah yeah the </garnt>
<joey> ones it feels like oh it's really like </joey>
<joey> squishy and so wet yeah but then after a </joey>
<joey> while you get used to it you're like oh </joey>
<joey> no this is actually a really fun yeah </joey>
<joey> the clicks are really solid yeah but </joey>
<garnt> they're not like in your [ __ ] face </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like it's screaming hey you </garnt>
<garnt> just clicked hey hey you just clicked it </garnt>
<garnt> do you want to be that [ __ ] on </garnt>
<garnt> Discord he's like yeah because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when mechanical keyboards got </garnt>
<garnt> popularized and that was like the </garnt>
<joey> popular key because it was like it was </joey>
<garnt> like everyone bought the 30 uh </garnt>
<joey> mechanical keyboard on Amazon because </joey>
<connor> they thought mechanical equaled good </connor>
<joey> when in fact I just can't get over like </joey>
<joey> you describing like the sound of these </joey>
<joey> keys and you know it just sounds like </joey>
<joey> you know hearing the experience of </joey>
<connor> someone going on a drug I've never been </connor>
<joey> on you know it's just like At first it's </joey>
<joey> like really wet but then I want to get </joey>
<joey> used to it it gets like really firm and </joey>
<connor> it's like oh </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> because when when I was picking the keys </garnt>
<joey> because like uh like I'll I'll take a </joey>
<joey> picture and send a Gmail but like I have </joey>
<joey> like a whole [ __ ] like it's a </joey>
<joey> keyboard yeah it's a test it's a square </joey>
<joey> of just keys of different keys and I </joey>
<garnt> have and like it's it's bad with someone </garnt>
<garnt> with ADHD because it's just like you </garnt>
<garnt> just like constantly clicking it and </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like oh this this is a fun </garnt>
<garnt> toy oh this is a fun toy this is it's </garnt>
<garnt> like fidget Spinner's got nothing on </garnt>
<connor> this and then you have to like click one </connor>
<connor> and then you have to choose one key from </connor>
<connor> like a hundred yeah I'm like at some </connor>
<connor> points like Keys just like meld together </connor>
<connor> and they're like different like the </connor>
<connor> different like lubiness of keys and like </connor>
<connor> I didn't know I didn't know luminous </connor>
<connor> like matted with keyboard Keys like I'm </connor>
<connor> just like okay at which point I'm like </connor>
<connor> I'm get it it's it's like a hobby right </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's it's a it's a hobby kind </connor>
<connor> of object right because you have to </connor>
<connor> really be really into it to really care </connor>
<connor> about it this much </connor>
<connor> yeah a key file right right which one </connor>
<connor> does it get like too much where yeah </connor>
<connor> where it's no too much is it never too </connor>
<connor> much never too much all right I'm </connor>
<connor> waiting I'm waiting I'm waiting for my </connor>
<connor> first time this is why we're gonna have </connor>
<joey> flying cars they're the ones in this </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah I I I I've someone told </garnt>
<garnt> me on stream yesterday I was like they </garnt>
<garnt> are completely unrelated but you said </garnt>
<garnt> ADHD so it came from my mind </garnt>
<garnt> um I was like no no I checked because </garnt>
<joey> Chad was accusing me of having ADHD and </joey>
<joey> I said no I don't know what I was like I </joey>
<joey> can like I can focus on things I get </joey>
<joey> really fixated yeah and they're like you </joey>
<joey> know focusing too much is a sign of ADHD </joey>
<joey> right and I was like what yeah it </joey>
<joey> apparently it is yeah so so I was like </joey>
<joey> wait what if I if I concentrate too much </joey>
<joey> on things you have ADHD but if I don't </joey>
<joey> concentrate enough I've had HD2 and I'm </joey>
<connor> like wait wait but then wait hold up </connor>
<joey> what is it what does that mean what is </joey>
<joey> it how does it work it's just I don't </joey>
<joey> know it's like you can't be on too far </joey>
<joey> off the either side of the spectrum yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah because then you have a problem </connor>
<connor> because it isn't specify that you can't </connor>
<joey> pay attention it's attention </joey>
<connor> who's making these rules up huh </connor>
<joey> people who are more informed uh than us </joey>
<connor> you know I was like oh damn these people </connor>
<connor> coming up with these these definitions </connor>
<joey> that's crazy it's usually the person </joey>
<joey> that says you have ADHD yeah like </joey>
<connor> officially how do you test if someone </connor>
<connor> concentrates too much how do you I'm </connor>
<connor> genuinely curious it's nice to be like </connor>
<connor> you can't control yourself and you </connor>
<connor> realize that oh [ __ ] it's like oh you're </connor>
<joey> gonna question something oh yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> you get obsessed it's kind of repeat </joey>
<joey> that yeah it is but at the same time </joey>
<joey> it's like you can't control it but I </joey>
<joey> feel there's a lot of people like in </joey>
<joey> just this internet age that you know </joey>
<joey> because we're so [ __ ] over sensitized </joey>
<joey> and just overwhelmed with all this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] information right all at the </joey>
<joey> same time right there are so many people </joey>
<joey> who are just like oh there's so much </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] [ __ ] to do on the internet do I </joey>
<joey> have ADHD I'm like no you're just on the </joey>
<connor> internet this is also I wonder I'm like </connor>
<connor> I don't think like I have a problem I </connor>
<connor> think there's just so much [ __ ] that's </connor>
<joey> being shoved in my face yeah that's what </joey>
<joey> it is but that's why like I reckon </joey>
<connor> there's probably I mean like you have </connor>
<garnt> ADHD how does it feel I mean I got it is </garnt>
<garnt> weird right because the the reason I I </garnt>
<garnt> only like recently got diagnosed with </garnt>
<joey> ADHD and it was just like the most aha </joey>
<joey> moment of my life like of course I do </joey>
<joey> you know it's like oh that's what that </joey>
<joey> was because like you know especially </joey>
<garnt> like growing up in Asian culture mental </garnt>
<garnt> health and mental conditions are very </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like literally that Meme image </garnt>
<connor> of just don't be sad like yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> cutting the water yeah cutting cutting </garnt>
<garnt> the water of like don't be sad don't be </garnt>
<garnt> sad so I I remember like because I have </garnt>
<connor> this like such a vivid memory in school </connor>
<connor> right of uh I knew someone in school who </connor>
<connor> got diagnosed with ADHD and they got </connor>
<joey> like some like advantage or something in </joey>
<connor> that in like a test that we were taking </connor>
<joey> right I go like extra time or something </joey>
<joey> and then you remember like describing </joey>
<joey> like what he what his experience of ADHD </joey>
<joey> was and I was just like what a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> liar I he he like what a [ __ ] liar I </garnt>
<joey> do that and he's getting some free time </joey>
<garnt> on an exam what the [ __ ] and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like was like it just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> it just for some reason it just never </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] occurred to me that uh </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately I had the same symptoms </garnt>
<garnt> because I was raised not not even raised </garnt>
<garnt> but like a lot of people in my culture </garnt>
<garnt> and the environment I grew up with </garnt>
<garnt> um it was just we it was put in our </garnt>
<garnt> minds that you know mental health just </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't really like it was either like a </garnt>
<garnt> very very serious thing or it just like </garnt>
<garnt> was just didn't exist and you've just </garnt>
<joey> got to get on with it there's no such </joey>
<joey> thing as a mild symptom yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> like you either had it or you don't know </garnt>
<connor> so what made you think oh I should go </connor>
<garnt> and see if I have it like what was the </garnt>
<garnt> Turning Point what like what so this can </garnt>
<garnt> be awful </garnt>
<connor> um enough comments on trash taste I am </connor>
<connor> actually wait why did you like fidgeting </connor>
<garnt> with things huh because you were </garnt>
<garnt> fidgeting with things honestly seeing </garnt>
<connor> myself on camera I'm just like damn man </connor>
<connor> I do that [ __ ] what yeah like hey </connor>
<connor> because like obviously I've never been </connor>
<connor> on camera and especially with me yeah </connor>
<connor> being on camera documented so much on </connor>
<connor> trash taste I'm like damn I do a lot of </connor>
<connor> people analyze yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> habits because you're looking at </joey>
<connor> yourself through the third person </connor>
<connor> um and then also you know there's </connor>
<connor> there's always going to be comments that </connor>
<connor> are like psychoanalyzing and over </connor>
<connor> analyzing stuff yeah like we'll say some </connor>
<connor> really wild yeah yeah yeah but then like </connor>
<connor> what I I saw some comments that are just </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] they kind of make sense and </connor>
<joey> then they Google it uh Google what they </joey>
<joey> say I'm like damn that doesn't look like </joey>
<joey> it's uh that doesn't look like it's just </joey>
<connor> someone talking out their ass and then </connor>
<joey> like the final straw was uh meeting </joey>
<connor> someone here who has ADHD and they </connor>
<joey> describe their symptoms I'm like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> okay I need I need to go get diagnosed </joey>
<joey> right I need to go get checked out </joey>
<garnt> um and yeah it was thanks to trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> I guess and thanks to random Youtube </garnt>
<garnt> comments well done guys you uh you're </garnt>
<joey> like it's like the one time in the world </joey>
<joey> where you guys were actually correct </joey>
<joey> with your diagnosis you weren't just a </joey>
<garnt> bunch of like Reddit armchair </garnt>
<connor> psychologists and Wild Ones yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's in Wild diagnosis yeah I do I I </garnt>
<garnt> have as a views of trash </garnt>
<garnt> that's not an excuse to psychoanalyze </garnt>
<garnt> all of us okay a broken clock is right </garnt>
<connor> two times you know guys </connor>
<connor> I remember my uh my </connor>
<connor> I was growing up they everyone was like </connor>
<joey> convinced I'd like dyslexia yeah and </joey>
<connor> like I was like no I don't think I do </connor>
<joey> because I don't really have from reading </joey>
<joey> the word I just really [ __ ] hate </joey>
<joey> doing it right but because they would </joey>
<connor> describe the symptoms to me as like a uh </connor>
<connor> you know when I was like 10 or something </connor>
<connor> so just give some backstory to this uh I </connor>
<connor> you know I went to a Welsh school I </connor>
<connor> didn't like reading I liked gaming I was </connor>
<connor> probably my parents my parents probably </connor>
<connor> wish that nobody'd ever introduced me to </connor>
<connor> gaming yeah but I I I was introduced to </connor>
<garnt> gaming very very young right yeah </garnt>
<connor> talking like four five six I found out </connor>
<garnt> about video games yeah I became like </garnt>
<garnt> obsessed and I read the games I I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> I've said this before I beat all of one </garnt>
<joey> of the first games I ever played with </joey>
<joey> Pokemon Gold in French and I beat the </joey>
<joey> whole game in French I don't know how </joey>
<joey> even though you don't know any french </joey>
<joey> yeah this must have been literally the </joey>
<garnt> birth of me bashing my head against the </garnt>
<joey> wall to figure out yeah video games yeah </joey>
<garnt> not reading so I've been doing this </garnt>
<garnt> since like a young age not I I never </garnt>
<connor> really like read stuff I just kind of </connor>
<connor> did it this is probably like sounds very </connor>
<connor> like monkey-esque already and not you </connor>
<joey> know not very well it's very like a like </joey>
<connor> a primeval like yeah it is </connor>
<connor> so and I went to a Welsh school so I </connor>
<joey> didn't really </joey>
<joey> um read English like ever we learned </joey>
<joey> everything in Welsh I spoke in Welsh in </joey>
<joey> school so I never read English like ever </joey>
<connor> the only thing I'd ever read is like we </connor>
<garnt> go to the store I can I can read the I </garnt>
<garnt> would just read the [ __ ] right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> whatever like but like like when I would </garnt>
<garnt> be quizzed on like how to spell [ __ ] I </garnt>
<connor> like wouldn't know they'd be like spell </connor>
<connor> said I'd be like oh yeah just said Zed </connor>
<connor> in it said </connor>
<connor> yeah so when we started learning English </connor>
<joey> more and I was like yeah I just don't </joey>
<connor> don't read books ever yeah and they're </connor>
<connor> like what you didn't read books my </connor>
<joey> parents were like yeah we tried to we </joey>
<garnt> tried to break him really but he keeps </garnt>
<joey> playing those goddamn video games </joey>
<garnt> as much Pro my parents tried their </garnt>
<joey> goddamn hardest to get me to read it was </joey>
<joey> just not gonna happen like I was just I </joey>
<joey> had absolutely zero interest in it yeah </joey>
<joey> so I was so so bad at English but like </joey>
<joey> they knew I was very competent all other </joey>
<joey> subjects like I was I was very like you </joey>
<connor> know maths and Science and all that </connor>
<joey> really really high marks like I was you </joey>
<connor> know I mean I got like like a star and </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] and maths and all that so the </joey>
<joey> highest grade you can get went did </joey>
<joey> engineering all that there's no problem </joey>
<garnt> with like I wasn't like like bad at </garnt>
<joey> learning yeah it was just I just hated </joey>
<joey> this one subject right but they were </joey>
<connor> convinced they were like what what if </connor>
<connor> he's Compton and other stuff he just </connor>
<connor> must have some uh dyslexia or something </connor>
<connor> right and they would tell me what the </connor>
<connor> symptoms were yeah and it was so </connor>
<connor> annoying because a kid this is where I </connor>
<connor> started learning where adults like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> with you as a kid yeah they would like </connor>
<connor> try and spoon feed me the answers to </connor>
<joey> like set to like dyslexia right I would </joey>
<connor> like to try and tell me I had symptoms </connor>
<joey> that I didn't have until I get you to </joey>
<joey> agree to it just because they wanted to </joey>
<connor> have like that like so they can tick it </connor>
<connor> off it's like oh we've figured it out </connor>
<connor> yeah we sort them out and then whenever </connor>
<connor> I have an issues they'll be like oh </connor>
<joey> don't worry we don't have to put him </joey>
<joey> work he's just dyslexic yeah this is </joey>
<joey> where you like I get it because the </joey>
<joey> teachers they want an answer they want </joey>
<joey> to read they want a solution right they </joey>
<connor> want to know why and I can understand </connor>
<connor> everyone wants a reason why but like </connor>
<connor> unfortunately mental health and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like that and yeah and and learning is </connor>
<connor> like the most complicated [ __ ] known to </connor>
<connor> men and there is never ever just a one </connor>
<connor> solution that fits all yeah like just </connor>
<connor> because somebody sucks on something it </connor>
<joey> doesn't mean there's an inherent problem </joey>
<connor> so I would like talk to my teachers and </connor>
<joey> stuff and yeah and I remember talking to </joey>
<joey> my English teacher and she like made me </joey>
<connor> like stay after class and she talked to </connor>
<connor> me and she'd be like so you can you can </connor>
<connor> read these words right and I was like </connor>
<connor> yeah I can read them and she's like they </connor>
<joey> don't look like messed up or jumbled at </joey>
<connor> all and I was like and I was like no not </connor>
<joey> really and then she was like sometimes </joey>
<connor> the words are hard to read I'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> I don't know the word sometimes I don't </connor>
<connor> really know it so it's kind of hard to </connor>
<connor> read because English is kind of funny </connor>
<connor> and the pronunciation is weird and then </connor>
<joey> so she was like okay okay so then </joey>
<joey> another teacher came in a few weeks </joey>
<joey> later and started asked me more </joey>
<joey> questions about dyslexia and stuff and I </joey>
<joey> was like no no I I the words are not </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] jumbled okay I've seen the </joey>
<joey> movies they don't [ __ ] do that I know </joey>
<joey> that's not how it works but I'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah I I do not have a problem I can see </joey>
<joey> all the letters in order they do not </joey>
<garnt> move I know what I'm reading I am just </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] at this subject and I don't like it </joey>
<joey> because they start shaking your body </joey>
<joey> like what about now yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> it was literally like I had I'm thank </garnt>
<garnt> God I wasn't like uh I wasn't a kid they </garnt>
<joey> were just like I feel bad because like </joey>
<joey> kids are so easily like pushed into </joey>
<joey> saying yes or no yeah I'm so glad I was </joey>
<joey> a stubborn [ __ ] from like a young age </joey>
<joey> where I was like no the words are not </joey>
<connor> jumbled I don't have a problem reading </connor>
<connor> the word I just just hate this shitty </connor>
<connor> subject yeah I hate English yeah and </connor>
<garnt> they were like no no no no no you have </garnt>
<garnt> to be you have to be so you have to have </garnt>
<joey> a disability you must be you must be </joey>
<garnt> yeah I'm very glad that Iris I don't </garnt>
<joey> know where I got the stubbornness from </joey>
<connor> yeah I was like because I I remember </connor>
<joey> like I it was really annoying and they </joey>
<connor> kept insisting I had it yeah no no </connor>
<joey> I do not have this I have no problem </joey>
<joey> reading Of Mice and Men I just don't </joey>
<connor> like it I'd rather watch the movie </connor>
<joey> they're like trying to just like </joey>
<joey> brainwash you yeah okay so this is what </joey>
<joey> I'm realizing and I understand now why </joey>
<connor> like you know this whole discussion </connor>
<connor> about diagnosing kids is like yeah I get </connor>
<connor> why it's like a a touchy subject and </connor>
<connor> some parents are like my kids you can't </connor>
<connor> diagnose them and then you know some </connor>
<connor> people are so quick to jump to it it's a </connor>
<connor> really uncomfortable subject and kind of </connor>
<joey> touchy because yeah the kids often can't </joey>
<joey> like I was a kid I couldn't fully </joey>
<joey> Express that you know I can't just be </joey>
<joey> like listen I didn't really connect with </joey>
<joey> the subject I don't like it yeah they </joey>
<joey> can't fit for themselves right yeah I </joey>
<joey> can't really fully explain why I don't </joey>
<connor> want to why I don't engage with this </connor>
<connor> yeah but they you know they're just like </connor>
<joey> well they're like no we're the adults we </joey>
<connor> know more than you right yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> so it's kind of a it's weird man and I </connor>
<joey> think that's why like when you get </joey>
<joey> parents that are super passionate about </joey>
<joey> it and stuff and then there's also the </joey>
<joey> thing of like </joey>
<joey> some parents don't want to </joey>
<joey> get their kids diagnosed with things </joey>
<connor> because they don't want to like be like </connor>
<connor> my kid has a problem or has something </connor>
<connor> right my parents didn't really give a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] they were like if he's got it he's </connor>
<garnt> got it whatever yeah just deal with it </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah yeah because I I think with how </garnt>
<garnt> mental health is now it's just like it </garnt>
<connor> feels like at least it feels like if </connor>
<connor> you're diagnosed with something then </connor>
<connor> then the kind of feeling is oh there's </connor>
<joey> something wrong with me obviously yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you know there's something there's </joey>
<joey> something broken with me because like uh </joey>
<joey> like with me and ADHD for example like I </joey>
<joey> I didn't realize that I was abnormal you </joey>
<connor> know because I would have I would I </connor>
<connor> would do all these things to basically </connor>
<connor> basically be able to like seem like I </connor>
<connor> was able to function you know and I I'd </connor>
<connor> only learned recently that that was like </connor>
<connor> my coping mechanisms for like my what it </connor>
<connor> was like my how my brain works you know </connor>
<connor> yeah I'd figured out ways to live with </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> um and I thought everyone had to do that </connor>
<connor> you know that's that's just what I </connor>
<connor> thought and like especially like after </connor>
<connor> being diagnosed it hasn't like changed </connor>
<connor> my life or anything like that it's like </connor>
<connor> the biggest thing that it's done for me </connor>
<connor> is like it's just helped me understand </connor>
<connor> myself and I think that's just I think </connor>
<garnt> that's like the most valuable thing yeah </garnt>
<connor> right definitely it's just like make </connor>
<connor> sense of things that you were like why </connor>
<garnt> why am I like yeah yeah exactly because </garnt>
<garnt> it's just helped me like deal with it </garnt>
<garnt> even more because I I just remembered </garnt>
<garnt> because it wasn't it wasn't just the </garnt>
<connor> YouTube comments as well I remember </connor>
<connor> specifically seeing this one YouTube </connor>
<connor> video and that was that was like the </connor>
<connor> last straw where I was like where what </connor>
<connor> am I diagnosed no no where it was like </connor>
<connor> where it was like what ADHD feels like </connor>
<joey> and someone like someone like edited a </joey>
<joey> video of their day and like edited it in </joey>
<joey> a way to like to like show how they </joey>
<joey> perceive the world yeah how they </joey>
<connor> perceived the world and it was like such </connor>
<joey> a one for one copy of how I see the </joey>
<connor> world I was just like oh my God so like </connor>
<joey> that was like the aha moment because I </joey>
<connor> think I think that was one one scene in </connor>
<connor> particular because uh he was going about </connor>
<connor> his day and uh he was like being scolded </connor>
<connor> uh by his teacher or his mom or </connor>
<connor> something and and uh he was like </connor>
<joey> fidgeting right he was fidgeting and uh </joey>
<joey> and he would get told off for that for </joey>
<joey> him because his mom always teacher I </joey>
<joey> can't remember who was exactly but he </joey>
<joey> was just they were just like can you </joey>
<joey> concentrate please I'm trying to tell </joey>
<joey> you something serious yeah and you're </joey>
<joey> doing something else and I'm just like </joey>
<joey> and he said oh but it helps me to </joey>
<joey> concentrate and I'm just like that's </joey>
<garnt> been my entire life that's been if like </garnt>
<garnt> I need to fidget with something in order </garnt>
<garnt> to concentrate and if I don't I just </garnt>
<joey> lose like my trailer thoughts or </joey>
<joey> something right it's just like me yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I was just like holy [ __ ] maybe </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I should [ __ ] go in and get </garnt>
<joey> this so how do they because I've always </joey>
<joey> been curious like when you go see a </joey>
<joey> doctor right and you want to like you </joey>
<joey> know figure out if you are actually </joey>
<joey> diagnosed with it how does the doctor </joey>
<joey> like check that well is that like a test </joey>
<connor> it just puts like a Ruby's Cube on the </connor>
<joey> table he's like I'll be back in 15 </joey>
<joey> minutes let's </joey>
<joey> put fidget spinner </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> curious like you know how does the </joey>
<joey> doctor like kind of determine whether </joey>
<joey> you actually have ADHD or if it's just </joey>
<joey> like something similar to that that's </joey>
<garnt> not necessarily ADHD right yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> uh at the moment I'm at like I'm still </garnt>
<garnt> like processing and learning and </garnt>
<joey> learning through it because at the </joey>
<joey> moment at the beginning they uh take you </joey>
<joey> when they do like this uh this just uh </joey>
<joey> it's it's a survey at first so it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like the first test </joey>
<connor> um but then afterwards if you tick </connor>
<joey> enough boxes to be like okay there's </joey>
<connor> there's you know there's there's a </connor>
<connor> chance then you go into the psychologist </connor>
<connor> and you know they ask you like a bunch </connor>
<connor> of questions for me at least I don't </connor>
<connor> know because like uh another friend in </connor>
<connor> England just recently got diagnosed with </connor>
<connor> ADHD as well and I think in England they </connor>
<connor> have a different kind of process yeah </connor>
<connor> yes I think it's different to every </connor>
<joey> country uh in England I believe there's </joey>
<garnt> like a you have to go to like a group </garnt>
<joey> session as well or something like that </joey>
<garnt> it's different in every country but for </garnt>
<joey> me it was more just a one-on-one talk </joey>
<joey> with uh with my you know with the </joey>
<joey> psychology psychologist where they just </joey>
<joey> ask me like very detailed questions </joey>
<joey> about my experiences how I perceive </joey>
<connor> events and like I can't remember </connor>
<connor> everything because there was like a lot </connor>
<connor> of [ __ ] questions yeah it was kind of </connor>
<connor> it was basically like a therapy session </connor>
<connor> where she's like so so tell me about </connor>
<connor> this week talking about this tell me </connor>
<connor> about that </connor>
<connor> um and yeah I mean uh ever since being </connor>
<joey> diagnosed I've like like I said my life </joey>
<joey> hasn't changed that much I just know now </joey>
<connor> it's like written in paper that's uh </connor>
<connor> no no I I I got the plaque of just like </connor>
<connor> his </connor>
<connor> how your brain works and here's why you </connor>
<connor> your brain does this [ __ ] yeah and like </connor>
<connor> ever since known that I'm like ah that </connor>
<joey> makes sense now I have like a word to </joey>
<connor> put to how I felt for a lot of My Life </connor>
<joey> um and yeah that's it like like that's </joey>
<joey> the thing I feel a lot of people uh a </joey>
<joey> lot of people maybe have you know maybe </joey>
<joey> have different different conditions or </joey>
<joey> different mental conditions that they've </joey>
<joey> just never really thought about because </joey>
<joey> Like Me Maybe you found a way to cope </joey>
<joey> with it day to day you know because Like </joey>
<joey> Me Maybe you thought that hey maybe </joey>
<joey> everyone's like this and you've just </joey>
<joey> found a way to live normally because uh </joey>
<joey> because you've grown up uh you've grown </joey>
<joey> up in an environment where you just need </joey>
<joey> to like just get on with it basically </joey>
<joey> and a lot of a lot of the times like not </joey>
<connor> every mental condition is just like on </connor>
<connor> the extreme end sometimes it's like </connor>
<connor> really really subtle yeah but if you've </connor>
<connor> ever like had a thought that maybe maybe </connor>
<connor> I do have this or maybe I do have that I </connor>
<connor> think it might be worth just talking to </connor>
<connor> someone not like not to like have a like </connor>
<garnt> a life-changing aha moment but just </garnt>
<garnt> learning more about yourself I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> is the most valuable thing that someone </garnt>
<garnt> can someone can do yeah and uh doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> mean that doesn't mean that there's </garnt>
<garnt> necessarily anything wrong with you you </garnt>
<connor> know I think people more people would </connor>
<connor> probably go if it was like easier to get </connor>
<garnt> seen yeah yeah definitely most </garnt>
<garnt> definitely right it's like yeah yeah got </garnt>
<garnt> to be either rich or have a lot of time </garnt>
<joey> on your hands yeah or both or both yeah </joey>
<garnt> to get anything done Health Care wise or </garnt>
<joey> mental health-wise I don't know I know </joey>
<connor> in the UK it's not too great I know </connor>
<connor> they're like yeah trying to get better </connor>
<connor> at it but I know it's not adequate yeah </connor>
<garnt> in the UK it's like the waiting list is </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] this [ __ ] like huge yeah </connor>
<joey> no kidding yeah because </joey>
<joey> um yeah because I feel like the biggest </joey>
<joey> problem especially like everywhere but </joey>
<connor> America I can see is like the access to </connor>
<connor> Mental Health Care is it's difficult to </connor>
<garnt> sell especially in Asia in Japan dude </garnt>
<joey> it's like oh my God it's half the time </joey>
<connor> it's just like non-existent yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> mental health in Japan is the easy car </connor>
<joey> there is no </joey>
<connor> it's like go to the pub it could be a </connor>
<joey> don't think about it I know why you're </joey>
<joey> sad it's because you're not drunk right </joey>
<connor> now go to an Izakaya have a couple of </connor>
<connor> beers you'll be all right and then it's </connor>
<connor> just no I was like I I was walking home </connor>
<connor> and I saw a guy just like on the floor </connor>
<connor> just crying in in Tokyo and I was like </connor>
<connor> why is like no one no one helping him </connor>
<connor> like loads of people just walking past </connor>
<connor> him like why is no one saying like hey </connor>
<joey> are you okay this is so weird to me I </joey>
<connor> was like what people are just like man I </connor>
<connor> wanna don't wanna get involved yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> they don't they don't that's the thing </joey>
<connor> they see because you know again </connor>
<connor> collectivist Society they see one you </connor>
<connor> know uh Cog that's out of the system and </connor>
<connor> they're like well that's not our problem </connor>
<connor> we just gotta keep the call we're just </connor>
<connor> gonna keep the system moving well the UK </connor>
<connor> isn't great but I think at least where I </connor>
<connor> was from if someone was like crying in </connor>
<connor> the street like everyone would be like </connor>
<joey> you okay oh yeah yeah I think I'd say </joey>
<joey> most English-speaking countries they'll </joey>
<connor> definitely be at least a couple people </connor>
<joey> be like hey you know yeah all right dude </joey>
<garnt> what's up yeah at least like someone </garnt>
<garnt> checking on them yeah exactly and you </garnt>
<connor> know not to say that Japan isn't you </connor>
<connor> know the [ __ ] Mistress of the world </connor>
<connor> in that sense right like there's </connor>
<joey> definitely people I've seen people you </joey>
<connor> know go up to strangers </connor>
<connor> I wanted to help but I was like I don't </connor>
<joey> want this to be an awkward language </joey>
<connor> barrier situation where you actually </connor>
<joey> need help and I I'm just like oh hi you </joey>
<joey> know yeah I felt so sad about that I </joey>
<joey> couldn't do anything to help this dude </joey>
<garnt> because I was like I don't I don't know </garnt>
<joey> just imagining what situations he could </joey>
<garnt> be going through maybe so [ __ ] sad I </garnt>
<joey> was like what if what if his parents </joey>
<connor> like just said he couldn't go home or </connor>
<garnt> something I don't know I was like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah man yeah I just wanted to add an </garnt>
<connor> addendum to what I said uh if you do </connor>
<connor> like I I think a big issue nowadays is </connor>
<connor> as well is like there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> self-diagnosis yeah like especially I've </joey>
<joey> seen it on Tick Tock it's the internet </joey>
<connor> doctors like like they're like I've read </connor>
<garnt> one Google article I am like I you know </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I got this ADHD or I'm like </garnt>
<connor> well it's almost like the uh what's the </connor>
<connor> word the like collection of uh you know </connor>
<joey> people kind of I mean so you will but </joey>
<joey> online they kind of see it's like a </joey>
<joey> badge of honor yeah oh yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah people do they're like I'm if I </joey>
<connor> have XX thing and I have it in my bio </connor>
<joey> I'm like yeah or you're like immune to </joey>
<joey> like sometimes like being an [ __ ] or </joey>
<connor> something yeah yeah like it's just like </connor>
<joey> it's I don't know I I it sucks because </joey>
<connor> you don't want to be like man people are </connor>
<connor> faking it but it's like how are people </connor>
<connor> faking it I never see it as like a badge </connor>
<connor> of honor in a way yeah what and even and </connor>
<joey> you know even if you be proud about it </joey>
<connor> you can be proud about it and be open </connor>
<joey> about it yeah exactly is it like don't </joey>
<joey> be a dick about it you're </joey>
<joey> self-diagnosing so that you can then go </joey>
<garnt> and brag about it online and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but people actually have to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] yeah yeah I know right </garnt>
<garnt> actually it's I mean that whole argument </garnt>
<garnt> comes into like well we couldn't afford </garnt>
<garnt> to go to a doctor and get actual </garnt>
<garnt> diagnosis and it's like yeah but you </garnt>
<garnt> probably you still should never diagnose </garnt>
<connor> I don't think anyone ever would </connor>
<joey> recommend you self-diagnose no no no </joey>
<garnt> especially you'll be completely wrong </garnt>
<garnt> especially if something as delicate and </garnt>
<joey> as complicated as mental health like you </joey>
<garnt> like like I said the mind is a </garnt>
<connor> complicated thing and people do weird </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] A lot of the times and uh you can </connor>
<garnt> you can never know unless you really see </garnt>
<garnt> like an expert you know and then it also </garnt>
<connor> sucks as well because then you see an </connor>
<connor> expert maybe the expert was a [ __ ] of </connor>
<garnt> this job or something you know so </garnt>
<connor> there's always this like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> Minefield yeah yeah like counter </garnt>
<garnt> arguments have you ever like had a bad </garnt>
<garnt> experience with like a doctor or </garnt>
<connor> anything like that yeah I've had doctors </connor>
<connor> where I'm like yo this thing is actually </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] hurting me and then he's </connor>
<connor> like oh no it's good </connor>
<connor> I'm like some bad severe pains like no </connor>
<connor> you're good and then another doctor's </connor>
<connor> like oh holy [ __ ] man you gotta this is </connor>
<connor> like you gotta sort this out I've got a </connor>
<joey> lot of instances where I go to like a </joey>
<connor> local doctor like a local GM and they'll </connor>
<connor> be like I'll refer you to a bigger </connor>
<connor> Hospital yeah after looking at it for </connor>
<connor> like two seconds and then you go to the </connor>
<connor> bigger hospital and they're like oh </connor>
<connor> here's some drugs you can get anywhere </connor>
<joey> I'm like why did the guy at the local GM </joey>
<joey> not do that instead of [ __ ] wasting </joey>
<joey> my time taking me to another bigger </joey>
<joey> hospital that's way further away yeah to </joey>
<joey> do the exact same job that he could have </joey>
<joey> done yeah you know it's only the only </joey>
<garnt> one I've had yeah because especially me </garnt>
<garnt> like right now I'm like I think my </garnt>
<connor> biggest 30s like Health thing that I've </connor>
<connor> that I've found so much is like my jaw </connor>
<connor> my jaw issue and so I've been like </connor>
<connor> trying to get someone I've been trying </connor>
<connor> to find an expert to help me sort it out </connor>
<connor> so you know I go to uh I go to the </connor>
<connor> dentist to try and like try and find out </connor>
<connor> what's wrong with my jaw right and so </connor>
<connor> like I mean I remember the first time </connor>
<connor> I've tried to get it sorted out was uh I </connor>
<connor> remember I went to like several dentists </connor>
<connor> in the UK and uh one of them said oh do </connor>
<connor> you still have your wisdom teeth and </connor>
<connor> they were like and I was like yeah I </connor>
<connor> still have my wisdom teeth but like </connor>
<connor> they're not like the spacing in it isn't </connor>
<connor> like it isn't bad or anything it's not </connor>
<joey> like hurting me or anything like that </joey>
<joey> and they're like yeah we recommend you </joey>
<joey> get that uh we recommend you get that </joey>
<joey> taken out I was like okay do I that's a </joey>
<joey> that's a big commitment you know yeah </joey>
<joey> because you know at the time I was still </joey>
<garnt> a YouTuber </garnt>
<connor> um so you know talk yeah you can't you </connor>
<joey> can't you can't talk you can't talk so I </joey>
<connor> like I wanted to make sure that I needed </connor>
<connor> to go through this procedure uh so I </connor>
<connor> went to a second dentist for a second </connor>
<connor> opinion and he was like no definitely </connor>
<connor> don't take your wisdom teeth out that's </connor>
<connor> not the issue </connor>
<connor> um here have this mouth guard and I was </connor>
<connor> like okay he gave me the mouth but I </connor>
<connor> didn't like improved it a little bit but </connor>
<connor> I like the problems still persisted so </connor>
<connor> uh uh he K I went back to him and he's </connor>
<connor> like yeah honestly uh maybe you need uh </connor>
<connor> braces or something uh that's gonna cost </connor>
<connor> like 30 000 pounds or something I was </connor>
<joey> like okay </joey>
<joey> okay let's uh if let's let's be sure I </joey>
<joey> need to go through this and I guess so </joey>
<joey> like at this point I'd move to Japan </joey>
<joey> yeah right and then come to come to </joey>
<joey> Japan go do the same thing go to the </joey>
<joey> dentist and they were like you don't </joey>
<joey> need to take your wisdom teeth out but </joey>
<joey> maybe just take the top wisdom teeth out </joey>
<joey> I'm just like I'm getting like a dude </joey>
<joey> like every dentist I've gone to so far </joey>
<joey> has given me a different opinion about </joey>
<joey> what needs to be done so I'm like who do </joey>
<joey> I listen to yeah another one and it's </joey>
<joey> like so you only need to remove half </joey>
<joey> your wisdom teeth just like the top half </joey>
<garnt> just like shave it off yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> just shave the tall fall you'll be all </joey>
<joey> right yeah I'm just lying it's it's so </joey>
<joey> like I I want to get it fixed but I just </joey>
<joey> it's it's scary because whatever I go </joey>
<garnt> through it's a big commitment obviously </garnt>
<garnt> in time and cost and it's it's my body I </garnt>
<garnt> want to make sure it's done right </garnt>
<garnt> um at the same time everyone know </garnt>
<garnt> everyone I say everyone I meet is </garnt>
<garnt> telling me different things so I have I </garnt>
<garnt> have no [ __ ] clue who to listen to </garnt>
<connor> basically I got like tonsil I just like </connor>
<garnt> I used to get it like every year right </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like just remove your </garnt>
<garnt> tonsils and I was like </garnt>
<joey> God because I said they say there's a </joey>
<connor> chance it can like affect your voice </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah and I was like I'd rather just </joey>
<joey> be sick once a year and that's like a </joey>
<connor> lot of pain well you haven't had it in a </connor>
<connor> while though right no luckily I haven't </connor>
<connor> had it in a while I don't think I've had </connor>
<joey> it in Japan yeah exactly but I used to </joey>
<connor> get it like every year right yeah it's a </connor>
<connor> pain in the ass I still want my voice to </connor>
<joey> change so I was like I like my voice </joey>
<connor> right now it's kind of important to my </connor>
<joey> job yeah yeah what if I change it </joey>
<joey> although they say like you have a chance </joey>
<joey> that the voice will change but it's not </joey>
<connor> like you're gonna be like hey guys </connor>
<connor> I'm just like I have learned how to use </connor>
<joey> my voice yeah for like voice acting like </joey>
<joey> I I guess you're gonna like relearn it I </joey>
<joey> don't know how it would feel I I don't </joey>
<joey> they they just told me there's a chance </joey>
<joey> it could change slightly </joey>
<joey> for me it's just not worth it I was like </joey>
<connor> I'll just be sick every now and then </connor>
<joey> yeah I'll take the sickness plus light </joey>
<joey> isn't real it's not an illness it's a </joey>
<garnt> mindset </garnt>
<connor> that's a lifestyle </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah no I still have my I still </garnt>
<garnt> have mine oh dude when you get it </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] Hood have you ever had it yeah </connor>

<connor> in it yeah that's how I imagine your </connor>
<joey> throat looks like yeah it's horrible </joey>
<connor> it's so gross that sounds gross yeah </connor>
<connor> that's not that bad it's just your voice </connor>
<joey> how do you get it you just like it's </joey>

<joey> yeah hopefully it'll uh still be the </joey>
<joey> same old podcast let's press the fresh </joey>
<garnt> air yeah because because like we've had </garnt>
<garnt> we've had so many guests that we've </garnt>

<joey> years of just constantly waiting and </joey>
<joey> waiting maybe it's gonna come maybe and </joey>
<joey> then now that we can fly out and maybe </joey>
<joey> like we are we are just basically it's </joey>
<joey> the floodgates just opening right and </joey>
<garnt> it's just everyone coming on at once </garnt>
<garnt> because it's everyone that we've wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to come on and we've talked to before </garnt>
<garnt> about wanting to come on uh all coming </garnt>
<garnt> on at once so we're excited uh and it's </garnt>
<connor> going to be a lot of fun I hope yeah I </connor>

<garnt> not just going to be uh filming yes </garnt>
<garnt> episodes we're going to be filming some </garnt>
<joey> specials as well you're gonna have like </joey>
<joey> your first Trash taste specials abroad </joey>
<joey> as well we're not gonna spoil what those </joey>
<connor> specials are yeah but uh yeah we have to </connor>
<garnt> be good yeah yeah yeah we have we have a </garnt>
<connor> lot planned for trash taste yeah in the </connor>
<connor> coming months if you miss just us I'm </connor>
<joey> sure there'll be some episodes sprinkled </joey>
<joey> in there that are just the three of us </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah definitely yeah I know there's </joey>
<joey> a good uh a vocal Bunch on the summer </joey>
<joey> love the just us three episodes yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah and I guess they're so used to it </connor>
<joey> now so yeah especially it's such like an </joey>
<joey> interesting divide though right because </joey>
<joey> it's like you know in my head it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah the [ __ ] guest episodes are like </joey>
<joey> awesome because it's like a new person </joey>
<joey> New Perspective yeah whatever new topics </joey>
<garnt> to talk about right but then there are a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of people who just like who like you </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> who this who this man I think we try to </connor>
<connor> make the guest episodes so even if you </connor>
<connor> don't know the guest you can kind of </connor>
<joey> they can come on right yeah I mean we've </joey>
<joey> had what three guest episodes before </joey>
<connor> this one right yeah so you know our </connor>
<connor> guest episodes aren't as personal so I </connor>
<garnt> understand that people might not enjoy </garnt>
<garnt> them as much if that if that's what they </garnt>
<garnt> like most about trash taste yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's obviously we can't go into a </garnt>
<garnt> lot about how we feel about things and </garnt>
<garnt> our own life because it's like oh we're </garnt>
<garnt> trying to make sure the vibe is good and </garnt>
<joey> the guest can can Vibe yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<garnt> well that's why we decided to just have </garnt>
<garnt> it the three of us when we started right </garnt>
<garnt> because of the light if we put a fourth </garnt>
<garnt> person in there not a whole lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> deep conversations yeah happening you </garnt>
<joey> know there's gonna be like two it's </joey>
<garnt> gonna be two on the surface I mean we're </garnt>
<garnt> clowns but we some sometimes we uh want </garnt>
<joey> to not be clowns and just want to chill </joey>
<joey> and Vibe you know yeah surviving bro </joey>
<joey> just vibing sure we're clowns but we </joey>
<connor> also Vibe because as clowns as well </connor>
<joey> that's a clown Vibe </joey>
<connor> so I'm sure you'll be a fun fun America </connor>

<joey> and I'm sure I'll gain well a lot of fun </joey>
<connor> UK stories as well yeah I'm sure God I'm </connor>
<garnt> not looking forward to gaining weight </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I've been trying I've been trying </garnt>
<connor> my [ __ ] hardest to not gain weight </connor>
<connor> before like obviously my wedding as well </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's it's really hard whenever </connor>
<joey> you travel out because one of the </joey>
<joey> hardest things is keeping to a schedule </joey>
<joey> right or getting to habits and like when </joey>
<joey> you're living in the same place and you </joey>
<joey> like build this habit you know you you </joey>
<joey> can stay on this habit and it's so much </joey>
<joey> easier but when you when there's like </joey>
<joey> even like a slight change in environment </joey>
<joey> or something you know </joey>
<joey> um it's so easy for just like one one </joey>
<joey> Domino to fall over and like everything </joey>
<joey> just Falls over oh yeah and you just </joey>
<garnt> like slip into like the complete </garnt>
<connor> opposite lifestyle of what you had I'm </connor>
<connor> trying my best to stay healthy right now </connor>
<connor> I've been like going to gym like every </connor>
<joey> day yeah just like working out because </joey>
<joey> I'm like I need I need to be healthy </joey>
<joey> before I go out there couldn't be me </joey>
<joey> I don't know I also want to get in cheap </joey>
<joey> as well so yeah I mean I feel more </joey>
<connor> energized when I've worked out yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> so I feel like I need that yeah I kind </joey>
<joey> of like the exercise bike every now and </joey>
<joey> then still like at home because we </joey>
<joey> bought one quite a while ago so like </joey>
<joey> whenever I have time I do that but like </joey>
<joey> yeah I don't know like again like I was </joey>
<joey> going to the gym for a while and then </joey>
<joey> just that one trip out for like a week </joey>
<joey> just completely throws everything out </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you know and then you </joey>
<garnt> come back and you're like oh [ __ ] now I </garnt>
<garnt> gotta start from the scratch again you </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah and you're just like not </garnt>
<joey> motivated at all yeah and that's just </joey>
<connor> like it's just a complete like habit </connor>
<connor> killer I don't know I'm kind of picky </connor>
<connor> like if the because some hotels are like </connor>
<connor> we have a gym yeah and you rock up to </connor>
<connor> this gym and it is literally like a </connor>
<connor> treadmill from the 80s that like is is </connor>
<connor> just so [ __ ] yeah and you're like well </connor>
<connor> okay I mean I guess I'll do that and </connor>
<connor> they got like no weights or anything you </connor>
<connor> know yeah okay all right I guess I'll </connor>
<connor> just run and then you just like okay and </connor>
<connor> then you go to the next place and </connor>
<connor> they're like we have a gym oh gyms </connor>
<connor> closed or something like it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's so hard to like can stay consistent </connor>
<connor> working out when you're traveling and </connor>
<joey> stuff that's definitely impossible I </joey>
<joey> didn't even try to pretend to try and </joey>
<connor> keep up I remember when I was going to </connor>
<joey> the gym crazy like when I lost the </joey>
<joey> majority of my weight like before I came </joey>
<joey> to Japan I was doing it while I was </joey>
<joey> going to the conventions and it's so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hard yeah waking up in the </joey>
<joey> morning before a convention and going to </joey>
<joey> the gym yeah oh my God it was so hard oh </joey>
<connor> my God and also bringing your Gym gear </connor>
<garnt> with you yeah oh it's a pain in the ass </garnt>
<garnt> just bring your 75 dumbbells man yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's all you need man that's all you </garnt>
<garnt> need you don't realize right in your </garnt>
<garnt> suitcase shoes take up a lot of room oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah shoes are a painless and then also </garnt>
<garnt> shoes get dirty so I want to kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like cover them up yeah just like pain </garnt>
<joey> in the ass and you've got to bring gym </joey>
<connor> clothes which you're not gonna wear any </connor>
<garnt> other time okay any other time like I </garnt>
<garnt> remember before when I used to travel </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be like I'd have to use like the </garnt>
<garnt> weight limit to its [ __ ] maximum </garnt>
<garnt> right of course like like you'd have to </garnt>
<garnt> pack as much as you can and if you if </garnt>
<garnt> you don't then you could squeeze in more </garnt>
<garnt> there but now like I want to pack as </garnt>
<garnt> light as possible right and like shoes </garnt>
<garnt> are the most like annoying things right </garnt>
<joey> it's so annoying they're like because </joey>
<joey> they're light but they take up the most </joey>
<garnt> space what the thing is are they light </garnt>
<garnt> some sometimes shoes aren't like I mean </garnt>
<joey> if they're packing like boots like yeah </joey>
<garnt> you're back in like [ __ ] Doc Martens </garnt>
<joey> then yeah like I need like separate </joey>
<garnt> luggages because because like here's the </garnt>
<garnt> thing like you normally pack extra pairs </garnt>
<connor> of shoes with you </connor>
<connor> the everyday shoes yeah nice shoes yeah </connor>
<joey> it depends where I'm going right </joey>
<garnt> sometimes like if I'm going to like say </garnt>
<garnt> like a completely different like if I'm </garnt>
<garnt> going somewhere that's like really </garnt>
<garnt> summery and beachy then yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> I'll take like a couple of like </garnt>
<garnt> flip-flops </garnt>
<garnt> they aren't shoes but like you know if </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going somewhere and I know I need to </garnt>
<joey> go to like a fancy dinner or something </joey>
<garnt> then you know I'll bring some like dress </garnt>
<garnt> shoes yeah yeah that's and and they are </garnt>
<garnt> just like the most fiddliest things </garnt>
<joey> trying to [ __ ] fit in your in your </joey>
<joey> life but if I just need like a pair of </joey>
<joey> sneakers then I'm just taking the one </joey>
<garnt> pair of sneakers yeah yeah like how many </garnt>
<connor> jeans do you bring How many pairs of </connor>
<joey> trousers do you bring oh one pouches </joey>
<joey> yeah because yeah one pair of jeans </joey>

<garnt> 10 t-shirts five hoodies or whatever and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like do I need an extra pair of </garnt>
<garnt> jeans sometimes the answer is no you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> sure there's people going around asking </garnt>
<connor> people how much underwear they brought </connor>
<joey> for like a five-day trip right and I was </joey>

<garnt> like maybe I need that extra pair of </garnt>
<garnt> underwear maybe I'll [ __ ] it's not </garnt>
<garnt> underwear it's socks How many pairs of </garnt>
<joey> socks do you bring oh I always bring </joey>
<joey> extra socks wait why because you know </joey>
<joey> you might run into an instance where </joey>
<joey> like say wherever you are is raining for </joey>
<joey> instance right your socks get wet you </joey>
<joey> don't want to wear those wet socks for </joey>
<connor> the rest of the day okay I'm doing my </connor>
<joey> underwear all right okay underwear for </joey>
<joey> me if it's a five day trip I'm bringing </joey>
<joey> Max six how much you guys bringing how </joey>
<connor> much you guys bringing your five-day </connor>
<joey> trips </joey>
<joey> six right yeah six socks underwear </joey>
<garnt> underwear How many pairs </garnt>
<garnt> like like like for me the amount of </garnt>
<garnt> socks in the amount of underwear you </garnt>
<garnt> bring should be equal right yes yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> your face was just like yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah on this video people are like eight </connor>
<joey> nine ten eleven and then like three </joey>
<joey> yeah like one yeah whoa but like eight </joey>
<joey> what is happening are you bringing eight </joey>
<garnt> pairs of under what has happened like </garnt>
<garnt> double up right like I'm I'm sorry like </garnt>
<garnt> unless like when you're working out it's </garnt>
<garnt> a different story right because you're </garnt>
<connor> playing the workout I get it because I </connor>
<garnt> when I work out I'm running through </garnt>
<connor> socks and underwear yeah yeah of course </connor>
<connor> I'm I'm not re-wearing that underwear </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it starts because she's </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] I only got half a day out of </connor>
<connor> this underwear yeah I [ __ ] wash it </connor>
<connor> yeah it kind of sucks you know but like </connor>
<connor> if you're if you're just going on a trip </connor>
<connor> why do you need more than five pairs </connor>
<garnt> does it make any sense it also depends </garnt>
<garnt> on the climate because if you're going </garnt>
<garnt> to like especially like a Southeast </garnt>
<joey> Asian country you are sweating through </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] underwear man </joey>
<joey> you're taking like four showers a day </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah the swamp ass man is just like </connor>
<connor> it's on another level you need you need </connor>
<garnt> those extra pairs of underwear man but </garnt>
<connor> like this is like in America yeah I </connor>
<connor> think there's a single place in America </connor>
<connor> we need more than five pairs of </connor>
<joey> underwear I guess unless you're going on </joey>
<joey> like a five-day trip to like Death </joey>
<connor> Valley you know maybe like I just think </connor>
<garnt> that like you know whatever and I've </garnt>
<garnt> been trying to like you know like I said </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to minimize but also yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah did you ever try and uh do anything </garnt>
<garnt> sneaky with your suitcase to the airport </garnt>
<garnt> you would try to like get past the </garnt>
<connor> weight limit how so uh </connor>
<connor> one time I don't know which airport it </connor>
<connor> was in the the thing where the suitcase </connor>
<connor> was yeah there was no other staff to </connor>
<garnt> this side yeah it was just the person </garnt>
<garnt> there behind the desk yeah and uh I had </garnt>
<garnt> the suitcase just like the suitcase I </garnt>
<garnt> had was kind of like uh the wheels were </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like not centered not on the </garnt>
<garnt> edge but like kind of sent going towards </garnt>
<garnt> the center so the edge was leaning off </garnt>
<connor> yeah and so I'll just do that thing </connor>
<connor> where you just like put your foot and </connor>
<connor> just like slightly lift it up to like </connor>
<connor> get a kilogram or two off and then just </connor>
<connor> hold it like like some kind of nen user </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you've got to have the </connor>
<joey> conversation while just slightly holding </joey>
<joey> it because it was it was going to go </joey>
<connor> over yeah I knew it was over because on </connor>
<garnt> the way there it was over yeah on the </garnt>
<garnt> way back how much was it like five </garnt>
<garnt> kilograms okay so you're not getting </garnt>
<garnt> away with that so I no I did huh I got </garnt>
<garnt> it down to like it was just 20 kg limit </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah it was going to like 24 25. </garnt>
<garnt> yeah who are you flying with mostly </garnt>
<garnt> Airlines have 20 kg on one bag limit </garnt>
<joey> it's another 23 normally 20 I actually </joey>
<joey> depends on the airline </joey>
<joey> sometimes yeah something 15 as well okay </joey>
<joey> so I I was like I I need to show you </joey>
<connor> five off this bad boy right now and it </connor>
<connor> was solar cars dude it was so hard </connor>
<connor> because I'm like I'm like on the desk </connor>
<garnt> like this trying to get my documents and </garnt>
<connor> I'm like I'm like my foot is like steel </connor>
<garnt> right yeah like lifting it up but you've </garnt>
<connor> got to keep it even because if it's </connor>
<connor> wobbling they know what you're doing </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but like what I figure like </connor>
<connor> what are they gonna do they're gonna </connor>
<connor> kick me off the plane if they find out </connor>
<joey> I'm doing it it just reminds me of like </joey>
<connor> you know in JoJo where they put the </connor>
<joey> chocolate under the water right so I </joey>
<joey> changed the level of it while you're </joey>
<connor> just having a conversation because it's </connor>
<connor> like I've been [ __ ] with you this in </connor>
<joey> times you because I had to pay the fee </joey>
<joey> on the way back yeah I have any other </joey>
<joey> way of taking it they charged me like 70 </joey>
<joey> or something yeah the flight was like </joey>
<joey> 300 yeah I was broke yeah yeah I </joey>
<connor> couldn't afford 70. so I was like I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do this bro yeah it was like a </connor>
<connor> JoJo like fight there I was like holding </connor>
<connor> it up with my like left foot yeah on the </connor>
<joey> desk doing my passport getting the </joey>
<joey> ticket it was like no need </joey>
<connor> put it on and when I put it on I just </connor>
<garnt> kept talking to her yeah it seemed like </garnt>
<joey> nothing was I wasn't that close to it </joey>
<joey> either but like this she because the </joey>
<joey> desk was really tall yeah and there was </joey>
<joey> no one else </joey>
<joey> there's no one behind me and I'm scared </joey>
<connor> that someone would call me out but no </connor>
<joey> one did so yeah it all worked nicely so </joey>
<joey> if there was someone behind you they </joey>
<connor> would have just been like damn yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> I I if somebody called me yeah I'd have </joey>
<joey> been like what is wrong with you yeah </joey>
<joey> let me you are you you want to be [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> over by them too come on but one time I </connor>
<connor> will say uh when I was moving to Japan </connor>
<garnt> and I had like three suitcases the woman </garnt>
<garnt> was like my suitcases were like way over </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because I had like my computer </garnt>
<joey> gearing yeah so it was like it was like </joey>
<joey> 10 15 kg over yeah and she just like </joey>
<joey> looked at me and I was like I must look </joey>
<joey> really sad because I was like I was like </joey>
<garnt> I'm moving and she's like </garnt>
<connor> all right I won't tell anyone don't you </connor>
<joey> just let it off sometimes I love when </joey>
<garnt> they do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> because like they're so hard so because </garnt>
<garnt> like here's the thing like I I've had to </garnt>
<garnt> like do similar things but I tried to </garnt>
<connor> prepare as much as possible yeah before </connor>
<connor> I go again so you you weigh it and </connor>
<connor> you're just like how much how much can </connor>
<connor> you like physically bring on a carry-on </connor>
<connor> okay right like you push that to the </connor>
<connor> Limit because you have you have a </connor>
<garnt> carry-on and then sometimes you can have </garnt>
<garnt> like a bag which is not too big or it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't look too big you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> but like you you push the limits about </garnt>
<joey> how much you can have on a carry-on and </joey>
<connor> a personal personal item is that's what </connor>
<joey> it's called right yeah right so you you </joey>
<connor> have to spread things as equally as </connor>
<connor> possible and I noticed like the magic </connor>
<connor> number is between like 0.5 and 1 </connor>
<joey> kilograms right if it's between if it's </joey>
<joey> over by like less than like one kilogram </joey>
<joey> or just like like I've met airlines that </joey>
<joey> is like if it's exactly one kilogram </joey>
<joey> they will charge you but if it's like </joey>
<garnt> 0.9 they're just like we'll let it go </garnt>
<connor> we'll let it go the the the 0.1 </connor>
<joey> kilograms makes a big difference I I </joey>
<joey> that just reminded me of like the time </joey>
<joey> when I got stranded in Canada right one </joey>
<joey> time because I lost my passport right so </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I've told this story in </joey>
<joey> trash days but like like yeah like this </joey>
<joey> is like five six years ago I went I went </joey>
<joey> to uh I went to a con in Montreal and uh </joey>
<garnt> and you know I was like hanging out with </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of mates or whatever and then I </garnt>
<garnt> was flying back to Australia but I had </garnt>
<garnt> to stop buying Toronto first so I was </garnt>
<garnt> like Montreal to Toronto and then </garnt>
<garnt> Toronto back to Sydney right so then I </garnt>
<connor> got to Montreal Airport and I was like I </connor>
<connor> can't find my [ __ ] passport </connor>
<connor> and you know this is the first time ever </connor>
<joey> I've lost my passport let alone overseas </joey>
<joey> right yeah which is [ __ ] terrifying </joey>
<joey> yeah I find out later that my friend who </joey>
<joey> was with me at the con the entire time </joey>
<garnt> I'd accidentally put my passport in his </garnt>
<garnt> bag and he had already flown home back </garnt>
<garnt> to like I think he lives in like San </garnt>
<garnt> Jose or something right so he was </garnt>
<garnt> already in America with my passport in </garnt>
<garnt> his bag man and so I got to Montreal </garnt>
<garnt> Airport that's like nightmare it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was a [ __ ] nightmare I forgot to cry </garnt>
<connor> yeah like and like I got to Montreal </connor>
<connor> Airport I told them the situation they </connor>
<joey> were like all right what you can do is </joey>
<joey> that there's an Australian Embassy in </joey>
<connor> Toronto anyway yeah so just we'll let </connor>
<joey> you fly to Toronto at least but then you </joey>
<connor> we're gonna have to but then you're </connor>
<connor> gonna have to find a hotel go to the </connor>
<joey> Embassy get a new passport right right </joey>
<joey> so you know I'm [ __ ] freaking out </joey>
<joey> right so I fly to Toronto get put in a </joey>
<joey> hotel </joey>
<joey> and then my friend who had the possible </joey>
<joey> was like I can try and like email like </joey>
<joey> not email email </joey>
<joey> I can try it I can try and this like </joey>
<connor> send this to you like mail it to you </connor>
<joey> right through like FedEx whatever but </joey>
<connor> like I don't know how long it's gonna </connor>
<connor> take right not to mention it's </connor>
<joey> technically in a different country yeah </joey>

<connor> days what the [ __ ] are they doing I </connor>
<connor> don't know checking it was legitimate or </connor>
<connor> something like no illegal activities </connor>

<connor> [ __ ] depressed because like I'm stuck </connor>
<connor> in this area in this hotel in the middle </connor>
<connor> of Toronto I don't know anyone who lives </connor>
<connor> there right yeah I wake up in the </connor>

<joey> ergonomic keyboard no I didn't </joey>
<garnt> I was like 75 </garnt>

<connor> Airport to like change my flight right </connor>
<connor> like hey I've lost my passport I don't </connor>
<connor> know what to do and it was like this </connor>

<joey> situation we can change your flight for </joey>
<joey> free if you fly tomorrow right and you </joey>
<joey> know I didn't know when this package was </joey>

<joey> okay yeah sure let's do that yeah you </joey>
<joey> know just so I don't get my flight </joey>
<joey> completely canceled yeah of course next </joey>
<joey> day happens it doesn't arrive yeah so </joey>
<joey> then the next day I had to go back to </joey>
<joey> Toronto Airport and the same woman was </joey>
<joey> there right and she was like okay if you </joey>
<joey> want to change it to like two or three </joey>
<joey> days later which is the next available </joey>
<joey> flight it's gonna cost you like you know </joey>
<joey> a couple of thousand dollars yeah right </joey>
<joey> and at the time you know because I'd </joey>
<joey> only just started doing YouTube I didn't </joey>
<joey> have that kind of money you know I was </joey>
<joey> still living off [ __ ] scraps yeah for </joey>
<joey> YouTube ad rev and Saul was like and you </joey>

<joey> already like I was on the verge of tears </joey>
<connor> and just being like </connor>
<connor> I I was just like I don't have that kind </connor>
<connor> of money right now and I was like what </connor>
<connor> do I do should I call my mom but it's </connor>
<connor> like three in the morning in Australia </connor>
<connor> right now blah blah blah blah and then </connor>
<connor> the woman just like kind of like was </connor>
<connor> just looking at me panicking for a </connor>
<connor> little bit and this just starts typing </connor>
<connor> away on a keyboard and then she prints </connor>
<connor> out this ticket </connor>
<connor> for two days to go and she hands it to </connor>
<connor> me and then she just I'll never forget </connor>
<joey> it she just says I better not see you </joey>
<garnt> here ever again and she just gave me </garnt>
<joey> this free tip dude I [ __ ] cry I just </joey>

<garnt> happen in Japan in Japan it's like hold </garnt>
<connor> on I gotta call up the manager and then </connor>

<joey> you that was like that was the moment </joey>
<joey> where I was like you know what People </joey>
<joey> Are Awesome there is there is a God I I </joey>
<garnt> can confirm that that would never happen </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan yeah uh because I that I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> have that much of a stressful situation </garnt>
<garnt> uh but something kind of similar </garnt>
<joey> happened to me recently yeah so uh </joey>
<joey> recently we uh we went on a trip </joey>
<connor> together uh and after the trip I was </connor>
<joey> meant to fly to America uh fly to </joey>
<connor> America to uh meet Sydney's family </connor>
<connor> because I haven't seen them since before </connor>
<connor> covert so I wanted to see them once </connor>
<connor> before I get married and become one big </connor>
<connor> happy family uh so I had the tickets </connor>
<connor> booked and because the schedule was so </connor>
<connor> tight I had pre-packed all of my travel </connor>
<connor> stuff before going on the trip with the </connor>
<connor> boys basically </connor>
<connor> um Sydney uh flew out I believe like a </connor>
<connor> week before me so she she had she had </connor>
<connor> she had flown off already right uh and I </connor>
<joey> remember I packed everything before and </joey>
<joey> I put my passport in my travel bag right </joey>
<joey> and uh it's and I remember coming home </joey>
<joey> and I remember being absolutely </joey>
<joey> knackered from coming back from this uh </joey>
<joey> boys trip </joey>
<joey> um and then I was just like checking </joey>
<joey> everything was ready to go ready to fly </joey>
<joey> in like a day or two </joey>
<joey> um and then I noticed the bag is missing </joey>
<joey> oh oh [ __ ] and then I start panicking </joey>
<joey> because I know the most like if there's </joey>
<joey> one document I need it's my passport </joey>
<joey> yeah right especially because I'm </joey>
<joey> getting married in two months I can't </joey>
<joey> believe my [ __ ] passport I need to </joey>

<connor> need to check that you have the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Oscar travel bag okay do you have it and </connor>
<connor> she's just like </connor>
<garnt> um yeah yeah I have it I'm like is my </garnt>
<garnt> passport in there and she's she's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I'm so I'm so like she </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know why she had never used </garnt>
<garnt> this bike which like this is the one </garnt>
<garnt> time she decided to use this as a travel </garnt>
<garnt> bag </garnt>
<garnt> um and unfortunately she didn't check </garnt>
<garnt> the contents of the bag so it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> check her bag </garnt>
<connor> there's like nothing else in the fair </connor>
<garnt> was it just the passport in the back uh </garnt>
<garnt> it was my passport and my other like </garnt>
<garnt> vaccine travel documents that I needed </garnt>
<joey> so basically all everything you needed </joey>
<garnt> so so everything I needed to travel out </garnt>
<connor> of Japan </connor>
<garnt> so he was like empty aside from like the </garnt>
<garnt> front pocket which had like literally </garnt>
<garnt> like the one that everything I needed in </garnt>
<garnt> my life I'm your proof for existence </garnt>
<garnt> yeah existence to Japan right and so I'm </garnt>
<connor> and so we're like trying to like plan </connor>
<connor> this out to be like can I make this </connor>
<connor> flight if I if we like do a frame </connor>
<connor> perfect like frame perfect drop of this </connor>
<connor> to like [ __ ] DHL right away like and </connor>
<connor> we're like what's the closest DHL okay </connor>
<connor> so it's it's this place we can go home </connor>
<connor> you can you can wake up tomorrow and go </connor>
<connor> get it and then I realized unfortunately </connor>
<connor> it's America and </connor>
<joey> um they don't they don't work on the </joey>
<connor> weekends yeah so I'm like oh [ __ ] I have </connor>
<garnt> to wait two days before they can even </garnt>
<garnt> put the drop off even if even if DHL are </garnt>
<garnt> like super on point which they were </garnt>
<garnt> actually DHL were like very fast </garnt>
<garnt> um I'm still not gonna get it in time so </garnt>
<garnt> I have to like uh if I want to go to </garnt>
<garnt> America he's the Strat yeah I have to </garnt>
<joey> like delay I have to like change the </joey>
<joey> flight right uh so that was stressful </joey>
<joey> enough not having my passport on me </joey>
<joey> right yeah </joey>
<joey> um so I remember phoning up a a </joey>
<joey> to be like look I'm I'm in the situation </joey>
<joey> now like I don't know if I don't know if </joey>
<joey> I qualify for a change of flight because </joey>
<joey> the thing is like I believe I I bought a </joey>
<joey> flexible ticket right right so so I I </joey>
<joey> wasn't I wasn't I didn't buy one on like </joey>
<connor> I didn't I didn't buy a ticket on like </connor>
<connor> some random [ __ ] website I bought it </connor>
<connor> from a a itself right </connor>
<connor> um and so I thought paying like a bit of </connor>
<connor> a premium price as opposed to buying </connor>
<joey> from like [ __ ] Skyscanner or whatever </joey>
<joey> that I you know there was a little bit </joey>
<joey> of wiggle room on that right yeah </joey>
<connor> um because it wasn't a cheap ticket and </connor>
<joey> like like I don't know why flying to </joey>
<joey> America right now is so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> expensive from like everywhere because </joey>
<joey> it was it was it was like the cheap the </joey>
<joey> cheapest economy ticket they had and it </joey>
<joey> was still like [ __ ] like almost like </joey>
<joey> a grand or like two grand I can't I </joey>
<connor> can't [ __ ] remember it's like yeah </connor>
<connor> one way yeah yeah yeah it was on one-way </connor>
<joey> flights they're weirdly expensive return </joey>
<joey> flights are like weirdly more like less </joey>
<connor> experience yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> something to do with how long you're </connor>
<connor> gone on and there's there's different </connor>
<connor> price points based on if you're flying </connor>
<connor> with the same carrier and how far apart </connor>

<connor> she pauses and she pauses and she's just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> um hold on can I I need to go see the </connor>
<connor> manager quickly oh my god um and I'm </connor>
<connor> like that's that's that's not a good </connor>
<connor> sign that's not a good fighting in Japan </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah anything needs to manage it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah cause I'm like oh man how how </connor>
<connor> many hundreds of dollars am I gonna have </connor>
<connor> to like [ __ ] pay to like change my </connor>
<connor> flights yeah um and then like I wait for </connor>
<connor> like five minutes I'm like okay you know </connor>
<connor> I can afford like a few hundred dollars </connor>
<connor> luckily enough </connor>
<connor> um because I really want to go see their </connor>
<connor> family </connor>
<connor> um and then she comes back </connor>
<connor> and then uh and then she's like okay I </connor>
<garnt> have just confirmed to my manager if you </garnt>
<garnt> would like to change uh your plane </garnt>
<garnt> ticket to this date uh it is four </garnt>
<garnt> thousand dollars </garnt>
<garnt> what and um and I was I was like uh can </garnt>
<joey> can you can you repeat that right could </joey>
<joey> you repeat that </joey>
<connor> could could you repeat could you repeat </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> because because they because they said </connor>
<joey> it in because they said it in Yen right </joey>
<joey> because I said in Yen I was just like </joey>
<joey> 400 000 years yeah so I was like uh my </joey>
<joey> my again my my Japanese must be rusty </joey>
<joey> because I think I think there's I I must </joey>
<joey> have missed that must have been some </joey>
<joey> static yeah because I think like is is </joey>
<joey> that what it is in Japanese I must have </joey>
<joey> added an extra zero in my head because </joey>
<joey> that is that is not 400 000 Yen I must </joey>
<joey> have heard forty thousand yen yeah and </joey>
<joey> uh just misheard so I was like could you </joey>
<joey> repeat that please and then they </joey>
<joey> repeated that and now I was just like so </joey>
<joey> to confirm in English that is 400 000 </joey>
<joey> Yen right because I'm like it's like I'm </joey>
<joey> like Manny hunger is not Josie enough </joey>
<joey> I'm coping right now mind hunger is </joey>
<joey> definitely not josu enough right now I'm </joey>
<joey> just hearing this right oh my God and </joey>
<joey> um and she was and and then she was like </joey>
<joey> yes it is 400 000 uh Yen and I was like </joey>
<garnt> how is this possible and and and and she </garnt>
<garnt> was like uh I apologize </garnt>
<garnt> um because because it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> there's a small change fee and like the </garnt>
<garnt> tax is different like I couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> understand like no matter what she says </garnt>
<garnt> there is no justification for an </garnt>
<connor> increase in four it performs like a flex </connor>
<connor> ticket and somehow it ended up costing </connor>
<connor> more than the original ticket yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> like you're not you're not you didn't </joey>
<garnt> like upgrade to business class right no </garnt>
<joey> no no like that's that's the kind of </joey>
<garnt> prices this was economy and I was just </garnt>
<joey> like is that 4 000 Yen on top of the two </joey>
<joey> like oh no so is that a thousand yeah is </joey>
<joey> that like 4 000 on top of the ticket </joey>
<joey> that I just already paid for and she was </joey>
<joey> like yes </joey>
<joey> wow so so so it's a five thousand dollar </joey>
<joey> one week yeah yeah yeah and and so like </joey>
<joey> I'm like there is no [ __ ] way this </joey>
<joey> makes sense so I go on [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Skyscanner like I I as as they're on the </joey>
<joey> call as we're on the call and I'm just </joey>
<connor> like I can see I can buy a ticket on </connor>
<connor> your website for two thousand dollars </connor>
<connor> like a new ticket for two thousand </connor>
<connor> dollars how does it make sense that </connor>
<connor> you're charging me four thousand dollars </connor>
<connor> to change my ticket change it change it </connor>
<connor> right and she was like I apologize sir </connor>
<garnt> it's just that's just how the system </garnt>
<garnt> works it's the up charge for changing </garnt>
<garnt> the tickets and I'm just like okay </garnt>
<garnt> so it's cheaper for me to buy a new </garnt>
<garnt> ticket even if it's like double the </garnt>
<garnt> price at this point from what I </garnt>
<connor> originally paid can I get a refund for </connor>
<connor> the original picadite for the original </connor>
<connor> ticket I paid </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> for the original ticket I paid uh in </connor>
<connor> order to get to get the refund back so I </connor>
<connor> can buy a new ticket yeah and she was </connor>
<garnt> like oh yes uh the uh </garnt>
<garnt> the cancellation fee or free 900 900. </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> flexible tickets means you can change it </garnt>
<joey> you can't refund it some of them let you </joey>
<connor> some of them you can change it some of </connor>
<joey> them do and I was just like </joey>
<garnt> am I talking to the circus right now </garnt>
<garnt> like that's I don't like that I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> say that but that's what I wanted to say </garnt>
<connor> you're not the clown you want a whole </connor>
<connor> circus </connor>
<joey> oh my God so so my choices are either to </joey>
<connor> pay four thousand dollars uh to change </connor>
<joey> my ticket or to to or to to like get 900 </joey>
<joey> to pay 900 to cancel with tickets uh and </joey>
<joey> then buy a two thousand dollar ticket a </joey>
<joey> new two thousand dollar ticket and I'm </joey>
<joey> just like I am not doing this like at </joey>
<joey> like so </joey>
<joey> for the first time in my life I was like </joey>
<joey> can I speak to the manager </joey>
<joey> like I like because the thing is I am </joey>
<connor> not the type of guy who goes Karen of </connor>
<garnt> course I am all the type of guy yeah but </garnt>
<joey> they were taking the piss I mean I think </joey>
<joey> anyone in that situation would go Karen </joey>
<garnt> mode yeah that's [ __ ] ridiculous yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like so I asked for the manager and </garnt>
<garnt> like it was the reasoning for like the </garnt>
<garnt> up charge of that much is because I </garnt>
<garnt> wanted the flights within like if if I </garnt>
<garnt> if I had waited I believe like I thought </garnt>
<garnt> I believe like eight days eight or nine </garnt>
<joey> days then it would be a lot cheaper </joey>
<joey> because there was this like window yeah </joey>
<joey> where I wanted to change the flight to </joey>
<joey> even though there were flights available </joey>
<joey> and the flight tickets which was cheaper </joey>
<joey> to buy new changing to that changing to </joey>
<joey> within that date range meant that they </joey>
<joey> had to up charge the tickets right so </joey>
<joey> and there was nothing that which still </joey>
<joey> doesn't make sense yes which still </joey>
<joey> doesn't make sense so there was nothing </joey>
<joey> there was nothing I could do about it I </joey>
<joey> I talked to the manager I was like look </joey>
<joey> is there anything you can do at all </joey>
<joey> because I like I'm not I'm not lying but </joey>
<connor> this is ridiculous yeah you are not </connor>
<joey> giving me any way out you you are not </joey>
<garnt> giving me a solution my solution is I </garnt>
<garnt> pay 900 to pay two thousand dollars </garnt>
<connor> like like you you're not it's literally </connor>
<joey> like the enter the lottery to buy the </joey>
<connor> tickets yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> um so so unfortunately I didn't get a </connor>
<connor> solution I lost a thousand I I lost 900 </connor>
<connor> uh to cancel my ticket and I flew to </connor>
<connor> England for a fraction of the price for </connor>
<garnt> this headache to go to America Christ </garnt>
<garnt> um so yeah unfortunately </garnt>
<connor> um I don't know I don't know what's </connor>
<connor> going on with flights to America it's </connor>
<connor> insane right now yeah </connor>
<joey> Flash from the UK to America as well </joey>
<connor> it's crazy expensive really wow [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah meanwhile flights to from Tokyo to </connor>
<connor> London were like it was like one </connor>
<joey> thousand dollars for business so what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] going on what's Happening no </joey>
<joey> one's wanting to go to the UK right I </joey>
<garnt> think no one wants to go from Tokyo as </garnt>
<garnt> well oh that's true yeah but okay I got </garnt>
<garnt> because I got to ask now hey just remind </garnt>
<connor> me have you guys ever gone full Karen </connor>
<connor> have you guys ever needed to like ask </connor>
<connor> for the manager </connor>
<garnt> I'm not the kind of person to like go to </garnt>
<joey> a restaurant and be like wow my soup is </joey>
<connor> 20 minutes late yeah yeah but I feel </connor>
<connor> like I normally try to like I I when I'm </connor>
<joey> talking in those situations I'd only try </joey>
<joey> to build up some rapport with the person </joey>
<joey> I'm talking to yeah yeah I don't </joey>
<joey> normally be like yo listen uh you know I </joey>
<connor> nothing can be done and I'll be like I </connor>
<joey> mean I'll take your word for it yeah yes </joey>
<joey> like you know I feel there's like if </joey>
<joey> there is a problem with some kind of </joey>
<connor> service or you know situation there's </connor>
<connor> only so much that I know the manager can </connor>
<connor> do anyway so I'm just like don't just </connor>
<connor> don't even bother like yeah I'll just </connor>
<joey> I'll fold I don't give a [ __ ] like it's </joey>
<connor> not it's not a life or death situation </connor>
<connor> in that situation I I'd be tempted to </connor>
<connor> but even then I'm like I'm so lazy that </connor>
<garnt> I'm like all right I guess I also don't </garnt>
<joey> want to cause a scene you know even </joey>
<garnt> though I'm perfectly in the right to </garnt>
<garnt> cause a scene because I'm the one </garnt>
<garnt> getting [ __ ] over like there's a part </garnt>
<garnt> there's a part of me that's just like no </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna I don't wanna like be the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah you know so it's like yeah </joey>
<garnt> I don't know I don't think I've ever no </garnt>
<connor> I never don't have but I mean I don't </connor>
<joey> think like I don't know it's weird </joey>
<joey> because like if you call the scene </joey>
<joey> sometimes you get what you want yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah right because it's like I don't I'd </joey>
<joey> just rather not I've I've been in </joey>
<connor> situations where you just treat me like </connor>
<joey> a human being yeah I've been in </joey>
<joey> situations where I've been in like a </joey>
<joey> restaurant or whatever and I've seen </joey>
<joey> someone else cause a scene they get what </joey>
<garnt> they want yeah I'm just like what an </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah yeah because because the </garnt>
<garnt> thing is like it's it's because I I </garnt>
<connor> hardly ever go full Karen </connor>
<connor> um but I've seen I've seen it work I </connor>
<joey> just like I could I I don't have the </joey>
<connor> ability to do that myself yes because I </connor>
<joey> remember like on this trip back to </joey>
<joey> England uh there was this point where we </joey>
<joey> were on it we're on a night out uh we're </joey>
<joey> with all our friends right </joey>
<joey> um and Sydney was tired and so like I I </joey>
<joey> took her home like took her home like </joey>
<joey> earlier everyone else went on drinking </joey>
<joey> and eventually they ended up in a casino </joey>
<joey> right yeah uh and so I was like cool I'm </joey>
<joey> not tired yet I'm is it cool if I go out </joey>
<joey> to you know continue with my mates and </joey>
<joey> continue drinking have fun and then I </joey>
<joey> was like yeah uh Sydney was already </joey>
<connor> passed us I was like cool I'm just gonna </connor>
<connor> go please make noise </connor>
<connor> don't hear anything yeah </connor>
<connor> absolutely and so there was a sizable </connor>
<joey> group </joey>
<joey> um inside the casino yeah uh so I get </joey>
<connor> there and I want to go in and uh there's </connor>
<connor> a bouncer at the door uh and he's just </connor>
<connor> like sorry you can't come in unless you </connor>
<connor> remember and I was just like but I know </connor>
<connor> you've let uh plenty of other people in </connor>
<connor> because my entire my entire friend group </connor>
<connor> is in there yeah </connor>
<connor> um and uh my entire my entire friend </connor>
<connor> group is in there and they weren't </connor>
<connor> members uh so what's that what's </connor>
<connor> happening with that and he was like oh </connor>
<connor> you know uh he was like sorry no members </connor>
<connor> right now uh uh no entry right now until </connor>
<connor> unless you remember yeah and I was just </connor>
<connor> like oh I I know like I know he can let </connor>
<connor> me in you know like it's not like a </connor>
<connor> massive casino and the thing is I see </connor>
<joey> people walking out you know I I see like </joey>
<joey> plenty of people walking out and I like </joey>
<joey> you know when you can tell like that </joey>
<joey> there's a bouncer who just wants to go </joey>
<connor> on a power trip oh yeah like you know </connor>
<connor> what I mean you know what I mean I like </connor>
<connor> I knew it wasn't like it wasn't like </connor>
<connor> devote like it wasn't like the busiest </connor>
<connor> place in London or whatever it was it </connor>
<connor> was it was a place that I knew the </connor>
<connor> bouncer was just trying to be an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> because like I could clearly see there </connor>
<connor> are people walking in and out yeah right </connor>
<connor> and there are people that were going out </connor>
<connor> and saying that they were leaving and so </connor>
<connor> I was just like okay what is the right </connor>
<connor> angle to go for to try and get myself in </connor>
<connor> right if you want to see your friends </connor>
<connor> yeah because I really because I'm like </connor>
<garnt> everyone see my friends uh because the </garnt>
<garnt> night we wasn't even like that late </garnt>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> was it a Saturday or like a Tuesday </garnt>
<garnt> um I believe it was a Sunday oh I can't </garnt>
<garnt> understand maybe if it was Saturday it </garnt>
<joey> was really busy you know we want to </joey>
<garnt> limit it to customers then they were </garnt>
<connor> going to spend a [ __ ] ton of money yeah </connor>
<garnt> it wasn't even like that busy right no </garnt>
<joey> it was it wasn't even that business </joey>
<joey> because because like so I'm like I'm </joey>
<joey> like okay I gotta at least try to get in </joey>
<joey> right yeah because uh if I don't get in </joey>
<connor> I gotta I didn't get to say goodbye to </connor>
<connor> my friends and like my night's over so </connor>
<connor> I'm at least like try to get in uh and </connor>
<joey> of course I don't go full Karen I go I </joey>
<joey> try to go </joey>
<garnt> so I go I go for the friendly approach </garnt>
<connor> you know like start from at the moment </connor>
<garnt> right yeah the the Rapport approach </garnt>
<garnt> right the the Rapport approach the </garnt>
<connor> dieters approach there's nothing wrong </connor>
<joey> with like being like trying to explain </joey>
<joey> like yeah you know maybe if there's not </joey>
<connor> like a giant line behind you like listen </connor>
<joey> I wanna I wanna see my friends </joey>
<garnt> calmly explain </garnt>
<garnt> look mate like I understand that you </garnt>
<garnt> don't want like a big group of like </garnt>
<garnt> strangers coming in or whatever at this </garnt>
<garnt> time of the hour you know I get that you </garnt>
<joey> know you you're just like you got you </joey>
<joey> got some rules that you need to follow </joey>
<joey> and everything like that </joey>
<joey> um look I'll be honest I'm just one guy </joey>
<joey> I'm not local around here because I've </joey>
<joey> literally flown in from Japan just to </joey>
<joey> hang out with my mates and I don't get </joey>
<joey> this chance often yeah </joey>
<joey> um and I was I was just I was just like </joey>
<joey> the sympathy approach because I was </joey>
<joey> because I was like dude I'm not here to </joey>
<connor> like ruin you now spend [ __ ] money </connor>
<connor> yeah you know I I know you just don't </connor>
<connor> want some [ __ ] random deck here just </connor>
<connor> like walking and everything like that I </connor>
<garnt> am not that random [ __ ] I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> drunk you know I'm I'm like I'm like a </garnt>
<garnt> good I'm a good boy I'm a good boy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah that is very very well </garnt>
<garnt> definitely like like I was trying to be </garnt>
<joey> as well [ __ ] spoken as possible it </joey>
<joey> was this was like me me like putting on </joey>
<joey> like The Tuxedo like it's the way it's </joey>
<connor> 100 but like but like [ __ ] you know this </connor>
<garnt> guy just was not having it like he was </garnt>
<connor> like something else is like that they're </connor>
<connor> just like you know she was like no </connor>
<garnt> they're not having it because because </garnt>
<garnt> the thing is he would not even like even </garnt>
<garnt> have a conversation like he was like no </garnt>
<connor> I can I can get it because they probably </connor>
<garnt> deal with like some really [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<garnt> I I get it I get it at the same time </garnt>
<joey> it's like sometimes you're like yeah </joey>
<joey> dude I'm I'm not I'm not the problem </joey>
<garnt> here dude yeah yeah everyone causing you </garnt>
<connor> problems yeah yeah yeah yes maybe I am </connor>
<garnt> by talking YouTube yeah yeah exactly I </garnt>
<garnt> was just like look look you know and </garnt>
<garnt> eventually I was just like you know find </garnt>
<garnt> it you know fine I guess you know I </garnt>
<garnt> guess I guess my night's over and then </garnt>
<garnt> one of my one of my friends comes out </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and uh she sees what's going on she's </connor>
<connor> like what's going on here and I was like </connor>
<connor> they have some rules and </connor>
<connor> um the balance is just like not </connor>
<connor> communicating with me at all I don't </connor>
<connor> think there's any way to get in and </connor>
<joey> she's like bet she's like </joey>
<joey> Karen mode actively </joey>
<joey> like that was like an instant like 50 </joey>
<joey> like an instant switch to be like </joey>
<garnt> um excuse me yeah like do you know that </garnt>
<garnt> he's getting married in a month awesome </garnt>
<garnt> she's just gonna be a lady do you know </garnt>
<garnt> who he is yeah yeah he's the anime Zone </garnt>
<garnt> the greatest YouTuber and she goes and </garnt>
<garnt> and she's able to just like go on this </garnt>
<connor> like some somehow yeah I just probably </connor>
<connor> want to get rid of her yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it's [ __ ] off it's like </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] five minute rant right it's </garnt>
<garnt> like you know it's it's like you know uh </garnt>
<joey> when it's like Senator Armstrong is just </joey>
<joey> like standing there and you're like it's </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] like pulling the </joey>
<joey> punches and he's just it's not punching </joey>
<joey> yeah he's not budging But like after </joey>
<joey> about five minutes he's just like fine </joey>
<joey> you can go in I was just like stop what </joey>
<joey> that what I I thought I thought being </joey>
<garnt> like the nice guy would work but just </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] like go like just like no </garnt>
<garnt> like just going full Karen and just like </garnt>
<garnt> like hauling from the manager and just </garnt>
<garnt> like not letting up that works sometimes </garnt>
<joey> that's but I think that's the thing </joey>
<joey> right it's like I think the reason why I </joey>
<joey> don't go Karen mode like ever is because </joey>
<joey> I've been on the other side of that </joey>
<joey> before like when I used to work yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah and like oh my God I still </connor>
<connor> remember this [ __ ] to this day but </connor>
<connor> like it was it was this absolute knob </connor>
<connor> head who like he came in I was working </connor>
<connor> when I was working up at the ski Fields </connor>
<connor> I was working behind a bar some nights </connor>
<connor> and you know I had to pour like beers </connor>
<connor> and [ __ ] and whatever yeah but then of </connor>
<connor> course the this this [ __ ] this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] walks in with like 10 of his </connor>
<connor> mates right and he was like and he said </connor>
<connor> could you come here for a second yeah </connor>
<connor> you love me for a second I was like oh </connor>
<joey> you're talking to me all right yeah </joey>
<joey> whatever that's a bit weird and uh and </joey>
<joey> then he's like can we get 20 B-52s </joey>
<joey> please </joey>
<joey> and to explain what a B-52 is it's this </joey>
<joey> liqueur shot that's three layers right </joey>
<joey> yes and so the layering [ __ ] I don't if </joey>
<joey> you've ever made layering stuff you've </joey>
<joey> got to like slowly pour it at the back </joey>
<joey> of a spoon otherwise it mixes right yeah </joey>
<garnt> so in other words making one of these </garnt>
<garnt> takes a long time yeah because you know </garnt>
<garnt> you want to make it look nice right and </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] was like 20 of them </garnt>
<garnt> please and I was like okay sure I was </garnt>
<garnt> the only one at the bar right yeah so I </garnt>
<garnt> was like all right I better start </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] slaving away at it then but you </garnt>
<joey> know because it's you know a restaurant </joey>
<joey> right and like a bar I wanted to like </joey>
<joey> look nice I'm not just gonna [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pour it in right yeah I start pouring </joey>
<joey> you know a couple of them and then </joey>
<joey> around like the third one that I'm </joey>
<joey> making this [ __ ] just walks into the </joey>
<joey> bar and he was like oh where the [ __ ] </joey>

<joey> and so of course but you know that's </joey>
<joey> what I said in my head right but on the </joey>
<joey> outside I was like I'll get the medicine </joey>
<joey> right away </joey>
<joey> so then the magic </joey>
<joey> the manager </joey>
<joey> and then I call the manager over and </joey>
<joey> she's like this Japanese lady right but </joey>
<connor> like you know who looks really nice on </connor>
<connor> the outside but on the inside she's like </connor>
<connor> a reverse character because you have to </connor>
<garnt> deal with like she has to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like this all right yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> then she comes out and you know this </garnt>
<garnt> nice like you know short Japanese lady </garnt>
<joey> comes out and she's like oh what seems </joey>
<joey> to be the problem and you know this guy </joey>
<joey> starts going off being like yo so he's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] taking forever making these </joey>
<connor> drinks you know like we've been waiting </connor>
<connor> forever by forever he they mean like you </connor>
<connor> know 10 minutes yeah right and I've </connor>
<joey> never seen someone Go reverse Karen yeah </joey>
<joey> on a customer before yeah and she was </joey>
<connor> just like um excuse me do you want to </connor>
<joey> make these I don't think so so give him </joey>
<connor> some [ __ ] time I love videos of like </connor>
<connor> the employees of fast food places yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah just being like and and she was </joey>
<connor> just like she literally was like get out </connor>
<connor> yeah good yeah yeah and you know he was </connor>
<joey> you know going off and being like this </joey>
<connor> is the worst place ever [ __ ] you guys </connor>
<connor> it's just like I don't give a [ __ ] get </connor>
<connor> out get the [ __ ] out right now and I was </connor>
<joey> like and you know because I was like </joey>
<joey> okay and it's too shy and like scared to </joey>
<joey> like say anything so in the back I was </joey>
<joey> like yeah </joey>
<joey> think every time you know I'm in a </joey>
<joey> situation where you know perhaps </joey>
<joey> something is laid or you know where most </joey>
<joey> people would want to go Karen mode in </joey>
<joey> some situations I always remember that </joey>
<joey> situation I'm like no I don't want to be </joey>
<garnt> that [ __ ] yeah I'll wait but because </garnt>
<garnt> because like the part of the reason that </garnt>
<garnt> I was like because I got like slightly </garnt>
<connor> annoyed at the bouncer wasn't wasn't </connor>
<connor> because of the fact that he wasn't </connor>
<connor> letting me in but because like he just </connor>
<connor> refused to like engage with me yeah so </connor>
<garnt> because I wouldn't explain it to you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he just wouldn't explain it to me </garnt>
<connor> because like I could like I could tell </connor>
<joey> he was just like he he probably had a </joey>
<joey> bad day or something or I don't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> know but like he was just he just wanted </joey>
<connor> to exert his power upon someone like I I </connor>
<connor> could I could feel that energy because </connor>
<joey> like I've been to like places before </joey>
<joey> where you talk to The Bouncer and they </joey>
<joey> explain to you like look look like </joey>
<joey> there's nothing I can do you know like I </joey>
<joey> don't I I don't feel like trying to help </joey>
<connor> you yeah I'd be like I get it because </connor>
<connor> I'm like I'm a human as well but like I </connor>
<connor> was like he was like nah gotta </connor>
<connor> prioritize our members and I was looking </connor>
<joey> around I was like thinking what [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> members it's you and me I was like there </joey>
<joey> is no line here there is no line there's </joey>
<joey> no line of people waiting to come up I </joey>
<connor> know for a fact uh because after I went </connor>
<connor> in the casino was like 90 empty so I was </connor>
<connor> just like what I was just like you know </connor>
<connor> this is an [ __ ] being an [ __ ] and </connor>
<garnt> this is like the only thing that could </garnt>
<joey> beat an [ __ ] is a Karen and like </joey>
<garnt> Unstoppable forces </garnt>
<connor> you know those YouTube videos where </connor>
<joey> they're like yeah just like bribe your </joey>
<joey> way into everything yeah yeah you want </joey>
<joey> an upgrade at a hotel room just slip the </joey>
<connor> person 50 bucks yeah I've always thought </connor>
<connor> about stuff like that because I'm like </connor>
<connor> I'd love to be able to have the </connor>
<connor> slickness and the coolness to pull that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] off but I'm just thinking like how </connor>
<joey> do I how do I discreetly just give you </joey>
<joey> like 10 pounds in a way that like </joey>
<joey> doesn't make me look [ __ ] stupid yeah </joey>
<joey> what if you say no to me right and then </joey>
<connor> I'm like oh give me a second just pull </connor>
<connor> out 10 notes </connor>
<connor> I would have to preemptively give him </connor>
<connor> some money and that point what if no one </connor>
<connor> else paid money to get in and I'm the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] who gave him 10 pounds yeah and </connor>
<connor> alternatively what if you go to like </connor>
<garnt> that whole I see all those [ __ ] tick </garnt>
<garnt> tocks just give your hotel checking </garnt>
<garnt> person 50 bucks like it's like okay what </garnt>
<garnt> if the hotel should actually fall like </garnt>
<joey> you actually just gave them 50 and </joey>
<garnt> you're a dude I've seen that before </garnt>
<joey> though where like I saw a guy at like a </joey>
<joey> club or like a bar or something yeah who </joey>
<joey> like you know did like the whole </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] being like like pulls out at 20 </connor>
<connor> and like puts it into the you know </connor>
<connor> bounces like pocket yeah and the bouncer </connor>
<joey> looks at it and he's like all right give </joey>
<connor> me a second I'm gonna go talk to the </connor>
<joey> manager about it yeah and he goes in he </joey>
<connor> comes out and he's like sorry we're full </connor>
<joey> and so and then everyone in the lines </joey>
<joey> just starts laughing being like I want </joey>
<connor> to dig in I've seen it work and not work </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah I've seen when it doesn't work </joey>
<joey> it's hilarious yeah yeah but that's that </joey>
<joey> to me it's like all right the the </joey>
<joey> benefits don't outweigh the the absolute </joey>
<joey> humility of getting rejected yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah trying to for money to someone to </garnt>
<joey> get into something it's like you not </joey>
<joey> only lost money but you also didn't get </joey>
<connor> what you wanted yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> there's some people who like have their </connor>
<joey> I think they have the personality that </joey>
<joey> matches up to that kind of behavior oh </joey>
<joey> yeah I I'm not slick at all I can't </joey>
<joey> remember this stuff I can't do that I've </joey>
<connor> been with guys who are just like well </connor>
<connor> let's uh let's come to a solution and </connor>
<connor> then they like [ __ ] give the 10. yeah </connor>
<connor> I was like just just say shut up </connor>
<garnt> I've not seen Jen do it but I know Jen </garnt>
<garnt> it's like like John has the energy that </garnt>
<joey> he could pull it off no Joanna's the </joey>
<joey> energy he can pull it off without ever </joey>
<joey> getting his wallet out yeah he's just </joey>
<connor> like let's talk Jen would do it get </connor>
<joey> rejected and then not care that he was </joey>
<joey> rejected yeah just be like okay we'll go </joey>
<joey> somewhere else yeah but to me it's like </joey>
<garnt> that's crushing and bad yeah I can't I </garnt>
<garnt> can't do that you tell me it's full I </garnt>
<joey> don't have a magical Karen that appears </joey>
<joey> to sort it out for me I guess I don't </joey>
<joey> have like cameras </joey>
<joey> I don't have like a stand I can pull it </joey>
<connor> out </connor>
<garnt> I guess I'm done </garnt>
<joey> yeah cause like I'm just going for </joey>
<connor> trying to be a clown a little bit maybe </connor>
<joey> I'll feel like that was funny I'll let </joey>
<joey> this guy yeah I try and like I try and </joey>
<joey> like human my way through things because </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't work no it doesn't think </garnt>
<garnt> about those bribes that I've seen it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like how do you how do you know how </garnt>
<garnt> much to give you know like like how like </garnt>
<garnt> how what's the right amount to bribe </garnt>
<connor> someone of like well if you're trying to </connor>
<connor> get a situation and you know a Michelin </connor>
<garnt> star restaurant I I don't have that at </garnt>
<garnt> work it doesn't make any sense but like </garnt>
<joey> a club if there's a [ __ ] Club maybe you </joey>
<joey> just give them like I don't know we've </joey>
<joey> got six pins and I want two drinks yeah </joey>
<joey> many people who do this often no there's </joey>
<joey> a system I don't know there's like a </joey>
<garnt> tier list right yeah maybe they can </garnt>
<garnt> explain it to me how it works especially </garnt>
<garnt> how nice or expensive the drinks are </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I've never heard of being rejected </garnt>
<garnt> from a casino though that's and only </garnt>
<joey> like drunk people get rejection casinos </joey>
<garnt> normally your Tipsy gone I was not too </garnt>
<joey> sure like </joey>
<garnt> he was like two bottles </garnt>
<garnt> that's how I remember at least </garnt>
<connor> I'm sure it came out hello my name is </connor>
<connor> to enter this establishment meanwhile </connor>
<joey> others learned from Japan </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> well you said you just take Sydney home </connor>
<joey> right so odds are you probably even if </joey>
<garnt> you did drink you'd probably [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> show it out yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> that was a good night we uh we we went </garnt>
<joey> to casino it was a happy end to the </joey>
<joey> story and it was the one time in my life </joey>
<garnt> that uh seeing someone go go for Karen </garnt>
<joey> uh was impressive and it actually worked </joey>
<joey> as well not that I would ever have the </joey>
<garnt> balls to do with myself no I I I I was </garnt>
<garnt> just starting there </garnt>
<joey> um and I was just I was impressed that's </joey>
<joey> what everyone needs though no like not </joey>
<joey> ever like you you don't need to be a </joey>
<joey> Karen you just need to know a Karen yeah </joey>
<joey> that's that's all you need you just need </joey>
<connor> that one mate who will be the man when </connor>
<joey> they work for me </joey>
<joey> parents Karen suck unless you can tell </joey>
<garnt> them to do something that you want okay </garnt>
<garnt> no no no Kara suck unless the the </garnt>
<joey> manager or the person is being an equal </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] exactly yeah you know like I I </joey>
<joey> normally I don't advocate for this like </joey>
<garnt> at all because you know service people </garnt>
<connor> go through enough you know </connor>
<garnt> people when people I see videos people </garnt>
<garnt> like arguing at McDonald's asking for </garnt>
<connor> free food I'm like what happened at </connor>
<joey> Birth that you became like this like how </joey>
<joey> did how did you how are you dropped hard </joey>
<connor> enough yeah to go to a McDonald's and </connor>
<connor> like berate a 14 year old kid just like </connor>
<joey> being a brat about it right like they're </joey>
<garnt> probably a brat their entire life there </garnt>
<garnt> are only very few points and some and </garnt>
<joey> like yeah if if the service person is </joey>
<joey> being an [ __ ] yes you should be a </joey>
<joey> coward even though I still don't have it </joey>
<joey> in me even if there have been plenty of </joey>
<joey> points where I'm like I should go for </joey>
<joey> Karen you know because there have been </joey>
<joey> plenty of points where they have been </joey>
<garnt> the [ __ ] yeah and I'm totally within </garnt>
<garnt> my rights to go full character but like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's just so hard man it's </garnt>
<connor> it's so hard luckily Google reviews </connor>
<connor> exists okay </connor>
<joey> you know like that [ __ ] who ordered </joey>
<garnt> the 20 b52s I would have loved to have </garnt>
<garnt> like Snapped back at him yeah but I just </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't imagine yeah okay I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> have the balls yeah or or when you well </garnt>
<joey> when they tell you you have to you get </joey>
<joey> charged four thousand dollars to change </joey>
