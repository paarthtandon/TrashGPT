<joey> - We live, baby! </joey>
<joey> Everybody, shut up! </joey>
<joey> We're making art! </joey>
<garnt> - You enjoy this content right now! </garnt>
<joey> - Is that what you say before you start recording? </joey>
<joey> Content, content! </joey>
<connor> - I shouldn't even notice what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> It's so weak. </connor>
<connor> We're in a new studio. </connor>
<connor> You can shout, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Can you give us an example of that? </joey>
<joey> (Connor yells) </joey>
<joey> (chill music plays) </joey>
<joey> - Hello, gamers. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of the Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I am boy with boys. </joey>
<joey> You guys know us by now. </joey>
<joey> And we have a themed episode, as you can tell. </joey>
<joey> - We've never done this- </joey>
<joey> - We've never done this before. </joey>
<joey> - Like, imagine this, </joey>
<joey> what if we make a three by three, guys? </joey>
<garnt> Never done that before, before. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you heard of an episode </joey>
<joey> that will not go on a tangent? </joey>
<joey> I'm just kidding. </joey>
<connor> We will go on tangents. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I think 'cause we're, </connor>
<connor> me and Garnt are planning to go out to the UK for a bit, </connor>
<garnt> so we need to record a little more episodes in advance. </garnt>
<garnt> So, our solution to do that is themed episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> so that we don't run out of stuff to talk about. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, we don't want to run out of stuff to talk about. </joey>
<garnt> - I like the three by three episodes </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's just a good excuse to talk about shit </connor>
<garnt> that maybe we're not gonna ever tangent towards. </garnt>
<joey> - It's also just hilarious </joey>
<joey> that we kind of brought back the three by three, like... </joey>
<connor> - I didn't even know that was a thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<connor> People haven't done it since like 2010. </connor>
<connor> But anyway, we've done a couple of three by three episodes </connor>
<garnt> in the past. </garnt>
<garnt> We did one on anime. </garnt>
<joey> We've done one on games, </joey>
<joey> and I think this will be the third one now. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna talk about movies! </joey>
<joey> Not anime movies though. </joey>
<garnt> - Actual live action movies </garnt>
<connor> with real people. - [Joey] With real people. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I feel like we don't- </garnt>
<garnt> - I like how we have to fucking specify </garnt>
<joey> we watch real movies. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course because to some people it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, so nine Ghibli films? </joey>
<garnt> "Is that gonna be-" </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly like I don't get </joey>
<garnt> to talk about live action movies a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I feel like I've watched a hell of a lot </garnt>
<joey> of live action movies. </joey>
<garnt> But the biggest problem I had </garnt>
<garnt> when making this three by three was I don't remember </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck I've watched. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, we've been watching movies God knows how long, </connor>
<garnt> right? </garnt>
<garnt> - For like my entire life. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's no like my movie list either. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like when you got into anime specifically, </connor>
<connor> it was probably at a point where you really like cared </connor>
<garnt> about it a lot, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> So, you made note of what you're watching. </garnt>
<garnt> You've been watching movies your whole God damn life </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's just what you do. </connor>
<joey> - Well, didn't you go through like the IMDb top 200? </joey>
<connor> - I went through it to remind myself, </connor>
<connor> "All right, what have I seen? </connor>
<joey> "Okay, I know. </joey>
<joey> "I like that, that one's good." </joey>
<joey> - I literally had to go down that list </joey>
<joey> to remind myself of what I've seen. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so what, like, </garnt>
<garnt> what logic did you guys use to choose your three by threes? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so in my head, </joey>
<joey> I always have like a top three movies ready. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, you know, you're always gonna be asked, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, what's your favorite movies?" </joey>
<joey> I always have like a top three, </joey>
<joey> but three by three you need nine movies. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, all right, shit. </joey>
<garnt> All right, I'll fill in the rest of the six with like movies </garnt>
<garnt> that I thought were really good </garnt>
<garnt> that I want to recommend to people </garnt>
<garnt> or movies that I know I've seen multiple times </garnt>
<joey> and I'll keep watching multiple times. </joey>
<garnt> - Mine were not recommendations at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I was thinking maybe I'll just make the ones </garnt>
<garnt> where like the movies I really, really like. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I just went through like my list of movies I really liked, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just like too many fucking movies. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally could not narrow it down. </garnt>
<garnt> It needs to be like a fucking top 50 list. </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen most of the IMDb top 200. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, this is not healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> - It would literally just be like the IMDb top 200 </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, I just went, fuck that. </garnt>
<garnt> What are the movies that I've just seen the most? </garnt>
<garnt> And like, if it's on TV, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I got time to watch this movie." </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I just picked movies that made me think of something. </garnt>
<garnt> Feel, feel things. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Raw emotions. </joey>
<connor> - A movie that gave me an experience. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I feel that's- </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause yeah, I feel like the problem with that for me is </garnt>
<garnt> that too many movies do that for me, so it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - You're out here like fucking having </connor>
<connor> an emotional breakdown every movie you watch? </connor>
<connor> - I like movies. </connor>
<garnt> I like movies. </garnt>
<joey> - It's really hard also to like get rid of recency bias </joey>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like immediately I thought </garnt>
<garnt> of like the last 10 movies I watched, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Were they as memorable as these other movies </garnt>
<joey> "that I probably haven't seen in like five, 10 years?" </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna say there's some movies on my list </garnt>
<connor> that I haven't seen in fucking years, </connor>
<connor> and I've put them on just because- </connor>
<joey> - I can't wait to quiz you about movies </joey>
<joey> that you haven't watched in years. </joey>
<joey> - I was like obsessed with them as a kid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So some of those are on my list, so. </joey>
<garnt> - What, do you got the fucking Teletubbies movies? </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> How far back we talking here, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty far back. </garnt>
<garnt> You'll see, you'll see. </garnt>
<joey> - So, let's see if our movie tastes are </joey>
<joey> as pretentious as our anime tastes. </joey>
<joey> But we're gonna decide as always with Trash Box </joey>
<joey> to see who goes first. </joey>
<joey> Oh, get that out of here. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that still in there from last time? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's in there from last time. </garnt>
<garnt> Throw that out. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a scripted joke last time, </garnt>
<joey> and we just forgot we put her in this time. </joey>
<garnt> - We forgot this time around. </garnt>
<garnt> That was a genuine bit. </garnt>
<joey> All right, who wants to pick who goes first? </joey>
<connor> - All right, I'll go first. </connor>
<connor> - I hope it's not me. </connor>
<garnt> I really don't want to go first. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, thank God, it's Garnt. </connor>
<joey> Thank God, it's Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, fuck, I didn't want to go first. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bring up Garnt's three by three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] So, you're logic for your three by three was- </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why I didn't want to go first </garnt>
<garnt> because I've got to fucking defend this shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, there are some there where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> "Genuinely good movies." </joey>
<joey> And then there's a... </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so this is split into two parts. </garnt>
<connor> - I just love how "Space Jam" is in the fucking middle. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> It's like the fucking epicenter. </connor>
<joey> - This is my movie! </joey>
<garnt> - As a fucking kid, </garnt>
<garnt> like as a kid who grew up in the 90s, </garnt>
<joey> everyone went through a fucking "Space Jam" phase. </joey>
<joey> This is a classic. </joey>
<joey> It's a fucking classic. </joey>
<joey> I mean, as a kid, I didn't watch the fucking NBA, </joey>
<joey> didn't even watch the fucking "Looney Tunes." </joey>
<garnt> And even as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking watched this so many times, </garnt>
<garnt> every time it was on TV, </garnt>
<garnt> I rewatched this shit so much. </garnt>
<connor> "Space Jam" is amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - You sound like a kid trying to justify </garnt>
<garnt> why you shit on the bed. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Like to your parents. </connor>
<connor> - Do you want to go through your list? </connor>
<garnt> - All right, so, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So, "Kung Fu Hustle." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] That's a good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's a great movie. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] "Rush Hour 2." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yo, I fucking love "Rush Hour 2!" </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] "Memento." </joey>
<garnt> "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World." </garnt>
<connor> - I had a feeling you were going to put "Memento" for some, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know why, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I was that close to putting "Memento" on my list, </connor>
<joey> but I'm like, "I feel Garnt's gonna put 'Memento' on." </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] "Space jam." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Of course. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] "The Matrix." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] First "Matrix," right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, the first "Matrix." </joey>
<connor> "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> "Snatch," and "Confessions." </garnt>
<garnt> So, this is very much split up </garnt>
<garnt> into my childhood obsession movies </garnt>
<garnt> and then some movies that I just want people to watch </garnt>
<garnt> and recommend them. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I've just watched it so many times. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so before, we, I guess, </connor>
<connor> which movies have you seen, Joey, here? </connor>
<joey> - I've seen all of them except for "Kung Fu Hustle" </joey>
<joey> and "Confessions." </joey>
<connor> - I've not seen, </connor>
<joey> "Snatch" sounds so familiar. </joey>
<joey> - Is "Snatch" the one where- </joey>
<joey> - That's the one where he fucking is like a boxer, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> "Snatch" is a Guy Ritchie movie. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a good movie. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's Guy Ritchie's best movie like by far. </connor>
<connor> It's that and "Lock, Stock." </connor>
<garnt> And I was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about putting a Quentin Tarantino movie on, but- </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised there is no Quentin Tarantino movie. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I had a feeling someone else was gonna put it on. </garnt>
<joey> So, that's why I put on "Snatch" </joey>
<joey> instead of Quentin Tarantino </joey>
<joey> because it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Snatch" and like "Reservoir Dogs" </joey>
<joey> which is like my Quentin Tarantino movie of choice, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like, it's the same kind of feel for me. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like more people know about Quentin Tarantino, </joey>
<joey> which is why I wanted to put "Snatch" </joey>
<joey> which is kind of like, </joey>
<joey> if you want kind of a British Quentin Tarantino </joey>
<joey> kind of movie where it's just got amazing dialogue. </joey>
<joey> And I love the concept of a lot of different characters </joey>
<joey> that has nothing to do with each other </joey>
<garnt> just kind of like merging into one coherent storyline. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's just bants. </garnt>
<garnt> The banter in this is so fucking good </garnt>
<garnt> that I still quote this to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, so many of the lines I "come up with" </garnt>
<joey> just comes from "Snatch." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> It's just got great writing, great fucking humor. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow, Gigguk literally stealing from "Snatch" </joey>
<connor> - I haven't seen "Confessions." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, me neither. </joey>
<joey> I've never even heard of it. </joey>
<garnt> - "Confessions" is actually a Japanese movie. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey gasps) </garnt>
<garnt> - Very fitting. </garnt>
<joey> - I know, and it's the one movie- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Kokuhaku. </joey>
<joey> I think I've read the book. </joey>
<connor> I read the book, yes, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know it was even based on a book. </connor>
<connor> But it's probably my favorite revenge movie of all time. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's a Miyabe Miyuki book. </joey>
<joey> Is it the one where it's like set in high school? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - With like two girls? </joey>
<joey> - Kind of. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's the one. </joey>
<joey> - So, the concept of this movie is </joey>
<connor> the main character is a teacher. </connor>
<connor> And she used to teach, teach a class. </connor>
<connor> And so these two students from these class, </connor>
<joey> or I think it was like two or three students </joey>
<joey> from this class, </joey>
<joey> they basically murder her daughter. </joey>
<joey> But because of Japanese laws, if you're like a minor, </joey>
<joey> then you can't be charged </joey>
<joey> even if you've technically like killed somebody. </joey>
<joey> - Which is fucked. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, which is fucked, </joey>
<joey> and that's like the whole premise of this movie. </joey>
<joey> And the premise of this movie is </joey>
<garnt> just her basically playing fucking 5D chess </garnt>
<garnt> against these high schoolers, </garnt>
<garnt> and just coming up with a very unique like revenge scheme </garnt>
<garnt> against these kids. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's kinda like maybe similar to "Old Boy" </garnt>
<garnt> if you've seen "Old Boy," but maybe just- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've seen "Old Boy." </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe just not as fucked. </joey>
<connor> I think... </connor>
<joey> - "Old Boy" is pretty fucked. </joey>
<joey> - "Old Boy" is pretty fucked, and my problem </joey>
<garnt> with "Old Boy" is that- </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised "Old Boy" isn't on your three by three. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, my problem with "Old Boy" is I really liked it, </garnt>
<garnt> but there are definitely some parts of "Old Boy" </garnt>
<garnt> that really push your suspension of disbelief. </garnt>
<joey> Like, without spoiling, </joey>
<joey> like without spoiling the ending of "Old Boy" or something, </joey>
<joey> there's some plot elements where you're just like- </joey>
<joey> - Like the final twist? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like the final twist where you're just- </joey>
<garnt> - You've seen it? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - The final twist where you're just like, "I guess..." </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> "Can the human mind be tricked into doing this? </garnt>
<garnt> "That's like kind of pushing it." </garnt>
<connor> What I like about "Confessions" is that it's </connor>
<connor> kind of like the same kind of deal </connor>
<connor> where it's one person getting revenge over people, </connor>
<connor> but it's just, it's kinda like, </connor>
<connor> she's kinda like a Light Yagami kind of character </connor>
<joey> where it's a very, it's a very intricate revenge plot- </joey>
<joey> - But it's believable. </joey>
<joey> - But it's believable, and it's, </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's believable </joey>
<joey> because the whole premise is fucked to begin with. </joey>
<joey> Because this is real, </joey>
<joey> like, you know, Japanese minors cannot be charged </joey>
<joey> even if they kill somebody, </joey>
<joey> and that's like the premise of the movie. </joey>
<garnt> But the way it unravels is really, really interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> And for a Japanese movie as well, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest things I remember </garnt>
<garnt> when watching this movie for the first time is </garnt>
<garnt> that out of nowhere they start playing Radiohead. </garnt>
<joey> - Hell yeah! </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Is that fucking Radiohead I'm listening to now?" </garnt>
<joey> And so Radiohead is- </joey>
<joey> - Instant 10 out of 10. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And so like literally one of the best parts of this movie, </joey>
<joey> it was just like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> like the song for like the epic reveal </garnt>
<garnt> where she reveals everything, it's just fucking Radiohead. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "This is the best reveal I've ever seen in a movie." </garnt>
<joey> - Which Radiohead song is it? </joey>
<garnt> - I can't remember. </garnt>
<connor> - Just remember the emotions. </connor>
<connor> - I just remember the emotions. </connor>
<connor> But it's not the most famous Radiohead song. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's the one movie </connor>
<connor> that I think is like really underground </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's a Japanese movie. </connor>
<connor> And everyone who's watched it so far has been </connor>
<connor> really, really fucking impressed. </connor>
<connor> And I don't see many people talking about this movie </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like Japanese cinema in general </connor>
<garnt> just gets looked over a lot, but- </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like 'cause they tackle very Japanese things </connor>
<garnt> more often than not. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the way they go about things is very Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and like kind of like doesn't really make, </garnt>
<connor> not that it doesn't make sense, but just kind of odd. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's a lot of like cultural elements and things </garnt>
<garnt> that they throw back to that </garnt>
<garnt> where other people will be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, that doesn't happen in my school." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you have to kind of like </connor>
<joey> just look past a lot of things I think </joey>
<joey> when you watch Japanese movies as foreigners. </joey>
<joey> You can't relate to most of the stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause like I've definitely read this book before </joey>
<connor> and I really, really enjoyed it, </connor>
<connor> like back in like high school as well. </connor>
<joey> I think this is quite an old book. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I mean, for one, </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know that this was like a movie, first of all. </joey>
<connor> I didn't even know it was available in English. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause like a lot of Japanese cinema doesn't make it </joey>
<joey> outside of Japan. </joey>
<connor> - There's always just translations online. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> But it's like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I just wasn't expecting this. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I recommend a lot of movies from this director. </garnt>
<connor> I can't remember his name, </connor>
<connor> but "Confessions" is my favorite one. </connor>
<connor> - Is it on the poster? </connor>
<connor> - "Memories of Matsuko" is another movie </connor>
<connor> that this director made that is like really underground </connor>
<connor> even for like Japanese cinema, but it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, just like if you're gonna take anything </connor>
<connor> out of my three by three, watch "Confessions" </connor>
<connor> because more people need to know about "Confessions." </connor>
<connor> Kokuhaku. </connor>
<connor> It's an amazing movie. </connor>
<connor> It's one of the few Japanese movies </connor>
<garnt> that I think is just easily accessible to like anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't really need to know about Japanese culture. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a good revenge plot. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you like "Old Boy" or, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of Korean movies, </garnt>
<garnt> you're probably gonna like "Confessions." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Miyabe Miyuki I think is the original woman </joey>
<joey> who wrote Kokuhaku. </joey>
<joey> Like, all of her books kind of like deal </joey>
<connor> with this kind of like, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like criticizing fucked up parts of Japan </connor>
<connor> and like using it as like an advantage. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm down for that. </connor>
<joey> - It's really good, the book- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] That sounds really good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Might actually watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> The best movie on there is "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I think... </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I wanted to put a comedy movie on, </garnt>
<garnt> I was thinking what comedy movie can I infinitely rewatch? </garnt>
<garnt> - You've got like three on there. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] You've got "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World." </joey>
<connor> "Space Jam," "Rush Hour 2." - [Garnt] Is that a comedy? </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] "Scott Pilgrim" is a comedy. </joey>
<joey> - "Scott Pilgrim" is a comedy. </joey>
<connor> - Are you kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt sighs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess it's like a- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fucking comedy. - It's a comedy! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's nonstop jokes. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's, okay, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - It is the best with visual comedy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay, it is definitely a, it's a comedy movie, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not just got a comedy in it because I love, I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - Neither is "40-Year-Old Virgin." </connor>
<joey> It's quite a story of a man coming to lose his virginity. </joey>
<joey> - Of course, it's a great coming of age story. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, coming of 40-year-old age. </connor>
<connor> - And I was thinking like what, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like recently comedy movies have </connor>
<garnt> kind of just died. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if that's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> What's, what's... </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I mean, you know, it's like, </connor>
<garnt> there's like the fucking Will Ferrell movies </garnt>
<garnt> and modern Adam Sandler films, outside of "Uncut Gems," </garnt>
<garnt> have just fucking made it go to, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's literally only it. </garnt>
<garnt> But also the Adam Sandler movies do extremely well </garnt>
<joey> on Netflix. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<connor> - They're some of the most watched things on Netflix. </connor>
<joey> The ones that they bought off- </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've seen an Adam Sandler movie since- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause they're all so mediocre, his new ones. </joey>
<joey> And the only one that he was amazing in </joey>
<garnt> which was, "Uncut Gems" is absolutely fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't even his movie. </garnt>
<connor> He was just, he's the main actor. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard. </connor>
<garnt> Is that a comedy movie or is that just a movie? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, it's a pretty brutal movie. </connor>
<garnt> Really fucking good though. </garnt>
<connor> - All I've seen from that is the clip when he goes, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, I'm gonna cum!" </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> - That's pretty much all I've seen of that movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to watch this movie now! </garnt>
<connor> - What is going on? </connor>
<connor> Adam Sandler, what is happening right now? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly it's a fucking amazing movie. </connor>
<joey> - I need to watch this movie. </joey>
<joey> - It's so fucking good. </joey>
<connor> "Uncut Gems," please watch it if you haven't. </connor>
<connor> I think it's his best role. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, "40-Year-Old Virgin" is like </garnt>
<garnt> to me the infinitely rewatchable comedy movie for me. </garnt>
<connor> - That used to play on British television, </connor>
<garnt> I think like once a fucking week. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's why I've watched it so many times. </garnt>
<joey> - Everyone in the UK has watched it </joey>
<garnt> 'cause it use to play all the fucking time. </garnt>
<joey> - This is also one of those movies </joey>
<joey> that never leaves the airplane. </joey>
<connor> Like, it's always playing. - Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Like, if you look up movies on an airplane, </joey>
<connor> like "the old classics" genre, it's always in there. </connor>
<joey> - There's so many famous scenes in that movie, </joey>
<connor> like the fucking tit scene </connor>
<connor> where they talk about feeling a boob. </connor>
<garnt> - "It's like a sandbag." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - And the fucking waxing scene as well. </joey>
<connor> It's iconic, it's iconic. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like this gets talked about less than maybe, </connor>
<garnt> like at least when it first came out, because the iconic- </garnt>
<garnt> - Was that one if his like most famous, </garnt>
<connor> like was that one of the roles that blew him up? </connor>
<garnt> - This one was when I first started to know Steve Carell </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't know about him before </garnt>
<joey> because I think before that, </joey>
<joey> the only thing I've seen him in was like "Bruce Almighty." </joey>
<joey> But he had like one iconic scene out of that. </joey>
<joey> - He wasn't the main character, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - He wasn't the main character. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it was Jim Carrey. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like this was his first movie </connor>
<joey> where I was just like, "Damn, this guy's funny. </joey>
<connor> "This is a funny fucking movie." </connor>
<connor> But, I remember back when this came out, </connor>
<connor> the iconic comedy movie </connor>
<garnt> when this first came out was "Superbad." </garnt>
<garnt> - Classic. </garnt>
<connor> - It was like 2000s humor. </connor>
<joey> Like those movies were all the rage. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone was quoting "Superbad," </connor>
<garnt> and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I kind of think 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' is funnier." </garnt>
<garnt> That was just (laughs) that was just me back then. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought "Superbad" was funny for like two months. </joey>
<connor> - Nah, nah, when you were in high school, </connor>
<joey> "Superbad" is like the funniest shit. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you're just going to. </joey>
<joey> - When you've heard of like the, </joey>
<joey> you know, 1,000th McLovin' joke, you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, yeah, I get it. </joey>
<joey> "I get." </joey>
<garnt> - It's kind of same with "Borat," right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I should've put "Borat" on mine. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Actually, it's so funny. </garnt>
<connor> Like, Sydney had never seen "Borat" before. </connor>
<connor> So, she watched "Borat" for the first time in 2021 </connor>
<connor> about like a month ago. </connor>
<garnt> And like, me, someone who's like been quoting "Borat" </garnt>
<garnt> throughout my entire high school, it's been quoted to death. </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard to find it funny anymore </garnt>
<connor> because it's just been like, everyone's just- </connor>
<connor> - It's so ingrained. </connor>
<connor> - It's so ingrained that I just cease </connor>
<connor> to find it funny anymore. </connor>
<connor> She still found it fucking hilarious. </connor>
<connor> - It's so funny. </connor>
<garnt> It is legitimately hilarious. </garnt>
<connor> - It is really funny, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, when I watched that movie, all I think is like, </connor>
<joey> "God damn, he's such a fucking amazing actor." </joey>
<joey> There's no movie that even comes close to like </joey>
<connor> that kind of experience, like, of what he does. </connor>
<connor> It's crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Admittedly, you know, </connor>
<joey> like I can probably quote most of that movie, </joey>
<joey> but I'd be lying if I said every time I heard Borat go, </joey>
<joey> "My wife," like, I'm like, that's just hilarious. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause Borat said, "My wife," </garnt>
<garnt> and Sydney just fucking lost it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh shit, this was funny at a point. </garnt>
<garnt> "I forgot this was legitimately funny." </garnt>
<connor> - The genius of fucking "Borat" was that it made you, </connor>
<garnt> on a service level you think that, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, this is just hee hee funny movie," making fun of, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was really just a really fucking intelligent way </garnt>
<joey> of showing how racist America is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And that's how good, </joey>
<joey> and the best part was is </joey>
<joey> that those people were the ones quoting it </joey>
<joey> after the movie came out. </joey>
<joey> But it's like a genius way of showing it </joey>
<joey> in a way that, like, </joey>
<joey> he made a, he showed, like, how, </joey>
<garnt> like, I guess there was like a racist problems in America </garnt>
<connor> before it was like talked about wildly today. </connor>
<joey> And still it was massively marketed towards the audience </joey>
<garnt> that often didn't even know </garnt>
<connor> that that's what he was poking fun at. </connor>
<connor> It's genius. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's what I fucking loved about Ali G </joey>
<garnt> back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, that's a name I haven't heard in so long. </garnt>
<connor> - He has a movie as well. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God, like the first time I watched that, </joey>
<joey> like, I thought everything was scripted. </joey>
<joey> And like a lot of it is, </joey>
<joey> but like some of the interview scenes and stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> like it's all non-scripted. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how the fuck does he do that? </joey>
<connor> - He's just a genius at like being able to turn a situation </connor>
<connor> and like make them look stupid without having </connor>
<connor> to like make them think that he's playing a character. </connor>
<garnt> He's so good at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, he is actually like a social genius. </garnt>
<garnt> He knows how to work people so well. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is like, </garnt>
<garnt> he gets so invested in this character. </garnt>
<connor> It's actually insane. </connor>
<connor> - It must be a nightmare being married to him. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - "Which character are you tonight, honey?" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Like, 'cause I remember like re-watching "Borat" </joey>
<joey> with Sydney, there was this one scene where he gets drunk </joey>
<joey> with a bunch of American frat boys. </joey>
<connor> And at first I was like, "There's no way this is real. </connor>
<connor> "This must be scripted." </connor>
<connor> And so we looked into it, </connor>
<connor> and it's totally real to the point- </connor>
<connor> - He got drunk with them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, to the point where he got like blackout drunk </connor>
<connor> with them and just was able to stay </connor>
<garnt> in character this entire fucking time. </garnt>
<joey> - That's fucking dedication, man. </joey>
<connor> It's insane. </connor>
<connor> - So, I think by the time he goes to do these characters, </connor>
<joey> it's so fucking baked in his head that he's this character </joey>
<garnt> that he doesn't even think, "Oh, I'm doing an act." </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just him. </garnt>
<garnt> - He just thinks this is me which is insane. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's such an insane- </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe you should have put "Borat" on yours. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't put "Borat" on mine. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I did though. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like the whole, I just find it all so fascinating. </garnt>
<connor> And like "What is America" is so fucking funny as well. </connor>
<garnt> Like, oh, he's just so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, he's very, very good. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolute fucking genius. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So aside from that, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> what else haven't you seen Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen everything, oh, "Kung Fu Hustle" I haven't seen. </joey>
<garnt> - "Kung Fu Hustle," fucking, that's, that's- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's a good movie? </garnt>
<joey> - That's a fucking banger. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it looks fucking awesome already. </joey>
<joey> - To me it's like one of the closest you could possibly get </joey>
<joey> to real life anime. </joey>
<joey> It's somehow wacky. </joey>
<garnt> It's a wacky live action kind of slapstick. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, what it does is that it does, </connor>
<garnt> to parody martial arts movies, </garnt>
<garnt> it just makes a martial arts movie that is just an anime. </garnt>
<garnt> All the characters are like, "I have this power." </garnt>
<connor> And then they do like all weird fucking spells and shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So, like the premise of this movie is like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like this like ax gang, this very famous gang, </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason they invade this very, </garnt>
<connor> very small village that nobody's heard of. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like this secret village </connor>
<connor> where coincidentally a lot of martial arts masters have </connor>
<connor> just like all situated in this one city. </connor>
<connor> - I love it already. </connor>
<connor> - So, what happens is firstly, </connor>
<connor> they find three martial arts masters </connor>
<connor> who just happen to live in this city. </connor>
<connor> They didn't know they lived in this city. </connor>
<connor> Like, one person was just like, </connor>
<connor> I think like a barber or something or... </connor>
<connor> - It's been so long since I've watched it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's been so long. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] The noodle store owner. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, one was the noodle store guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] The tailor. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, the tailor, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] One was, like, the laborer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn, you remember the story. </garnt>
<garnt> You remember this better than me, Ashley. </garnt>
<garnt> - Were you in the movie? </garnt>
<garnt> - And so after they find out </garnt>
<garnt> these three martial arts masters are in this village, </garnt>
<garnt> they were like, "Well, we got to send assassins </garnt>
<garnt> "to assassinate them." </garnt>
<garnt> So, they send assassins </garnt>
<connor> to like get rid of these three martial arts masters. </connor>
<connor> And then it turns out that there are even more, like, </connor>
<joey> higher up martial arts masters just living in there. </joey>
<joey> - It's a pyramid. </joey>
<joey> - Hierarchy. </joey>
<joey> - Hierarchy. </joey>
<joey> - Pyramid. </joey>
<joey> And so like they just find out like more OP people </joey>
<garnt> just keep fucking invading this village </garnt>
<garnt> and like more OP heroes just keep coming out </garnt>
<connor> of the woodworks. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's just literally just escalation. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such a fun movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why have I not heard of this movie? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really, if you watch martial arts movies- </garnt>
<joey> - Which I used to. </joey>
<connor> - You'll know about this. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing, during high school, </connor>
<connor> I had like a massive like spree </connor>
<garnt> of just watching every Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movie </garnt>
<garnt> and like all the martial arts movies I could think of. </garnt>
<garnt> - Same here. </garnt>
<joey> - But I never heard of this one for some reason. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I feel like if you did go through </garnt>
<garnt> that martial arts phase, </garnt>
<garnt> this is like one of the peak of just, </garnt>
<connor> it knows the genre so well that it kind of parodies itself. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time takes itself 100% serious. </connor>
<joey> It's just one of the best- </joey>
<connor> - I'd argue that's the best kind of movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly! </joey>
<connor> It does everything well for a martial arts movie, </connor>
<connor> and that's why I love it. </connor>
<connor> It's got the wacky fights, </connor>
<connor> and it's got like the really well choreographed fights </connor>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But speaking of martial arts fights </garnt>
<garnt> that defines my childhood, </garnt>
<garnt> "Rush Hour." </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Speaking of Jackie Chan, there he is right there. </joey>
<joey> - What can you say? </joey>
<garnt> - I wish there was more "Rush Hour." </garnt>
<connor> I need the dynamics. </connor>
<garnt> - I really think that the "Rush Hour" series was what got me </garnt>
<garnt> into the whole martial arts genre to begin with. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, honestly, maybe same. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so funny. </garnt>
<connor> My friend showed me it when I was like really young, </connor>
<connor> and I just fucking fell in love with it. </connor>
<connor> It was so fun. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, it's like Jackie Chan </connor>
<connor> and Chris Tucker is a dynamic </connor>
<connor> that on paper should never work. </connor>
<connor> They should never have the chemistry that they do, </connor>
<connor> but they have such good chemistry. </connor>
<connor> And the amount of times </connor>
<connor> I've rewatched "Rush Hour" one and two, </connor>
<connor> especially in my childhood, was just like uncountable. </connor>
<garnt> I actually don't know how many times I've rewatched it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it like defined like a good, like, </garnt>
<garnt> five-year period of my life </garnt>
<garnt> because that was what started my martial arts phase </garnt>
<garnt> where I just watched so many different martial arts movies, </garnt>
<garnt> it's 'cause of "Rush Hour." </garnt>
<garnt> - Jackie Chan is very, very funny. </garnt>
<joey> - He's one of the most charismatic actors. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like in that that's carried by Jackie Chan, </connor>
<connor> like how good he is at playing like dumb. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So good in this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Him playing off Chris Tucker, it's just, it's just- </garnt>
<connor> - Chris Tucker's just Chris Tucker. </connor>
<connor> And then Jackie Chan. </connor>
<joey> - He's just funny by himself. </joey>
<joey> And Jackie Chan is also like funny by himself </joey>
<joey> for like a completely different reason. </joey>
<joey> It's like completely clash of styles. </joey>
<joey> But like I remember when I was doing, </joey>
<connor> doing, not the anime awards, </connor>
<connor> the Trash Taste awards. </connor>
<connor> When I was doing the "I have a dream" speech. </connor>
<connor> People were just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Wow, Garnt's really parodying Martin Luther King </garnt>
<garnt> "really well." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, I actually just took that speech </garnt>
<connor> from "Rush Hour 2" when Chris Tucker did it </connor>
<garnt> at the casino scene. </garnt>
<joey> - All of your fucking jokes and everything come </joey>
<joey> from fucking movies. </joey>
<joey> - Everything you hear on Gigguk is just movie quotes. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, this is the secret coming out. </joey>
<garnt> When I'm just like, these are the movies I've rewatched </garnt>
<garnt> so many times that they're just ingrained in my mind. </garnt>
<connor> - Was "Rush Hour 2" the best one? </connor>
<garnt> - I think it was. </garnt>
<connor> - What was the plot of "Rush Hour 2," is that the Paris one? </connor>
<garnt> - No, that was "Rush Hour 3." </garnt>
<garnt> That was, that (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> "Rush Hour-" </joey>
<joey> - I love he just immediately knows this. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Yeah, that's 'Rush Hour 3.'" </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember a distinction between any of them. </connor>
<joey> They're all just one. </joey>
<joey> - All of the "Rush Hours" kind of just blend together </joey>
<garnt> for me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I remember "Rush Hour 1" and "2" were the good ones. </joey>
<joey> - Was "3" bad? </joey>
<joey> I don't think "3" was bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I think "3" was average. </garnt>
<joey> - "3" was kind of like the contested one. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, Jackie Chan was getting like a little bit old </garnt>
<garnt> when "Rush Hour 3" happened, </garnt>
<garnt> so like you could tell that he couldn't do </garnt>
<joey> as many stunts as he could do. </joey>
<joey> "Rush Hour 1" and "2" I feel like was Jackie Chan more, </joey>
<joey> like, he could get away with more things. </joey>
<joey> - He was in his prime. </joey>
<joey> - I don't feel it was his prime, </joey>
<connor> but it was definitely closer to his prime. </connor>
<garnt> - The back end of his prime. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I think his prime was in like 1990. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, I remember, I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember as a kid, I slightly preferred "Rush Hour 2." </garnt>
<garnt> I think that was the slightly better movie. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, "Rush Hour 1" is still fucking brilliant </garnt>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I mean, can we also just talk about the fact </joey>
<joey> that I fully expected you to put "Memento" </joey>
<joey> in your three by three. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, why? </joey>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> - It just seems like- </joey>
<connor> - Have I ever talked about it? </connor>
<connor> - No, it just seems like a Garnt movie. </connor>
<joey> - I can picture the Gigguk video. </joey>
<joey> He's like, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Guys, what if I told you you could go back </joey>
<connor> "and get pictures or something?" </connor>
<connor> I just, I feel like I would hear, I would hear like- </connor>
<garnt> - How is that my Gigguk video? </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I can see you making a video about "Memento" </connor>
<joey> even though you never, </joey>
<connor> it just feels like a Gigguk- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, if I can imagine anyone making a "Memento" video, </connor>
<connor> it's either you or John. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> It just seems like the kind of thing you would talk about. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a very like artsy film. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's a really good film. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it an artsy film? </garnt>
<joey> I don't think it's an artsy film. </joey>
<joey> - It's a bit artsy. </joey>
<joey> - It's like Christopher Nolan being Christopher Nolan, </joey>
<connor> being like, "I have 500 IQ. </connor>
<connor> "Watch me try to present my 500 IQ on film." </connor>
<joey> And it's just like, "Memento" is one of the few, like, </joey>
<joey> films I think he's made that actually, </joey>
<garnt> it was just like, "Oh, Nolan, that was pretty smart. </garnt>
<garnt> "I gotta give you-" </garnt>
<joey> - Well, "Memento" actually was written by his brother. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's based off like a four page novella </connor>
<connor> written by Jonathan Nolan. </connor>
<joey> Christopher was like, "You have four pages? </joey>
<joey> "Let me turn that into 400 and get Guy Pearce in it." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember this was one of his first movies </garnt>
<garnt> and they actually, I think this was, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know it was based on a novella </garnt>
<garnt> because I know that they made a short film around this, </garnt>
<garnt> which I've actually seen, and that's also really good, </garnt>
<connor> and they expanded on this idea. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like Nolan with no budget. </connor>
<connor> Like, but still doing the same kind of Nolan ideas. </connor>
<connor> Like, before he had a budget and- </connor>
<garnt> - Like "Tenet." </garnt>
<joey> - It's "Tenet" without a budget. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - And then "Tenet" happens </garnt>
<garnt> and then he forgot that he had to write like characters </garnt>
<connor> and a plot, and just like (laughs) </connor>
<connor> to go along with the cool ideas he had in his head. </connor>
<joey> But like, I feel like this and "Inception," </joey>
<connor> I mean, "Inception" has been memed the fuck </connor>
<connor> to like hell and back. </connor>
<garnt> But I remember the first time I saw "Inception," </garnt>
<joey> I thought it was fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, of course, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, like I will always give Nolan the chance </joey>
<connor> just because his peak- </connor>
<connor> - He always does something interesting. </connor>
<connor> - Like, he always, you know, </connor>
<connor> even if he doesn't make the best movie, </connor>
<connor> he always has interesting ideas </connor>
<connor> and he always tries something new, </connor>
<connor> which is what I can respect. </connor>
<connor> Not everything hits the mark, but it's Nolan. </connor>
<garnt> You can expect that he's not gonna stay in his comfort zone. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, "Memento" is definitely one of those movies </joey>
<joey> that like, well, A, you have to watch more than once </joey>
<garnt> to fully understand it, </garnt>
<joey> but B, even after multiple watches, </joey>
<joey> it's like, "I don't get it." </joey>
<garnt> - So to explain "Memento" to anyone who hasn't seen it, </garnt>
<garnt> this is, yeah, it's gonna sound so weird, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a movie that plays in reverse kind of. </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because it's about this guy </connor>
<garnt> who has a condition that gives him short-term memory loss. </garnt>
<connor> So, he can only remember </connor>
<garnt> at most like five minutes at a time? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Something like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a horrible existence. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's someone like that in real life, I think actually. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, this is an actual real condition </garnt>
<joey> that exists. </joey>
<connor> - Love how they made it into a real thing. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you can't believe it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, I can't believe you have the same condition </connor>
<garnt> as that guy from "Memento." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> But so because of this, </garnt>
<garnt> you're only presented like five minutes of this movie </garnt>
<garnt> at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a movie that plays in reverse. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's about this guy who has this condition </garnt>
<garnt> and is trying to get revenge for the person </garnt>
<garnt> who murdered his wife, </garnt>
<garnt> which, you know, it's... </garnt>
<garnt> Combine a five minute memory, </garnt>
<garnt> a five minute short term memory </garnt>
<garnt> with a long-term revenge plot. </garnt>
<garnt> Things are... </garnt>
<joey> - Things are about to get confusing. </joey>
<garnt> - Things are gonna get confusing, </garnt>
<garnt> especially for the main character. </garnt>
<joey> - Have I watched this movie? </joey>
<joey> - It's the one where, like, every time he comes to again, </joey>
<connor> he looks at his body </connor>
<joey> because he tattoos all of his memories onto his body. </joey>
<connor> - I think I've heard so much about this movie </connor>
<joey> that I think I've seen it, </joey>
<joey> but I don't actually think I've ever seen it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I have actually. </joey>
<joey> - It's very good. </joey>
<joey> - But I know the plot and I know what happens. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone knows the plot to this movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone talks about it. - You know what happens? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, you know the twist, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I believe I do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean, we're not gonna say it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna know just in case I'm wrong. </joey>
<connor> But I think I know what the twist is. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I just remember the first time </connor>
<connor> I watched this movie and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Damn, this is legit, like, really clever." </connor>
<garnt> 500 IQ meme aside, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to have a high IQ to enjoy this movie. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a very well-made movie for such a confusing concept. </joey>
<garnt> - Because at the beginning you were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> how am I supposed to follow along </garnt>
<garnt> when the movie is playing in backwards? </garnt>
<joey> How am I supposed to, like, </joey>
<garnt> how is anything supposed to be surprising to me? </garnt>
<joey> And he finds a way to keep it interesting </joey>
<joey> throughout the entire run of the movie. </joey>
<joey> And then the ending kind of just like slaps you in the face. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, "Oh. </joey>
<connor> "Oh shit, I did not see that coming, okay." </connor>
<joey> And yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then this kind of launched his career, </joey>
<garnt> and I feel like this is one of his best works. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I agree with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you for that talk, Garnt. </garnt>

<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely need to watch "Kung Fu Hustle" </joey>
<joey> and "Confessions." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you watched "Scott Pilgrim?" </garnt>
<connor> - Of course, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I liked "Scott Pilgrim." </garnt>
<garnt> - I really like "Scott Pilgrim." </garnt>
<connor> - It's a good movie. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's a good movie? </connor>
<joey> It's a good movie? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's a really good movie. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm a huge fan of Edgar Wright. </garnt>
<garnt> Edgar Wright's the other director where I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Whatever you make, I'll fucking watch it." </garnt>
<joey> - Edgar Wright is like the master of visual comedy </joey>
<garnt> where like, he manages to cut something in a way </garnt>
<garnt> or just like edit something in a way </garnt>
<joey> that just makes it like, "Whoa, I wasn't expecting that. </joey>
<joey> "But that's hilarious." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's just, he's one of the few people who, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever genre he takes on, </garnt>
<garnt> he'll put his own spin on the genre. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's so rare to find someone </garnt>
<connor> who you can just watch a movie </connor>
<connor> and you can just tell it's Edgar Wright </connor>
<connor> through the editing itself because it's such a- </connor>
<connor> - The snappiness of it. </connor>
<joey> - It's just like the unique and the snappiness and the like- </joey>
<connor> - It's very rhythmic, isn't it? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Is this your favorite Edgar Wright film? </connor>
<garnt> - I think it is. </garnt>
<connor> - I think mine is still "Shaun of the Dead." </connor>
<joey> - I was debating putting "Shaun of the Dead" on. </joey>
<garnt> "Hot Fuzz," I like "Hot Fuzz." </garnt>
<joey> - That's a great movie, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - "Hot Fuzz" is good. </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel like the first half was </garnt>
<garnt> like a little bit boring. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I don't think it's as strong </garnt>
<garnt> as a "Shaun of the Dead." </garnt>
<garnt> And "Scott Pilgrim" I feel like is </garnt>
<garnt> the most Edgar Wright film there is because- </garnt>
<joey> - I feel "Scott Pilgrim" couldn't be made </joey>
<garnt> by any other director. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<garnt> I feel "Shaun of the Dead," Sean Penn... </garnt>
<joey> Is that his name? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Sean Penn. </joey>
<garnt> - Sean Penn and Nick... </garnt>
<joey> - Cannon? </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<garnt> - I was about to say Nick Fury, </garnt>
<garnt> then I was like, wait, that's not- </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] You're thinking of Nick Frost. </joey>
<garnt> - Nick Frost, that's it. </garnt>
<joey> Nick Frost. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] You also said Sean Penn not Simon Pegg. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I said Sean Penn. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, Sean Penn is the one that dies every movie! </joey>
<connor> - I was wondering who you were talking, </connor>
<connor> I was like, I don't think he's, </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to think like when you said that. </connor>
<garnt> - No, Sean Penn is not the one that dies in every movie. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Sean Penn is the one that always dies </joey>
<joey> in every movie. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] No, that's Sean Bean. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that's Sean Bean. - Oh, that's Sean Bean. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is there so many Seans? </garnt>
<connor> - Sean Penn is... </connor>
<garnt> Who's Sean Penn? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] He was married to Robin Wright. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who the fuck is that? </garnt>
<connor> - Whatever. </connor>
<connor> - We got a fucking living IMDb page right here. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] She played Kevin Spacey's wife </garnt>
<garnt> in "House of Cards." </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't seen "House of Cards." </joey>
<joey> - I've seen "House of Cards." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, but going back to "Scott Pilgrim," </garnt>
<joey> the reason I put this on is </joey>
<joey> 'cause like I do really, </joey>
<garnt> really fucking like "Shaun of the Dead." </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like "Scott Pilgrim" is </garnt>
<joey> just the most Edgar Wright movie to exist at the moment. </joey>
<joey> It's him on like his best form. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, </joey>
<joey> this movie kind of, like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like defined a whole generation of nerds. </joey>
<joey> Like, you've seen so many people </joey>
<joey> who just base their entire fucking personality </joey>
<joey> on this one movie. </joey>
<joey> You know who you are. </joey>
<joey> You know who you fucking are. </joey>
<joey> Like, you meet that person at like, </joey>
<joey> you meet one person like that </joey>
<joey> at like every anime convention you go to. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But- </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I think the reason why it works so well </joey>
<joey> is because like again, </joey>
<garnt> Edgar Wright's like way of directing is very </garnt>
<garnt> like over-exaggerated and like very not rooted in reality. </garnt>
<garnt> And that works perfectly with "Scott Pilgrim" </garnt>
<joey> 'cause "Scott Pilgrim" is based off of fucking comic books. </joey>
<joey> It's very comicy. </joey>
<connor> - Was this the first Edgar Wright film you watched? </connor>
<garnt> - No, "Shaun of the Dead." </garnt>
<connor> Like, I literally watched his movies like </connor>
<connor> from the beginning, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I watched "Spaced" before "Shaun of the Dead." </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, I've known of them </garnt>
<garnt> for like a very, very long time. </garnt>
<joey> - I think most people in our age group started </joey>
<joey> with "Shaun of the Dead," right? </joey>
<connor> - I really like "Hot Fuzz." </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Hot Fuzz" is really good. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's a really good film. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's maybe my favorite. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it's, out of like the Cornetto trilogy, </connor>
<connor> it's like the middle favorite for me. </connor>
<garnt> It's like "Shaun of the Dead, "Hot Fuzz," </garnt>
<garnt> then I can't remember the third one then. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] "The World's End." </garnt>
<garnt> - "World's End," that's it! </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I also, I think "Hot Fuzz" is like where I grew up, </connor>
<joey> those kinds of towns. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "Oh shit, that is real." </connor>
<connor> - It's very much like if you're not like familiar </connor>
<connor> with British, like, comedy- </connor>
<joey> - It's literally like they ripped my town. </joey>
<connor> I know they didn't but it's very much similar to- </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like that was the vibe they were going for. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why "Hot Fuzz" like barely made it big in the US </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, you know, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the references Americans don't get. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like "Shaun of the Dead" </garnt>
<joey> and "Hot Fuzz' were both very much cult hits. </joey>
<joey> Because they're very much ingrained in British humor </joey>
<joey> and British culture, you know. </joey>
<connor> You watch "Hot Fuzz" and you probably can get a vibe </connor>
<connor> of what the place like he grew up in, which is like- </connor>
<connor> - Nothing bad happens here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just like not something you can say </connor>
<garnt> for many other British films even. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean people, when people think British films </garnt>
<joey> or British culture, they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's like 'Harry Potter,' right? </joey>
<joey> "Everything's like 'Harry Potter' over there." </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's just wizarding. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I think another thing </joey>
<joey> that's been lost through time was </joey>
<joey> just how fucking unpopular this was </joey>
<joey> when this first came out. </joey>
<joey> Because now it's just like nerd culture. </joey>
<joey> Ha ha mainstream nerd culture. </joey>
<joey> Hi, I'm a nerd guys. </joey>
<connor> I identify as a nerd. </connor>
<joey> But I remember when I first saw this in theaters, </joey>
<joey> I saw this by myself in a completely empty theater </joey>
<garnt> in Brighton. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because nobody wanted to see this fucking movie! </garnt>
<connor> - Was it a marketing issue? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - Was it a marketing issue? </connor>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe the nerds just didn't want to expose themselves. </joey>
<connor> Except for Garnt who's like, "Fuck you, dude." </connor>
<joey> - Normally, it's normally a marketing issue, </joey>
<garnt> especially if it's a good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, this movie fucking bombed in the cinemas. </garnt>
<joey> It was only afterwards- </joey>
<joey> - Definitely a cult. </joey>
<connor> - It definitely became a cult movie that got picked up </connor>
<connor> and more people watched </connor>
<connor> as like nerd culture became more mainstream. </connor>
<connor> But I remember the first time watching this, </connor>
<connor> it blew my fucking mind how good this was. </connor>
<connor> And I couldn't tell anyone about it </connor>
<connor> 'cause nobody was interested in watching it. </connor>
<connor> - Just tell them to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - How do I sell this? </connor>
<connor> How would you sell this to someone? </connor>
<connor> Like, go back 20 years. </connor>
<joey> How do you sell this to someone, </joey>
<garnt> to like one of your mates or something? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just tell them it's really good. </garnt>
<connor> You wanna watch it again. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - "So what's it like? </garnt>
<garnt> "What's it like? </garnt>
<garnt> "Tell me." </garnt>
<garnt> - "I'll just take you. </garnt>
<connor> "Just shut up." </connor>
<connor> - "Shut up and I'll take you. </connor>
<joey> "Don't expect anything." </joey>
<joey> - "Buy some popcorn and have a good time." </joey>
<garnt> - "Is it like the fooey?" </garnt>
<connor> - No, fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> "Space Jam," you already mentioned that you grew up with it </garnt>
<joey> and whatnot. </joey>
<garnt> What about "Matrix" there? </garnt>
<garnt> - "The Matrix," I mean... </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you really feel that strongly about "The Matrix?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly as a kid, yeah, I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - As a kid, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it's one of those things </garnt>
<garnt> where I just care about it as like referential. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's so famous and so referenced. </garnt>
<garnt> But now I don't really give a shit about "The Matrix." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I didn't really give a- </garnt>
<joey> - It was revolutionary when it came out. </joey>
<garnt> It was like, "Whoa, you can do that?" </garnt>
<joey> - I'm also biased. </joey>
<joey> That fucking scene where they put the thing </joey>
<garnt> inside of the stomach gave me nightmares as a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've already talked about that, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That fucking gave me nightmares. </garnt>
<garnt> I will say, I don't think "The Matrix" has aged very well. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no, definitely not. </joey>
<joey> Especially the first one. </joey>
<joey> - I've definitely rewatched it and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh God, I thought this was really cool." </connor>
<connor> I thought this was like the coolest thing when it came out </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's why- </connor>
<garnt> - It's kind of shit. </garnt>
<joey> It's kind of shit. </joey>
<joey> - It definitely hasn't aged well. </joey>
<garnt> - It definitely has not aged well. </garnt>
<joey> - But that's because there's been since "The Matrix," </joey>
<joey> there's been a million "Matrix" clones </joey>
<garnt> that are just shot better. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I mean, like I feel like part of the big reason I got </garnt>
<garnt> into anime was because of "The Matrix' as well. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm just like, I see this, </connor>
<connor> and then this was like my anime taste for a long time </connor>
<connor> because I thought this was cool as shit, </connor>
<connor> and I wanted to find more things like this. </connor>
<connor> - Just iconic as fuck really. </connor>
<connor> - It's iconic as fuck. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I think the first time I saw this, </connor>
<joey> when did this come out? </joey>
<joey> 1999? </joey>
<joey> - '97, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I think I was like nine or 10 </joey>
<joey> when I first saw this. </joey>
<connor> Way too young to be seeing this. </connor>
<connor> But I remember thinking this was like the coolest thing, </connor>
<connor> which it was. </connor>
<connor> - It was. </connor>
<joey> - For the time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, for the time, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - For the time. </garnt>
<connor> - Showing your age there, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - When he like pulls the red and blue pill, it was like, </connor>
<connor> "Which one is he gonna pick?" </connor>
<joey> - I thinK by my age </joey>
<connor> when I was old enough to be able to appreciate it, </connor>
<joey> it'd kind of fallen out. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, definitely because- </joey>
<joey> - I was like, what, like 16? </joey>
<joey> So that was like eight years ago. </joey>
<connor> - At that time, right, </connor>
<joey> there'd already been a million clones of "Matrix." </joey>
<garnt> - By the time that came out for you, </garnt>
<garnt> people who would dress like the people </garnt>
<garnt> in "The Matrix" are like neckbeards holding a katana </garnt>
<garnt> with like a fedora, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If "The Matrix" was made nowadays, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like the person </connor>
<garnt> who's just learned the way of the blade. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't really watch many, like, </garnt>
<connor> nerd movies though growing up. </connor>
<joey> Like, I never watched- </joey>
<joey> - What defines a nerd movie? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what defines nerd movie? </joey>
<joey> - "Star Wars." </joey>
<joey> I've still yet to watch the original "Star Wars" trilogy. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> Or like "Lord of the Rings" or anything like that? </joey>
<joey> - I love "Lord of the Rings." </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's probably the nerdiest of nerd- </joey>
<joey> - I haven't watched "Lord of the Rings." </joey>
<joey> - The fuck? </joey>
<joey> - You haven't watched "Lord of the Rings?" </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what's weirder, </joey>
<connor> not watching "Star Wars" or "Lord of the Rings?" </connor>
<connor> - You haven't watched "Star Wars?" </connor>
<joey> - Okay, you're both fucking weird to me! </joey>
<joey> You haven't watched "Star Wars," </joey>
<joey> you haven't watch "Lord of the Rings." </joey>
<connor> - I feel like you have to watch "Lord of the Rings." </connor>
<joey> - I feel like you have to watch "Star Wars" </joey>
<joey> in that sense then. </joey>
<joey> - No, you don't. </joey>
<joey> - You don't have to, okay. </joey>
<joey> You don't have to watch one, two, and three </joey>
<joey> just at least four, five, six. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've only watched one, two, and three. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I don't count that as watching "Star Wars." </joey>
<connor> - I've not watched the original trilogy. </connor>
<joey> - You have to watch the original trilogy. </joey>
<connor> - I just don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> - If you sat through 12 hours of "Lord of the Rings," </connor>
<joey> you can sit through three "Star Wars" movies. </joey>
<connor> - I used to watch like the director's cut </connor>
<joey> of "Lord of the Ring" back to back. </joey>
<joey> - It's like 15 hours. </joey>
<garnt> - Back when we used to car journey, </garnt>
<garnt> we used to go to France every holiday. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a 12 hour journey. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> like longer than 12. </garnt>
<joey> So, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Great, I'll watch the 'Lord of the Rings' director cuts </joey>
<joey> "back to back in one sitting." </joey>
<connor> I used to do that like on the way there and on the way back. </connor>
<connor> - I like "Lord of the Rings," </connor>
<joey> but that's too much "Lord of the Rings" for me. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly the reason </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't watched "Lord of the Rings" is, </garnt>
<connor> okay, I have watched the first movie. </connor>
<connor> Fell asleep, thought it was boring, never came back. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - How old were you? </joey>
<garnt> - When did it come out? </garnt>
<joey> - The first one? </joey>
<joey> "Fellowship of the Ring" came out in like mid-2000s, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, wait. </joey>
<joey> - It's like 2003 or something, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, something like that. </connor>
<joey> - So, I remember my cousin watching it, and he was like- </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] 'O1. </joey>
<joey> - '01. </joey>
<joey> Holy shit, that's a 20-year-old movie? </joey>
<joey> Sheesh. </joey>
<joey> - So, I think was about like 13, 14 </joey>
<garnt> when I attempted to watch it, and I don't know, like- </garnt>
<joey> - That's like the prime time though! </joey>
<joey> I feel. </joey>
<garnt> - This is gonna sound weird like coming from the isekai guy. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't find fantasy all that interesting. </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> That's all you fucking talk about. </connor>
<connor> That's all you talk about! </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Watch it now. </connor>
<connor> You like fantasy now. </connor>
<garnt> - Bring back Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> This is not Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> - Go back and watch it now. </connor>
<connor> - Anime fantasy, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I fucking fuck with that. </connor>
<garnt> Real life fantasy, get this shit out of my face. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, what a weeb. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> What a fucking weeb. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, go watch it. </connor>
<joey> Actually give it a shot. </joey>
<joey> - "If it doesn't have hot anime titties in an isekai world, </joey>
<joey> "I don't want it." </joey>
<joey> - Basically. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I appreciate the honesty. </connor>
<connor> - Is the main character overpowered? </connor>
<connor> No, Frodo's like, Frodo can't do shit. </connor>
<joey> - That's why it's so good. </joey>
<joey> - That's why it's good because he fights </joey>
<joey> through all of these like insanely impossible </joey>
<joey> to survive situations with the power of friendship, bro. </joey>
<connor> - Every single movie has just amazing scenes in it. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, Sam, best waifu. </joey>
<joey> I'm just saying right now. </joey>
<connor> He's best waifu, dude. </connor>
<connor> He supPorts Frodo from start to finish. </connor>
<connor> - What's your favorite "Lord of the Rings" movie, Joey? </connor>
<connor> - Probably third one. </connor>
<connor> - See, this is what I mean, </connor>
<connor> you can say any one of those movies is the best movie, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "That's totally fair." </connor>
<connor> Like, every single movie is great. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, all three movies are fantastic. </joey>
<garnt> - So good. </garnt>
<connor> You gotta watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe. </connor>
<joey> - We should watch it together. </joey>
<joey> - It's long though. </joey>
<joey> It's long. </joey>
<joey> - We don't have to watch the director's cut and shit. </joey>
<joey> We can watch the normal ones, which is still like 10 hours, </joey>
<joey> but still. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> The director's cut can only really be appreciated </connor>
<connor> after you've loved the first cut </connor>
<connor> because they didn't want the bonus stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You need to make sure you love it first. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I'm sitting you down to watch "Lord of the Rings," </connor>
<connor> I'm sitting you down to watch "Star Wars." </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think you do. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't feel like "Star Wars" is necessary. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, I'm... </connor>
<connor> Okay, I've pissed off "Lord of the Rings" fans. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Let me piss off "Star Wars" fans. </connor>
<connor> - Say it, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - I prefer the prequels. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] What? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I've never just silenced a room so fast. </garnt>
<joey> - That was the loudest one second silence I ever heard. </joey>
<connor> - I know the plot to the original trilogy </connor>
<connor> and like Darth Vader. </connor>
<connor> I just think Darth Vader looks fucking boring. </connor>
<connor> Like, I've played the Lego games, so I know the story. </connor>
<joey> - "So, I basically know 'Star Wars' guys." </joey>
<connor> - I know the story and I just think </connor>
<joey> that like Darth Maul, fucking bad ass. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair- </joey>
<joey> - General Grievous, </joey>
<joey> only the coolest- </joey>
<joey> - Count Dooku? </joey>
<joey> - Count Dooku's meh. </joey>
<joey> General Grievous is the coolest </joey>
<connor> fucking "Star Wars" character. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, to be fair- </joey>
<connor> - Jar Jar Binks, amazing. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - If we're gonna say our hot takes on like "Star Wars," </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna say it, </joey>
<garnt> I think "Episode I" is actually really fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, well, obviously, because I prefer the prequels. </garnt>
<garnt> - Darth Maul fight and the podracing is </garnt>
<joey> like the two greatest scenes in "Star Wars." </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, because the reason I prefer the prequels, </garnt>
<garnt> to defend myself is, okay, number one, </garnt>
<joey> I really don't give a shit about "Star Wars." </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't care less about "Star Wars." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's fair. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just not something I'm interested in. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not passionate about "Star Wars" either. </joey>
<garnt> - The Lego games are just bangers. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> They're great. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like, I remember watching, </connor>
<connor> I've actually seen the original trilogy a lot of times </connor>
<connor> because someone's always got it on in the background. </connor>
<connor> Someone's always watching it at some fucking family, </connor>
<connor> family gathering or something. </connor>
<connor> Or it's like playing at Christmas. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> But someone's always watching it, </connor>
<connor> so I've seen it so many fucking times. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of find it like just boring. </connor>
<garnt> It's just a very standard movie with like, it's just... </garnt>
<garnt> What's original about "Star Wars" nowadays? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, nowadays it's not </joey>
<joey> because again very much like "Matrix" </joey>
<joey> it's just been copied to shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's kind of just like "The Matrix" to me </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just, to me it's just boring now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a very normal standard movie, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like, yeah, Luke goes on a hero's journey </garnt>
<garnt> and Darth Vader is the villain and yada yada yada. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I never like cared </joey>
<joey> to watch episodes seven, eight and nine </joey>
<joey> because in my mind, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> it's not really like a fantasy to- </joey>
<connor> - Is nine out? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] It's been out since what... </connor>
<connor> - See, I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't people like hate the last two movies? </connor>
<joey> - I think so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> "Episode VII" was the only one were people were like, </joey>
<joey> "It was pretty good." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like, to me, there are so many like scenes </garnt>
<garnt> in the prequels that just stand out to me. </garnt>
<joey> Like, that fucking duel with Darth Maul </joey>
<joey> and like fucking Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan. </joey>
<joey> Holy shit! </joey>
<joey> That is iconic! </joey>
<joey> - That fight to this day still is the best fight scene </joey>
<garnt> in "Star Wars" and it has the best theme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - The Darth Maul theme, dude! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Darth Maul was terrifying as well. </connor>
<joey> - Darth Maul was fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Fuck the Darth Vader theme. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck Darth Vader. </joey>
<connor> What's scary about someone having asthma? </connor>
<joey> Like, fucking... </joey>
<connor> I have asthma. </connor>
<connor> Does that make me fucking scary? </connor>
<connor> No, fuck that. </connor>
<garnt> - Also in the prequels, </garnt>
<connor> we didn't get to see Anakin kill the kids. </connor>
<connor> I like that part. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Like, are you kidding me? </joey>
<connor> Like, the first time you see, like, </connor>
<joey> Count Dooku fight Yoda, holy shit, man. </joey>
<garnt> That was, to me, that was like by far the one "Star Wars-" </garnt>
<joey> - The only thing that irks me </joey>
<joey> about the original three episodes is that </joey>
<joey> Yoda is literally a puppet. - General Grievous wasn't </joey>
<joey> in all of them. </joey>
<joey> - Yoda is literally a puppet. </joey>
<joey> - People love that though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<joey> I don't get that. </joey>
<joey> I prefer when he's like, you know, has emotion in his face. </joey>
<joey> - I liked him when he was fucking shit up! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, when he was like flipping in the air and shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - When he brings out the lightsaber </garnt>
<joey> and he starts doing fucking like gymnastics </joey>
<garnt> and all this shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Also I love Samuel L. Jackson though. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. </joey>
<joey> - Samuel L. Jackson is the only thing </joey>
<joey> that made "The Clone Wars" bearable. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When he pulls out the purple lightsaber, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "My man! </joey>
<joey> "Let's go!" </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the coolest, </garnt>
<garnt> the only thing I actually gave a shit </garnt>
<garnt> about "Star Wars" was the jedis, </garnt>
<garnt> and what's not in the fucking, </garnt>
<joey> like what's hardly in the original trilogy </joey>
<joey> and like the sequels? </joey>
<joey> It's the jedis! </joey>
<joey> That's what I want. </joey>
<joey> I want to see cool jedis fights. </joey>
<joey> I want to see cool lightsaber fights. </joey>
<connor> - Also all the best memes come from the prequels. </connor>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> It did get memed to shit. </joey>
<garnt> - So yeah, I'm sticking by my gun. </garnt>
<garnt> I prefer the "Star Wars" prequels. </garnt>
<garnt> Come at me "Star Wars" fans. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wonder how many dislikes this clip's gonna have. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - "Star Wars" is kind of boring. </joey>
<joey> - Fair. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna sit here and pretend </joey>
<garnt> like it's the greatest fantasy story ever written. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, you know, it's dece. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, that's the biggest thing. </joey>
<garnt> I'm more passionate about not caring about "Star Wars" </garnt>
<garnt> and like "Lord of the Rings" I've seen some of </garnt>
<joey> like the action scenes, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I could probably get into it. </joey>
<joey> There's just- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, the battles. </garnt>
<garnt> Bruh! </garnt>
<connor> - The battles are fucking everything. </connor>
<joey> - Battle of Helm's Deep. </joey>
<joey> Bro! </joey>
<connor> Got me acting up. </connor>
<joey> - So good. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Battles are so good! </joey>
<connor> - "Lord of the Rings" battles make me act up. </connor>
<joey> - Yo, we still haven't had battles </joey>
<joey> as good as "Lord of the Rings." </joey>
<connor> It's been like 20 years and nothing has come close. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, give me another hour and a half long fight scene, </joey>
<joey> man, I need that in my life. </joey>
<connor> - It's insane, bro. </connor>
<connor> That guy literally pitched that and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, let's do it." </connor>
<joey> - "So you want the fight scene to be how long?" </joey>
<connor> - And they fucking did it. </connor>
<connor> - They did it. </connor>
<connor> - What's this? </connor>
<connor> - It's an hour and a half battle scene. </connor>
<joey> And it's fucking amazing. - That doesn't cut away </joey>
<joey> to anything. </joey>
<garnt> It's literally an hour and a half of fighting. </garnt>
<joey> - It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - All right, I guess you sold me. </joey>
<garnt> I guess that's all I need. </garnt>
<joey> - They still build character and story in a battle </joey>
<connor> without like bullshit disbelief of, </connor>
<joey> "What's going on? </joey>
<joey> "Is everything okay?" </joey>
<garnt> It's like literally they're like in the middle of fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - They're literally monologuing as they're fighting. </garnt>
<joey> - I actually remember </joey>
<garnt> why I stopped watching "Lord of the Rings" (laughs) 'cause, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I was actually watching it with my cousin. </connor>
<connor> And so they go on this journey and I kept asking, </connor>
<garnt> "Are they there yet?" </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And he literally got so fucking pissed off with me. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I was just like, "Are they there yet? </joey>
<garnt> "When are they gonna get there? </garnt>
<garnt> "Are they close to coming there?" </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "Garnt, shut the fuck up!" </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You also can't watch "Lord of the Rings" </connor>
<connor> with someone who is a giga fan. </connor>
<joey> You need someone to shut the fuck up when you're watching. </joey>
<joey> - That's my pet peeve. </joey>
<joey> - Please, please- </joey>
<joey> - People who love "Lord of the Rings," </joey>
<garnt> unfortunately will tell you everything </garnt>
<connor> about "Lord of the Rings" throughout every single moment. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, please don't be that guy </garnt>
<garnt> who just quotes the movie as it happens. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally can't stand it. </garnt>
<joey> - That is my least favorite thing. </joey>
<garnt> - And like what's even worse is like not even </garnt>
<garnt> when they're quoting out loud, </garnt>
<joey> when they think they're being conspicuous about it </joey>
<joey> and they just like start mouthing to themselves. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, the one I hate more is </joey>
<joey> when they whisper to themselves right before it happens. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I get it, you've seen this movie 17,000 times. </joey>
<joey> Shut the fuck up. </joey>
<joey> - I hate when people are like, "Oh, this part's good." </joey>
<joey> It's like, well, I'll decide that. </joey>
<joey> Don't tell me this part's good. </joey>
<connor> I'm about to fucking watch it. </connor>
<connor> I'll decide if this part is good. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't be that guy please. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I've... </garnt>
<connor> You know, you always have that part </connor>
<connor> where you show someone a movie you really like, </connor>
<connor> but I try to be as subtle about it as I can. </connor>
<connor> Because like, in my mind, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "This good part's coming up." </connor>
<connor> And I'll like try to like see on the corner of my eye </connor>
<joey> if they're watching it. </joey>
<joey> Like, if I was invisible, I'd be like full on Elmo. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<garnt> Like. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't look at me like that. </connor>
<joey> - That's the other pet peeve I have </joey>
<connor> when I'm showing a movie to a friend or whoever </connor>
<connor> and in my head, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, this next scene, they're gonna love." </joey>
<joey> And I look over and they're just out on their phone. </joey>
<joey> Don't be that guy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, don't be that guy. </joey>
<joey> - Etiquette, come on. </joey>
<joey> Movie etiquette. </joey>
<joey> - But anyway, that's my three by three. </joey>
<connor> These are not my favorite films, </connor>
<joey> well some of these I fuck with still. </joey>
<joey> Some of these are just there because (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, they're your childhood movies. </joey>
<joey> - They're my childhood movies. </joey>
<joey> - That's what three by three's all about. </joey>

<joey> What are you doing? </joey>
<joey> - Link's in the description. </joey>
<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<connor> - All right, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Who is next? </connor>
<joey> Oh, should I do it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] All right, who's next? </joey>
<joey> Me or Connor? </joey>
<connor> - Joey is next. </connor>
<joey> I swear I'm always last, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you are. </garnt>
<connor> - Why is that? </connor>
<connor> All right, well, hopefully mine won't be too pretentious. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> What? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Is mine pretentious? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - At first I saw "Apocalypse Now" and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> did you just go through the IMDb top 250? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so I'll go through them. </joey>
<garnt> So, from top left to bottom right we have "King's Speech," </garnt>
<garnt> "Rashomon," "Bruce Almighty," </garnt>
<garnt> "Apocalypse Now," "Pulp Fiction," </garnt>
<joey> "Goodfellas," "Austin Powers Goldmember," </joey>
<joey> "Gladiator," and "Kamera o Tomeru na." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I've seen every English speaking movie. </garnt>
<connor> - I had a feeling you'd put Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - What are these Japanese movies? </connor>
<connor> - What are these Nihongo movies? </connor>
<garnt> I say that as I put one on mine. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so which ones have you guys seen and not seen? </joey>
<connor> - All of these except for, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've seen "Apocalypse Now." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you've never seen "Apocalypse Now?" </joey>
<garnt> - Actually I haven't seen "Apocalypse Now" either. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What? - The two Japanese films. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so like as I was saying earlier, </joey>
<joey> like I always have that like top three movies </joey>
<joey> in case anyone at like a panel always asks me. </joey>
<joey> And my top three that I always bring up is "Apocalypse Now," </joey>
<joey> "Pulp Fiction," and "Goodfellas." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, those are all fucking bangers, honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, this is top 10 IMDb films. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like "Goodfellas" and "Pulp Fiction" </joey>
<connor> definitely are like top 20. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, "Goodfellas" and "Pulp Fiction" are </connor>
<joey> definitely up there. </joey>
<connor> - I've never, wait, no, I haven't watched "Goodfellas." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you've never seen "Goodfellas?" </joey>
<joey> - I've never watched "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, have you not? </joey>
<joey> - You know how you said like sometimes you just save a movie </joey>
<garnt> that you just know you're gonna love? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, you know, I don't need to watch it right now, </garnt>
<connor> but I know I will and I know I'll enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean, like, I feel like if we're going through like </joey>
<connor> that IMDb thing, like most people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, 'Godfather.'" </connor>
<connor> Like, the "Godfather" trilogy, yeah, </connor>
<connor> that's definitely one of those. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, the "Godfather" trilogy is good </connor>
<joey> and like, I like a lot of Martin Scorsese films. </joey>
<joey> But I think out of all of them, "Goodfellas," </joey>
<joey> it's a tie for me between "Goodfellas" and "Casino." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I feel like "Casino" is so underrated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Casino" I feel is a very </garnt>
<garnt> underrated Martin Scorsese film. </garnt>
<garnt> But I put "Goodfellas" there because it was like- </garnt>
<joey> - It's the classic. </joey>
<joey> - It's the classic, it was the first, like- </joey>
<garnt> - Safe. </garnt>
<garnt> Safe is what I'm seeing here, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the first Martin Scorsese like gangster film </garnt>
<garnt> I ever watched. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> and then obviously I went back after that and was like, </garnt>
<joey> I'll watch "Godfather" and "Taxi Driver" and like all those. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the thing about "Godfather" is that, </garnt>
<joey> I obviously recognize it as a good movie, </joey>
<joey> but there's a difference between me being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is a really good movie" to "This is a movie </joey>
<joey> "that I really personally enjoy." </joey>
<joey> And for me, "Godfather" is like something </joey>
<joey> that I could recognize as really good. </joey>
<joey> It was just a bit slow sometimes. </joey>
<joey> I feel like Martin Scorsese gangster films is </joey>
<joey> just "Godfather" but just a bit more condensed, </joey>
<garnt> a bit more snappy, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I mean, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Martin Scorsese did "The Departed?" </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he did "Departed" as well. </joey>
<garnt> - And that's probably one of my favorite. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a fantastic film. </connor>
<connor> I mean, again, everything he's made, </connor>
<joey> like "Wolf of Wall Street" as well was fantastic. </joey>
<garnt> - Martin Scorsese is just- </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just a really, really good filmmaker. </garnt>
<connor> - Consistent. </connor>
<joey> - "Raging Bull" as well was another one. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Basically every movie you can think of </joey>
<joey> that has Robert De Niro in it, probably a Scorsese film. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci is </garnt>
<garnt> just like one of the best duos. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you see them together </garnt>
<garnt> and you know it's gonna be a banger film. </garnt>
<joey> - The part that killed me though was like, I remember, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I was telling Aki about this, the "Goodfellas" movie, </connor>
<connor> 'cause she'd never seen it before, </connor>
<connor> and she was like, "Who's in it?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you know, Robert De Niro and like Joe Pesci." </connor>
<joey> She was like, "Yeah, I know." </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, "Oh, and Ray Liotta is in it as well." </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Oh yeah, I know that guy from 'Bee Movie.'" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - How does she know that? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause she loves "Bee Movie!" </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "You're dead to me." </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that poor man. </garnt>
<joey> - Ray Liotta's legacy is literally "Goodfellas" </joey>
<joey> and "Bee Movie." - And "Bee Movie." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I deadass can't think of another Ray Liotta movie. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure he's been in a bunch of other movies. </joey>
<garnt> - I know I've seen him in other things. </garnt>
<garnt> I just can't think of it off the top of my head. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I mean like I don't really have </garnt>
<connor> to explain "Pulp Fiction." </connor>
<connor> It's like one of the most cult classic fucking- </connor>
<connor> - I like cinema. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, I swear to God, it was like either, </garnt>
<joey> if you want to look like you have a personality </joey>
<joey> in university, you put a Quentin Tarantino poster </joey>
<joey> on your wall. </joey>
<joey> - It's either a "Pulp Fiction" poster </joey>
<joey> or a "Reservoir Dogs" poster. </joey>
<connor> - I put a Tarantino film on my list, </connor>
<joey> so I guess we can debate it when we get to that. </joey>
<connor> Which one is the- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I've seen everything by Tarantino. </connor>
<connor> He's like one of my favorite directors, </connor>
<garnt> but I still think to this day, </garnt>
<joey> "Pulp Fiction" is, in my personal opinion, is my favorite. </joey>
<joey> It's really close between "Pulp Fiction" </joey>
<garnt> and "Reservoir Dogs." </garnt>
<garnt> - I still put "Reservoir Dogs." </garnt>
<connor> - I'll save my points for mine. </connor>
<connor> - We'll save that debate. </connor>
<joey> And then "Apocalypse Now" is my favorite war film. </joey>
<joey> - What's the plot of "Apocalypse Now?" </joey>
<joey> - What's it even about? </joey>
<joey> - So, "Apocalypse Now" is based on the Vietnam War. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's all I know about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - With like basically the, </garnt>
<garnt> it's told from the American side </garnt>
<connor> where like American troops are told, </connor>
<connor> so Martin Sheen is the main character, </connor>
<connor> and he is like set on a mission to go and pick up a soldier </connor>
<joey> from like, he's like a vet. </joey>
<joey> - Who's the director? </joey>
<joey> - Francis Ford Coppola. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the same person who made "Godfather." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<joey> - So, Francis Ford Coppola, </joey>
<joey> like this is like one of his most famous films, I think. </joey>
<joey> Did you know that Francis Ford Coppola is </joey>
<joey> actually the uncle to Nicholas Cage? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, random fact I found out the other day. </joey>
<garnt> But anyway, so basically it's set </garnt>
<garnt> where like Martin Sheen's character's team has to go </garnt>
<garnt> into the Vietnam forest to go and look for this like vet </garnt>
<garnt> who holds a lot of information about the Vietnam War. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically he's kind of gone insane </garnt>
<garnt> and is living in the Vietnam like- </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's Marlon Brando, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Marlon Brando. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically, it's, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> So, Marlon Brando's character is this like Viet </connor>
<connor> like soldier vet </connor>
<connor> who like holds a lot of information </connor>
<connor> and like he needs to be brought back to the US army. </connor>
<garnt> Basically Martin Sheen's character goes in, </garnt>
<garnt> tries to fight off all the Vietcong </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, tries to get him back basically. </garnt>
<garnt> But as Martin Sheen's character is going </garnt>
<garnt> through all of these like life and death situations, </garnt>
<connor> stuff like that, he too also slowly starts to lose his mind. </connor>
<connor> And then eventually, and then, you know, </connor>
<connor> that poster there is pretty much- </connor>
<connor> - Fucking awesome poster. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much sums up. </connor>
<connor> Like, that scene where he like comes out of the pool </connor>
<connor> as there's like fighting happening is </connor>
<connor> one of the coolest fucking scenes in cinema. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna watch that. </connor>
<connor> That sounds cool. </connor>
<connor> - Marlon Brando is like fantastic, Martin Sheen is- </connor>
<garnt> - Is it a thinky movie? </garnt>
<joey> - How much do I have to think during this movie? </joey>
<joey> - Well, okay, so "Apocalypse Now" has </joey>
<connor> like a director's cut called "Apocalypse Now Redux," </connor>
<connor> which is like three and a half hours long. </connor>
<connor> - How long is the original? </connor>
<connor> - Three hours. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, it's still a long movie. </joey>
<joey> - Because here's the thing about "Apocalypse Now" </joey>
<joey> 'cause everything you described </joey>
<garnt> I already kind of knew about it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I knew like the basic plot description </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> What makes it good? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so in my opinion what makes it really good is </joey>
<joey> just the, well, first of all, it's like, </joey>
<garnt> the music choice in that movie is fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like everything I fucking love. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, in my opinion, "Apocalypse Now" still has </garnt>
<garnt> one of the greatest opening scenes </garnt>
<connor> of any movie. - Iconic, iconic. </connor>
<connor> - Very iconic. </connor>
<connor> But I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's also just like, again, </connor>
<connor> it's like it takes that like kind of war element </connor>
<connor> and weirdly enough, it's a Vietnam War film </connor>
<garnt> that doesn't really have a whole lot of fighting. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, really the most amount of like fighting </garnt>
<garnt> between the US army and Vietnam really happens </garnt>
<garnt> in like the first like maybe 20 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the rest of the movie is literally </garnt>
<garnt> just you're inside the mind of Martin Sheen's character </garnt>
<garnt> as he's like slowly venturing closer and closer </garnt>
<connor> to his target and he's slowly like losing his mind </connor>
<connor> as a result of war. </connor>
<connor> And it's like a very, like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's like a really weird like psychological twist </connor>
<connor> on a war movie that you don't really, </connor>
<joey> 'cause when you think of a war movie, </joey>
<joey> you think of like "Saving Private Ryan," </joey>
<joey> where like, yeah, there's obviously a lot of like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> soldiers getting fucked up in the war scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> But like there's also a lot of like fighting scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, gun fighting scenes or whatever the fuck it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas "Apocalypse Now" doesn't really have </garnt>
<garnt> a whole lot of that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's almost like a psychological horror set </garnt>
<garnt> during the Vietnam War. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that's what makes, </garnt>
<joey> personally that's what makes it really interesting to me. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is I think I know more </garnt>
<garnt> about "Apocalypse Now" </garnt>
<joey> than actually seeing the movie itself. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I know like, </joey>
<joey> I think this has like a really interesting story </joey>
<joey> behind how it was made </joey>
<joey> because like I think, </joey>
<joey> the director himself I think almost went bankrupt </joey>
<joey> making this movie or something like that. </joey>
<joey> Because he had to like convince the studio that he owns </joey>
<joey> or something to like lend him the money to make this movie. </joey>
<joey> And he was out there for like months </joey>
<garnt> and months shooting this movie and it almost wasn't made. </garnt>
<joey> And I think like Marlon Brando </joey>
<garnt> just refused to read the script. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Marlon Brando refused to remember his lines. </joey>
<connor> - He's been notorious for that. </connor>
<connor> - But this was the first movie </connor>
<connor> where he started to become like this. </connor>
<connor> And then "The Godfather" I think happened </connor>
<garnt> after "Apocalypse Now" which like then, </garnt>
<joey> or was it the other way around? </joey>
<joey> - I think it was the other way around. </joey>
<joey> - It might've been the other way around. </joey>
<joey> But basically, yeah, </joey>
<joey> Marlon Brando doesn't appear in this movie </joey>
<joey> until maybe about two and a half hours in. </joey>
<garnt> - I think like most of his lines are just like ad-libbed </garnt>
<connor> because he just refused to remember his lines. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, how does that work? </connor>
<connor> How does that work? </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever seen any of the movies </joey>
<joey> that he's in, </joey>
<joey> but I know that he's like notorious </joey>
<connor> for being awful to work with. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean, you know, like during his prime </joey>
<connor> obviously he was a fantastic, </connor>
<connor> and you know, he's still a fantastic actor in this movie </connor>
<connor> as well, but it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's very clear that he's not like at his peak. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like Martin Sheen's performance </connor>
<connor> in this movie is just so God damn good </connor>
<connor> that like he does such an amazing job of like </connor>
<garnt> really like progressively showing someone going insane. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> My opinion, fantastic movie. </joey>
<connor> - I remember, I think he was on Joe Rogan I think... </connor>
<joey> - Martin Sheen? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> Robert Downey Jr. Was on it and he was talking about </garnt>
<connor> that sometimes he didn't remember lines. </connor>
<connor> I think when he did... </connor>
<connor> Which I think "Sherlock" he remembered all his lines. </connor>
<connor> But other movies he was just like, "Put an earpiece in. </connor>
<connor> "Just feed me my lines." </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, especially when he's like Iron Man, </garnt>
<garnt> he's just acting Robert Downey Jr. </garnt>
<connor> - He was saying, you know, </connor>
<connor> some films don't require me to get that deep </connor>
<connor> into their character so there's no point </connor>
<connor> in spending all this time learning the lines. </connor>
<connor> But like, I think for like "Sherlock," </connor>
<connor> it was like quite difficult, </connor>
<connor> some of the lines in the way that he was doing it </connor>
<connor> so he wanted to learn it. </connor>
<connor> He was just like, "Yeah, it depends on the movie." </connor>
<connor> But the way he made it sound made it seem like, </connor>
<connor> oh, that makes sense. </connor>
<joey> Then when you hear about like the third party accounts </joey>
<joey> of Marlon Brando, it's like, </joey>
<connor> oh my God, this sounds like fucking hell. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> And I bet like, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's a lot of big actors in this, </joey>
<joey> like Harrison Ford's in this movie as well. </joey>
<connor> - This before he's angry at everything? </connor>
<joey> - This is before he's angry. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but like, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Just really, really good movie in my opinion. </joey>
<garnt> And then- </garnt>
<joey> - "The King's Speech?" </joey>
<joey> - I was surprised. </joey>
<garnt> That came out of nowhere 'cause I've never- </garnt>
<joey> - What, "King's Speech?" </joey>
<garnt> - I've never heard Joey mention this film ever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so to be fair, </garnt>
<joey> this is probably the most recent film I watched </joey>
<joey> that really made a massive impact on me 'cause- </joey>
<connor> - Is it 'cause Aki's obsessed with the Royal family? </connor>
<connor> - No, it's because Aki's obsessed with biopics. </connor>
<connor> - Ah. </connor>
<connor> - So before I met Aki, </connor>
<connor> I never really cared to watch a lot of like biopics. </connor>
<connor> Biopics are like movies based off </connor>
<connor> of real people's lives essentially. </connor>
<connor> And so I watched a shitload of biopics with Aki. </connor>
<garnt> So, like "Imitation Game" was another one I was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> of putting here. </garnt>
<connor> Like, "Theory of Everything" is another great movie. </connor>
<connor> But I don't know, something about "King's Speech," </connor>
<connor> I mean, firstly, I fucking love Geoffrey Rush. </connor>
<connor> He's like one of my favorite actors. </connor>
<joey> Like, everything that he had, </joey>
<joey> and he does such a fucking good job in this movie as well. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know, it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's a really simple movie, </joey>
<connor> but it's just the acting in this is </connor>
<connor> just so God damn believable. </connor>
<connor> It's just so good. </connor>
<connor> - I've never actually watched it. </connor>
<joey> But I also, when I was growing up my best mate </joey>
<joey> for like my whole childhood had like a really bad stutter. </joey>
<joey> So I always had to order for him at things and everything. </joey>
<connor> I don't know, this movie came out </connor>
<connor> and I think it was a big deal. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it won best picture at the Oscars. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it did. </connor>
<connor> I mean, like, the only reason I knew a lot </connor>
<garnt> about stuttering was, again, my best mate had it </garnt>
<connor> and had to go to a bunch of like therapy and stuff </connor>
<connor> to try and get it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> like even like at like 16, 17, 18 couldn't like, </connor>
<joey> you know, order at places. </joey>
<connor> And so I just got used to doing it. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, it was really interesting </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think in the movie they kind of like gloss over it. </connor>
<connor> But like in real life, </connor>
<garnt> the way that you like you can solve it, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like so many different methods. </garnt>
<connor> My mate had to wear like a belt, </connor>
<connor> like a big belt around his chest </connor>
<joey> to make his breathing different </joey>
<joey> so that he wouldn't stutter. - Oh wow. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, the movie actually does go through </connor>
<connor> like all the actual steps that- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I haven't seen it so I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - That the king actually had to go through </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<joey> And like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's really interesting as well. </joey>
<joey> And it's just cool to think that like a lot </joey>
<garnt> of this stuff actually happened in real life. </garnt>
<connor> At the end, like King George? </connor>
<connor> What's his name? </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, whatever the king's name was, </connor>
<connor> like actually got over his stutter in real life </connor>
<connor> as a result of this dude who just, you know, solved it. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know, it's just, </connor>
<connor> like, it's very like, </connor>
<connor> because you like meticulously watch </connor>
<garnt> through like every single step </garnt>
<garnt> and every failure of the king trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get over his stutter, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like the ending speech is just really powerful </garnt>
<joey> and like really rewarding being like, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck yeah, dude, you nailed that shit. </joey>
<joey> "My man, let's go!" </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I saw it a while ago </garnt>
<garnt> and I just remember it was a good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think this movie got me into biopics. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, okay, you know what? </garnt>
<joey> Biopics might be kinda cool. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad you guys didn't put any like documentaries </connor>
<connor> or anything. </connor>
<connor> I was like, we have to save that for another time. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We'll save that for another. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we'll save that for another time. </joey>
<garnt> - Connor would do like a fucking 10 by 10. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll bring a 100 by 100 for you, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Can I just do like a one by one? </joey>
<connor> It's just "Supersize Me." </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> And then obviously "Bruce Almighty" we're talking </connor>
<joey> about like, who hasn't seen "Bruce Almighty?" </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Morgan Freeman as God. </garnt>
<joey> I still think of Morgan Freeman as God. </joey>
<joey> Just because of "Bruce Almighty." </joey>
<connor> - It's like the most 2000s film ever. </connor>
<garnt> - It is like the quintessential Jim Carrey movie. </garnt>
<joey> - When did it come out? </joey>
<joey> Might've come out in 90s. </joey>
<joey> But I think of this </joey>
<connor> like encapsulates the feeling of the 2000s. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, like everyone in it is amazing. </joey>
<garnt> It's still funny to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] '03. </garnt>
<joey> - '03, God damn. </joey>
<joey> - Because of this movie, </joey>
<garnt> if I die and I don't see Morgan Freeman at the pearly gates. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll just want to refund on life. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll be like, "Take me to hell." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - "I specifically died with the expectation </connor>
<connor> "that Morgan Freeman would be here waiting." </connor>
<joey> - And then what's another obvious one. </joey>
<joey> I mean, "Austin Powers Goldmember." </joey>
<garnt> - Before we get to these ones, explain the Japanese films. </garnt>
<joey> - The Japanese ones, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Explain the Nihongos. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Wait, which one do you want to hear about? </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] First one, the top one. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] The top one, okay. </joey>
<joey> So "Rashomon," so this was during a time, </joey>
<joey> this was during like a very, </joey>
<joey> I guess pretentious period of my high school life, </joey>
<joey> where I was like, I want to watch a lot of really old films. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Oh gosh. </joey>
<joey> - So "Rashomon" is one, </joey>
<joey> it's done by this guy called Akira Kurosawa. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it's an Akira Kurosawa. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's an Akira Kurosawa film </joey>
<joey> who's known as like one of the greatest film directors </joey>
<joey> of all time. </joey>
<joey> - Hello, I'm a film buff. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Mention one name. </joey>
<garnt> Hello, I'm a film buff. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm a pretentious film buff. </joey>
<joey> So I sat down and watched every Akira Kurosawa film </joey>
<connor> and "Rashomon" is one of them. </connor>
<connor> And it's essentially, it's really hard to kind of explain. </connor>
<joey> But basically I think this movie was made in like 1950, </joey>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> Black and white film. </joey>
<joey> But basically it revolves around this like one murder case </joey>
<joey> that happens in like Edo period Japan, </joey>
<joey> and the same I guess murder is told </joey>
<joey> from different perspectives and different characters. </joey>
<joey> So like, it kind of plays around, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it was the first movie to ever do it, </joey>
<joey> but it kind of plays around </joey>
<joey> with the whole like unreliable narrator like logic </joey>
<joey> that a lot of movies use now. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> the cinematography in it is like, </joey>
<joey> it's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that's why every fucking big director </garnt>
<garnt> and big film buff still says his name. </garnt>
<joey> - Akira Kurosawa is your favorite director's </joey>
<garnt> favorite director. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, I feel "Rashomon" was one of those movies </garnt>
<garnt> that like took everything that Akira Kurosawa was </garnt>
<garnt> like really good at in terms of filmmaking, </garnt>
<garnt> and just like crushed it </garnt>
<garnt> into like an hour 30 minute like solid movie. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, Mifune Toshiro is like the guy in the poster </garnt>
<garnt> who's in like basically every fucking Akira Kurosawa movie. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, he's one of my favorite Japanese actors </garnt>
<garnt> just because like, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> He kinda, you know, </connor>
<connor> that like weird stigma of Japanese acting </connor>
<connor> where it's like way over the top </connor>
<garnt> and like really unrealistic? </garnt>
<garnt> - We've talked about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which we talked about. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, Mifune Toshiro in my opinion like kind of took that </garnt>
<joey> and almost made it his own. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like every Mifune Toshiro character is </joey>
<joey> like so over-exaggerated in terms of like emotion </joey>
<joey> and like movement and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'd be very surprised </joey>
<connor> if he didn't do like theater training and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> But like, I don't know, it's over-exaggerated </connor>
<joey> but it's still like believable, if that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> And it like, it becomes really like kind of, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the right word for it is. </joey>
<joey> I know I sound very pretentious right now, </joey>
<joey> but it's a real- </joey>
<joey> - Go ahead, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - But like in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> like there's lots of really good Akira Kurosawa movies. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the only one I've seen is "Seven Samurai." </garnt>
<joey> - "Seven Samurai." </joey>
<garnt> - The classic. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a classic. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that the one where that like fight scene goes on </garnt>
<connor> for so God damn long? </connor>
<joey> - That might be. </joey>
<connor> I mean, there's a lot of like- </connor>
<connor> - That was a really weird. </connor>
<garnt> - There's a lot of fight scenes in Akira Kurosawa movies. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Seven Samurai," did it have a remake? </garnt>
<joey> - There was a western remake. </joey>
<garnt> - There was a western remake, </garnt>
<connor> also "The Magnificent Seven" is the Western version </connor>
<connor> of that film, which is also a classic. </connor>
<garnt> - I think maybe I watched, </garnt>
<garnt> what's it called, "13 Assassins," </garnt>
<connor> That's a remake right of... </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, actually. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] That is a different. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a different story, is it? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there a really, really long fight in "Seven Samurai?" </connor>
<joey> - I don't know about "Seven Samurai," </joey>
<joey> but like the one that I can think of </joey>
<joey> that has a really long flight is probably "Ran." </joey>
<garnt> - You've probably seen "Seven Samurai" </garnt>
<joey> if you've gone through, </joey>
<joey> if you went through the phase of going </joey>
<joey> through the IMDb top 250. </joey>
<joey> - You've probably seen about five different Akira Kurosawa- </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I watched a movie called "Seven Samurai" </joey>
<joey> that was in black and white, </joey>
<connor> and there was a fight scene that was like two hours long. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like sitting there like, </connor>
<connor> "When is it gonna end?" </connor>
<joey> - I don't know about, </joey>
<joey> I don't think "Seven Samurai" was even two hours long. </joey>
<joey> - No, it was. </joey>
<garnt> It was like three and a half hours long. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't remember. </connor>
<joey> - Is there a long fight scene in "Seven Samurai?" </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was just a very long movie in general. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you Google it? </garnt>
<connor> Like long fight scene- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's probably the film you're thinking of. </garnt>
<joey> - I just wanna know if I watched it. </joey>
<joey> - You've probably seen it. </joey>
<garnt> It's a classic. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's definitely on the IMDb, </garnt>
<joey> like there's probably about five Akira Kurosawa films </joey>
<joey> if you go through the IMDb. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's actually only one. </joey>
<garnt> It's only "Seven Samurai," I was about to say. </garnt>
<joey> - Big sad, big sad. </joey>
<joey> - Because that's the only one that's on the IMDb top 250. </joey>
<garnt> So, that's the only one that most people have only seen. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though he has like such a wealth of work. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, "Ran" was I think his first color film </joey>
<joey> and that was also fucking fantastic. </joey>
<connor> I think the stigma is that a lot of Akira Kurosawa films are </connor>
<connor> like based around like samurai and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> When like later on in his career, </connor>
<connor> he did a lot of like kind of rooted more </connor>
<connor> in like modern day stuff. </connor>
<connor> There's another film </connor>
<connor> that I thought about putting up there called "Ikiru" </connor>
<connor> which means to live. </connor>
<connor> And it's essentially this like kind of coming of age story </connor>
<connor> of this old man who realizes that he's like about to die </connor>
<connor> and basically like, </connor>
<connor> you know, the movie "The Bucket List" </connor>
<connor> with fucking Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. </connor>
<connor> I feel that completely ripped off of "Ikiru" </connor>
<connor> because it's almost like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause the concept is exactly the same. </connor>
<connor> It's like an old guy wanting </connor>
<garnt> to like kind of rediscover his life </garnt>
<garnt> and like really like give meaning to his life </garnt>
<garnt> on his death bed. </garnt>
<garnt> But like told in like a really like cool, </garnt>
<garnt> artistic Akira Kurosawa-esque way. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, he's a legend for a reason </garnt>
<joey> especially in the film industry. </joey>
<joey> - If you're a movie buff, please watch Akira Kurosawa. </joey>
<garnt> - What's this? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never... </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, "Kamera o Tomeru na" is a, there's this- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a zombie movie, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so basically it's this movie, have you seen it? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, I was not expecting anything out of this movie. </joey>
<joey> So I actually watched this film- </joey>
<joey> - When did it come out? </joey>
<joey> (Joey sighs) </joey>
<joey> - Quite, quite recently. </joey>
<connor> Like, a couple of years ago. </connor>
<connor> So, I thought it was just gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> okay, so the reason why I think this movie is genius </connor>
<connor> is the way that it was marketed. </connor>
<connor> So the way that it's marketed, </connor>
<connor> you look at this poster and you think, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's a zombie film. </connor>
<connor> "Like, a B grade zombie film kind of thing." </connor>
<connor> It's completely not. </connor>
<connor> It basically takes the zombie film thing </connor>
<connor> and turns it super fucking meta. </connor>
<connor> So basically what it is, it's like, </connor>
<joey> I don't want to give too much away, </joey>
<joey> but basically the movie opens </joey>
<joey> with this 15, 20 minute one cut zombie film. </joey>
<joey> Like, there's no cuts in it whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> And then you think, oh, the credit's roll and that's it. </joey>
<joey> But then what happens is it goes back, </joey>
<joey> and it shows you how that one cut movie is made </joey>
<joey> but told in a fictional way. </joey>
<joey> It's really difficult, it's really fucking meta. </joey>
<joey> It's basically- </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh, that sounds cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically a movie on, </garnt>
<joey> and there's like all sorts of like weird, </joey>
<joey> like it's actually a comedy. </joey>
<joey> There's also like there's all these </joey>
<joey> like weird comedic shenanigans </joey>
<garnt> that happen behind the scenes of them shooting </garnt>
<garnt> that one shot 20 minutes zombie film. </garnt>
<garnt> So, the movie is about the making of that movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - That honestly sounds like it's right up my alley. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I think you'd love it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, this is, that's- </joey>
<connor> - Garnt wants to stop recording right now. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll make a fucking video on this. </garnt>
<joey> - I was not expecting this movie to be good at all, </joey>
<connor> but it was, one, it's really, really funny. </connor>
<joey> And two, again, like the whole meta aesthetic of it, </joey>
<connor> I was like, whoa I've never. </connor>
<connor> And it gets even more meta because during the credit scenes, </connor>
<garnt> then there's a behind the scenes camera of that camera. </garnt>
<garnt> So, it's like a movie within a movie within a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> I just love like the whole meta aesthetic of it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like I put this on there because like for one, </garnt>
<garnt> I barely know anyone who's seen it. </garnt>
<joey> - I've never even heard of it until now. </joey>
<connor> - I guess people will now. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] The English title is "One Cut of the Dead." </garnt>
<garnt> - "One Cut of the Dead." </garnt>
<garnt> That sounds so cliche though. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's exactly it. </joey>
<joey> Like, it plays to the strengths of zombie film cliches </joey>
<connor> and just completely flips it on his head </connor>
<garnt> and just turns it into like this wacky slapstick comedy. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's really, really cool. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like an episode of "Haruhi" or something, right? </joey>
<joey> - Honestly. </joey>
<joey> It's like if "Endless Eight" was good. </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] Sorry, it came out in 2017. </connor>
<garnt> I forgot. </garnt>
<garnt> - 2017. </garnt>
<garnt> - 2017, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like the last zombie movie that I watched </garnt>
<connor> that I really fucking enjoyed was "Train to Busan." </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's good. </connor>
<joey> - I haven't watched "Train to Busan." </joey>
<joey> - That's a fantastic movie. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking so good. </joey>
<joey> Like, I can't explain why it's really good </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's just like a very, </joey>
<connor> like, it has like the same beats </connor>
<connor> as just a standard zombie movie, </connor>
<connor> but it's just a really good movie. </connor>
<connor> - Just a solid movie. </connor>
<connor> - It is a solid movie. </connor>
<joey> Even if like, you think you're bored of the zombie genre, </joey>
<joey> like- </joey>
<joey> - I think I am. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I thought I was. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, if you're bored of the zombie genre, </connor>
<joey> you need to watch that. </joey>
<connor> - And then I got to watch "Train to Busan." </connor>
<connor> And then I gotta watch other shit too. </connor>
<connor> Fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - No, but like "One Cut of the Dead," </garnt>
<garnt> that was the title, right? </garnt>
<garnt> "One Cut of the Dead," like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I feel, </garnt>
<garnt> if there's any movie I can recommend on my three by three, </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably that one just because it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I like how we both put it in the bottom right as well. </garnt>
<garnt> The bottom left, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, it completely destroys what you think about movies </joey>
<garnt> in a way that's like really fun. </garnt>
<joey> And also like, just again, it's just meta as fuck. </joey>
<joey> If you love that whole meta thing, </joey>
<joey> like you'd love that film. </joey>
<connor> And then I put "Gladiator" on there just 'cause it's- </connor>
<connor> - I probably would put "Gladiator" too. </connor>
<connor> It's a good film. </connor>
<garnt> - It's fantastic. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just good. </joey>
<joey> - It's just very good. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, there's no complaint. </garnt>
<joey> Like, I don't have any like special memories with the movie. </joey>
<connor> I just think it's really good. </connor>
<connor> - Just a clean story. </connor>
<joey> - I like history. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not even history, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I like tournament arcs. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's basically it, right? </joey>
<connor> - "Gladiator" is just a tournament arc. </connor>
<connor> - I like Russell Crowe, he's funny. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Russell Crowe is a great actor. </joey>
<garnt> - I just realized, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> this is basically just a fucking shonen anime set in Rome, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just condensed down into a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, tournament arc, revenge story. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah! </garnt>
<joey> - It's everything I want. </joey>
<joey> Russell Crowe. </joey>
<garnt> It's everything I want. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like it's this, </garnt>
<joey> and I was like really close to putting "300" </joey>
<joey> on mine as well. </joey>
<connor> - Actually I think I like "300" more. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like "Gladiator" is the better film, </joey>
<connor> but I think "300" made more of an impression. </connor>
<joey> - "300" is the more entertaining variety. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Before like Zack Snyder thought like, </joey>
<garnt> before Zack Snyder thought, </garnt>
<garnt> "I could put slow mo in everything. </garnt>
<joey> "What if I just use it for everything?" </joey>
<joey> - "300" is so good. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, man, </joey>
<joey> the slow motion fight scene in "300" still fucking slap </joey>
<joey> to this day. </joey>
<garnt> - I still think it's Zack Snyder's best film to this day. </garnt>
<joey> - I 100% agree. </joey>
<joey> - Like, he just peeked with that and he was just like, </joey>
<joey> "How do I recapture this? </joey>
<joey> "How do I do it?" </joey>
<joey> - "Let me do the same thing with all my other films." </joey>
<connor> - It's just such a fun film. </connor>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<joey> It's such a quotable, just fun, like bloody, gory film. </joey>
<connor> - It's such a cool story too. </connor>
<joey> - It's just like- </joey>
<joey> - It's based off real life. </joey>
<joey> Fucking awesome. </joey>
<joey> - As much as we know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, somewhat. </joey>
<joey> - You cannot like watch "300" </joey>
<garnt> and not just come out just hyped as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> Just wanting to fucking punch someone. </joey>
<garnt> - The funniest thing about "300" </garnt>
<joey> in my opinion is just how they made Xerxes </joey>
<joey> into this like nine foot tall like brick shit house. </joey>
<joey> When I think in real life, Xerxes was like four feet tall. </joey>
<joey> Like, he was actually a midget. </joey>
<joey> And Zack Snyder was like, "No, no. </joey>
<joey> "Let's get the biggest Chad in the movie film industry </joey>
<joey> "and just they can play Xerxes." </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think, have you been in a movie theater </garnt>
<joey> where they've literally just gasped? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like "300" is the only experience I've had </joey>
<joey> in a movie theater </joey>
<joey> where like the whole fucking movie theater just gasped </joey>
<joey> and that was the scene, that was like the very final scene </joey>
<joey> where he throws the spear. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That was such a good scene. </joey>
<joey> God, that's such a good movie! </joey>
<joey> - God, I want to watch "300" again. </joey>
<garnt> - It's such a good film. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such a good movie. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't not be happy watching that film. </joey>
<connor> So fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - Such a quotable movie. </connor>
<connor> I mean, like all of these films like, </connor>
<garnt> there's at least one quote I can easily, </garnt>
<garnt> one or two quotes I can talk. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's get into this. </connor>
<joey> - "Austin Powers." </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<garnt> - "Goldmember" though. </garnt>
<connor> It's "Goldmember." </connor>
<garnt> - What's up with that? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, I think it's the best "Austin Powers" movie. </joey>
<connor> - I don't really like "Austin Powers." </connor>
<connor> - You don't like "Austin Powers?" </connor>
<connor> I rewatched "Goldmember" again </connor>
<joey> just because like one of my friends came over to my house </joey>
<joey> and was like, "I feel like watching 'Goldmember.'" </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "I haven't seen that movie in like 10 years, </connor>
<joey> "but let's do it." </joey>
<connor> - Is that movie still funny now? </connor>
<joey> I feel like it's not funny anymore. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's still funny. </joey>
<garnt> - You think it's funny anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't find it funny when it first came out, </garnt>
<joey> I'll be honest. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, it's a... </joey>
<joey> - Again, it's like that whole, like, it's the meta thing. </joey>
<joey> It's like the fact that Austin Powers </joey>
<garnt> as a character is so- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like James Bond, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just so aware of what he is that like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the potty humor poopoo peepee humor. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> It really is. </joey>
<connor> - It kind of is. </connor>
<joey> - I like that humor. </joey>
<connor> I don't know why I didn't like this movie. </connor>
<joey> I've seen, sorry, the "Austin Powers" series, </joey>
<joey> I think I've seen all of them and I just thought like, </joey>
<connor> it's all right. </connor>
<connor> - It's, I don't know, it's like, for me, </connor>
<connor> it's just like comfort food to just go back to. </connor>
<joey> It's just like, it's either that or "Bruce Almighty" </joey>
<garnt> in terms of comedy films </garnt>
<joey> where I'm just like, "Yeah, this is still funny." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think it's just like the peepee poopoo humor- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like- </connor>
<garnt> - It was a bit too in your face. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, when I think of "Austin Powers," I just feel like, </connor>
<garnt> I like recoil in disgust a little bit. </garnt>
<joey> - I think you know what it is- </joey>
<connor> - There's so many gross scenes in that film. </connor>
<connor> - You know what it is about "Goldmember" in particular, </connor>
<connor> I think it's like the same concept as like, </connor>
<connor> when you see like, you know, a troll face comic on Twitter </connor>
<joey> where it's like it's so not funny that it's just funny. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just ancient memes put into a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the second one? </garnt>
<garnt> - This the third one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Third one. </garnt>
<garnt> The one with Fat Bastard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, this is the last one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God. </garnt>
<connor> - And like Goldmember is also played by Mike Myers </connor>
<connor> where he's like the fucking Dutch guys, </connor>
<connor> like, "I love gold!" </connor>
<joey> Like, that character. </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's so dumb, that it's like, it's funny. </joey>
<garnt> - I put it in like the same category as "Scary Movie" </garnt>
<joey> and just, remember "Scary Movie?" </joey>
<joey> - See, I didn't find "Scary Movie" funny at all. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't find it funny at all. </joey>
<connor> - I think 13-year-old me loved "Scary Movie." </connor>
<garnt> And then when I watched it again, I was like, oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same kind of like hehe peepee poopoo, </garnt>
<joey> this is a parody kind of humor. </joey>
<connor> And I just like, I never found that too funny. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I love peepee poopoo humor jokes, </connor>
<garnt> but it was just a bit too in your face. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe. </connor>
<connor> I swear I probably got a few laughs out of it here and there </connor>
<connor> but I don't know, maybe. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - I think I'm kind of just like numb to comedy movies now </joey>
<joey> just because the like past five years </joey>
<connor> of comedy movies have just all been really fucking mediocre </connor>
<connor> in my opinion. </connor>
<connor> - Haven't had many good comedy movies in a while. </connor>
<connor> - I'm trying to think of like the last good comedy movie, </connor>
<garnt> and like, I genuinely- </garnt>
<garnt> - "40-Year-Old Virgin." </garnt>
<joey> - I genuinely think it might be "Goldmember." </joey>
<joey> Like, I deadass can't think of comedy movie </joey>
<garnt> that came out after this that was like nearly as fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty sure "Superbad" came after this, right? </garnt>
<connor> - As a white guy, I'm obliged to say "Stepbrothers" </connor>
<connor> even though I don't really feel that way. </connor>
<connor> - See, okay. </connor>
<joey> Hot take, since we're all doing hot takes on movies. </joey>
<joey> I don't think I've ever laughed at a Will Ferrell movie. </joey>
<connor> - No, I mean- </connor>
<joey> - There isn't a single Will Ferrell movie- </joey>
<connor> - I don't actually think "Stepbrothers" is very good, </connor>
<connor> I was just joking. </connor>
<joey> - There's one scene in "Stepbrothers" that I was like, ha. </joey>
<connor> - When I was like 15 'cause I think that movie </connor>
<garnt> just came out, 15, 16. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna check Will Ferrell's entire filmography </garnt>
<garnt> to see if I actually agree with that. </garnt>
<joey> - Because like "Stepbrothers" was like okay. </joey>
<joey> I thought "Blades of Glory" was not funny at all. </joey>
<connor> - They were just like, </connor>
<joey> they were the most six to seven out of 10 films. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What's his most... </connor>
<connor> - Okay, "Anchorman." </connor>
<connor> - "Anchorman" is just like just driven </connor>
<joey> to the fucking ground now. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if that's just like had the "Borat" phase- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, "Elf" was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> I like "Elf." </connor>
<joey> - "Elf" is overrated as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - I think "Elf" is overrated. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] I think "Elf" is fun. </joey>
<joey> - The thing that I don't understand about "Elf" is </joey>
<joey> that like it gained like a cult classic following </joey>
<connor> after like all this time of being ignored. </connor>
<connor> - I like "Talladega Nights." </connor>
<connor> I actually like "Talladega Nights." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just looking at this and I'm just like, it's okay. </connor>
<joey> Everything's okay. </joey>
<joey> Like, "Anchorman," </joey>
<joey> I feel like I've watched "Anchorman" </joey>
<joey> passed when like it was already memed to death. </joey>
<garnt> And I feel like the best part </garnt>
<garnt> of "Anchorman" was Steve Carell. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why are late night shows listed as filmography? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I guess I just don't find Will Ferrell </garnt>
<garnt> that funny I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - "The Lego Movie" is pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> He's in that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Lego Movie." </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I like- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> "21 Jump Street," that was the last great comedy movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "21 Jump Street." </garnt>
<garnt> - Come on, come on, come on, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - See, I didn't watch it. </garnt>
<joey> - That's actually really good. </joey>
<joey> - That was the last great comedy movie. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I watched the original "21 Jump Street." </joey>
<connor> - No, the new one's really good. </connor>
<joey> - The one with, what's his face? </joey>
<garnt> - Ice Cube and... </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> The one with, </garnt>
<connor> like the really, really old one with... </connor>
<connor> Oh, fuck. </connor>
<connor> Was it "21 Jump Street?" </connor>
<connor> I might be thinking of something else. </connor>
<garnt> The one with Ice Cube though was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who was the main character in that? </garnt>
<connor> - It's Channing Tatum. </connor>
<connor> - Channing Tatum. </connor>
<connor> Channing Tatum and... </connor>
<connor> - Jonah Hill. </connor>
<connor> Jonah Hill is just an amazing actor. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, but like, </joey>
<joey> I prefer Jonah hill in like the more serious movies though. </joey>
<connor> - Jonah Hill is so good now. </connor>
<joey> - As much as I love Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" </joey>
<garnt> and like all the Jim Carrey like classic comedy </garnt>
<garnt> like "Mask" and "The Grinch" and all that. </garnt>
<connor> I fucking love Jim Carrey in all the serious roles. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, his serious roles are really good. </connor>
<connor> - The other one I was thinking like, </connor>
<connor> I'll put "Bruce Almighty" there </connor>
<garnt> just 'cause it's like the comedy movie I can go back to. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like classic. </garnt>
<garnt> But like if I didn't put "Bruce Almighty" </garnt>
<garnt> or any Jim Carrey comedy, I would've put, </garnt>
<garnt> do you know "The Number 23?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like really like kind of neo noire, </garnt>
<joey> like the most serious- </joey>
<joey> - You like that one? </joey>
<joey> - I kind of liked it. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> I kinda liked it. </joey>
<joey> It's like that one </joey>
<joey> or like "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." </joey>
<garnt> - That was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - That one's good. </garnt>
<joey> And then another one I saw was- </joey>
<garnt> - "Truman Show" is my favorite Jim Carrey movie. </garnt>
<garnt> Such a fucking good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Truman Show" is good. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I don't know something about "The Number 23" was like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was so fucking edgy </garnt>
<garnt> that it just became entertaining again. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Where like, it's like a point of edgy-ness </garnt>
<joey> where it's like, it just all comes back around- </joey>
<garnt> - Wasn't that like destroyed by critics </garnt>
<garnt> for like being pretentious? </garnt>
<joey> - It was destroyed. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, look, have you seen my three by three? </joey>
<joey> It's pretentious as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - Joey's like, "Ah, yes, I don't understand. </connor>
<connor> "Perfect." </connor>
<joey> - I think the fact that I put in a Akira Kurosawa film </joey>
<joey> goes to show </joey>
<joey> that I'm a pretty fucking pretentious movie critic. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - What'd you guys think of, </garnt>
<garnt> while we're on the topic of comedy movies, </garnt>
<garnt> Seth Rogen films, how do we feel about that? </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of the same thing I feel about Will Ferrell movies. </joey>
<joey> - What was... </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like- </joey>
<joey> - "Pineapple Express" is okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's like ha ha, he smokes weed. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like, if it's not like purely </garnt>
<joey> just Seth Rogen being a stoner, </joey>
<garnt> then it's a pretty funny film. </garnt>
<joey> - I like Seth Rogen as a person. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> I like the stoner actor Seth Rogen, </joey>
<joey> but like Seth Rogen in films, I'm just kinda just like, eh. </joey>
<connor> - I like his movies. </connor>
<connor> You just turn your brain off and it's an easy movie. </connor>
<connor> You know, sometimes it's just hard movies to watch. </connor>
<joey> - I can't even think of like a Seth Rogen movie. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the Akira Kurosawa films are not the kind of thing </joey>
<joey> I can just put on.. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no, no, no, of course not. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, you know you always get </joey>
<connor> just a film you can watch with Seth Rogen. </connor>
<joey> - Actually, do you wanna know how fucking pretentious I am </joey>
<connor> as a film critic? </connor>
<joey> Instead of "Goldmember," </joey>
<joey> I was gonna put "2001: A Space Odyssey." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I would have actually been like, </connor>
<garnt> "Actually fuck off." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> "Actually get the fuck out." </connor>
<connor> - Joey, who are you trying to please? </connor>
<joey> Joey, who are you trying to please? </joey>
<joey> - I'm trying to please myself, all right? </joey>
<joey> - One thing I'm surprised </joey>
<garnt> that's not on here is "Trainspotting." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you've talked about that a bunch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck. </garnt>
<joey> You know what, I completely forgot about that. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Actually, yeah, can we get rid of "Goldmember" </joey>
<joey> and put "Trainspotting?" </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, it's already done. </joey>
<joey> - Please? </joey>
<joey> Do me a solid. </joey>
<joey> No, he did it with the fucking gaming three by three. </joey>
<joey> I can do it with the movie. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<garnt> Munon or whoever's editing, get rid of "Goldmember." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] This is a shit movie anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Get rid of "Goldmember," </garnt>
<connor> put "Trainspotting" on it. </connor>
<joey> "Trainspotting" is fucking fantastic. </joey>
<connor> - Someone criticized me because I said, </connor>
<connor> when someone, they asked me what my favorite video game </connor>
<connor> or whatever was, </connor>
<connor> I said different from what I put on my three by three. </connor>
<connor> We make our three by threes in like 10 minutes. </connor>
<connor> It's not like the end all of our actual. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - We're just trying to make some interesting. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, they're fine. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, I've really enjoyed "This is the End," </garnt>
<garnt> a Seth Rogen film. </garnt>
<connor> - "50/50" was really good. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, "50/50" was great. </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't seen any of these. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - They're ones where like the joke isn't </joey>
<connor> just him being a stoner. </connor>
<joey> And that's why I feel like- </joey>
<connor> - Wait, is that even possible? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Occasionally he does. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I think it with Seth Rogen, like, </joey>
<joey> I watched one film with Seth Rogen in it and I was like- </joey>
<joey> - Was it "Pineapple Express?" </joey>
<joey> - It might've been. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I 100% understand this actor </joey>
<connor> and this character now. </connor>
<joey> Probably like that in every other movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> "Pineapple Express" is one of those movies- </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, fucking, can I talk about "Trainspotting." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, sorry, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so good! </joey>
<joey> Okay, have you guys seen it? </joey>
<joey> - Of course I have. </joey>
<connor> - I have not. </connor>
<connor> - You haven't seen it? </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So, "Trainspotting" is this like, </connor>
<joey> oh God, how the fuck do you explain "Trainspotting?" </joey>
<connor> - I know that it's not about spotting trains. </connor>
<connor> - It is not about spotting trains. </connor>
<connor> - So, the term trainspotting comes from heroin addicts </connor>
<garnt> where they try to inject the heroin into their veins, </garnt>
<joey> so they have to spot the veins </joey>
<garnt> and that is referred to as trainspotting. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically it's a drug film set in Scotland. </joey>
<garnt> Main guy is Ewan McGregor </garnt>
<garnt> who he is in his natural habitat. </garnt>
<joey> He's in his natural accent, so you know it's gonna be good. </joey>
<joey> Very, very young Ewan McGregor. </joey>
<joey> I think this is before "Star Wars." </joey>
<garnt> - I think the one scene I remember </garnt>
<joey> from "Trainspotting" apart from the baby scene was just- </joey>
<joey> - The toilet scene. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just Ewan McGregor emerges from a toilet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've heard about this. </connor>
<connor> I've heard of the scenes in "Trainspotting." </connor>
<joey> - So very famous scene is where Ewan McGregor needs to go, </joey>
<joey> you know, do a hit, </joey>
<joey> and he's at a pub and he goes into the closest, </joey>
<garnt> no, no, that's right. </garnt>
<garnt> No, he gets the runs I think from something. </garnt>
<garnt> And he runs into a pub and goes into probably </garnt>
<connor> the most disgusting looking toilet imaginable. </connor>
<connor> - Just UK toilets. </connor>
<connor> - It's like actually foul. </connor>
<connor> And he drops his drugs into the toilet. </connor>
<connor> And because he's a desperate junkie, </connor>
<connor> and he took a shot beforehand, </connor>
<connor> he starts hallucinating as he reaches into the toilet </connor>
<connor> and just goes into the toilet </connor>
<connor> and starts swimming inside the toilet. </connor>
<connor> Emerges out of the toilet with the drugs in his hand. </connor>
<joey> It's a very, very bizarre movie. </joey>
<joey> But I (laughs) I showed "Trainspotting" to Aki, </joey>
<joey> and she stopped it after five minutes and she's like, </joey>
<joey> "Can we put subtitles on? </joey>
<joey> "'Cause I can't understand what the fuck they're saying." </joey>
<joey> To be fair, it's a very heavy Scottish accent. </joey>
<connor> Like, there were some scenes where even I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I didn't quite catch what he just fucking said there." </connor>
<connor> So, like Americans, probably best to put subtitles on. </connor>
<joey> - Being from the UK is like your English level is OP. </joey>
<joey> You can understand any form of English. </joey>
<joey> - Any accent. </joey>
<joey> - The only reason why I understand "Trainspotting" is </joey>
<joey> because I like watched it like over 10 times. </joey>
<connor> So, I just remember what they say. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, it's very brutal film, </connor>
<connor> but also it's like, again, like the music choices- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Sounds good. </connor>
<connor> - With movies if it's got great music choice, </connor>
<joey> I'm all for it. </joey>
<garnt> Same with my anime. </garnt>
<joey> If the OST is good, it's a great movie. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd say if there's like two, like drug like films, </garnt>
<joey> kind of like, how do I describe this? </joey>
<connor> - Is that a category? </connor>
<joey> Drug movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, drug movies. </joey>
<joey> - Drug movie. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like I don't really know how </joey>
<joey> to describe "Trainspotting." </joey>
<connor> It's just a movie about a bunch of characters and- </connor>
<connor> - I'm already sold on it to be fair. </connor>
<connor> - Their lives revolve around drugs. </connor>
<connor> And like "Trainspotting" is one of them. </connor>
<joey> And the other one is "Requiem for a Dream," </joey>
<joey> which is not a film I think </joey>
<garnt> like people should watch to enjoy. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think people should just watch it at least once </garnt>
<joey> to like realize, wow, I just never want to try heroin. </joey>
<joey> That's just a bad thing. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, "Trainspotting" was definitely one </joey>
<joey> where I was like, oh, never touching that shit in my life. </joey>
<joey> Fuck that. </joey>
<joey> Fuck that. </joey>
<connor> - You know, I was 50/50 but. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> After watching "Trainspotting," you know... </connor>
<joey> - If you ever have a friend who's like, </joey>
<joey> "Maybe I might try heroin," just show them "Trainspotting," </joey>
<garnt> they'll probably be like, "Nope, never doing that." </garnt>
<garnt> - Or "Requiem for a Dream." </garnt>
<joey> - Or "Requiem for a Dream" as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I think I just got full on fucking depression </joey>
<garnt> for a week after watching that film. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, "Trainspotting" is definitely another film </joey>
<joey> that is not watched for entertainment sake. </joey>
<joey> Probably more entertaining than "Requiem for a Dream." </joey>
<garnt> - I would like to say like, </garnt>
<joey> "Trainspotting" isn't a happy movie, </joey>
<joey> but it's like less bleak than "Requiem for a Dream." </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of great scenes and it's like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, it's just, again, </joey>
<joey> the acting's really good and it's just very, </joey>
<joey> it's a very raw film. </joey>
<connor> - "Requiem for a Dream" just sounds </connor>
<connor> like something you'd give an Oscar to based on the title. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - To be fair there's some great fucking scenes </joey>
<connor> in "Requiem for a Dream." </connor>
<connor> - The title alone you're like, "Fuck, that's awesome." </connor>
<connor> - The thing I can say about "Requiem for a Dream" is </connor>
<connor> that it's just, it's a fucking powerful movie. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, it makes you feel emotions </connor>
<connor> that is not pleasant feeling, </connor>
<connor> but it's fucking powerful as shit. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of powerful, should we get onto my list? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Is it powerful? </garnt>
<joey> Are you gonna live up to that expectation? </joey>
<joey> - When you see this three by three, you're gonna think, </joey>
<joey> "Holy shit." </joey>
<garnt> - Does it have "Space Jam" on it? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if not- </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Rush Hour 2?" </garnt>
<garnt> Come on. </garnt>
<joey> - More powerful than any. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm curious to see what your Quentin Tarantino pick is. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I'm- </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna have a toilet break now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Needless to say, it's gonna be powerful. </garnt>
<connor> I actually did put "No Country for Old Men." </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - What's interesting was is off-camera- </connor>
<garnt> - This is mine, this is mine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, this one. </garnt>
<connor> Off-camera Joey was like, "Put 'No Country for Old Men.'" </connor>
<garnt> - Yo. </garnt>
<connor> Honestly, I was so close to putting some of these on mine. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I knew you were gonna- </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] 'Cause I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Maybe someone else is gonna put 'Ip Man.'" </garnt>
<garnt> But that was so close to coming on mine. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] This is a powerful list I think, gentlemen. </connor>
<garnt> I think you'll agree. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, you know what? </joey>
<joey> The only one that I probably have like a little bit </joey>
<joey> of qualms with is "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> Absolutely not! </connor>
<connor> This is a masterpiece of cinema. </connor>
<joey> - If we're talking about overrated films, "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<connor> - It is not overrated. </connor>
<connor> Listen, the main actor, you know- </connor>
<joey> - The entire "Fast and Furious" franchise is overrated. </joey>
<joey> There, I said it. </joey>
<connor> - He's an impeccable character actor, </connor>
<joey> the main actor of "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if you're being serious or not. </joey>
<joey> - He enveloped like, </joey>
<joey> nothing has mimicked living in Japan </joey>
<joey> quite like "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<joey> - You're right, you're right. </joey>
<connor> - When I went to school in some, you know- </connor>
<joey> - I love all one Japanese actors in this movie. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - You know, when I was in school in Japan </joey>
<joey> with my black friend from America... </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - We dreamed of going to Japan one day, </joey>
<joey> and we were like, "What is the closest we can get to it?" </joey>
<connor> - You know, I think- </connor>
<connor> - I wonder if you know. </connor>
<connor> - Every single point of "Tokyo Drift" is a masterclass </connor>
<connor> in filmmaking, frankly. </connor>
<connor> From the very start, you know, </connor>
<connor> in the American high school scene, </connor>
<connor> it's very, very much like how it would still be in America. </connor>
<connor> Naturally I race my cars and I cause a lot of damage </connor>
<connor> and don't get arrested and get exiled, </connor>
<connor> which I don't think is a punishment that you see. </connor>
<connor> You know, a lot of movies, they would just arrest him. </connor>
<joey> And I think he was really genius that they gave exile. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you know, like full speed drifting </connor>
<connor> through a parking lot, which is just, you know, </connor>
<joey> if you've ever been to a parking lot in any country it's </joey>
<connor> just impossible. </connor>
<connor> - I think there's not enough movies that use exile </connor>
<connor> as a good way of conveying the story. </connor>
<connor> Name a movie with exile in it. </connor>
<connor> I'll wait. </connor>
<connor> There we go. </connor>
<joey> - Probably for good reason. </joey>
<joey> - It's a medieval concept </joey>
<joey> that hasn't been introduced in modern films, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Exile. </joey>
<joey> - Exile, he was exiled from Arkansas or something. </joey>
<connor> I don't know where the fuck he was found. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some hick town. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, his accent is just amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> I love it. </garnt>
<connor> I love this guy's accent. </connor>
<joey> So, so much. </joey>
<connor> I love the accent. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever felt physical pain </joey>
<joey> while watching a movie before until I watched "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna be honest, </joey>
<garnt> I have not seen a single "Fast and Furious" film. </garnt>
<connor> - I've only seen "Tokyo Drift" </connor>
<garnt> and I, you know, because I didn't want to be annoyed </garnt>
<connor> because we'd already found the best "Fast and Furious" film </connor>
<connor> so why watch another one? </connor>
<joey> - Garnt, I must say, you are not missing out on anything. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, "Tokyo Drift." </connor>
<connor> Have you watched "Tokyo Drift?" </connor>
<garnt> - I literally just said five seconds ago, </garnt>
<connor> I've not seen- </connor>
<connor> - He's never seen it! </connor>
<joey> - Literally five seconds ago. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't count it as a "Fast and Furious" film. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I don't count this as "Fast and Furious" film. </joey>
<joey> - It's a cinema experience. </joey>
<joey> It's a totally different- </joey>
<joey> - But somehow worse. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's, </joey>
<joey> if you add up all the IMDb scores </joey>
<joey> of the "Fast and Furious" films, </joey>
<joey> it's still not as high as "Tokyo Drift." </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because it's like zero, zero, zero. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> Zero plus zero is still zero. </joey>
<joey> - "Tokyo Drift" is a great film </joey>
<joey> that is close to my heart in many ways. </joey>
<garnt> Not only did it get me into- </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> - Donkey Kong because of the DK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> What's DK stand for? </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That compelled me to check out Donkey Kong. </garnt>
<garnt> - The beginning of monkey. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Is "Tokyo Drift." </garnt>
<connor> - This was actually- </connor>
<garnt> - This is the monkey origin story. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, it's almost, it's just, </garnt>
<joey> there's nothing quite as groundbreaking as this film, </joey>
<joey> quite frankly. </joey>
<joey> - So what's your favorite scene? </joey>
<joey> - I like the scene where he breaks his iPod </joey>
<joey> and then he still manages to sell the iPod broken </joey>
<joey> and then he doesn't check to, </joey>
<joey> he doesn't check the iPod before buying it. </joey>
<joey> I believe this is what happens. </joey>
<connor> And then he purchased the iPod then gets annoyed </connor>
<connor> that it was broken. </connor>
<connor> But he never once thought, </connor>
<connor> "I should check this iPod before buying it." </connor>
<connor> - Classic storytelling. </connor>
<connor> - I thought that was a really intelligent scene </connor>
<connor> because that's how they made conflict through a broken iPod. </connor>
<garnt> - What I want to know is </garnt>
<garnt> how are there so many "Fast and the Furious" films? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, this actually saved </connor>
<joey> the "Fast and Furious" franchise. </joey>
<joey> - Did it actually? </joey>
<connor> - No, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I think it deadass might've 'cause it's like- </connor>
<joey> - This was the first- </joey>
<joey> - When you hear of someone saying "Fast and Furious-" </joey>
<garnt> - I think of "Tokyo Drift." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> Most people I think think of "Tokyo Drift," </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, why? </joey>
<garnt> - Like, do the other "Fast and Furious" films </garnt>
<garnt> even have names? </garnt>
<joey> - No, it's like "Fast and Furious 1, 2, 3, 4" </joey>
<connor> - Memes aside, how does such a shit film become so iconic? </connor>
<connor> Like, that's what I want to know. </connor>
<connor> It is terrible by every single metric of the English word. </connor>
<connor> But I love this film to death. </connor>
<joey> - It's like "The Room," right? </joey>
<connor> - It's like "The Room" of "Fast and Furious." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - "The Room" of "Fast and Furious." </garnt>
<connor> - Because it's just got the coolest name. </connor>
<connor> I mean, "Tokyo Drift," right? </connor>
<connor> It's a fucking cool ass name. </connor>
<connor> - Also, legit, I know we spoke about it before, </connor>
<connor> but like it was kind of like a gateway for me to Japan. </connor>
<joey> Like, it- </joey>
<joey> - Was it actually? </joey>
<joey> - It kind of legit got me into Japan in many ways. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's great 'cause then I got to learn actual shit. </joey>
<connor> Also it was the very first DVD I ever owned, </connor>
<connor> was "Tokyo Drift." </connor>
<joey> And it's in a glass cabinet as you can imagine. </joey>
<joey> Vacuum sealed. </joey>
<joey> - Mint condition. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, mint condition. </joey>
<joey> Had been graded obviously. </joey>
<joey> - I think the first DVD I ever owned was "Shrek." </joey>
<garnt> - Well- </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so "Tokyo Drift" is a terrible but amazing movie, </garnt>
<joey> and I can watch it and enjoy it </joey>
<joey> because you can just laugh at it now. </joey>
<joey> It's amazing to laugh at. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Some of the dialogue that the poor actors have </joey>
<joey> to actually like say is just hilarious. </joey>
<joey> And then it gets just not fun at all towards the end. </joey>
<garnt> And then it becomes too serious. </garnt>
<connor> - Then it becomes too serious. </connor>
<joey> - So let me ask you one thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] All right. </joey>
<garnt> - Why "Shrek 2" over "Shrek 1?" </garnt>
<garnt> - "Shrek 2" is the best "Shrek." </garnt>
<joey> "Shrek 2" is the best. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, "Shrek 2" is the best. </joey>
<joey> Bro, "Shrek 2" is the best! </joey>
<garnt> - Like, "Shrek" run, set the rules. </garnt>
<joey> - Run? </joey>
<joey> What is wrong today with your English? </joey>
<joey> - "Shrek 1" set the rules, </joey>
<garnt> and then "Shrek 2" perfected everything. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna go against the fact </joey>
<joey> that "Shrek 2" is a good movie. </joey>
<joey> - "Shrek 2" is the best, bro. </joey>
<connor> Prince Charming is fucking amazing. </connor>
<joey> - I still think "Shrek 1" is better. </joey>
<joey> - "Shrek 1" is just an encapsulated experience </joey>
<joey> that is fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - I think the problem with "Shrek 1" is </joey>
<joey> that no one can watch it seriously anymore </joey>
<garnt> because it's been memed to the ends of the earth. </garnt>
<garnt> Not enough scenes in "Shrek 2" have been memed, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think that's why. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually disagree 'cause I feel like "Shrek" is one </garnt>
<connor> of the few franchises where the memes have only like put it </connor>
<connor> into legendary status. </connor>
<garnt> I am never going to forget "Shrek" anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I can't. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, Smash Mouth can like retire </garnt>
<garnt> because they've already been immortalized </garnt>
<connor> through "Shrek" memes. </connor>
<connor> - "Shrek" is an amazing film that you can watch any time. </connor>
<garnt> But I think people forget how fucking amazing "Shrek 2" is. </garnt>
<joey> "Shrek 2" is- </joey>
<joey> - No, "Shrek 2" is a great film, I don't disagree with that. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, so much better than "Shrek 1". </connor>
<connor> Watch it. </connor>
<joey> - In my opinion, like, "Shrek 1" just inches past. </joey>
<connor> - "Shrek" is an 8.5 and "Shrek" is a 9.2 in my head, </connor>
<connor> "Shrek 2" sorry, is a 9.5. </connor>
<garnt> And "Shrek 1" is a 8.5. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about "Shrek the Third?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Every single character they, oh, two. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even worth watching. </garnt>
<garnt> Every single character they introduce </garnt>
<garnt> in "Shrek 2" is a banger character. </garnt>
<connor> They all like help the story so much. </connor>
<connor> And then they build on the one-off characters in "Shrek 1" </connor>
<connor> that you thought were a joke. </connor>
<connor> They bring them back. </connor>
<connor> They're like, hold up, hold up. </connor>
<connor> You know, there's a reason why the Wolf was cross-dressing. </connor>
<connor> Let's find out. </connor>
<garnt> - You're gonna see Gingerbread Man and Pinocchio again. </garnt>
<connor> - Also they use the soundtrack in very intelligent ways, </connor>
<joey> you know. </joey>
<garnt> - They do, they do. </garnt>
<joey> - The soundtrack's banging. </joey>
<garnt> - That is true, that is true. </garnt>
<garnt> - The rendition of "I Need a Hero" was like fucking amazing! </garnt>
<connor> - So good! </connor>
<joey> - It is an amazing scene. </joey>
<connor> - Puss in Boots is introduced. </connor>
<connor> - I completely forgot that. </connor>
<garnt> Puss in Boots wasn't in "Shrek 1," was he? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, his standalone movie was terrible. </garnt>
<joey> But there's a reason why he was so lovable. </joey>
<joey> - It's also amazing to think </joey>
<joey> like how many fucking high profile actors are in "Shrek 2." </joey>
<joey> - Honestly. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't the Fairy Godmother played by Julie Andrews? </joey>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I think, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you want your career made, you're in "Shrek 2." </connor>
<connor> Coincidence that every single "Shrek 2" actor </connor>
<connor> is a god tier actor- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, Antonio Banderas was the cat, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly, man. </connor>
<connor> - Why did Mike Myers do another </connor>
<connor> like fucking "Austin Powers" film when he was in "Shrek?" </connor>
<garnt> Why even try? </garnt>
<garnt> Why, Joey? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, that's because- </connor>
<connor> - This is the best of Mike Myers film. </connor>
<joey> - No, I'm not saying "Austin Powers" is </joey>
<joey> the best Mike Myers film. </joey>
<joey> "Shrek" 100%. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause Mike Myers has like two good films, </connor>
<joey> and it's "Shrek," </joey>
<connor> one and two. - "Shrek" and "Shrek 2." </connor>
<garnt> - "Wayne's World" is overrated. </garnt>
<connor> "Shrek 1" and "2" are his only good roles. </connor>
<joey> - I'll agree "Wayne's World" is overrated now. </joey>
<connor> Okay, but let's talk </connor>
<connor> about the Quentin Tarantino choice you put? </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - "Kill Bill." </joey>
<connor> - I think- </connor>
<connor> - Volume one? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, I like volume one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<joey> - I actually- </joey>
<joey> - For number one? </joey>
<joey> - I actually prefer volume one. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Volume two is rated higher, </joey>
<connor> and it's a crime we didn't get another one. </connor>
<connor> That's a legit crime we didn't get a volume three. </connor>
<joey> - I just think... </joey>
<joey> I think in the entire filmography </joey>
<joey> of Quentin Tarantino films, </joey>
<joey> "Kill Bill" is just one that I just forget. </joey>
<connor> - See, the thing for me is like "Pulp Fiction" isn't </connor>
<joey> even like my top five Quentin Tarantino films. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that like "Inglourious Basterds," </garnt>
<garnt> "Django" is better. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Django" is not better. </garnt>
<connor> - "Django" is not better. - "Django" is better. </connor>
<garnt> "Django" is better! </garnt>
<connor> What do you mean? </connor>
<joey> "Django" is amazing! </joey>
<joey> - I'll agree, "Inglourious Basterds" is up there. </joey>
<joey> "Django" though is not up there. </joey>
<joey> - "Django" and "Inglourious Basterds" are both better </joey>
<joey> than "Pulp Fiction." - No. </joey>
<joey> - And "Kill Bill" is better than "Pulp Fiction." </joey>
<joey> And what else has he done that's better? </joey>
<connor> - What about like "Jackie Brown?" </connor>
<garnt> - Look, look, look. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe "Django" would have been like one of his best films </garnt>
<joey> if not for Jamie Foxx. </joey>
<joey> I feel like Jamie Foxx was so fucking dry. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know who was originally cast? </joey>
<garnt> Will Smith. - Will Smith! </garnt>
<connor> - If they got Will Smith for that movie, </connor>
<joey> legendary! - Holy shit! </joey>
<connor> - He wouldn't have said half the shit. </connor>
<connor> - Will Smith would have carried that movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But because they got Jamie Foxx, </joey>
<joey> Christoph Waltz had to do the fucking- </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> It's Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. </garnt>
<connor> - I think Jamie Foxx was great in that movie. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you remember after the big scene in the middle? </garnt>
<connor> - I think I actually can't remember much. </connor>
<joey> - That's the point! </joey>
<joey> Because- </joey>
<connor> - It's been so long since I've watched. </connor>
<connor> - Because after that it's Jamie Foxx </connor>
<garnt> who has to carry the film and he just doesn't. </garnt>
<joey> He doesn't. </joey>
<connor> - Jamie Foxx tries </connor>
<joey> when fucking decrepit Samuel L. Jackson walks off. </joey>
<joey> - I was gonna say like, </joey>
<joey> actually like, you know, everyone focusing Christoph Waltz, </joey>
<joey> and he did amazing and so did Leonardo DiCaprio, </joey>
<joey> but like Samuel L. Jackson is </joey>
<joey> like probably one of my favorite things in that film. </joey>
<connor> He is so fucking good at being evil. </connor>
<connor> - He's good, he's good. </connor>
<joey> Don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> But it's not the best Samuel L. Jackson role in- </joey>
<connor> - It's because every single fucking role he does is amazing. </connor>
<joey> Like, Samuel L. Jackson kills it in everything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I get that, but like, I think his roll </joey>
<joey> in like "Jackie Brown" was 100 times better. </joey>
<joey> - I just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I had more fun watching like "Jackie Brown' </joey>
<joey> and like even "Kill Bill" over "Django." </joey>
<connor> - I just, I don't think "Pulp Fiction" was that good. </connor>
<joey> - How dare you. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it was fine. </garnt>
<garnt> There was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> there was too many scenes where I was actually bored </garnt>
<garnt> during "Pulp Fiction." </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, the scene where they're at the restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> just talking, I was bored out of my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - What, do you mean the one at the end? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, the start, the start. </garnt>
<garnt> Not the diner, the restaurant where they're like, </garnt>
<joey> were they having like milkshakes with John Travolta. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, at Jack Rabbits. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I can't fucking stand it. </joey>
<joey> - That scene's fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - I just think John Travolta is like not a good actor. </joey>
<connor> I think he's not good. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't know- </garnt>
<connor> - What are these takes, dude? </connor>
<joey> - John Travolta is a bad actor. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, okay. </joey>
<joey> - John Travolta is very much- </joey>
<connor> - Samuel L. Jackson carries, </connor>
<connor> it's so obvious because when Samuel L. Jackson isn't </connor>
<connor> with John Travolta, John Travolta sucks. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, in my opinion, John- </joey>
<garnt> - How many scenes were there without those two together? </garnt>
<connor> There wasn't many. </connor>
<joey> It was a duo. - Like one or two, </joey>
<connor> and he was terrible. </connor>
<joey> - I think John Travolta is- </joey>
<connor> - Not terrible but. </connor>
<joey> - John Travolta is one of those actors </joey>
<joey> where like I feel- </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen his recent movies? </joey>
<garnt> - No, but that's because, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, recent John Travolta movies he's clearly like, </garnt>
<garnt> has just been type casted as the bad guy </garnt>
<garnt> because of "Pulp Fiction." </garnt>
<joey> Because before "Pulp Fiction," </joey>
<joey> John Travolta just did all the "Grease" lightning movies. </joey>
<joey> So he literally went- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, he was in "Grease." </joey>
<joey> - He literally went from this like sing songy, </joey>
<joey> like cool, cool boy guy </joey>
<joey> to suddenly playing as this like badass gangster. </joey>
<joey> And because of the success of "Pulp Fiction," </joey>
<joey> the movie industry was like, "We need a bad guy </joey>
<joey> "who's also like kind of quirky and charming on the surface </joey>
<joey> "but is actually fucked up on the inside. </joey>
<joey> "John Travolta." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like, "Pulp Fiction" isn't </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite Tarantino film. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's your favorite one? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I put it on. </joey>
<joey> It's "Reservoir Dogs." </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I still would put like, </joey>
<garnt> I really love "Inglourious Basterds." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Would you say "Inglourious Basterds" is better </connor>
<connor> than "Pulp Fiction" to you? </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say it's about the same. </garnt>
<joey> - I think "Inglourious Basterds" is good. </joey>
<joey> It's better than "Pulp Fiction" but for different reasons. </joey>
<garnt> - I do agree with you where there are some parts </garnt>
<garnt> of "Pulp Fiction" that did drag. </garnt>
<joey> But when, like, I feel like the highs of "Pulp Fiction" are </joey>
<joey> just they're like the best Tarantino can do. </joey>
<connor> "Kill Bill" is I feel like one of his most </connor>
<garnt> different movies. - I love "Kill Bill." </garnt>
<joey> - "Kill Bill" is clearly the movie where Tarantino was like, </joey>
<joey> "I like anime by the way." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I love it. </joey>
<connor> - "I really like anime. </connor>
<joey> "I really like Japan." </joey>
<joey> - It's so cool. </joey>
<joey> I just love it. </joey>
<joey> Everything about the movie is just so fun. </joey>
<joey> - No, I mean, like Uma Thurman is fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - I love Uma Thurman. </connor>
<connor> - I love the scene with, what's her name? </connor>
<joey> Kuriyama Chiaki who did Gogo Yubari </joey>
<joey> with like the chain thing. </joey>
<joey> - That's so good! </joey>
<joey> I love that! </joey>
<joey> - I just love fucking Uma Thurman's janky Japanese </joey>
<garnt> when like Gogo Yubari comes out like swinging the chain </garnt>
<joey> and then Uma Thurman turns around, she's like, </joey>
<joey> "Gogo danay?" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> That scene fucking kills me every time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, I feel like on an aesthetic level, </joey>
<garnt> there's few that are as iconic as "Kill Bill." </garnt>
<connor> - It's just such a fucking, </connor>
<connor> and also the restaurant is still like open in Tokyo. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, going there and like seeing it and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> It's so cool. </joey>
<joey> When you go to that restaurant, </joey>
<joey> you're like, "Fuck, how did they make this happen?" </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely like a culturally significant movie. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, for the record, </garnt>
<garnt> all of Quentin Tarantino movies are fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel like "Kill Bill" is like the most different, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, especially in terms of Tarantino movies. </garnt>
<garnt> Volume two felt way more like a Tarantino movie. </garnt>
<joey> - I deadass don't even remember what happens in volume two. </joey>
<garnt> - She fucking kills Bill, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Joey! </joey>
<joey> - How dare you spoil! </joey>
<joey> - Joey! </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe you spoiled "Kill Bill." </joey>
<connor> - It's literally there in the title. </connor>
<connor> - I've rewatched the first one so many times </connor>
<joey> I've barely watched the second one. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, it's just like, </joey>
<joey> I've definitely seen "Kill Bill Volume 2" a couple of times. </joey>
<joey> I just don't remember what happened </joey>
<joey> other than the titular thing. </joey>
<garnt> - I would say that the only film, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, the only scene out of "Kill Bill" </garnt>
<garnt> that really sticks out to my mind is the one </garnt>
<connor> at the end of "Kill Bill Volume 1" </connor>
<connor> which is her against... </connor>
<connor> - Lucy Liu, right? </connor>
<connor> - Lucy Liu. </connor>
<connor> - No, not Lucy Liu. </connor>
<connor> The one with her against like the fucking, </connor>
<garnt> what, the name of the gang that she fights? </garnt>
<connor> - That's not the end. </connor>
<connor> - The Crazy 88s. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's like in the middle. </connor>
<garnt> - No, that's like right before the end. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, right before the end is when she fights Lucy Liu. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the ending. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so the one, so, </connor>
<connor> she fights the Crazy 88 before she fights Lucy Liu. </connor>
<connor> To me, that is like the iconic scene </connor>
<connor> of the "Kill Bill" franchise. </connor>
<connor> - It's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - But I felt like overall, </connor>
<joey> I felt like the second film was just a little bit better. </joey>
<connor> - I have to rewatch it honestly. </connor>
<joey> - I have to, I think- </joey>
<garnt> - Why is this your favorite Tarantino movie then? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Again, I think it's just how unique it is </connor>
<connor> and how stylized. </connor>
<joey> Like, you don't really get a movie like it any more. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely not anymore. </joey>
<joey> - It's just such a good movie. </joey>
<connor> - I feel this is the only successful </connor>
<joey> live-action anime adaptation. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Where it's like, </joey>
<joey> this feels like it was based off of anime. </joey>
<garnt> - It had actual fucking anime in it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's got a production IG. </connor>
<garnt> That's fucking badass. </garnt>
<joey> - That scene was dope. </joey>
<joey> - The whole lore when they build it up. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, it's just so fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> I love everything about that film. </joey>
<joey> It's just like him just like saying, </joey>
<joey> "Hey guys, I'm a weeb." </joey>
<joey> And like you said, but in a good way, </joey>
<joey> in a way that you're like, okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely done from like a place of like respect. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just, like, you watch this </garnt>
<joey> and you just feel like this is just fun. </joey>
<joey> This is just a director having fucking fun. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely the most like turn your brain off type </joey>
<garnt> of Tarantino film. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the best kind. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - Because you don't need to turn your brain off </joey>
<joey> to appreciate this movie. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, </joey>
<connor> it follows that kind of same style </connor>
<connor> where you don't have to think much, </connor>
<joey> but everything about this just has impact. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - Impact. </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely agree "Kill Bill' is good. </joey>
<garnt> I just want to rewatch it now. </garnt>
<connor> It's been awhile. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you wanna talk about next, boys? </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, honestly, </connor>
<garnt> I know you put this on because you thought </garnt>
<garnt> that I was gonna like, just fucking destroy you for it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm glad someone put an Adam Sandler movie on here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, "Click," I love "Click." </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, 100% easily the best Adam Sandler film. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> Well, a film made by Adam, </connor>
<joey> this is made by him, right? </joey>
<joey> - I think so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, "Click" is so good. </joey>
<joey> - "Click" is a really good movie. </joey>
<garnt> - I still cry at the end of "Click" </garnt>
<garnt> every single God damn time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - "Family comes first." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> That's all I can remember. </joey>
<garnt> - I was really, really close to putting "50 First Dates" </garnt>
<joey> on my three by three. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - No! </joey>
<connor> No "Click" is actually good. </connor>
<connor> - "Click" is really good. </connor>
<joey> - "Click" is good. </joey>
<joey> - "Click" is one of those movies that gets so much bad rep, </joey>
<joey> but like I actually think it's like, </joey>
<joey> come on, it's pretty fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Adam Sandler has a bad rep. </joey>
<connor> - . Of course, there's some scenes in there you're like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, Adam, come on." </connor>
<connor> But then there's also so many moments you're like, </connor>
<joey> "Holy shit, this is actually like a really good fucking take </joey>
<joey> "on your life and missing out on things." </joey>
<joey> - Especially the second half where it starts </joey>
<connor> to get really serious. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, oh my God, </connor>
<joey> this is not the direction I was expecting it to go. </joey>
<joey> - It's so good. </joey>
<joey> It shows that like when Adam Sandler wants to fucking act, </joey>
<joey> he brings his fucking A-game. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Wow, he can act?" </joey>
<joey> - Again, this is like, why watching "Uncut Gems" is like, </joey>
<joey> all the shit parts of "Click" are like not there, </joey>
<connor> just great fucking acting from Adam Sandler. </connor>
<connor> And like, it's amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - I just feel like people forget that I think Adam Sandler </garnt>
<joey> actually made good films. </joey>
<joey> I like a lot of- - Just lazy. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like "Click" might be his like last great film </connor>
<connor> or last good film </connor>
<connor> 'cause I remember like he just like fell off a cliff </connor>
<garnt> after a certain point but- </garnt>
<connor> - Now he just makes, </connor>
<connor> he's openly admitted that he makes movies on, </connor>
<garnt> basically if he can go to a vacation on the place, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's his production company. </connor>
<connor> - What a power move. </connor>
<connor> - The movies that he makes, it's his production company. </connor>
<joey> So he just picks places he can go on vacation </joey>
<connor> with his family. </connor>
<garnt> - I think there's a lot of good Adam Sandler movies </garnt>
<garnt> that I've really enjoyed. </garnt>
<joey> Like, has anyone seen "Anger Management?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I really, really enjoyed. </joey>
<joey> Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, </joey>
<joey> my God, that's such a good film. </joey>
<joey> He has such a bad rep, but I fucking, </joey>
<joey> like his films defined a lot of </joey>
<joey> like the early 2000s comedies I feel. </joey>
<joey> Nothing wrong with "Click." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, nothing wrong with "Click." </garnt>
<connor> Easily, I mean, fucking what's his name, as well is in it. </connor>
<joey> Christopher Walken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> He's the one that gives the remote, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's the one that gives the remote. </joey>
<connor> - I just wish they didn't set it up so fucking stupid. </connor>
<connor> Like, in a Bed Bath Beyond he gets it. </connor>
<joey> - He's like, yeah, he's like a security guard </joey>
<joey> at Bed Bath and Beyond. </joey>
<connor> - And there's so many fucking childish jokes, </connor>
<connor> like when he farts on the guy and stuff </connor>
<connor> and then fast forwards in the room. </connor>
<connor> Like, that shit's so dumb </connor>
<connor> 'cause like they actually hit </connor>
<connor> so many good fucking emotional notes. </connor>
<connor> I wish they didn't fucking sully it with that shit. </connor>
<connor> But it's actually a good movie. </connor>
<connor> I love it. </connor>
<joey> It's so good. </joey>
<joey> - Although to be fair, </joey>
<joey> the scene where he like smacks the boss in the face </joey>
<joey> and then plays it, and goes like, </joey>
<joey> "Whoa, I just had a massive headache." </joey>
<joey> That scene is still really funny. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, there's some good moments. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> I have never seen "Catch Me If You Can." </garnt>
<garnt> - You haven't? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - It's so good! </joey>
<joey> - It's a movie I've heard so many times. </joey>
<connor> - I think it is the best Leonardo DiCaprio film. </connor>
<joey> - That's all I've heard from people. </joey>
<joey> - And then there's Tom Hanks in it as well. </joey>
<garnt> And Tom Hanks is just a fucking delight. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like it's... </garnt>
<connor> - What do you think is, </connor>
<connor> when you think Leonardo DiCaprio, </connor>
<connor> what movie comes to your mind? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think of "Catch Me If You Can." </garnt>
<connor> I think of Tom Hanks for this one. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think of him for it. </garnt>
<garnt> But then also when I think of it, </garnt>
<garnt> it uses like everything that Leonardo DiCaprio, </garnt>
<joey> especially at that point in his life- </joey>
<garnt> - What movie do you think of </garnt>
<joey> when you say Leonardo DiCaprio now? </joey>
<connor> - Probably now "Wolf of Wall Street." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think "Wolf of Wall Street." </connor>
<garnt> - That's because- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> I think of "Shutter Island." </joey>
<joey> - Really? - What? </joey>
<garnt> - I just really like that movie. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, that's a good movie. </connor>
<connor> - It's either "Wolf of Wall Street' or "Django." </connor>
<connor> - I feel like Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved quite a lot </connor>
<garnt> during his time because he's been acting since like- </garnt>
<connor> - Remember when he was the "Titanic" boy? </connor>
<connor> Nobody knew him for anything else but "Titanic." </connor>
<garnt> - But like, I feel like when he did this movie, </garnt>
<garnt> it like perfectly captured at that age </garnt>
<joey> what he was best at doing, </joey>
<joey> was playing like the sexy young guy. </joey>
<joey> And he's so fucking good in this movie. </joey>
<joey> And I love it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, he's good in every movie. </joey>
<joey> - You need to watch this movie. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, I do. </joey>
<connor> And this is one of those movies </connor>
<joey> that I've heard people talking about for years now, </joey>
<connor> and I just never found the time to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - And it's based on a true story. </connor>
<joey> And like the guy- </joey>
<joey> - It's a biopic? </joey>
<connor> - It is a biopic. </connor>
<joey> - I love biopics. </joey>
<joey> - The guy who it's actually based on has done </joey>
<garnt> like Google talks now about how he, </garnt>
<joey> I think he's done work. </joey>
<connor> He did like work for the FBI afterwards and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - I think he was in this movie </connor>
<joey> or at least he was a producer. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because I've purposely like not looked </joey>
<joey> into this film 'cause I feel like I just want to go </joey>
<joey> into it blind. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just watch it. </connor>
<joey> It's such a good story. </joey>
<joey> And although obviously it's dramatized, </joey>
<joey> it is based on a real event, and it's so good. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause like if I was to actually do a three by three </garnt>
<garnt> with like my top favorite movies of all time, </garnt>
<garnt> there would definitely also be a Tom Hanks movie in there. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh dude, "Castaway" would be in here for me. </joey>
<garnt> - I had only seen "Castaway" recently, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was one of the few movies that- </garnt>
<garnt> - You only saw it recently? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I only saw it recently. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was one of the few movies </garnt>
<garnt> where despite how much hype had gone into it, </garnt>
<connor> I thought it was as good. </connor>
<connor> It lived up to everything. </connor>
<garnt> I thought it was an amazing fucking film. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Catch Me If You Can" is more of a Leonardo DiCaprio film </garnt>
<garnt> than a Tom Hanks film. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's half and half. </garnt>
<connor> To me- </connor>
<joey> - It's two big names. </joey>
<connor> - It's two very big names, and I feel like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it is Leonardo DiCaprio. </connor>
<connor> He does do really well in it. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like he just, him and Tom Hanks, </connor>
<joey> it's both of them in that film. </joey>
<joey> Whereas with "Castaways" Tom Hanks, </joey>
<joey> and what was the other fucking massive Tom Hanks film that- </joey>
<joey> - "Green Mile?" </joey>
<joey> - Not "Green Mile." </joey>
<joey> - Was he in "Green Mile?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he plays the main security guard. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "Forrest Gump." </joey>
<joey> Fucking what an amazing film. </joey>
<joey> That will probably be like in my- </joey>
<joey> - Also "Saving Private Ryan" as well. </joey>
<joey> - Everything he's in he's good. </joey>
<joey> - "Toy Story." </joey>
<garnt> Hello? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything that man is in is a good film, straight up. </garnt>
<joey> - I just feel like he's the world's dad. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He's everyone's dad. </joey>
<joey> - He is everyone's dad. </joey>
<connor> I want Tom Hanks as a dad. </connor>
<connor> Are you fucking kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> My God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like we should explain some of the plots </garnt>
<garnt> of these. </garnt>
<connor> "Catch Me If You Can-" </connor>
<garnt> - I just feel these are such like big movies </garnt>
<connor> that everyone should know them. </connor>
<garnt> - "Catch Me If You Can" if you haven't seen it, </garnt>
<connor> it's about a guy who pretends to be a pilot and that's it. </connor>
<garnt> That's literally it. </garnt>
<garnt> And about a detective trying to find him. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's not what it's about. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's kind of it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to spoil too much! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, don't go too into detail. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to give more information than that. </joey>
<connor> - I just know it's a fucking amazing film, </connor>
<joey> and I need to watch it. </joey>
<connor> - That's like, I mean, it's that, but it's not, </connor>
<connor> but just watch it. </connor>
<connor> Like, that's it, kind of. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - That's like saying like, "Sixth Sense" is about a divorce. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's the real life story of a con artist, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's pretty much it. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, and then, okay. </joey>
<joey> I appreciate the fact </joey>
<joey> that you put "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" </joey>
<connor> but the OG one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the OG one. </connor>
<joey> The new one sucked. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the new one sucks. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's got its 50th anniversary this year. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, already? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Shit. </joey>
<joey> - I just love this movie. </joey>
<joey> I can watch like as, from a young age to now, </joey>
<garnt> like fucking Gene Wilder is like such a God damn good actor. </garnt>
<garnt> Holy shit, this movie's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Also fuck his granddad, bro. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck his granddad. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's a classic movie for a reason, right? </garnt>
<connor> I mean, already mentioned "The Truman Show" as well, which- </connor>
<connor> - Great movie. </connor>
<connor> - Was my favorite Jim Carrey movie as well. </connor>
<connor> Why are there so many, </connor>
<garnt> like why are so many comedy actors </garnt>
<garnt> that are just like actual, just really fucking good actors? </garnt>
<connor> - I think you need to understand emotions well to be funny, </connor>
<connor> I think. </connor>
<joey> - Jim Carrey is such a fucking good actor </joey>
<connor> when he decides to act. </connor>
<joey> - I feel sorry for that, man. </joey>
<joey> He seems like he has a lot of problems. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But I feel like comedy actors normally do have </garnt>
<connor> that problem. </connor>
<garnt> - I really want to rewatch "The Truman Show" now </garnt>
<connor> because I want to, </connor>
<connor> because the entire premise of "The Truman Show" is </connor>
<connor> that it's just, is it a twist? </connor>
<connor> Can I spoil it? </connor>
<connor> - I think everyone knows what it is. </connor>
<connor> If you don't know what the twist is, </connor>
<connor> you should know what the twist is. </connor>
<connor> - So, it follows the story of this guy </connor>
<garnt> whose entire life has just been broadcasted. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, it's just his life is a reality TV show. </garnt>
<connor> - They've made a world around this man to make a TV show. </connor>
<connor> - This was a "Black Mirror" episode </connor>
<joey> before "Black Mirror" was a thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is basically just IRL Twitch, </garnt>
<garnt> before IRL Twitch was a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And now it is a thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Except that in the movie, he doesn't want to be filmed. </connor>
<garnt> IRL Twitch people are like, "Yeah, let's do it." </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so you remember Ludwig's sub-athon? </garnt>
<garnt> Just imagine that from like birth. </garnt>
<connor> - But he didn't know. </connor>
<garnt> - But he didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's "The Truman Show" </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just a fucking amazing film. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd love to see "The Truman Show," </connor>
<connor> except where Truman is just a horrible person </connor>
<connor> because Truman in this is a nice guy. </connor>
<connor> What if Truman did things </connor>
<joey> that got him canceled all the time? </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> Would people still watch the show? </joey>
<joey> Would the ratings go down? </joey>
<joey> How would they fix the ratings if Truman was going around- </joey>
<joey> - Just gets canceled. </joey>
<joey> - Just getting canceled. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Fuck, we gotta interfere. </joey>
<connor> "We gotta reeducate Truman." </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] And then we joked about "No Country for Old Men." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, I fucking love this film. </connor>
<joey> - It's a great film. </joey>
<joey> It's just one of those films that's like, </joey>
<joey> "Yes, I'm a movie critic." </joey>
<connor> - I don't think that based on my list </connor>
<connor> that you could say that about me. </connor>
<connor> But I do think that "No Country for Old Men" was </connor>
<connor> the first film where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Wait, you can just like make things this ambiguous? </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck?" </connor>
<joey> And it's also not cheesy as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I do like my very </joey>
<connor> kind of open-ended ambiguous films. </connor>
<connor> "Memento" was one of them. </connor>
<joey> - You know, you don't really have a film </joey>
<joey> where you follow the main character often </joey>
<connor> that acts, behaves in this cold way </connor>
<connor> that you're also like, you're like, </connor>
<joey> "Come on, tell me something." </joey>
<joey> And they just don't tell you anything. </joey>
<joey> - I think the only other film </joey>
<joey> that's even remotely like that is maybe </joey>
<joey> like "American Psycho." </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, yeah. </connor>
<joey> But every single, like, </joey>
<connor> you know, when you rewatch this movie so many times, </connor>
<joey> and then you go and watch like- </joey>
<joey> - Have you rewatched it a lot? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause it used to be on channel four </joey>
<garnt> all the fucking time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it did, didn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - So I used to watch it all the fucking time, </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 ad breaks in between. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, you know, you'd watch this movie </garnt>
<garnt> and then you'd read about it and you'd be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, that's what that was about." </joey>
<connor> And then you go back and watch it. </connor>
<connor> "Oh shit!" </connor>
<joey> - I was exactly the same with, </joey>
<joey> and I was debating whether to put it on, </joey>
<garnt> but I was like, no, my three by three is </garnt>
<garnt> already pretentious enough. </garnt>
<garnt> I was gonna put "Mulholland Drive." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> Great film by the way. </garnt>
<joey> - Great film. </joey>
<joey> David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. </joey>
<joey> But I was like, I don't want this to be more pretentious. </joey>
<garnt> - That's what I was thinking as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's so many things in "No Country for Old Men" </garnt>
<garnt> that I just love so much to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the fact that he just decides sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> to flip a coin to kill them. </garnt>
<connor> And he went through with it. </connor>
<connor> Like, if it genuinely went heads, </connor>
<joey> he wouldn't like it would kill them. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, holy shit, this man is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, I've gone through this like recent phase of </garnt>
<connor> just like instead of watching movies again, </connor>
<connor> I just rewatch clips from movies. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason, like, because I watched one, </connor>
<joey> another iconic clip gets recommended, </joey>
<joey> and like, I remember just rewatching the gas station scene- </joey>
<connor> - I fucking love that! </connor>
<connor> - And holy fuck. </connor>
<connor> What a good scene. </connor>
<connor> I think out of like the entire history of movies, </connor>
<garnt> in terms of like tension, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't think of a better scene than that. </garnt>
<connor> - He's just such a good actor as well, </connor>
<connor> but I can't remember the main man. </connor>
<connor> He was one of the villains in the "Bond" movies. </connor>
<connor> But he's terrifying. </connor>
<connor> He's so good at this. </connor>
<connor> - Those eyes, man. </connor>
<connor> - I know, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Cold blooded eyes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every single dialogue moment that he has with anyone, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like, oh my God, it's fucking terrifying. </connor>
<connor> - That's funny you say you go back </connor>
<joey> and like watch movie clips of like iconic movies </joey>
<joey> 'cause I have that exact thing with the fucking court scene </joey>
<joey> in "There Will Be Blood." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, Daniel Day Lewis is like doing </joey>
<connor> that like insane monologue at the courtroom, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, holy shit. </joey>
<joey> I need to go back and watch this movie, </joey>
<joey> but I can't be fucked to go back and watch this. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually like (laughs) there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's been the phase now where, </garnt>
<garnt> because I've been watching a lot of movie clips, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I just watch clips from movies I haven't seen. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I end up just- </garnt>
<garnt> - You psychopath. </garnt>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - You psychopath. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because like it gets recommended </garnt>
<connor> and like it's a good clickbait title. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, damn, that was a good scene. </connor>
<connor> And then I watch another clip and another clip. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like there's a lot of people doing this now </connor>
<connor> because I go to the comments section, </connor>
<connor> and, - Psychopath. </connor>
<connor> - I go to the comments section and it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like it's people </garnt>
<garnt> who've gone through the exact same algorithm journey as me. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember going through the comments section </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> "I feel like I've watched this entire movie now </garnt>
<garnt> "just through clips." </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, that's exactly what I did! </joey>
<joey> - Those poor cinema directors pour their heart out </joey>
<connor> to make a cohesive story that's well paced, </connor>
<joey> and you motherfuckers go on YouTube and watch clips. </joey>
<joey> "I've seen the movie now. </joey>
<connor> "I've seen four clips." </connor>
<connor> - "I've seen the TikTok clips of it." </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, I fucking love that movie. </connor>
<connor> I can rewatch it as many times. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, watch "No Country for Old Men." </garnt>
<garnt> It's a very good film. - That's a great film. </garnt>
<joey> - Or just watch the gas station scene on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - No! </joey>
<joey> Don't do that! </joey>
<joey> Don't do that! - With zero context. </joey>
<joey> - You need to watch the whole film! </joey>
<garnt> - And be very confused why this guy is asking this other guy </garnt>
<joey> to flip a coin. </joey>
<joey> - It's still a great scene even out of context. </joey>
<connor> - The fucking dialogue he asks people is, like, </connor>
<connor> the things he asks people are so creepy. </connor>
<garnt> - The thing that stands out to me </garnt>
<garnt> in that film wasn't the dialogue, </garnt>
<connor> but it's when he puts down the candy wrapper </connor>
<connor> and it just like expands for like a little bit too long. </connor>
<connor> And I've never been so tense hearing </connor>
<garnt> just a candy wrapper expand. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - Also, the coolest weapon ever used in a movie. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - The fucking gas canister. </connor>
<joey> So fucking cool. </joey>
<connor> Because you're like, oh, this is badass </connor>
<connor> but fuck he's terrifying. </connor>
<joey> But man, that's cool though. </joey>
<connor> - Really scary. </connor>
<joey> I forgot Tommy Lee Jones is in that movie as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, he's the main guy trying to get him, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> The detective or police guy or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - The sheriff. </connor>
<joey> - The sheriff, that's right, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then of course, last of all, we've got "Ip Man." </connor>
<connor> Fucking... </connor>
<garnt> I mean, what can you say? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the best, one of the best, </garnt>
<joey> if not the best martial arts movie, </joey>
<joey> especially in the past 20 years. </joey>
<joey> - I agree with that. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of, I mean, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure a lot of people who are massive martial arts buff </joey>
<joey> would argue there's a lot of the earlier films, </joey>
<connor> like some of Jet Li's earlier stuffs, </connor>
<joey> some of Jackie Chan's earlier stuff. </joey>
<joey> - What happened to Jet Li? </joey>
<connor> He just kinda disappeared. </connor>
<connor> - He kind of jetted. </connor>
<joey> - As far as I know- </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Get the fuck out of here. </joey>
<garnt> - So as far as I know what happened with Jet Li is </garnt>
<garnt> that after "Fearless," which was the 2008- </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I thought was a fucking amazing film. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was supposed to be his last, </garnt>
<garnt> that was supposed to be his last </garnt>
<garnt> like epic martial arts film. </garnt>
<connor> And it was kind of well received. </connor>
<connor> It was, it's like a very seven, six out of 10 film. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was really good. </connor>
<garnt> It was, actually like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's really underrated for a Jet Li movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, his older stuff is just way better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> But in terms of modern stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, and that was supposed to be his last one. </garnt>
<garnt> And then what ended up happening was is </garnt>
<joey> that the "Expendables" were like money. </joey>
<joey> So that was actually like- </joey>
<joey> - That's right, he was in "The Expendables." </joey>
<joey> - So that was like his last action film. </joey>
<joey> And since then, he kind of said, </joey>
<joey> as far as I know, he kind of quit doing </joey>
<garnt> big martial arts films 'cause I think it's just too intense. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's a lot 'cause you have to, </garnt>
<connor> those scenes, like choreograph is insane. </connor>
<connor> - I just remembered the fucking "Expendables" movie. </connor>
<joey> I was like talk about the most wankerish movie. </joey>
<joey> Like, "Let's just get as many big people as possible </joey>
<garnt> "and just throw them into a movie." </garnt>
<connor> - It's just fun, right? </connor>
<garnt> - It was fun. </garnt>
<joey> - But have you seen this? </joey>
<joey> - I've seen "Ip Man," yeah. </joey>
<connor> - When did you watch "Ip Man?" </connor>
<connor> - I actually watched it not too long ago </connor>
<connor> 'cause you recommended it. </connor>
<connor> - Did you like it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's really fucking good. </connor>
<joey> I mean, I love Jet Li. </joey>
<connor> - It's got one of my favorite fight scenes is when he, </connor>
<connor> fighting the Japanese and the karate, like 10 of them </connor>
<garnt> and he breaks their leg. </garnt>
<connor> - That scene I think is like the best, </connor>
<garnt> one of the best fucking martial arts scenes of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> Talking about clips you can rewatch on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, okay, to be fair, </connor>
<connor> all right, yeah, that's fair enough. </connor>
<joey> - You can watch Kung Fu fights. </joey>
<joey> But like you can't watch that scene </joey>
<joey> from "No Country for Old Men" out of context. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's just, like the story of "Ip Man" </connor>
<garnt> is it's about when Japan is invading China way back. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I think there's a scene where, </garnt>
<garnt> but once they've invaded they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh well, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> "Japanese karate or something is superior. </garnt>
<connor> "So bring your Chinese people to practice with." </connor>
<joey> - To practice. </joey>
<joey> - That's literally what it is. </joey>
<connor> It's like, if you win, you get a bag of rice or something. </connor>
<joey> And he's like, "I'll take on 10 of you." </joey>
<connor> Okay, it's kind of cheesy, but it is epic. </connor>
<connor> But it's so fucking epic. </connor>
<connor> And he like snaps their legs doing it. </connor>
<connor> It's insane. </connor>
<joey> - I feel that kind of cheesiness though </joey>
<joey> in martial arts films is what makes a martial arts film. </joey>
<joey> - It totally is. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like it set, that scene alone, </garnt>
<connor> it set the stakes perfectly where it's just like, </connor>
<joey> holy shit, I'm ready to see him fuck shit up. </joey>
<joey> And he just takes on 10 black belts. </joey>
<connor> - That's not even like the end of the film though. </connor>
<garnt> It's like halfway through. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's the best fight. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the best fight of the franchise. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember when, because the previous guy, </garnt>
<joey> he fought like three black belts, </joey>
<joey> and he's like, "Fuck, I'll take on all of you." </joey>
<joey> And it's just one of the few moments in film </joey>
<connor> where you're just like, 'I'm ready for this." </connor>
<connor> - You don't care how cheesy it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't care how cheesy this is. </garnt>
<connor> - Especially like when you are like, </connor>
<connor> so when I was like 16, </connor>
<connor> whenever I was watching all these movies, </connor>
<connor> I legitimately thought like martial arts is like badass </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, dude, this is epic. </connor>
<connor> But obviously now with all the, you know, </connor>
<connor> the MMA fighters that like fought them, </connor>
<connor> now it's not so epic because you're like, okay, </connor>
<connor> the MMA fighters just kill these guys. </connor>
<connor> But when you're like 16, you think like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh shit, this is like the superior way of fighting. </garnt>
<joey> "This is epic. </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God!" </joey>
<connor> Like, it's so cool. </connor>
<joey> - "They don't use strength, they use speed and balance!" </joey>
<joey> - It's so fucking cool. </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, now, not so much. </garnt>
<garnt> But back then, you're like, "Oh my God, this is amazing!" </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of martial, </garnt>
<connor> like Jet Li's earlier stuff is amazing. </connor>
<connor> Obviously Jackie Chan's earlier cinemography is amazing </connor>
<joey> as well. </joey>
<garnt> Love like "Drunken Master" and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> That's such a good film. </garnt>
<garnt> What are some really good, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the, I forgot </garnt>
<garnt> what Jet Li's highest rated film is called. </garnt>
<connor> It's his 1980s film. </connor>
<connor> It's really highly rated. </connor>
<connor> Is it "Fist of the Dragon" is it? </connor>
<connor> Or "Enter the Dragon" or something? </connor>
<garnt> - "Enter the Dragon" is a Bruce Lee movie. </garnt>
<connor> - [Ashley] "Fist of the Legend." </connor>
<garnt> - "Fist of the Legend" that's it. </garnt>
<joey> That's like, his, </joey>
<connor> like I think it has like 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. </connor>
<joey> - I was about to say "Fist of Fury," </joey>
<joey> but I'm pretty sure that's Bruce Lee, right? </joey>
<connor> - That's Bruce Lee. </connor>
<garnt> - Also "Hero" with Jet Li is a really good one. </garnt>
<garnt> But it depends if you'd like martial arts film </garnt>
<garnt> where they use like wires. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, some people don't like it when they do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's wire fu, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of prefer it when they're just </garnt>
<connor> like beating the shit out of each other. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that the name of the genre? </garnt>
<garnt> Wire fu? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know it has a name. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] It's called wirework. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wirework. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not really martial arts, but it is martial arts. </connor>
<joey> But "Hero" was really good. </joey>
<joey> 2006. </joey>
<connor> - I really liked "Hero" which had Donnie Yen in it as well. </connor>
<joey> And Jet Li. </joey>
<joey> - The story's so fucking cool. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that story is cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like I haven't really sat down </garnt>
<joey> and watched like a lot of Jet Li films. </joey>
<connor> - His stuff is actually like really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause Donnie Yen hasn't... </connor>
<garnt> Oh, another one, I think it's called, </garnt>
<garnt> it might be called "War" or like "Warrior" or something. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's about like the three kingdoms </garnt>
<connor> or something in China way back. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] "Warrior." </connor>
<joey> - What is it called? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] I think it's called "Warrior." </joey>
<joey> - Might be called just "Warrior." </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] "Warrior," yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's such a good fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Jet Li film? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Jet Li's the main character. </joey>
<garnt> And it's like this... </garnt>
<garnt> About how like a general got like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna spoil it. </garnt>
<garnt> But just watch it. </garnt>
<connor> It's really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Really, really fucking good. </connor>
<garnt> - And I feel like, 'cause I, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't want to put another martial arts film </garnt>
<garnt> on my three by three, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like one of the few things Southeast Asians </garnt>
<garnt> can be proud about are our fucking martial arts films. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause we have like, "The Raid," "Ong-Bak." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "Ong-Bak" is really good. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty much the only thing of Thai culture </connor>
<connor> that's ever been like popularized outside. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, like I, like, </connor>
<connor> I was really happy to see like the more </connor>
<joey> like gritty martial art films. </joey>
<connor> You know, you think of like, you know, </connor>
<connor> "Ip Man" is more like very clean. </connor>
<connor> - "The Raid" is really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - "The Raid" is so good. </connor>
<connor> - Indonesian, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's Indonesian. </garnt>
<garnt> - But directed by a Welsh guy. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<garnt> - It's a Welsh guy who directed it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that "The Raid 1" or "Raid 2?" </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I know he directed "Raid 2." </connor>
<connor> - "Raid..." </connor>
<connor> Who directed "Raid 1" and "2?" </connor>
<connor> Can you check real quick? </connor>
<joey> I swear, it's the same guy. </joey>
<joey> - That's another movie I've heard of, but I've never seen. </joey>
<connor> - "The Raid?" </connor>
<joey> Dude! </joey>
<garnt> "The Raid 1" is such a good premise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just get to the top of an apartment building. </garnt>
<garnt> That's it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically just a fighting game. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, Double Dragon. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just Double Dragon. </connor>
<connor> - The fighting, like the choreography is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Gareth Evans. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Gareth Evans. </garnt>
<garnt> The most Welsh name on earth. </garnt>
<connor> Too Welsh names, Gareth and Evan. </connor>
<connor> - Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - I just like, it's so bizarre. </connor>
<connor> There's a Welsh guy directing an Indonesian film. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Hell yeah, dude. </joey>
<joey> - But it's just like awesome. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's such a good- </joey>
<joey> - That's some cross culture pollination right there. </joey>
<joey> Hell yeah, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Look at us Thai and Welsh here too, you know. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, yeah, I fucking love fighting, </garnt>
<garnt> martial arts movies. </garnt>
<connor> I've watched nearly all of Jet Li's films. </connor>
<connor> I think I've watched most of them. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't watch some of the older ones </connor>
<connor> 'cause they were impossible to find online. </connor>
<connor> And I've watched I think all </connor>
<connor> of Donnie Yen's films pre "Ip Man." </connor>
<garnt> I haven't watched "Ip Man 4." </garnt>
<garnt> I heard it was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I really liked "Ip Man 4." </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I actually it's my second favorite "Ip Man." </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I'll watch it tonight. </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like "Ip Man 4" is just- </connor>
<connor> - "3" was the worst. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like "Ip Man 4" was just "Ip Man 2" done better. </connor>
<connor> Because my problem with "Ip Man 2" is that the villain is </connor>
<connor> just so comical that I just couldn't take him seriously. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, let's characterize this character. </connor>
<connor> - So, the whole selling point </connor>
<connor> to like a Western audience of "Ip Man" was just </connor>
<garnt> that it's the guy who trained Bruce Lee. </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally the selling point of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Fair enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - But he's supposed to be like a master or something. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that is a cool like catch to be fair. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that's how it was marketed, and the story, </connor>
<connor> I don't, again, I don't know how true it is, </connor>
<garnt> but it's an interesting made up story maybe if it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it's true or not. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] It's true. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a real character but the events are fictional. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's normally how it goes </connor>
<garnt> with martial arts people. </garnt>
<joey> It's kind of hard to survive some of the shit </joey>
<joey> they go through. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I'm sure they fought all those people, </joey>
<joey> but they probably died halfway through. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I don't think he did fight 10 black belts. </joey>
<joey> You know, that's probably, </joey>
<garnt> probably dramatized. </garnt>
<joey> - Unless he's like a fucking super saiyan. </joey>
<connor> - There's another Donnie Yen film </connor>
<connor> that's actually really good where he's like a detective </connor>
<connor> in a small town, I think in a village. </connor>
<connor> And it's really good </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like a mystery of the martial arts </connor>
<connor> and it's just, yeah, it's really good. </connor>
<connor> I forgot what it's called. </connor>
<connor> Again, I've watched these movies so long ago. </connor>
<garnt> It came after "Ip Man." </garnt>
<connor> - Same with Jackie Chan as well. </connor>
<connor> Some of his best works are when he was young. </connor>
<garnt> Like, fucking "Police Story." </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, "Police Story" is fantastic. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Is that scene where he jumps on the wire? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And it's completely real. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Were you thinking of "Flash Point?" </joey>
<connor> - Might be "Flash Point," yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Or "Kung Fu Jungle." </joey>
<joey> I think it's "Flash Point." </joey>
<connor> - Is it yellow the poster? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] The yellow one is, oh, oh wait. </joey>
<garnt> We have the Chinese name. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the one where he's a teacher, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> Again, I might've remembered it incorrectly </connor>
<garnt> because it's been so- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] "Big Brother." </garnt>
<connor> - I'll have to go back to the thing and watch it. </connor>
<connor> I might be misremembering. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like one underrated Donnie Yen film is </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was "SPX" or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the plot? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt sighs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I do not remember. </garnt>
<garnt> But the only reason- </garnt>
<joey> - "SPS" just sounds like a law firm. </joey>
<joey> - Let me, let me... </joey>
<joey> - Because what happened was, is that you had Bruce Lee, </joey>
<connor> and then you had Jackie Chan. </connor>
<connor> And then when Jackie Chan was getting older, </connor>
<connor> Jet Li was making films. </connor>
<connor> And then when Jet Li was getting older, Donnie Yen came in. </connor>
<connor> But I don't really know who it is now. </connor>
<connor> Who's like the main martial arts guy. </connor>
<connor> - Martial arts guy? </connor>
<connor> - Who is the main like face of martial arts now? </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Donnie Yen, but he's close to retiring. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it still is Donnie Yen </connor>
<garnt> because he's in the new Marvel film. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but they also don't really utilize him much. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, he's the villain, isn't it? </connor>
<joey> - I feel like martial arts films are kind of </joey>
<joey> just like a little bit of a dying breed almost </joey>
<garnt> in like especially in the west I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I'm sure, like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> if you go to Asia and Southeast Asia they're still- </joey>
<connor> - I mean, the past 20 years have all been from China. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Ip Man" is from China. </connor>
<connor> And then Donnie Yen is in "Rogue One" from "Star Wars." </connor>
<connor> But again, when I was watching that movie </connor>
<connor> and you can see what Donnie Yen does, </connor>
<joey> kind of disappointed 'cause you're like, </joey>
<joey> Donnie Yen is so fucking good, and they barely use him. </joey>
<joey> He just swings a fucking thing around. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh cool. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't seen "Rogue One." </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's cool, but yeah, he could have done- </joey>
<joey> - He could have done so much. </joey>
<joey> Like anyone, like a lot of people could have done </joey>
<joey> what Donnie Yen did in that film. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like why, </joey>
<connor> if you're getting Donnie Yen, </connor>
<connor> and he doesn't really speak much in the film. </connor>
<connor> Because I don't think he can speak much English. </connor>
<connor> - All I'm saying is there hasn't been a "Rush Hour 2." </connor>
<connor> There hasn't been a modern "Rush Hour." </connor>
<garnt> - Do a reboot with Donnie Yen. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly! </joey>
<connor> Fuck yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And Ice Cube. </connor>
<connor> - Ice Cube and Donnie Yen! </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> The movie industry, we just gave you a million dollar idea. </connor>
<connor> Donnie Yen and Ice Cube in "Rush Hour 7" </connor>
<joey> or whatever the next one is. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] The movie you were thinking about was "SPL." </joey>
<connor> - "SPL." </connor>
<joey> - What's the plot of that movie? </joey>
<connor> Can you tell me the plot? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] "SPL?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] My phone's in Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> - But I remember there's one fight scene in "SPL" </garnt>
<garnt> which is like completely just improvised. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, is that in the street? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's in the street. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's such a fucking good fight scene. </garnt>
<garnt> And then because the whole premise around this, </garnt>
<garnt> the whole background around this fight scene is </garnt>
<garnt> that they trained together, these two actors, </garnt>
<joey> Donnie Yen and I'm not sure who the other person is, </joey>
<joey> but they trained together. </joey>
<joey> And because they were so familiar </joey>
<joey> with each other's fighting style, </joey>
<joey> they literally just improvise this fight scene with just- </joey>
<joey> - That's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - With just this basic, okay, here's what's meant to happen, </joey>
<garnt> but let's just try to kill each other </garnt>
<garnt> and then let's just get it on film. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such a good film as well. </garnt>
<connor> - [Ashley] It's a story where an honest detective </connor>
<connor> who's suffering from cancer and about to retire resorts </connor>
<connor> to illegal means in order to capture ruthless triads. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - All I remember was there was a police detective in it, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like... </garnt>
<joey> That's like, it's either like traditional historical setting </joey>
<joey> or they're a police detective. </joey>
<joey> - Or it's a crime drama. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Or it's like a neo noire crime drama. </joey>
<garnt> But I mean like, oh God, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you like describe this three by three? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you describe any? - Powerful. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do describe any three by three? </garnt>
<joey> - You can describe mine, pretentious film critic. </joey>
<connor> - Pretentious, powerful. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Guilty pleasure. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I was trying to think of a word with P. </connor>
<garnt> - P? </garnt>
<garnt> Why P? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause- </garnt>
<joey> - Pretentious, powerful. </joey>
<joey> Poopoo peepee. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, poopoo peepee. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I guess those are our three by threes. </garnt>
<connor> - Hope you get to watch some interesting movies </connor>
<joey> if you haven't seen some of these. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, please go and watch all the movies we recommended. </joey>
<joey> - I have some movie recommendations </joey>
<connor> that I will be watching, I guess now. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've honestly come out of this </garnt>
<connor> with some movie recommendations. </connor>
<connor> And this was actually like- </connor>
<joey> - "Shrek 2." </joey>
<joey> - Obviously. </joey>
<joey> I always got time for "Shrek 2." </joey>
<joey> - We know what we're doing after this. </joey>
<joey> Sitting down with some "Shrek 2," baby. </joey>
<joey> - But no, I mean, like it feels good to be able </joey>
<joey> to talk about movies </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like I don't get to talk about movies a lot, </joey>
<joey> even though like I kind of realized </joey>
<garnt> whenever I talk about movies, </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen a lot of movies </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like you guys have seen a lot of movies as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And we even like off-camera, </garnt>
<garnt> we don't really talk about movies in general. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it just has to do with the fact </joey>
<joey> that we haven't really had time to just sit down </joey>
<connor> and watch some. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair, I've not watched movies in awhile. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, me neither. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I feel like people don't watch as many movies anymore. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like if it's not on Netflix, </garnt>
<garnt> then I probably haven't seen it. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd say I've watched like 90% of the films I've seen </connor>
<connor> in like between the ages of like 18 and 14. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think that's usually like the period in your life </joey>
<joey> when you're like, "I'm gonna watch a lot of movies." </joey>
<joey> - It's also when I discovered you could </joey>
<joey> just Google the movies. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, holy shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, my dad used to collect </joey>
<garnt> like a shitload of DVDs when BlockBuster was still a thing. </garnt>
<joey> So, like I just watched a lot of the movies with my dad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I watch a lot less movies </garnt>
<garnt> than I did before as well </garnt>
<connor> because now it's just all been replaced by anime. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of anime movies. - YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - And YouTube as well. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like if there's a big enough movie, </connor>
<connor> then I probably have seen it. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm surprised no one put any Marvel movies here. </connor>
<connor> - Who the fuck cares? </connor>
<connor> - Who the fuck cares about Marvel? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I care about Marvel. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, Marvel's that one franchise </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm just like, hello, I'm a normie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's fun. </garnt>
<connor> But it's not like, I'm never like, </connor>
<garnt> "Fuck dude, that made me think something, </garnt>
<garnt> "that made me like happy." </garnt>
<garnt> - If I'm gonna watch a three hour- </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, I was really fucking invested </joey>
<joey> in "Infinity War" and "Endgame." </joey>
<connor> I will say that. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't even watch those. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Endgame" was good. </garnt>
<garnt> But again, it wasn't like, I thought it was amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> but it wasn't like, </garnt>
<garnt> when I left the cinema, </garnt>
<connor> like a week later, I don't think about "Endgame." </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I'm surprised no one put "John Wick" as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I was close. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought someone was gonna put "John Wick" on. </garnt>
<joey> - That was just another one of those </joey>
<joey> like it's fun, turn your brain off- </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no. - It's amazing. </garnt>
<connor> No! - It's fucking amazing. </connor>
<joey> - No, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. </joey>
<connor> - "John Wick" is probably like my favorite action series. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like in the west, they have "John Wick" </garnt>
<connor> and in the east they have "Ip Man." </connor>
<connor> That's like, "Ip Man" is just like the Asian equivalent </connor>
<connor> of "John Wick." </connor>
<connor> - Dude, man, I just... </connor>
<garnt> It holds a very dear place in my heart. </garnt>
<garnt> I've watched all the "John Wick" movies in the cinema. </garnt>
<garnt> And like I've watched the last one that came out alone, </garnt>
<garnt> and the cinema was empty </garnt>
<joey> and I had like such an amazing time watching that. </joey>
<joey> It was like the last- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - Bro, it was just fun. </joey>
<joey> I got to put my legs up on the chair in front of me. </joey>
<joey> I had all my popcorn and I just got to enjoy it, bro. </joey>
<connor> It was so good. </connor>
<connor> It was such a good, </connor>
<connor> dude, I'm so excited for the next one. </connor>
<connor> - I've only seen the first "John Wick" movie. </connor>
<joey> - I'm so hype for it. </joey>
<connor> It gets better and better. </connor>
<connor> The second one's amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Again, it's another one of those like long list of movies </joey>
<joey> that I hear people talking about saying it's amazing. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, all right, I'll watch it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to be too normie, so I didn't put it on. </connor>
<connor> But it's, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, just sometimes I just don't know what movies </garnt>
<connor> to watch because I, </connor>
<connor> like it's weird now 'cause I don't know where to start </connor>
<connor> because you know, we're so ingrained in like anime culture </connor>
<connor> that I know, you know, when there's a hot anime coming out. </connor>
<garnt> But in terms of movie recommendations, </garnt>
<garnt> anything from like the past five years, </garnt>
<garnt> if it's not been talked about a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> then I just probably haven't seen it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I barely have enough time to watch anime </garnt>
<joey> let alone fucking movies. </joey>
<garnt> - Joey, you don't watch anime period. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I don't. </joey>
<joey> I don't watch movies, period. </joey>
<joey> I don't watch anime, period. </joey>
<joey> That's just how it goes. </joey>
<joey> - Just read manga. </joey>
<joey> - I just read manga. </joey>
<garnt> Just read manga and read porn. </garnt>
<joey> - You know who does watch movies, Joey? </joey>
<joey> - Who? </joey>
<joey> - You tell me. </joey>
<joey> - Is it the patrons? </joey>
<connor> - It is the patrons. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah, bro. </connor>
<connor> Look at all these movie goers. </connor>
<joey> Let us know on the Reddit I guess. </joey>

<joey> and I don't have to think about making a video on it. </joey>
<connor> I can just watch it to enjoy it. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, </joey>
<joey> to me with movies is how I feel other people are to anime </joey>
