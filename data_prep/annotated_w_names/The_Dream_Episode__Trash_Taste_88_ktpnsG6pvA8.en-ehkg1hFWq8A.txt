<garnt> - Hello, hello, hello, hello? </garnt>
<joey> Testing. Testing. </joey>
<connor> Testing.
- How do we podcast? </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- How do I talk </connor>
<garnt> to real human beings? </garnt>
<garnt> (digital chirping)
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Do we just start?
- What was that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Do we just start? </garnt>
<garnt> - What was that?
- What do we do? </garnt>
<garnt> What do we do? </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle music) </garnt>
<garnt> Hello, gamers, </garnt>
<garnt> and welcome to the next
episode of, "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<joey> Fucking I stuttered already.
- What is this, </joey>
<joey> midnight radio? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Hello there. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want, </joey>
<connor> I don't even want to pretend
I have energy right now. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
I'm coming in </connor>
<connor> with a chill class today.
- You don't have any energy? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. It's- </connor>
<connor> - You're the host, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> You should come up with host energy. </connor>
<garnt> - Hello, everyone, </garnt>
<garnt> and welcome to this
episode of, "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> There, there, there. </connor>
<connor> Was that enough energy, Connor? </connor>
<connor> Was that enough energy?
- Who are we? </connor>
<connor> Who are we? </connor>
<connor> I don't know who we are.
- Who are we? </connor>
<connor> - I am Garnt, </connor>
<joey> and once again, I'm joined
by my host, Connor and Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow.
- How have you boys been? </joey>
<joey> - We've been all right. </joey>
<joey> How have you been </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
is more the question. </joey>
<joey> - How've you been, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - I've not been all right. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean,
(co-hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> I've certainly been in isolation. </joey>
<joey> If you didn't know, this
is actually the first time </joey>
<joey> we've filmed in three weeks now </joey>
<joey> because we took two weeks off.
- Yeah, three weeks. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know about you boys, </joey>
<joey> but not filming for three weeks </joey>
<joey> felt like three years for me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Especially for me
because I go on Twitter, </connor>
<connor> I go on social media, I
see you guys streaming, </connor>
<garnt> doing all of your shit, </garnt>
<garnt> and here I am just being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Just some bed ill. Just,
can't really talk, can't-" </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I don't think
anyone can fault you for that. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you got fucking COVID, </joey>
<joey> of course you're going to be sick. </joey>
<joey> - So if you didn't know, I, unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> tested positive about two weeks ago now. </joey>
<connor> It's been, actually, 15 days
since I tested positive. </connor>
<connor> Now I have officially tested negative, </connor>
<joey> so I am safe </joey>
<joey> to film again with the boys.
- He's back. He's back. </joey>
<connor> - Welcome back. Welcome back.
- Just in case. Just in case, </connor>
<connor> I'm in my own
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> isolation corner right here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - We didn't plan this.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I've been in isolation for 14 days and- </joey>
<joey> - How does it feel? </joey>
<joey> How does it feel to get COVID? </joey>
<connor> - It sucks. </connor>
<garnt> Luckily- </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels American.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Just joking. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck.
- Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> We're British, too.
- It's been zero days. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I had to. I had to. </garnt>
<connor> It's been three weeks. </connor>
<joey> - Three weeks and Connor's already, </joey>
<joey> How many minutes has that been? </joey>
<connor> - It was-
- I was just. I was just. </connor>
<connor> Connor was having withdrawal symptoms </connor>
<connor> for three weeks.
- You know, the vein busting. </connor>
<joey> - Been like, "I want a show so hard." </joey>
<connor> - My veins were bursting. </connor>
<connor> I hadn't insulted America in three weeks. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember when I got it. </garnt>
<garnt> I was, honestly, a little bit salty. </garnt>
<garnt> I was a little bit salty. </garnt>
<garnt> Not because, Obviously,
getting COVID sucks, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was a little bit salty </garnt>
<connor> because before I got COVID, I
hardly ever went out at all. </connor>
<connor> I didn't go out because
I spent all this time </connor>
<connor> marathoning all the great anime of 2021 </connor>
<connor> to make my, "Best of Anime, 2021" video. </connor>
<connor> So I was just inside. Just
watching all the best shit. </connor>
<connor> Watching all this anime. Didn't go out. </connor>
<connor> I went out, Aside from,
"Trash Taste" recordings, </connor>
<connor> I went out once, </connor>
<garnt> and the only time I went
out was with these boys. </garnt>
<connor> That was, literally,
the only time I went out </connor>
<garnt> in the past two weeks
prior to me catching COVID. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I figured it out. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] You think you figured it out? </connor>
<garnt> - I know why you got it. </garnt>
<connor> I think the air, when you're six foot, </connor>
<connor> is high enough.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - COVID was traveling
in the six-foot sphere. </connor>
<joey> We're under the, sorry, Joe, </joey>
<connor> Under the six foot.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> We couldn't breath it in.
We couldn't breath it in. </connor>
<connor> - Wow.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Hot air rises, right? </garnt>
<connor> COVID rises.
- COVID rises. </connor>
<connor> - COVID is rising. </connor>
<connor> - I was about to say
anime gives you COVID. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I guess that's another hypothesis as well. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the actual scientific, </garnt>
<connor> We're not scientists. Do not take of that. </connor>
<garnt> - COVID is the height equalizer. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - We needed this. We needed this. </garnt>
<joey> We need a win.
- They need to nerf six foot </joey>
<garnt> or something now, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously, when I tested positive, </garnt>
<connor> I remember messaging these boys. </connor>
<connor> I mean, like, "Boy's, I got to be honest. </connor>
<connor> You should probably be careful </connor>
<connor> because, I'm not going to lie, </connor>
<connor> the only time I've been
out in the past two weeks </connor>
<garnt> aside from, "Trash Taste",
which I'm also with the boys, </garnt>
<garnt> was with you guys when we off
to that one business meeting. </garnt>
<joey> - Let me just say I'm glad I got that text </joey>
<joey> while I was on the toilet
because I did shit myself. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> When I read that, I
was like, "Oh, my God." </joey>
<joey> - Would you have shit yourself
if you weren't on the toilet? </joey>
<joey> - Probably. Yeah.
- Oh, okay. Okay. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "Thank God my pants are down </connor>
<garnt> and I'm literally taking a shit." </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was like, "Brace
yourself, boys. It might come. </garnt>
<garnt> It might come." </garnt>
<garnt> - The storm's coming.
- Yeah. The storm's coming. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it didn't come. </garnt>
<garnt> And, apparently, I was
the only one who got COVID </garnt>
<connor> in our entire office. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I say this because, I say this, </connor>
<connor> I'm happy that no one else got COVID </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- aside from me. </connor>
<connor> I'm happy. I'm happy. </connor>
<connor> - Why didn't anyone else get it? </connor>
<connor> I don't want to be the only one. </connor>
<connor> But as the guy who does not, </connor>
<joey> The only time we go out to make content </joey>
<joey> is for, "Trash Taste". </joey>
<joey> You boys, filming outside, going outside, </joey>
<joey> filming constantly, I'm just
like, " Why, why, why me? </joey>
<joey> Why is it me? </joey>
<joey> Why is it the nerd that stays
inside and watches anime </joey>
<joey> that gets COVID? </joey>
<joey> - Anime gives you COVID,
man. I'm telling you. </joey>
<joey> Why do you think I stopped watching it? </joey>
<joey> Because Sydney got it
as well, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Sydney got it around two days
after me, which makes sense. </garnt>
<joey> That was two days after
symptoms had set in. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, I'm glad that I was vaccinated </joey>
<joey> and I think it was Omicron as well </joey>
<joey> because my symptoms weren't too bad. </joey>
<joey> I remember I felt something coming. </joey>
<joey> (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> You know when you wake up </joey>
<joey> and you have a bit of a sore throat, </joey>
<joey> and you start shitting yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because you're just like,
"Oh, is this illness?" </connor>
<connor> - "Is this it?" </connor>
<connor> - "Am I getting ill? </connor>
<connor> Am I getting ill? Am I getting paranoid?" </connor>
<connor> I remember on the Thursday night, </connor>
<connor> Because I've been paranoid before about, </connor>
<connor> "Am I ill?" Or "Am I not ill?", </connor>
<connor> because I have a slight sore throat </connor>
<connor> or a slight cough or something, </connor>
<connor> but I remember Thursday night here, </connor>
<connor> and your body knows when
it's about to get ill. </connor>
<connor> I could feel that my body, </connor>
<connor> That a storm was coming in my body. </connor>
<garnt> And I was praying to God
that it was just the flu </garnt>
<garnt> or some kind of normal, other illness. </garnt>
<garnt> But I knew that something
was coming and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I told Sydney, "Sydney, I
think I'm about to get ill. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm calling it now." </garnt>
<connor> I'm calling it now. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] See if you get ill. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm going to get ill. </garnt>
<connor> - "You can't be mad if I
get ill. I already said it." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, "Honey, don't be mad.
Promise you won't be mad. </garnt>
<garnt> Promise you won't be mad. I
think I'm about to get it'll." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't have a fever but
my body started to feel </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit groggy,
a little bit fatigued. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like,
"I've felt this before." </garnt>
<garnt> I've felt this before. </garnt>
<joey> I've gotten the flu or
that kind of illness </joey>
<joey> where it conks me out for a few days. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, "Honey, don't be alarmed, </joey>
<joey> but I think I might be ill." </joey>
<joey> And then I went to sleep, woke up </joey>
<joey> and had a pretty high fever. </joey>
<joey> For me, at least. </joey>
<joey> I remember when we did
our second vaccination, </joey>
<joey> I had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit. </joey>
<joey> On that Thursday,
- 12. </joey>
<joey> - It's not. </joey>
<joey> - On that Thursday,
- It's 12. </joey>
<connor> - On that Thursday, I started
off with a 38 degree fever. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Okay, I
definitely got a fever.", </connor>
<connor> went to get tested, </connor>
<connor> and then, by the time
nighttime came around, </connor>
<joey> that fever had gone up 40 degrees. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck it. Which is dangerous.
- Uh oh. Uh oh. </joey>
<joey> - Which is dangerous. </joey>
<joey> I was Googling. </joey>
<connor> I was Googling, "When should
I go to the hospital?" </connor>
<connor> - Spoiler, he lived.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What is the, What is the
boiling point for human? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because normally when I
get the flu or something, </joey>
<joey> I go up to 39, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, Even then, </joey>
<joey> that's pretty high-
- That's a really bad cold </joey>
<connor> as well.
- That's a really bad cold. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, It was like,
I remember measuring myself, </connor>
<connor> getting to 40, </connor>
<connor> and then I remember Googling, </connor>
<connor> "How high does your fever need to be </connor>
<connor> to consider going to the hospital?" </connor>
<garnt> And I remember Googling it, </garnt>
<garnt> and said, "After around 41 degree, </garnt>
<garnt> you should consider
going to the hospital." </garnt>
<garnt> And me, already drenched in sweat, </garnt>
<garnt> I start sweating even more, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - What do they, What can they
do there, if you have a fever? </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, here's a bed. Lie down." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> What can they actually do?
- Is it like placebo, </connor>
<joey> where because you're in a hospital, </joey>
<connor> you're going to get better sooner? </connor>
<joey> - Maybe, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they're like, "Oh, here's
an IV with nothing in it." </joey>
<joey> - Or maybe they give
you more stronger meds. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Maybe they give
you more stronger meds. </connor>
<joey> But at least-
- Here's POCARI Sweat. </joey>
<connor> Shut the fuck up.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This is hospital POCARI Sweat. </connor>
<joey> - But also, with some of these things, </joey>
<joey> Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. </joey>
<connor> I'll go on a rant after this. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, all I was going to say is, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I feel like it
is a bit of a placebo, </garnt>
<garnt> but also, in case your
symptoms do get majorly worse, </garnt>
<garnt> there is someone there to
put you under intensive care. </garnt>
<garnt> Just in case. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm absolutely terrified of hospitals. </garnt>
<connor> It's the only thing I'm scared of. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh, same here. </connor>
<joey> - I don't really-
- Well, I don't know anyone </joey>
<joey> who goes to the hospital and goes, "Yay." </joey>
<connor> - But some people don't mind. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Oh, whatever." </connor>
<connor> But I'm like, I would
literally do anything </connor>
<connor> not to go to the hospital,
which probably means that </connor>
<joey> at some point, </joey>
<joey> I'm probably going to
come down with something, </joey>
<connor> and I should probably go
and get it checked out, </connor>
<joey> - And just die in bed.
- But I'm not going to. </joey>
<connor> But I'm not because I'm so
stupid that I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "No. I'd rather not" </connor>
<connor> Because when I get ill, I
just never, ever assume, </connor>
<connor> "I should go to the hospital." </connor>
<connor> I just think, "Oh, I
should just ride it out." </connor>
<joey> But then you hear stories
about how people die from that, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Aah." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like a
lot of this is part of, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I think a lot of this is part of </garnt>
<garnt> growing up in England as
well because, I think, </garnt>
<garnt> there's definitely a
difference in mentality </garnt>
<connor> when it comes to illness, </connor>
<joey> especially when I started dating Sydney </joey>
<joey> and seeing how she handled getting ill </joey>
<joey> versus how I handled getting ill. </joey>
<joey> Because I'm just like, If I
have a fever, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Jut take some paracetamol,
ride it out, whatever." </joey>
<joey> Just start sweating in bed.
- Sweat it out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Sweat it out, sweat it out. </joey>
<connor> Because, in England, if
you go to see the doctor, </connor>
<connor> by the time you book an appointment </connor>
<joey> and you get the chance to go see the GP, </joey>
<joey> the fever's already gone. </joey>
<joey> The fever's already gone. </joey>
<joey> - You're either better or dead. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So it's either you're bad
enough to go to the hospital </joey>
<connor> or you just don't go to the doctor at all. </connor>
<connor> But with Sydney, luckily,
Sydney had health insurance </connor>
<joey> when she was in, When she
was growing up in America- </joey>
<joey> - Stop bragging.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Sure. Sydney's privileged, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah?
- Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> She had health insurance.
- Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Wow, health insurance. </joey>
<joey> So she would be like, If
she just got slightly ill, </joey>
<joey> "Just go see the doctor.
Just to make sure. </joey>
<joey> Just in case." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Use that health
insurance to your advantage. </joey>
<joey> - Use that health insurance. </joey>
<joey> Because you can just go see a, </joey>
<joey> So why would you not go see a doctor? </joey>
<joey> Me, dying in bed, being
like, "No, I don't see, </joey>
<joey> Sydney, I don't need to see a doctor. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to see a doctor. </joey>
<joey> Why would I need to see doctor? </joey>
<joey> It's only a 40 degree fever. </joey>
<joey> Google says I need to be 41
to go see a doctor, Sydney. </joey>
<joey> Come on. Come on. </joey>
<joey> I aint a pussy boy. I aint a pussy boy." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's true though. </connor>
<connor> In Japan, people are like
that, that's why, I think. </connor>
<connor> From what I heard,
(indistinct) people are like, </connor>
<connor> "I've got a headache.
I'm going to the clinic." </connor>
<connor> What? What? </connor>
<joey> No, no, no. You'll be fine. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. Just sleep it off. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. Maybe I'm being too harsh, </joey>
<joey> but then, do you ever find
that sometimes you're like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is me thing, </joey>
<connor> but sometimes I'm getting sick,
I'm like, "No. Stop, body. </connor>
<connor> Stop. Stop, right now."
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> Don't do this. </joey>
<joey> - What? Did you develop Nen?
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I think I might have, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this
is just me being stupid </joey>
<connor> but I just completely ignore it. </connor>
<connor> When I'm about to get sick,
I'm like, "We are not sick. </connor>
<connor> We will continue with our day
like everything is normal. </connor>
<garnt> - That just sounds like copium to the max. </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes I feel like it works, though. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's
just pure luck or it's, </connor>
<connor> It's probably my own stupidity. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I get ill, I
feel the illness coming, </connor>
<connor> and then, in my mind, I feel
like this is a deciding point. </connor>
<connor> In my he'd I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Am I going to resign
myself to being ill?, </connor>
<connor> or am I going to be
like, "No, I'm not ill. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to continue on. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to eat healthy,
I'm going to do it." </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> This sound like some Joe Rogan-esque shit </connor>
<connor> I'm saying right now.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> For small illnesses. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, if you've got some
kind of horrible illness, </joey>
<joey> it's like, "Yeah, no- </joey>
<joey> - The flu is controlled by the government. </joey>
<joey> - No amount of mind power is, </joey>
<connor> "Well, you know, it's
like a placebo effect." </connor>
<garnt> This shit is completely nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> We are not medical professionals. </garnt>
<connor> - We're going to say this right now, </connor>
<connor> we are not medical professionals. </connor>
<garnt> - This is a joke. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not a joke. See? </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I inject horse urine into my veins, Joey. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> When it's a tiny illness,
when it's a sore throat, </connor>
<connor> something like that,
sometimes I feel like, </connor>
<connor> how much of your mental,
Mental willpower can affect it </connor>
<connor> because you hear about the placebo effect </connor>
<connor> affecting how you can perform
in certain situations. </connor>
<connor> I'm wondering, how much can that affect </connor>
<connor> your likeliness to get sick? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I do feel like you're, Okay. </garnt>
<connor> This is going to be complete
speculation bullshit. </connor>
<connor> - This is all anecdotal. </connor>
<connor> Any medical professional would
be laughing at us right now. </connor>
<connor> - This is completely anecdotal </connor>
<connor> but I do feel like your mentality </connor>
<connor> and your willingness to, I
don't know, accept something, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it does play some
kind of conscious affect. </connor>
<connor> Because you hear, </connor>
<connor> You hear about stories </connor>
<connor> about people who have a deadly illness </connor>
<connor> and because they have
the will to fight it, </connor>
<connor> some people are able to
fight through the illness, </connor>
<connor> and some people are more
inclined to give in. </connor>
<connor> So I do feel, based on zero, </connor>
<connor> zero fucking scientific proof, </connor>
<connor> and just based on total
anecdotal evidence, </connor>
<joey> that there is some kind of effect </joey>
<joey> that your mentality has
towards illnesses, sometimes. </joey>
<joey> Not every time. </joey>
<joey> (stutters) </joey>
<joey> People, I'm not saying
everyone who died from cancer </joey>
<connor> being like, You obviously
didn't try the fucking, </connor>
<garnt> You obviously didn't try hard enough </garnt>
<connor> - You didn't want it enough. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't fight it hard enough. </connor>
<garnt> - You just have to get good. </garnt>
<joey> - Cancer is just the, "Dark
Souls" of illnesses, guys. </joey>
<joey> Come on. You just got to get good, man. </joey>
<connor> (Joey speaks indistinctly)
You just got to get good. </connor>
<garnt> I'm not trying to say that. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why I'm saying
it's with little things. </connor>
<joey> With colds and stuff. </joey>
<connor> I feel like when I'm way more
up for being like, "Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to just continue
with my day, mentally." </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - It's not like you do anything
to actually prevent it. </joey>
<connor> It's not like you take a fucking,
You eat honey or whatever. </connor>
<joey> - I go out of my way to not take anything. </joey>
<connor> I never take pain killers. </connor>
<connor> I hate taking them. </connor>
<connor> - To me, taking pain killers </connor>
<joey> is the point where I admit
defeat and I am actually ill. </joey>
<joey> Do you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Even this time, when I could
feel my body getting ill, </joey>
<connor> I was like, "No. It's
not it. I'm not ill." </connor>
<joey> I'm not going to go out,
obviously because it's a pandemic, </joey>
<joey> but I'm going to keep working. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to go by my daily schedule, </joey>
<joey> and I woke up and I'm like,
"38. That's a manageable fever. </joey>
<joey> I'll get tested. Come back. "
- I don't know. </joey>
<joey> 38's pretty fucking high. </joey>
<joey> To me it was manageable until,
I remember sitting at my PC </joey>
<joey> on the first day that the
symptoms started rolling in. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, at this time, </joey>
<joey> I didn't get any of the test results, </joey>
<joey> so I had no idea, It could've
been a cold for all I knew. </joey>
<joey> I remember sitting down at
the computer, trying to work, </joey>
<connor> and it was just, as the day
went on, I was like, "No, body. </connor>
<connor> Don't do this. You're not ill. </connor>
<connor> You're not ill. Come on, body. </connor>
<joey> You can power through this." </joey>
<joey> And I remember, it was
around five o'clock, </joey>
<joey> where I was staring at the script, </joey>
<joey> and I was trying to get shit
done, no words would come out </joey>
<joey> because I was just too tired. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Okay. I'm
absolutely fucking ill. </joey>
<joey> Let me take some fucking medicine. </joey>
<joey> Let me take my temperature
again. Let me do the fucking- </joey>
<garnt> - I can just imagine you sitting
at your computer and just </garnt>
<joey> (imitates Garnt)
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, God." </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Shit. My willpower wasn't
enough to beat this minor cold. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Shit.
- Who would've thought. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a perception,
man. It's a perception. </garnt>
<connor> - It seemed that, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> painkillers and stuff like
that, I have friends who, </connor>
<garnt> They'll take a painkiller </garnt>
<garnt> the moment they even
get a slight headache. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm always really
worried because then they, </garnt>
<connor> the same people, this
is completely anecdotal, </connor>
<connor> They're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah. It doesn't work as well anymore </connor>
<connor> because I take it too often." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "Well, that's scary. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to take it
unless I'm really in pain." </joey>
<joey> And then I'll be like, "All right. Fine. </joey>
<joey> I'll take a paracetamol or something" </joey>
<connor> - Because what happens if they get, say, </connor>
<joey> a really massive headache or
worse still, where it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, God." </joey>
<joey> If you don't have pain
medicine, you're just fucked. </joey>
<joey> You might faint. You might pass out. </joey>
<garnt> Whatever, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I always worry about stuff like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the only scary thing, for me, </garnt>
<garnt> was because I'd never gotten COVID before. </garnt>
<connor> Normally when I get an illness,
I've been ill enough times </connor>
<connor> to know how my body deals with it. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Okay. I'm going to
be out for X amount of days. </connor>
<connor> I need to do this." </connor>
<connor> I've got this down to a science. </connor>
<connor> I wake up with, </connor>
<connor> What's the throat-itis? </connor>
<connor> Tonsillitis or something,
which has happened a few times. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to be conked out for two days. </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to be able to
speak for three, four days, </connor>
<connor> and then afterwards,
I'll be completely fine. </connor>
<connor> But when I tested positive, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck. I've never done this before, </connor>
<joey> so this is all new territory for me, man. </joey>
<joey> How's my body going to react to it? </joey>
<joey> I've got asthma, is that
going to play an effect?" </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, It wasn't like,
I didn't have a bad time, </joey>
<connor> it was more of just the unknown
that scared me the most. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. That's way scarier.
- Because it was something, </connor>
<connor> It was something completely new </connor>
<connor> that I had never experienced before, </connor>
<joey> so I had no prior knowledge </joey>
<joey> about how I should best deal with it, </joey>
<joey> or how my body was going to deal with it. </joey>
<joey> Luckily, It was fine. </joey>
<joey> Second thing that I shit
myself over was everyone saying </joey>
<garnt> that you might lose your
sense of taste, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what? I think
I'd rather go to hospital </garnt>
<garnt> than lose my sense of taste, honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> With the bread take you surely did. </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of people
would argue you already did. </connor>
<connor> - You sure you haven't gotten COVID? </connor>
<connor> - I think you should've gotten COVID </connor>
<joey> for the best "Trash
Taste" recording in years. </joey>
<connor> Half of these food takes- </connor>
<joey> - I don't think you have
any taste buds to kill. </joey>
<garnt> The first thing that I
did when I tested positive </garnt>
<joey> was, obviously I needed to inform Meilyne, </joey>
<joey> to inform GeeXPlus and
everyone in the office </joey>
<joey> that I tested positive, </joey>
<joey> and the first thing she
messages me about is, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I've heard that COVID
might change your taste buds, </joey>
<joey> so maybe you'll be able
to taste bread now. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Fuck you, Meilyne." </joey>
<garnt> - Roasted </garnt>
<garnt> - This is not what I wanted to hear </garnt>
<garnt> when I tested positive, okay? </garnt>
<connor> - Were you hungry at all? </connor>
<connor> Did you have an appetite? </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't exactly the same, </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Here's the thing I
hate about being fucking ill, </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's, I didn't
lose my sense of taste, </garnt>
<connor> it was just the same affect to your taste </connor>
<connor> that you have with any illness,
which just, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> everything just tastes shit. </connor>
<connor> Everything just tastes bland. </connor>
<connor> - Man, I get super hungry when I get sick. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I remember-
- That's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - Remember when you got
ill the few weeks before, </connor>
<garnt> when you got tonsillitis,
you just ate a fuck ton. </garnt>
<garnt> And, to me, I can't eat at all </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah. Me neither.
- when I'm ill. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't eat. </garnt>
<connor> - It should mean my stomach is okay. </connor>
<connor> I have any other illness,
I'll just eat a lot. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - For me, when I'm sick,
just the smell of food </joey>
<connor> is like, "Urg." For me. </connor>
<joey> - Do you remember that one
time I got food poisoning? </joey>
<joey> I got food poisoning this one time, </joey>
<connor> and then the next day,
while I was still dying, </connor>
<joey> I got so hungry. </joey>
<connor> Felt like McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> So I ordered a fuck ton of
McDonald's and I ate all of it. </connor>
<connor> Weirdly, I felt a lot better. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm the only person on earth </connor>
<joey> who binged McDonald's
and then felt better. </joey>
<joey> - Because usually that's the thing </joey>
<joey> that gives you food poisoning. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's exactly right. </joey>
<joey> You'd think eating McDonald's
after having food poisoning </joey>
<joey> is a bold choice. </joey>
<joey> It was really weird.
- You're really doubling down. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Actually, the one
time I do regret doing this. </joey>
<connor> This one time I was really sick, </connor>
<connor> again, I think, with food
poisoning, the next day, </connor>
<connor> I know everyone is going to laugh, </connor>
<connor> I decided to get Indian curry. </connor>
<connor> That was actually a mistake. </connor>
<connor> - What? Why?
- Why would you do that? </connor>
<garnt> - I was really craving butter
curry. I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - I crave a lot of good
food when I'm ill as well, </garnt>
<connor> but I've had it enough times
that you regret it immediately </connor>
<connor> once you take the first bite. </connor>
<garnt> That was the only time I regretted it. </garnt>
<connor> Other times I've gotten
it and I feel better. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's, in
my mind, I'm like, "Yeah." </connor>
<joey> Maybe my body's like, "Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> We've got another problem to deal with. </joey>
<joey> Let's deal with that." </joey>
<joey> And then everything just gets better. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. I don't know. </joey>
<connor> It's a load of shit, really. </connor>
<connor> - Your brain works one step at time. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it should be. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. It's all weird. </joey>
<joey> I feel like no one really
understands their body. </joey>
<joey> We're all just guessing. </joey>
<joey> We're all just doing, </joey>
<connor> We're like plague doctors
tying to figure out our thing, </connor>
<connor> with our own weird rituals. </connor>
<connor> I think we all just have a thing </connor>
<connor> that we feel comfortable with, </connor>
<garnt> and somehow it works. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, we've sorted it. </connor>
<garnt> We've been ill enough times to know </garnt>
<garnt> how our body reacts to certain things, </garnt>
<garnt> and to deal with certain things. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone bodies is different. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I'll sit there and laugh
at all these plage doctors </connor>
<connor> from the 18th century, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll just be like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm going to will power my disease away." </connor>
<connor> It's only, really, Have we changed at all? </connor>
<joey> I don't think so. </joey>
<connor> I think we've just gotten
smarter while keeping the stupid. </connor>
<connor> - You know what will fix my sore stomach? </connor>
<joey> McDonald's. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, exactly. That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> - Before COVID, how often did
you guys get sick per year? </joey>
<connor> - Once a year. </connor>
<joey> - Once a year? </joey>
<connor> - Are we counting food
poisoning because I feel like, </connor>
<joey> food poisoning, to me- </joey>
<connor> - You seems to get food poisoning a lot. </connor>
<connor> - Food poisoning, to me, I
don't count as getting sick. </connor>
<joey> - No. That's definitely sick. </joey>
<connor> - That is illness. That is illness. </connor>
<joey> - Hear me out. Hear me out. </joey>
<joey> Hear me out. </joey>
<connor> Because it's like if I poisoned
Garnt, you wouldn't be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, Garnt got sick." </joey>
<joey> You'd be like, Garnt was poisoned. </joey>
<joey> It's a different kind of vibe. </joey>
<joey> It's just sickness. It's not
like something you treat. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "You got food poisoning? </joey>
<joey> "Yeah. "You're fucked" </joey>
<joey> You're fucked. Just deal with it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - What? Wait, do you know
what food poisoning is? </joey>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - It's not like someone slipped cyanide </joey>
<joey> into your McDonald's. </joey>
<connor> - No, I know. I know. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, It's not
caused by a natural cause </connor>
<joey> of sickness or a bacterial or virus. </joey>
<joey> It's like something went
wrong and fucked up. </joey>
<garnt> - No. No.
- No. It is. </garnt>
<joey> - It is. It is
- It is. </joey>
<joey> - No, I know. I know. </joey>
<joey> But it's not like you got
it by accident or something. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? Like
you stumbled across it. </connor>
<connor> Something had to go
wrong of it to be there. </connor>
<joey> - No, I think it's by accident. </joey>
<connor> - [Crew Member] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - No. No </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<joey> - [Crew Member] You wouldn't know </joey>
<joey> if something's wrong with
the food unless you try it. </joey>
<joey> - No, I know. </joey>
<connor> That's why I'm saying
I don't count that as </connor>
<connor> the natural quote of getting sick. </connor>
<connor> Because, let's say you undercook chicken </connor>
<connor> and there's salmonella
in it, that's fucked. </connor>
<connor> You're done. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But that's not the fault of the person </joey>
<joey> who undercooked the chicken, </joey>
<joey> that's the fault of the salmonella- </joey>
<joey> - Well, that is why you cook the chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Which is the disease
that comes naturally. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But that's not something
you come across naturally. </connor>
<connor> That's not something you
would normally come across. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean by "come across"? </joey>
<connor> Do you mean just on the street. </connor>
<connor> Be like, "Oh, there's salmonella." </connor>
<joey> - It takes something carried. </joey>
<connor> Garnt is carrying a
normal, I don't know, cold </connor>
<connor> or whatever. </connor>
<connor> It's a different category in my mind. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, not every raw piece
of chicken has salmonella, </garnt>
<joey> but there is a chance </joey>
<joey> that if you have a raw piece
of chicken and it's not cooked, </joey>
<connor> then the salmonella, </connor>
<joey> or the bacteria
- That's why we have steps to- </joey>
<connor> - will not be killed. </connor>
<connor> In the same way that if you go outside </connor>
<connor> and someone has COVID
or the flu or something, </connor>
<joey> and you stand next to them and they cough, </joey>
<joey> and then you inhale their particles, </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] You have a chance of getting it. </connor>
<connor> - then you have the chance of getting it. </connor>
<connor> - It's all right. </connor>
<connor> In my mind, I just put
it differently, I guess. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because food poisoning is
normally just due to the lack, </connor>
<connor> Of somebody fucking up. </connor>
<garnt> - You mean lack of- </garnt>
<connor> - Like undercooking and stuff? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Undercooking and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> Or bad meat. Bad storage. </joey>
<joey> - Not all the time, though. </joey>
<joey> It's just sometimes
- Not all the time. </joey>
<joey> - it might just be like a rogue- </joey>
<joey> - Well, like E.coli and shit. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That's a big fuck up. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes it's jus a matter of like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, there was a piece of food there, </connor>
<joey> and just, unfortunately,
just a rogue disease </joey>
<joey> or virus just happened to
fucking stumble upon it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean,
- And then you inhale it. </joey>
<connor> - it's different though. </connor>
<joey> Because then we- </joey>
<garnt> - Are you saying that food
poisoning is more preventable? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Way more preventable. </connor>
<connor> But that's why you can be, Your
restaurant can be shut down </connor>
<joey> if you keep giving people food poisoning. </joey>
<joey> The majority of the time,
something like food poisoning </joey>
<connor> is due to somebody fucking
up in the chain of, </connor>
<connor> Because we have these steps. </connor>
<garnt> - So, basically, the most times we get ill </garnt>
<connor> is when someone has fucked up
and given you food poisoning. </connor>
<garnt> Or you fucked up and given
yourself food poisoning. </garnt>
<connor> - Mainly me. I look at it and
I'm like, "Aah. Fuck it.", </connor>
<connor> and then I eat it.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then I shouldn't have. </connor>
<connor> - So that's why you don't
count it as getting it ill </connor>
<connor> because it's on you. </connor>
<connor> It's on you. </connor>
<connor> - If I just walked pass someone
in the street who was ill, </connor>
<garnt> I don't count that as the same thing. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I'm understanding this mentality now. </joey>
<joey> - It's not an illness, it's a self-own. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. It seem
different in my head. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know about you, </joey>
<garnt> I count food poisoning as an illness. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- I do count food poisoning </garnt>
<garnt> as an illness.
- But then again, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't get sick often, </garnt>
<joey> but I think I've only
ever gotten food poisoning </joey>
<joey> twice in my life. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't get it much
till I came to Japan. </connor>
<garnt> I've had it many times in Japan, weirdly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like four, three times. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never gotten
food poisoning in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I've never gotten
food poisoning in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I've got it, the worst
food poisoning I've gotten </garnt>
<garnt> was in China. </garnt>
<garnt> Also sometimes in
Thailand as well. I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I got really bad food
poisoning in the Philippines. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think food poisoning
in South-East Asia </garnt>
<connor> is just part of the experience, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah?
- Exactly. It's </garnt>
<joey> - Street food.
- Preventable. </joey>
<connor> - Street food.
- No. No. </connor>
<joey> In South-East Asia it is not preventable. </joey>
<joey> That shit is everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - [Crew Member] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's good the lights worked out. </joey>
<joey> When I went back to
it, I was like, "Damn." </joey>
<joey> - I never knew you could
food poisoning from a mango </joey>
<joey> but I definitely got it from a mango. </joey>
<joey> That shit fucked me up, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - I swear to God, every
time Sydney has oysters </garnt>
<garnt> she gets fucking food poisoning, </garnt>
<garnt> and every fucking time she's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Maybe this I won't. Maybe this time." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so weird. </garnt>
<joey> You hear every now and then
there's those foods that's like, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah. Food poisoning central." </connor>
<connor> Oysters being one of them. </connor>
<connor> - It's just poor storage. </connor>
<joey> - I've never gotten it from oysters. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<connor> You've probably only eaten
oysters here in Japan, right? </connor>
<joey> - No. No. </joey>
<connor> Everywhere.
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I had it in the US, Australia. </connor>
<joey> Everywhere. And I've never gotten it. </joey>
<joey> - It's a gamble in the UK.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's very much a gamble in the UK. </joey>
<connor> And, I think, a lot of
places in the US as well. </connor>
<connor> Because it depends how well they store it, </connor>
<connor> or how fresh it is. </connor>
<garnt> - It's human error. See? </garnt>
<connor> This is why I don't count
it the same, in my head. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> If somebody sneezes at
me in public, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "It can't be helped." </connor>
<connor> Or "Whatever. Whatever" </connor>
<connor> - Face mask.
- If somebody forgot </connor>
<connor> to fucking freeze a piece of
fish, then serve it to me, </connor>
<connor> someone fucked up and made me sick. </connor>
<joey> - Wait. How is someone sneezing
on you not a human error? </joey>
<connor> - Well, no. You get it,
Let's say you're in a plane, </connor>
<connor> someone four seats behind
you sneezes, whatever, </connor>
<connor> they didn't react quick enough. </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's not, </connor>
<connor> I can't possibly- </connor>
<connor> - They didn't react quick enough? </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't then go to court and be like, </connor>
<connor> "This person sneezed
on the plain behind me </connor>
<connor> and didn't cover up their face." </connor>
<connor> I feel like you can't
hold someone accountable. </connor>
<connor> Whereas, let's say somebody just didn't </connor>
<connor> store a piece of fish properly, </connor>
<connor> that's negligence on their part, </connor>
<connor> and then they served it to you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I get that.
- That's why </connor>
<garnt> I don't treat it the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't treat it the same either </garnt>
<joey> but it's still an illness. </joey>
<joey> - Regardless if it can be
helped, or it cant be helped, </joey>
<connor> it's still an illness. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I feel like, </connor>
<connor> Because it's not a way to- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Would you count
cancer as an illness then? </garnt>
<connor> - You don't get cancer from eating fish. </connor>
<connor> - No. No </connor>
<connor> No. What I'm saying is, </connor>
<garnt> is you treat it completely differently </garnt>
<garnt> but it's still an illness. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's something you can just get. </garnt>
<connor> That's just different. </connor>
<connor> Most of the time-
- lung cancer? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> What if you smoke enough,
that's, technically, </joey>
<connor> human error.
- Yeah. But that's on you. </connor>
<connor> That's on you. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So then in that case,
it wouldn't be an illness, </joey>
<joey> according to you. </joey>
<joey> - But even then, stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> it's like it only raises your chances, </joey>
<joey> whereas if somebody just
gives you, flat out, </joey>
<joey> a completely fucked up
piece of fish or meat </joey>
<joey> that has been stored improperly, </joey>
<joey> you're going to get sick 100%. </joey>
<joey> Whereas there are people
who've been chain smoking </joey>
<joey> from age 10 till 100 who don't get it. </joey>
<connor> So it's complete luck on that part. </connor>
<connor> But with the storage, food and all that, </connor>
<connor> that's like, "All right.
Somebody fucked up." </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> That's categorically, </connor>
<connor> someone just fucked up
and they gave it to you, </connor>
<connor> and poisoned you. </connor>
<connor> That's what it is. </connor>
<connor> It's different to getting an illness. </connor>
<connor> It's totally different. </connor>
<connor> Doctors in the comments
are cracking up right now </connor>
<joey> - I bet.
- on this conversation. </joey>
<joey> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </joey>
<connor> - I actually wanna know what
people think about this. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm not the
only one who thinks this way </connor>
<connor> towards food poisoning. </connor>
<connor> This is not a weird thing. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just you getting ill. </garnt>
<connor> That's just it. </connor>
<connor> - But if you ask me
how often do I get ill, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't count that because
that's got nothing to do with- </connor>
<connor> - It's an illness.
- No, it's not. </connor>
<joey> - You're literally sick. </joey>
<joey> - If I were to just make myself vomit, </joey>
<connor> would you say that I've gotten an illness? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Well then why would food
poisoning count towards that.? </connor>
<connor> - Because it's a literal disease. </connor>
<joey> - But that's got no comment
to how often you get ill, </joey>
<connor> that's how often you eat bad shit. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's entirely different. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it all depends
on your environment, </joey>
<joey> but obviously if you
are in an environment, </joey>
<joey> where a lot of people are ill </joey>
<joey> or are going through a wave of illness, </joey>
<joey> then you're more like to get ill. </joey>
<joey> In the same way, if you
live in an environment, </joey>
<joey> where people are less careful
with their food preparation, </joey>
<joey> then you're more like to get ill. </joey>
<joey> That is a thing. </joey>
<joey> If you go to South-East Asia </joey>
<joey> or a lot of places where the
food standards aren't as high, </joey>
<joey> It's true. It's true.
- Yeah. No, it's true. </joey>
<joey> I'm not throwing shade,
I'm just saying facts here. </joey>
<joey> Okay, guys? </joey>
<joey> I'm saying facts here. </joey>
<joey> You go to a fucking street
vendor on the street, </joey>
<joey> your just like, "How
was this meat prepared? </joey>
<joey> Where did this meat come from?" </joey>
<joey> They don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> - "From the back of my truck." </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's all risk. </joey>
<joey> It's all risk at the end of the day. </joey>
<joey> You can eat raw chicken in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> and apparently here it's more safer </garnt>
<garnt> because food standards
here in Japan are higher. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how true that
is, how not true it is, </joey>
<joey> but at the same time
you're still taking a risk. </joey>
<garnt> - What if you're the problem? </garnt>
<connor> - I could be the, I could be- </connor>
<connor> - What if your stomach's just weak? </connor>
<connor> - Well, no. </connor>
<connor> I mean, if the restaurant just gives me </connor>
<connor> poorly stored sausage, I
think that's their fault. </connor>
<connor> That's on them.
- Well, no. </connor>
<connor> Because the one thing I learned from, </connor>
<joey> when I was in the
Philippines, is that, yeah, </joey>
<joey> the food standards are
a lot lower than normal, </joey>
<joey> but people don't get sick
because they just naturally </joey>
<joey> have more of a resistant stomach </joey>
<garnt> from living there.
- Well, not always. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I'd say that's true, actually. </joey>
<joey> I would say that's true. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Not with everything, though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not with everything.
- Not with everything. </garnt>
<joey> But with a lot of things that
visitors to those countries </joey>
<connor> would immediately get sick with. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't say I have a weak stomach. </joey>
<connor> I normally don't have a
problem with gross foods </connor>
<connor> or something that's a little off, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, there are times
where I've eaten something, </connor>
<connor> and then I've gotten really sick. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Why did I eat that?" </connor>
<garnt> - Well, what do you count
as food poisoning then? </garnt>
<garnt> Because, </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a country or something- </garnt>
<garnt> - All right give me an example. </garnt>
<garnt> Throw things at me, </garnt>
<connor> and I'll be like, "Food Poisoning or not." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> You go to a country, </connor>
<connor> you taste something that your
body has never tasted before, </connor>
<connor> it's totally new cuisine
and your body's just like, </connor>
<connor> "ooh. Ooh. </connor>
<connor> - That's not food poisoning.
- "I don't like this." </connor>
<connor> And then you get the shits for five days. </connor>
<connor> - No. That's not food poisoning. </connor>
<garnt> Shits isn't the food poisoning. </garnt>
<connor> - If it comes back up, that's
food poisoning, normally, </connor>
<connor> in my mind. </connor>
<garnt> - To me, It's like you need to have, </garnt>
<garnt> Your body is literally
physically reacting in some way, </garnt>
<garnt> where it gives you a fever
or a headache or vomiting. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never get,
- Something that's not normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never get anything
like that from eating food, </garnt>
<connor> but when I do eat, </connor>
<garnt> can normally remember what
it was that gave me it </garnt>
<connor> because I very much felt rough
immediately after eating it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because I count food
poisoning as I am conked out, </connor>
<connor> in bed because I-
- Throwing up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I'm throwing up. </connor>
<connor> I've got a fever. </connor>
<garnt> Because that is, It's literally
a bacterial infection. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I think if it makes
you feel a little queasy </connor>
<connor> and it gives you the
shits, no, that's not. </connor>
<garnt> You do have a weak stomach for that. </garnt>
<joey> But I think if you're
throwing up, you have a fever, </joey>
<joey> yeah, you have food poisoning. </joey>
<joey> That's what I would, But then I wouldn't, </joey>
<connor> In my mind, if that
happens to me, let's say I- </connor>
<garnt> - You get that once a year? </garnt>
<garnt> - Lately, it's been more. </garnt>
<joey> It's been two, three times.
- What the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> - I've only had that a
few times in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - I order a lot of food.
I never cook myself, </joey>
<joey> so I think it- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Same. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I think it happens a lot more. </joey>
<joey> Also- </joey>
<connor> - That's why I'm saying I think it's you. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just you.
- I think it's just you. </joey>
<joey> - No it's not. It's not me. </joey>
<connor> - I think that's a you problem. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not the one cooking it. </joey>
<joey> - I think you just have a weak stomach. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Because it's happened </joey>
<joey> where it's not just been me
who gets it from the food. </joey>
<joey> Other people have gotten
sick who were with me. </joey>
<joey> - Well, maybe they have
weak stomachs, too. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- No, that's not, </joey>
<joey> That is not a good, </joey>
<connor> "Your honor, why did
you give people E.coli?" </connor>
<connor> "Oh, they just got weak
stomachs, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> Just got weak-"
- They just need to get good. </connor>
<connor> - No. No. </connor>
<connor> No. That's not how it works. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because out of the last three
times I got food poisoning, </connor>
<connor> two times it was sausage. </connor>
<connor> And I can distinctly
remember eating the sausage </connor>
<connor> and being like, "Hmm. Really
pink. Really, really pink.", </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "But I think
it's okay. I'll eat it." </connor>
<connor> And then I regretted it immediately after. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I learned that. </connor>
<connor> And the other bag was, </connor>
<connor> The other one was from a
bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, </connor>
<connor> that was four months off. </connor>
<garnt> - Well,-
- Well, That, again, </garnt>
<connor> sounds like a you problem
- Well, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So that's mine. </garnt>
<garnt> But when I, Okay, let's say I'm an idiot, </garnt>
<connor> and I eat a four-month- old
bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, </connor>
<connor> to me, if I start throwing up,
that, in no way, in my mind, </connor>
<connor> is in the same category as, </connor>
<connor> Let's say I got tonsillitis or something. </connor>
<connor> Because this is me being a fucking idiot, </connor>
<connor> and then I immediately
got consequences for it. </connor>
<connor> The only difference is, let's
say I go out to a restaurant, </connor>
<connor> is that I didn't cook it but
somebody still fucked up. </connor>
<connor> Let's say the sausage was off, </connor>
<connor> so, in my head, it's
not in the same category </connor>
<connor> as getting an infection from just, </connor>
<connor> I don't know where the fuck I got it from. </connor>
<connor> Because it's, somebody fucked up. </connor>
<connor> With the Flamin' Hot Cheetos, I fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I massively fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. All right. </garnt>
<garnt> Here's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> You go to a convention. </connor>
<connor> You go to a convention, </connor>
<connor> you party everyday at the
convention, you get con flu. </connor>
<connor> Everyone gets fucking con flu. </connor>
<connor> A lot of people get fucking con flu. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Does that count as the same thing? </connor>
<connor> Because you're going to
a place where you know </connor>
<connor> that you're probably going to
get infected with something </connor>
<connor> along the way </connor>
<garnt> because there's a lot of
people in a single area </garnt>
<garnt> and you're putting yourself in a position </garnt>
<garnt> where your immune system
is going to be weaker </garnt>
<garnt> because you're naturally
doing a lot of shit. </garnt>
<connor> Does that count as the same thing? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Is con flu an illness? </garnt>
<garnt> - Which category? </garnt>
<connor> The food poisoning or-? </connor>
<garnt> - Does con flu count as any one? </garnt>
<connor> - Getting sick, normal sick. </connor>
<connor> - Getting normal sick?
- Yeah, normal. </connor>
<connor> That's not food poisoning. </connor>
<connor> I feel like food poisoning is
in its own complete category. </connor>
<connor> Closer to self poisoning to me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </joey>
<connor> in my head. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how, Do you
understand why I think that way, </connor>
<connor> or is it you just don't get it at all? </connor>
<garnt> - I understand why you think that way. </garnt>
<connor> - I understand, I just
don't agree with it. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's not like
I'm going to the con, </connor>
<connor> and I'm going around licking
floors, and I'm licking, </connor>
<garnt> Do you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> I am just, I know that
you're at a higher risk </connor>
<garnt> because you're around a lot of people. </garnt>
<connor> People who aren't showering,
people who aren't- </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes you shake a
hand and you're just like, </connor>
<joey> "Ooh. I better sanitize
it afterwards, man." </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you know, man. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you know. </joey>
<connor> - My hand is getting sick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And the kids were taking photos, </joey>
<connor> you're getting close to
people, people want you, </connor>
<connor> people touch you. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I understand that
that's just a big risk. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I get con
flu, sometimes I don't. </connor>
<connor> Again, </connor>
<connor> that's me almost squishing
six months of interacting </connor>
<connor> into one weekend. </connor>
<connor> So to me it makes sense that
there is a very high chance </connor>
<joey> that you can get a sickness. </joey>
<joey> But again, it's not the
same with food poisoning. </joey>
<joey> Because, again, somebody had to fuck up. </joey>
<joey> (chuckles)
In my head. </joey>
<joey> I wonder if I'm the only, </joey>
<joey> I can't be the only person
who sees it this way. </joey>
<joey> There must be a lot of people
in the comments who are- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you're the first, in my head. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- You're the first person. </joey>
<joey> - But how many people have
you discussed this with? </joey>
<connor> This is not a normal thing to discus. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's not a normal thing to discus </joey>
<joey> because I think for most people </joey>
<joey> food poisoning is an illness. </joey>
<joey> There's no question about it. </joey>
<joey> - If you asked me, </joey>
<connor> "Connor, what's up? Why can't
you come in to record today?" </connor>
<joey> I'm not going to be like,
"I've been poisoned." </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, "No. I got sick. I got sick." </connor>
<connor> But in my head, I would
have this category, </connor>
<connor> that I would label it. </connor>
<connor> It just happens that now
we have to talk about it, </connor>
<connor> and I'm explaining it, </connor>
<connor> and I didn't realize that
people didn't see it this way. </connor>
<joey> - So the next time you get food poisoning </joey>
<joey> and you say, "Oh, sorry guys. I'm sick.", </joey>
<joey> I'm allowed to call you out on that, or? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. You can be like, "Who fucked up?" </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Who fucked up. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll be like, "Did you
eat another fucking bag </joey>
<joey> of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, Connor?" </joey>
<garnt> - Was it you or was it
the restaurant this time? </garnt>
<connor> Who was it? Who's the culprit? </connor>
<joey> - Here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> If I get sick from a restaurant, </joey>
<connor> and you only know me, it's
like, "Oh, Connor, you." </connor>
<connor> You don't know, Let's say
this restaurant's poisoned </connor>
<joey> 100 other people, then you
would start being like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<joey> Why is this restaurant still open?" </joey>
<joey> The only difference is
you only hear my side. </joey>
<joey> But obviously, normally a
restaurant wouldn't be doing that. </joey>
<joey> But still. </joey>
<joey> I'm not crazy. This is just, </joey>
<joey> it's perception. </joey>
<joey> I sound like Alex fucking Jones. </joey>
<connor> "Turn the frogs gay with the water. </connor>
<garnt> You're just hearing
one side of the story." </garnt>
<connor> - No. No. </connor>
<connor> I agree that food poisoning- </connor>
<connor> - It's just very hard to argue </connor>
<connor> without sounding fucking insane. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree that food poisoning
is in a different category </garnt>
<garnt> than, let's say, the flu or tonsillitis, </garnt>
<garnt> but I would say that there
are a lot of illnesses </garnt>
<connor> that exists that can exist
in different categories, </connor>
<connor> from the flu and food poisoning. </connor>
<connor> A lot of things. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> in my mind,
- You count all- </connor>
<joey> - They're all illnesses.
- They're all illnesses. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> But if you asked me,
"Connor, are you sick?" </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, "Yes." </joey>
<garnt> If I have both. </garnt>
<connor> But in my head, I don't
treat them the same way. </connor>
<connor> - There are millions
of different illnesses, </connor>
<connor> with millions of different
ways to prevent it. </connor>
<connor> To stop yourself from getting ill. </connor>
<garnt> All this kind of fucking shit. </garnt>
<connor> - I want to bear mind,
that this is not some hard, </connor>
<joey> scientific definition I put in my head. </joey>
<joey> This is just a mentality I
have towards thinking about it. </joey>
<joey> - Don't worry. </joey>
<joey> People don't come to "Trash
Taste" for that shit. </joey>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<joey> But there's always some of
these comments being like, </joey>
<joey> "I've got to poke some holes
through Connor's thoughts." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, "Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because I didn't really think
that much about it anyway. </joey>
<joey> - He's just talking out of his arse. </joey>
<connor> - It's just a rough
estimation of how I view it. </connor>
<joey> - I just don't see the benefit
in labeling food poisoning </joey>
<joey> as a different thing. </joey>
<connor> - I know. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like that's more of
copium on your end, to me. </joey>
<joey> I'm not ill. I'm not ill. </joey>
<joey> - Why not just say they're all illnesses? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Again, this isn't something
that I ever discuss with people. </joey>
<joey> This is not something that
comes out in the open often. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, now I'm having to talk about it </joey>
<joey> in front of a million plus people. </joey>
<joey> That was not my intention. </joey>
<joey> This is just a soft definition in my head </joey>
<connor> towards how I viewed the illness. </connor>

<connor> But, obviously, if you're like, "E.coli", </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't count that the same
as regular food poisoning, </garnt>
<garnt> because that's- </garnt>
<connor> - Bringing this back to how
we started this conversation, </connor>
<joey> - How did this even come up. </joey>
<garnt> I don't even remember.
- How often </garnt>
<joey> do you normally get ill? </joey>
<connor> - That's how it started. There we go. </connor>
<connor> - Not counting food
poisoning, once a year, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Okay. </connor>
<joey> Including food poisoning? </joey>
<connor> - That's exponential. </connor>
<connor> I don't know
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> That could be four, five- </connor>
<connor> - How many Flamin' Hot Cheetos
is that eaten in a year? </connor>
<garnt> - How risky we talking? </garnt>
<connor> How risky was my, </connor>
<connor> Well, last year it was four. </connor>
<connor> Four times, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Three of them were
food poisoning, though, </connor>
<connor> so one. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> One. </connor>
<connor> - So aside from this time,
the last time I got ill, </connor>
<garnt> was literally two years before this. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't get ill often. </connor>
<connor> Very rarely. </connor>
<connor> - I very rarely get ill as well. </connor>
<connor> I very rarely get ill to
the point where I cannot, </connor>
<joey> I cannot work.
- Function. </joey>
<joey> - I need to actually take
a rest and take a break. </joey>
<connor> Because I feel like, I don't
know, I feel like my body, </connor>
<connor> Obviously, this is all talking bullshit, </connor>
<connor> I feel like body, even if- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] This whole episode is bullshit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because there's been points </connor>
<connor> where Sydney has been
fucking conked out in bed </connor>
<connor> with a high fever and all that shit, </connor>
<connor> and I get a mild cough. </connor>
<connor> And that's just it. </connor>
<connor> And she's conked out for two days, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, (imitates coughing) </connor>
<connor> "How you doing, honey?
How you doing, honey? </connor>
<connor> - This is why,
- You need to get good. </connor>
<garnt> - This is why hospitals scare me as well, </garnt>
<joey> because when I'm around sick people, </joey>
<joey> - That's right. That's how this
whole conversation started. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> When I'm around sick people, </joey>
<joey> I get way more scared of being sick. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - It freaks me out.
- Of course. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> Is this a human reaction that we have? </connor>
<connor> That we're scared of sick people? </connor>
<joey> - I think it's pretty natural
to be afraid of a hospital. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like that's a </joey>
<joey> natural human reaction,
- Because people die </joey>
<connor> in a hospital. </connor>
<connor> - because you are averse to getting ill. </connor>
<garnt> You are averse to getting ill. </garnt>
<garnt> - People are sick. People die there. </garnt>
<joey> Why would you enjoy a
place where people die? </joey>
<connor> - Back when I got, Back when I had it? </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's genetic, what
the fuck am I talking about? </connor>
<connor> I still have it. </connor>
<connor> It's cute. That's cute. </connor>
<garnt> I'm cute. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even if it is, it's just state of mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just (grunts) that shit away. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gone. Boom. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like that. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] It's like food poisoning. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Preventable. </connor>
<connor> - I just got my five step course </connor>
<connor> on how to get rid of any genetic illness. </connor>
<connor> I had to go to the hospital
a lot when I was a kid, </connor>
<connor> because I had to get my blood
tested every three months </connor>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<connor> Or every six months. Something like that. </connor>
<connor> Anyhoo, far too often, for my liking. </connor>
<connor> And I hated it because I had
to sit there for four hours, </connor>
<connor> get a test, wait, get another test, </connor>
<connor> and get results and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and then the whole time
I was just surrounded </connor>
<connor> by very, very ill people. </connor>
<connor> And it was always just really
scary as an eight-year-old. </connor>
<connor> Then I keep growing up
and just kep seeing this, </connor>
<joey> I'm like,. "Uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-oh." </joey>
<connor> And all the offices the doctors have </connor>
<connor> are always really
cluttered, are really messy, </connor>
<connor> and I was always like, (grunts) </connor>
<joey> - I think the one thing I hate
about the hospital the most </joey>
<connor> is the smell. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. The smell is pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - The smell of a hospital is just, </connor>
<connor> It's hard to explain what that is. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. There was also- </garnt>
<connor> - It smells of illness.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Literally. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, when you're
ill, and when I was ill, </connor>
<joey> things just smell and taste different </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Of course.
- Naturally. </joey>
<joey> And it fucking sucks. </joey>
<joey> But when you go to a
hospital, for some reason, </joey>
<connor> you get that same smell
where it's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, everything just smells stale." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. It's stale </connor>
<connor> That's the word. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's the stale smell. </connor>
<connor> Like the magic, the color has
been taken out of everything. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's how I feel when I'm ill. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> It just feels like life gets
a black and white filter </garnt>
<garnt> being put onto it. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Do you like the
smell of the dentist? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I know people who
love the smell of the dentist. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is the smell of the dentist, </garnt>
<joey> Swinging Tod? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the smell
of, I don't know what it, </joey>
<garnt> it's the smell of, </garnt>
<joey> How do you describe the
smell of the dentist? </joey>
<joey> - I don't go, </joey>
<joey> Brah, I'm British. We
don't go to the dentist. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. True.
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. I don't
smell the dentist often. </connor>
<connor> I'm just in and out. </connor>
<connor> I want to get out there
as soon as possible. </connor>
<joey> - It's smells like clean teeth, </joey>
<joey> but in the worst way possible. </joey>
<joey> It smells like chemicals.
That's the only way. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I guess so. </garnt>
<garnt> I never really thought about it. </garnt>
<joey> It smells like hand sanitizer. </joey>
<joey> That fresh- </joey>
<connor> - All medical places
smells like a sterilized- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It smells clean
but not in a good way. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because when you think of,
say, something that's clean, </connor>
<joey> like scented hand sanitizer, whatever, </joey>
<connor> or Febreze or whatever, </connor>
<connor> Usually it's like, "Oh,
that's a good smell." </connor>
<connor> That's a refreshing smell. </connor>
<joey> But hospitals and dentists,
for me, I just like, </joey>
<joey> "It's clean but something's wrong." </joey>
<garnt> - No. Hospital and dentist
smell different to me. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no. They smell different, </joey>
<garnt> - Very, very different, for me. </garnt>
<joey> - But I feel their in the
same category of it's clean, </joey>
<joey> but it's not a good clean. </joey>
<joey> It's too clean. </joey>
<garnt> Where it's like, "Nothing's
here anymore.", levels of clean. </garnt>
<joey> Sterilized is a good word. </joey>
<garnt> - So it's sterile, </garnt>
<joey> which I hope they are. </joey>
<connor> I would very much hope
that they are sterile. </connor>
<joey> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Apparently, the
dentist smell of clove oil </joey>
<joey> and tooth dust. </joey>
<joey> - Clove oil and tooth dust? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck's tooth dust?
- What the fuck is tooth... </joey>
<connor> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </connor>
<joey> - Literally the dust.
- Gross. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, what? </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Disinfected
in formaldehyde as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It just smells like chlorine. </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - It has a feint chlorine smell to me. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe the dentist I go to. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it it's- </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] What were they
shoving in your mouth, Joe? </joey>
<joey> (speech drowned out by chatter) </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if they're
next to a pool or whatever, </joey>
<joey> but it smells like chlorine. </joey>
<garnt> - How often do you guys go to the dentist? </garnt>
<joey> - I try to go twice a year. </joey>
<joey> Just as a check up. </joey>
<garnt> - When it hurts.
- I think they say... </garnt>
<connor> - Do you put it in your,
Because British culture, </connor>
<connor> British culture. </connor>
<connor> We don't go to the dentist a lot. </connor>
<connor> And I only really started going, </connor>
<connor> Actually I would normally
only go to the dentist before, </connor>
<garnt> when I'd go to Asia, </garnt>
<garnt> because dentist were
actually really much cheaper. </garnt>
<connor> - I am before all the British tooth jokes </connor>
<connor> in the comments now. </connor>
<joey> - Do you have a schedule of,
"Oh, it's been three months, </joey>
<joey> or six months or
something", to the dentist" </joey>
<garnt> - My dentist emailed me. </garnt>
<joey> He was like, "Where are you?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I think the say, when you're an adult, </connor>
<connor> you should go, at least,
two or three times a year. </connor>
<connor> As for a check up. </connor>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> - The good thing with the dentist, </connor>
<connor> is that even if you don't have a cavity </connor>
<joey> or you're not hurting anywhere, </joey>
<joey> they'll at least just fucking
clean your teeth for you. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck. I hated them
cleaning my teeth though. </connor>
<connor> Why was that drill so loud? </connor>
<joey> - The water pressure thing?
(imitates drill) </joey>
<joey> - In Japan, it's horrible. </joey>
<garnt> - To me, I think the worst
feeling is getting a filling. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know- </joey>
<joey> - Have you got a filling before? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> I've gotten one before. </joey>
<connor> And, I don't know, that
experience as a kid </connor>
<connor> just scarred me for life. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is about </connor>
<connor> just hearing the drill and
just not being able to see </connor>
<connor> what they are doing to your mouth. </connor>
<connor> - Do you want to, Do you want to see? </connor>
<connor> Do you want a T.V? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know what's scarier because- </joey>
<joey> - I need to see this in 4K. </joey>
<joey> I think it can be arranged, actually. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> It's that feeling of when
they hit your nerve ending </connor>
<connor> for just a second. </connor>
<connor> - [Co- Host] Ow. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that in my nightmares. </connor>
<garnt> Ever since I felt that
as a kid the first time, </garnt>
<garnt> that put me off going to
the dentist ever again. </garnt>
<joey> - The worst, for me, is when
you hear the drill sound </joey>
<joey> but it's deep in your ear, </joey>
<connor> so it sounds like it's in your ear. </connor>
<connor> I hate it because it just sounds like </connor>
<joey> someone's just getting
into your ear, like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I had a night mold made. </garnt>
<garnt> When you go to bed, you wear
one of those plastic guards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I've got that as well.
- Yeah. I've got that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't worn it though, </garnt>
<garnt> so that's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - You haven't worn it?
- Nah. I forgot to. </garnt>
<connor> - Dentist will be proud of that. </connor>
<garnt> - I know. Sorry, dentist. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> My dentist speaks English, too. Fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. It was really
annoying to sleep with </connor>
<connor> for a long time. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't sleep with it in. </connor>
<garnt> It was very uncomfortable. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It took me about
a week to get used to. </connor>
<connor> - I woke up drooling everywhere with it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> That's a normal experience. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That happens. That happens. </connor>
<connor> - I think I didn't start snoring </connor>
<joey> until I started wearing my mouth guard, </joey>
<joey> because it literally force
you to be a mouth breather </joey>
<connor> when you sleep. </connor>
<connor> Because you got the gap between your teeth </connor>
<connor> - It pushed my, I couldn't
breath comfortably. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Why did you need to get it? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> My dentist was like, "You
don't really need it, </joey>
<connor> but it's good to just prevent- </connor>
<joey> - Dentist was just
trying to fuck you over. </joey>
<connor> - It was 300 bucks. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure they were like, "Yeah,- </joey>
<joey> - "Yeah, you definitely need this." </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] You need this. You need this. </connor>
<connor> - They were like, "Yeah, I do, </connor>
<connor> grinding your teeth isn't
an issue, but it might, </connor>
<connor> so we can get a night guard done </connor>
<connor> if you just want to be careful." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, sure." </connor>
<connor> And then they did it, </connor>
<connor> and then I just really didn't like it, </connor>
<connor> so I just stopped using it. </connor>
<joey> - Because I grind my teeth as well, </joey>
<joey> but my doctor was like, "If
you don't have this guard, </joey>
<joey> your bottom teeth are
literally going to disappear." </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh."
- I really grinded my teeth. </garnt>
<joey> - "Please give me the mouth guard." </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't really know about it </garnt>
<garnt> until I started getting jaw problems. </garnt>
<garnt> I think in my mid twenties, I
started getting jaw problems, </garnt>
<joey> where it felt like my, </joey>
<joey> Sometimes I'd wake up and
something will feel off, </joey>
<joey> or slightly dislocated or something. </joey>
<joey> - God. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't know that it was an issue </joey>
<joey> until I started getting the issue. </joey>
<joey> And then I went to my dentist
and you're like, "Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> You grind your teeth a fuck ton. </garnt>
<garnt> You need to wear a mouth guard </garnt>
<garnt> because your bite is going to
get more and more deformed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, after this episode, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to schedule an appointment, </garnt>
<connor> because I forgot to reply to
that email two months ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I should probably go, too.
- But I hated it. </connor>
<connor> When they did the mold
thing, they put all that- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] That gunk in you. </connor>
<joey> - The putty thing. </joey>
<connor> - It was so confusing
figuring out how to breath </connor>
<connor> for a second. </connor>
<connor> Where I was like, "Wait, shit. </connor>
<connor> My mouth is completely
covered with this gunk. </connor>
<connor> How do I breath without my teeth? </connor>
<connor> It feels so weird. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder if that's how it
feel when you have dentures. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Just not having teeth,
it felt really strange. </connor>
<joey> Also, I remember they were
like, "Whatever you do, </joey>
<joey> do not swallow right now." </joey>
<joey> And then I've never had an urge
to swallow more in my life. </joey>
<connor> - Is that a challenge? </connor>
<connor> - It was like (grunts) </connor>
<connor> They're blasting shit in your mouth, </connor>
<connor> trying to clean it, saying that. </connor>
<connor> "Do not swallow. Do not swallow." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "fuck it. Now
all I can think about </connor>
<connor> is swallowing this weird
liquid that smells like apples. </connor>
<garnt> I want to do it." </garnt>
<garnt> - Joe-Joe fans being like, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That's the joke or fact? </connor>
<connor> He thinks I wouldn't swallow
but I will swallow the poison. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Next thing you'll say
is, "Don't swallow." </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's true. It's true.
- My God. </connor>
<connor> - It's awful. I don't like dentists. </connor>
<connor> I don think anyone like the dentist, </connor>
<connor> if they do, I don't trust them. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think anyone
likes the hospital as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some people do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Who? </connor>
<joey> - Kids who want to play on the free PS2 </joey>
<joey> that they have there. </joey>
<connor> - You talked about this, didn't you? </connor>
<connor> - That used to be me. I used to like it. </connor>
<connor> But then the GameCube
controls were robbed. </connor>
<joey> - I wish I went to your hospital </joey>
<joey> because my hospital didn't
have that shit at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you guys ever had
to ride in an ambulance? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I did. </joey>
<garnt> In Japan, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - In Japan? Oh, okay.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because Ahki had a slight
accident at our last place, </connor>
<connor> and it was pretty bad, </connor>
<connor> so we had to call the hospital, </connor>
<joey> and I was riding the hospital, </joey>
<joey> Not riding the hospital, </joey>
<joey> riding the ambulance.
- Riding the hospital. </joey>
<joey> - I had to get an ambulance. </joey>
<connor> So I was riding the
ambulance late at night, </connor>
<joey> and because it was late at night, </joey>
<joey> the closest spital was closed, </joey>
<joey> makes no fucking sense. </joey>
<joey> You'd think hospitals
are open all the time. </joey>
<joey> So we had to go to the next furthest one. </joey>
<garnt> So it was a 15, 20 minute ride. </garnt>
<garnt> And luckily, Ahki was okay. </garnt>
<joey> She was calming down in the ambulance, </joey>
<joey> and it was so fucked
up because, in my head, </joey>
<joey> during that whole ambulance
ride, 95% of my brain was like, </joey>
<joey> " Oh, God. I hope Ahki's okay, </joey>
<connor> and she will be able to
get out of this fine." </connor>
<connor> And 5% of my brain was like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, fuck. I'm in an ambulance." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like, "Whoa. This is so cool. </joey>
<connor> I've never been in one before. </connor>
<connor> This is what it looks like? Oh, shit." </connor>
<connor> - I would just feel really bad. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like I'm
inconveniencing these workers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even though it's their job.
- Even though it's their job. </garnt>
<connor> - My leg could be broken,
I'm like, "Oh, fuck. </connor>
<connor> I'm so sorry for wasting your time. </connor>
<joey> Surely someone else has a heart attack </joey>
<connor> or something you can go to. </connor>
<connor> I can get there myself. It's all right. </connor>
<joey> - That's called an Uber. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Just call an Uber. </joey>
<joey> - Well, it's just, I remember
I was in the emergency room, </joey>
<joey> I've never been in that
room before, by the way, </joey>
<joey> but I was in the emergency room, </joey>
<garnt> and this guys was just
holding onto his thumb. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that was really fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was really calm. </garnt>
<garnt> He was holding onto his thumb like this, </garnt>
<garnt> and I could see- </garnt>
<garnt> - What you mean, holding onto his thumb? </garnt>
<garnt> - He's thumb.
- He's thumb was falling off. </garnt>
<joey> - His thumb, it had been cut off. </joey>
<joey> And he was holding onto it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, in his hand? </joey>
<joey> - He was holding onto his thumb, </joey>
<connor> - What?
- and he was really calm, </connor>
<connor> and they were talking to him, being like, </connor>
<connor> "Are you ready, Mr. Jones, to go to the, </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Yeah,
yeah. It's all right. </connor>
<connor> We'll go. </connor>
<connor> I don't mind waiting a little bit." </connor>
<connor> Really weird. </connor>
<joey> It was really strange, </joey>
<joey> because I didn't realize
what he was doing at first </joey>
<joey> until I saw the bag of ice with it, </joey>
<joey> and then he had a bandage
going around like this, </joey>
<connor> and his hand was like this, </connor>
<connor> and he had bandage just going around. </connor>
<joey> - I just wanted him to be like,
"Are you ready, Mr. Jones?" </joey>
<joey> He'll be like, "Thumbs up. Haha." </joey>
<connor> - That's really weird. </connor>
<connor> It's like T.V shows in the UK, </connor>
<connor> just farmers who had their arm cut off, </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "Yeah. Whatever. </connor>
<connor> Whenever you're ready." </connor>
<garnt> - I'd be fucking freaking out. </garnt>
<connor> If there's one finger
you don't want to lose- </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing you don't want to do. </connor>
<connor> You don't want to freak out. </connor>
<joey> You want to be calm.
- Yeah. That's true. </joey>
<joey> - The more you panic, the
worse it is for everyone. </joey>
<garnt> You have to calm yourself down. </garnt>
<connor> But that's easier aid than done. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, obviously, I've
never been in that situation, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's hard to image how you
would react in that situation, </garnt>
<garnt> because you've never
been in that situation. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It's weird, really, </connor>
<connor> because when I've been in situations </connor>
<connor> where I feel like I have
to calm myself down, </connor>
<connor> afterwards I'm like, "Is that what,", </connor>
<connor> You see people freaking out, </connor>
<connor> are they trying to calm themselves down? </connor>
<connor> What's going through their head? </connor>
<connor> Is it just panic? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Let's say, if I'm bleeding really badly, </connor>
<connor> which has happened a
few times or something, </connor>
<connor> and I have hemophilia, </connor>
<connor> my whole focus, when it's
happened, I remember distinctly, </connor>
<connor> is I'm literally focusing
on not freaking out. </connor>
<connor> That's all I'm doing. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to keep it together. </connor>
<connor> I just think, I'm like, "Is
that what everyone does?" </connor>
<connor> I don't know because there's no way </connor>
<connor> to get into someone else's mind. </connor>
<connor> So I wonder, </connor>
<connor> has anything ever happened to you </connor>
<connor> where you're really scared
and you're freaking out? </connor>
<garnt> - I've never had anything life threatening </garnt>
<garnt> or anything like that, </garnt>
<garnt> so I wouldn't know,
myself, how I would react. </garnt>
<garnt> But if I know how I react
with a lot of situations, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just, yeah, calm. </garnt>
<garnt> Calm. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like trying to force yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how the, I don't know how, </garnt>
<connor> The human mind is pretty fucking weird. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm the kind of guy who,
in stressful situations, </joey>
<joey> just say nothing. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Okay, this is going off tangent now, </joey>
<joey> but I don't physically react </joey>
<joey> when someone tries to jump scare me. </joey>
<joey> A lot of the times. </joey>
<connor> I remember, every time
there's a jump scare, </connor>
<connor> or anytime Sydney tries
to prank jump scare me, </connor>
<connor> she goes, "Ha.", like that or something, </connor>
<connor> when I come out the shower or whatever, </connor>
<connor> and just completely like
fucking The Terminator, </connor>
<connor> zero reaction. </connor>
<connor> And she's just like, "Fuck you." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Haha, Sydney. That's right, </connor>
<connor> I aint a pussy, bitch." </connor>
<joey> Whereas inside I'm just
like, "Fuck my life." </joey>
<garnt> Inside, I'm screaming my
fucking heat out, man. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Pee slowly runs down your leg. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> It's like, "Get good, Sydney." </joey>
<connor> Aah.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. So I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I'm the complete opposite. </connor>
<joey> I hate it when someone
comes around the corner </joey>
<joey> and scares me. </joey>
<joey> I always stop myself
from throwing a fist out. </joey>
<joey> Because I'm like, "It's a
threat. Oh, no. It's not </joey>
<joey> It's not. Okay. </joey>
<joey> Thank God. (exhales sharply)"
- It's a threat. </joey>
<joey> - My fight or flight is just
like, "Fight. Oh, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Okay. I shouldn't. </joey>
<joey> I shouldn't." </joey>
<joey> But it's weird because when
I had to call the ambulance </joey>
<joey> for Ahki, I was surprisingly calm. </joey>
<joey> I thought I was going to be, </joey>
<joey> Because I'd never called
the ambulance before. </joey>
<joey> Because I didn't know what
the fuck the procedure was. </joey>
<connor> So the first I was calling,
in my head I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, God. What the fuck am I going to say? </connor>
<connor> Am I going to stutter? </connor>
<connor> What the hell's going to happen?" </connor>
<joey> But then by the time I
got finished, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I was a lot calmer
than I thought I was being." </joey>
<connor> - "Domino's will be here
in 15 minutes, honey. </connor>
<joey> Don't worry about it." </joey>
<joey> "Oh, can you call the ambulance now?" </joey>
<joey> "Oh, shit."
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - "Oh, fuck" </connor>
<connor> Sorry. </connor>
<joey> - "Oh, you said ambulance.
- "Oh, shit." </joey>
<joey> I thought you said peperoni." </joey>
<connor> - "Don't worry, Ahki. </connor>
<joey> The double peperoni pizza is
going to be here in 15 minutes" </joey>
<joey> - "You have something,
- "Oh, shit." </joey>
<joey> - You have something to look forward to. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry."
- "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> - "Who's going to get here faster? </joey>
<joey> The Domino's delivery
guy or the ambulance?" </joey>
<joey> My bet's on the Domino's. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, no. It was surprisingly calming, </joey>
<garnt> but then I think it was, for
me, I'm calm in the moment </garnt>
<garnt> but then, when it's all over,
that's when it all comes out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> To me, I panic post, when
everything just sinks in, </garnt>
<connor> to be like, "Holy shit.
That fucking happened.", </connor>
<connor> and, "I went through all this shit." </connor>
<connor> And it's only after
the even has transpired </connor>
<connor> that it actually starts to sink in, </connor>
<connor> and I start to feel the gravity </connor>
<connor> of everything that's happened. </connor>
<connor> At least to me. </connor>
<joey> I do have a question, though, </joey>
<joey> because I remembered this </joey>
<garnt> in the experience I had in the past week. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you guys ever gotten fever dreams? </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean by fever dreams? </garnt>
<garnt> Can you define one for me? </garnt>
<joey> - That's the dream you
have when you have a fever. </joey>
<connor> - When you have a really bad fever </connor>
<connor> and you start dreaming really weird shit. </connor>
<connor> Because I thought it was just a saying. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was just a term or phrase </connor>
<connor> until I started dating Sydney, </connor>
<connor> who gets some of the most
fucking weirdest fever dreams </connor>
<connor> I've ever heard in my life. </connor>
<connor> - While conscious or while asleep? </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean by, </joey>
<joey> What? She's just fucking waving? </joey>
<joey> "I'm having a fever dream." </joey>
<connor> - She's running around the
apartment or is she asleep, </connor>
<connor> wakes up and then she's like, </connor>
<connor> "Garnt, you won't
believe this dream I had. </connor>
<connor> I was the president." </connor>
<joey> - I don't think that's a fever dream. </joey>
<joey> I think that's just going psycho. </joey>
<connor> - Can we get a definition of
where fever dreams comes from? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. So when you have, </garnt>
<garnt> When you have a really bad
fever, obviously you try to rest. </garnt>
<connor> Your body tries to rest. </connor>
<garnt> Well, at least some
people's body tries to rest. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go to sleep
and you're sweating. </garnt>
<garnt> You start having a really bad fever, </garnt>
<garnt> as your body tries to
fight off this illness, </garnt>
<garnt> and then some people,
I'm saying some people </garnt>
<garnt> because the only experience
I've seen it happen to </garnt>
<connor> is with Sydney, </connor>
<garnt> and she'll just wake up,
drenched full of sweat, </garnt>
<garnt> and was just like, "Honey, I
just saw Connor in a bikini, </garnt>
<garnt> running on the beach.
What the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> Where am I right now?" </garnt>
<connor> She will say it. </connor>
<garnt> She will just wake up and
say the weirdest fucking shit </garnt>
<connor> that happened. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What just happened?" </garnt>
<garnt> And she goes, "Oh, it
was just a fever dream." </garnt>
<connor> - That's believable, actually. </connor>
<garnt> That is a possibility. </garnt>
<joey> - That wasn't a fever dream,
that was just a video. </joey>
<connor> - That was an episode
of the cosplay series. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Because I've never had a
single fever dream at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually, I rarely ever dream. </garnt>
<joey> - The problem is, No, no. </joey>
<joey> It's not that you don't dream, </joey>
<joey> because I think I'm the exact same way, </joey>
<joey> whereas I don't remember 99% of my dreams. </joey>
<joey> And it's fucked up because it's, </joey>
<joey> Some mornings I wake up and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I remember having a really good dream." </joey>
<joey> And then as I am waking up </joey>
<joey> and I'm trying to remember
the dream again, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, and it's, wait, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck did I just dream about?" </joey>
<joey> And it's so weird because
it literally fades away </joey>
<joey> as I'm trying to think about it. </joey>
<joey> But all I remember is
that I had a good dream, </joey>
<joey> but if you told me to
recite it, I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't know. I don't remember." </joey>
<garnt> - Because, to me, I feel like
I just rarely ever dream. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Because if I have a dream-
- No, you do dream. </joey>
<joey> Everyone dreams. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure I do.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm sure I do. </joey>
<joey> - You're not a fucking reptile. </joey>
<joey> You do dream. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe I am, Joey. Maybe I am. </connor>
<connor> - Do we have the definition
of a fever dream? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Fever dreams are vivid, often
bizarre or unpleasant dreams </garnt>
<garnt> sleepers can experience
when they have a fever. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure I've had a fever dream. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> They happen similar to the other dreams. </joey>
<joey> They can happen during any
stage of sleep, mostly- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It just seems like her
dreams, when she has a fever, </garnt>
<garnt> is just the wildest ones. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so strange, I
don't remember my dreams. </connor>
<joey> I very rarely remember them. </joey>
<joey> Maybe once every month. </joey>
<connor> I don't remember.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I probably can only
remember two nightmares I had. </joey>
<garnt> - But if I have a dream, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the fact that I had a dream. </garnt>
<garnt> But most nights, I wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and there was just a void in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing)
There was nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> There was nothing.
- Really? </garnt>
<connor> - I dreamed nothing. </connor>
<connor> - Can you feel the sense of time passing </connor>
<connor> when you're aware that you're dreaming? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Have you ever had a lucid dream. </garnt>
<joey> - No. I really want to though. </joey>
<joey> - Those are the funnest ones. </joey>
<joey> - I've only had it,
- I've had it once. </joey>
<connor> - I've only had it a few times. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've had situations where </connor>
<connor> what I wanted to happen in the
dream during it did happen, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like it's a battle. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> This is so hard, to remember this stuff. </garnt>
<connor> This is what scientists have
been trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> for hundreds of years. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a
dream that's been so vivid </garnt>
<garnt> that it's just stuck with you for years, </garnt>
<joey> and you can still recite it? </joey>
<garnt> Because I don't remember
most of my dreams. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have one nightmare
I had when I was little </garnt>
<connor> that I think is the reason
why I'm afraid of heights now. </connor>
<connor> You know how they say you
can't die in your dream </connor>
<connor> because you've never
experienced it before. </connor>
<connor> - I think that that's BS. </connor>
<joey> - Well, actually, I
thought it was BS, too, </joey>
<connor> until I had this nightmare. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure I die
in a lot of my dreams. </connor>
<connor> - You all right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Food poisoning.
(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Call it a food poisoning dream. </joey>
<joey> - I've definitely died in my dreams, </joey>
<garnt> but I've just woken up
immediately as I've died. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? Do you always wake up? </connor>
<connor> Is that guaranteed? </connor>
<connor> I feel like I reset sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<joey> - Is it one of those, </joey>
<joey> "If you die in the
dream, you die for real?" </joey>
<connor> - You respawn in your dreams? </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure I've
respawned in my dream. </joey>
<joey> I'm near certain I've
respawned in my dream. </joey>
<joey> - The only nightmare I've had </joey>
<joey> that I can still vividly remember, </joey>
<joey> it was a really short dream
but I was flying in my room, </joey>
<joey> and then for some reason I
just stopped, and then I, </joey>
<connor> and then just stood-
- I just pictured a young Joe </connor>
<joey> flying in his room. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I'm just flying in my
room, like "Whee.", like that, </connor>
<connor> and then I just stop. </connor>
<connor> I remember I stopped, </connor>
<joey> and our house was, it was two stories </joey>
<joey> and we had the spiral staircase </joey>
<joey> that went down to the basement floor. </joey>
<joey> And I remember I just stopped </joey>
<joey> and I looked down at the spiral staircase </joey>
<joey> and I just dropped. </joey>
<joey> Head first. </joey>
<joey> And I vividly remember, </joey>
<connor> my face got about this
close to the ground, </connor>
<connor> and I woke up.
- And you woke up. </connor>
<joey> - Just shitting myself. </joey>
<garnt> And I think from that point
on, I got afraid of heights. </garnt>
<connor> Because I vividly remember
the feeling of falling, </connor>
<connor> and it was horrible. </connor>
<connor> - So you had a, </connor>
<connor> Your brain made a traumatic
experience for you? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That's so strange. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, the one traumatic
dream that I've had </garnt>
<garnt> that has stuck with me for years was, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember this one time,
I was living this dream, </garnt>
<garnt> and I would wake up in my bed, </garnt>
<garnt> in my room that I was
living at at the time </garnt>
<garnt> and I would just go about my day. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it would just be a normal day, </garnt>
<garnt> and then something would happen </garnt>
<connor> that would just be out of the ordinary. </connor>
<garnt> I would see, I would see, </garnt>
<garnt> I would see a twin
followed by another twin, </garnt>
<garnt> like I just noticed a glitch
in the matrix or something, </garnt>
<garnt> and then as soon as I saw
that, the dream would reset, </garnt>
<connor> and I'd wake up again. </connor>
<garnt> And I would think that
I was in the real world, </garnt>
<joey> and I would go about my day </joey>
<joey> and then I would notice
another glitch in reality. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking nightmare fuel </joey>
<joey> because I literally repeated this cycle, </joey>
<joey> and every time I would
get more and more paranoid </joey>
<joey> that I didn't know if
I was in a dream world </joey>
<joey> or if I was actually awake. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Is this a dream world?" </joey>
<joey> Because I would go about my day, </joey>
<joey> and I remember the exact moment I woke up, </joey>
<joey> was about the 10th time, when
I went through an entire day </joey>
<joey> thinking, "Okay. I'm awake. I'm awake." </joey>
<joey> And I remember going to the toilet, </joey>
<joey> and I was getting ready for
bed and I looked at the mirror </joey>
<joey> and then my reflection turned. </joey>
<joey> My reflection turned away.
- What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - I fucking freaked out, </joey>
<joey> and then I woke up for real. </joey>
<joey> For real, real. </joey>
<joey> - That's like an Ari Aster film. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like a cool film. </connor>
<connor> - I woke up for real, real
and I was shitting myself </connor>
<connor> because I didn't believe the
fact that I was actually awake. </connor>
<connor> It literally fucked with my
mind for an entire few days. </connor>
<connor> Because I went about
those few days being like, </connor>
<joey> "Where's the glitch?
When's it going to happen?" </joey>
<joey> When's it going to happen? </joey>
<joey> - Where are thew twins? </joey>
<joey> - That's fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - That's scary. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how my mind </joey>
<joey> created such a fucked up situation </joey>
<joey> that it literally fucked
up my mind in real life. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I'm still in the dream. </joey>
<garnt> - Trash Taste is all a dream, baby. </garnt>
<joey> - When you're dreaming, are you able, </joey>
<joey> You mentioned that you were flying, </joey>
<joey> when I'm in dreams and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> let's say I do something
that I know is impossible, </joey>
<connor> are you aware that you
know it's impossible </connor>
<connor> and that you're dreaming? </connor>
<connor> Because I often always get aware. </connor>
<joey> - I'm a ware that it's
impossible but I just, </joey>
<connor> Because lucid dreaming
is where you're aware </connor>
<connor> that what you're doing is impossible, </connor>
<connor> so you take full advantage of that. </connor>
<connor> - I thought lucid dreaming </connor>
<joey> was where you then controlled said dream. </joey>
<joey> - I can't control said, </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I know I'm in a
dream a lot of the time. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> So I can't control my dream </connor>
<connor> when I'm in lucid dreaming state, </connor>
<connor> but it's more of, it's more of, </connor>
<connor> It's more like you've
realized that you're in GTA </connor>
<connor> with cheats on. </connor>
<connor> That's how I imagine it. </connor>
<connor> Because there have been
times where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, fuck. I'm fucking dreaming. </connor>
<garnt> All right let me look. Am I dreaming? </garnt>
<connor> Let me try flying. </connor>
<connor> Oh, I'm flying now. Brilliant. </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking dreaming. This is amazing." </connor>
<garnt> - To me, that sounds
like you have cheats on. </garnt>
<joey> See? I can't, </joey>
<connor> Because I don't have
dreams often but when I do, </connor>
<connor> at some point in the dream, I
figure out, this is a dream. </connor>
<connor> Like Inception.
- I turn those cheats on. </connor>
<connor> - This is Inception. This is Inception. </connor>
<connor> Something will happen that
my brain chose to make happen </connor>
<joey> but I also am aware that
that is not possible, </joey>
<joey> and that I am now aware
that I am in a dream, </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't change how I behave. </joey>
<joey> I know that I'm in a dream
but I still go on the dream. </joey>
<joey> This is so strange. What's
wrong with our brains? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know.
- Why are we so fucking weird? </joey>
<joey> I had this dream recently,
I cant remember the full, </joey>
<joey> I told the dream on stream. </joey>
<garnt> It was something like I was in a situation </garnt>
<garnt> where I'd been falsely accused </garnt>
<garnt> of stealing this game cartridge. </garnt>
<garnt> I was then arrested for it. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like," No, I'm not
getting arrested for this. </joey>
<joey> I didn't steal it. I refuse." </joey>
<joey> Ten I killed one of the cops and ran away </joey>
<connor> because he was trying to arrest me </connor>
<connor> over a fucking game cartridge. </connor>
<connor> And then it turned out into
this massive shootout and stuff. </connor>
<joey> Then I somehow kept getting away. </joey>
<joey> And then eventually I got caught
and then I went to prison. </joey>
<joey> And I understood I was in
the dream at this point, </joey>
<joey> So then, somehow, I
magically then got a phone, </joey>
<joey> it's like in Isikai. </joey>
<joey> I had this phone in prison </joey>
<connor> that I was then using to
then play games and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and have a normal life in prison. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Then my charger broke, and
I remember this happened, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Shit.
Well, my charger's broke." </connor>
<connor> And then I just skipped
and I had a charger. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Great. This is awesome. </connor>
<connor> - You skipped.
- This is awesome. </connor>
<connor> This is fantastic. </connor>
<connor> I just skipped. </connor>
<connor> I just skipped the part </connor>
<connor> where my brain had to think hard enough </connor>
<connor> to come up with the reason
why I needed the charger, </connor>
<connor> - It just appeared.
- and then it just went, </connor>
<connor> "Boop." I have the charger. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh, this is
great. This is amazing." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand why
this happens though. </garnt>
<garnt> - But did you realize it was a dream? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> About half way through the dream </garnt>
<garnt> I understood it was a dream. </garnt>
<connor> - But you don't take advantage of it? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know how to. </garnt>
<joey> - I was about to say I
love how in the dream </joey>
<joey> you still got arrested. </joey>
<joey> He's taking an L in the dream. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. This is my thing. </connor>
<joey> If it was my dream I wouldn't
go to fucking prison. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. You wouldn't go to prison if you- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, shit. That's right. </joey>
<joey> And then I remember, No, no. </joey>
<joey> This is incorrect, actually, </joey>
<connor> I didn't get the charger,
I remember I got, </connor>
<connor> this is where I reset. </connor>
<connor> So I went to the roof of the prison </connor>
<connor> because I couldn't get
a charger so I thought, </connor>
<connor> "What's the fucking point
if I can't play games?", </connor>
<joey> I jumped off the roof of the prison, </joey>
<joey> and then I reset in the prison. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I died. I died. </connor>
<connor> And then I just, in my head,
I remember there was a jump, </connor>
<connor> I remember I died, </connor>
<connor> and then I just appeared
back in the prison again, </connor>
<connor> with the charged iPhone with
a new charger or something. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the worst
version of Age of Tomorrow. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's a terrible dream. Awful dream. </joey>
<joey> - Age of Tomorrow, Jail version. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't know
why this was happening. </joey>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<connor> I understood it was a dream, </connor>
<connor> why can't I have some control over it? </connor>
<connor> They're all shit dreams.
I always have shit dreams. </connor>
<joey> - But at least you remember- </joey>
<garnt> Because to me, a lot of,
Say for example, last night, </garnt>
<garnt> to me it's like, "Okay.
I'm falling asleep. </garnt>
<garnt> Falling asleep. Falling asleep." </garnt>
<garnt> One second later, "Oh, it's 7 AM." </garnt>
<joey> I feel no perception of time. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. When you wake up, </connor>
<connor> can you feel the time
without looking at the clock? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, but not accurately. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I'm pretty
fucking good at it now. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what happened. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know if I'm
getting old now or what. </connor>
<garnt> - It depends on how good my
sleep cycle is at that time. </garnt>
<joey> Now it's a bit fucked up </joey>
<joey> because COVID just made me
want to sleep all the time. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, "Okay,
now I can't tell." </joey>
<joey> Because my body's constantly tired, </joey>
<joey> but before then I would be, </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you wake up and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "It's going to be 15 minutes
before the alarm goes off." </joey>
<joey> And then you look at the time, </joey>
<joey> - That happens every time.
- And you look at the time, </joey>
<garnt> you're like, "I'm a fucking genius" </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. Okay </garnt>
<garnt> The reason why I asked, do you know that, </garnt>
<connor> is because I was, if I
asked in your dreams, </connor>
<connor> do you know that there is a
flow of time in your dreams? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No, no. </connor>
<joey> - See? This is weird. </joey>
<connor> I know how much time is
passing in the dream, </connor>
<connor> in the real world. </connor>
<connor> Isn't this weird? </connor>
<connor> How strange is that?
(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That's against Inception rules, though, </garnt>
<connor> because we all, </connor>
<garnt> We all know time passes
slow in the dream world. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Exactly.
- Because I wake up </connor>
<connor> after a dream or whatever, </connor>
<connor> and it'll be 5 AM and then I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "I liked that dream, I'm also
going to go back to bed." </connor>
<connor> And then I know, when I'm in the dream, </connor>
<connor> how much time is passing,
because when I wake up, </connor>
<garnt> the exact amount of time </garnt>
<garnt> that I thought had passed in the dream, </garnt>
<garnt> had passed in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> Isn't this so strange? </garnt>
<connor> - But I think that's
just your subconscious </connor>
<garnt> counting the time.
- Maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's also like an alternate reality. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you ever have a- </connor>
<connor> - Who needs VR? </connor>
<joey> Fuck them. Come in my brain. </joey>
<joey> - I am VR. </joey>
<garnt> - We all had VR in our minds, bruh. </garnt>
<connor> In our minds. </connor>
<connor> - This is one of the strangest
episodes we've ever done. </connor>
<connor> This is obviously the weirdest
topic we ever spoke about. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you ever have a really fun dream </garnt>
<connor> and then you get actively
pissed off when you wake up? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing)
- Yeah. Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> I remember some of the
funnest lucid dreams I had, </connor>
<garnt> and the fucking Sydney wakes
up and is like, "Garnt, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's cuddle.", </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Fuck off,
Sydney. I'm flying right now. </garnt>
<connor> I'm flying, Sydney." </connor>
<connor> - "I was on episode 24 and I
was the protagonist, Sydney. </connor>
<connor> I'm supposed to get what I deserve." </connor>
<connor> - The worst one for me is,
when I'm having a good dream, </connor>
<connor> because I don't remember
most of my good dreams, </connor>
<connor> but I remember I wake
up and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I don't remember what I just dreamed </connor>
<joey> but maybe if I go back to
sleep, I'll dream it again." </joey>
<joey> And so I go back to sleep
and I don't dream it again, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "No. It's gone forever." </joey>
<joey> - To me, there's a point, </joey>
<joey> Because, to me, I've had it before, </joey>
<joey> where I've had really, really fun dreams, </joey>
<joey> and you half wake up but before
your mind fully wakes up, </joey>
<connor> you're like, "Go back to sleep." </connor>
<connor> And then sometimes I've
been able to reinsert myself </connor>
<connor> into the matrix. </connor>
<connor> - I'm going in. </connor>
<joey> - I'm going in. </joey>
<joey> So I know sometimes I wake up, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "If I go to sleep now, if
I go to sleep right now, </joey>
<joey> I can jack back in." </joey>
<joey> And then I get so sad </joey>
<joey> when I try to fucking
will myself to sleep. </joey>
<joey> Because you know </joey>
<joey> when you try to will yourself to sleep, </joey>
<joey> most of the time it doesn't fucking work. </joey>
<joey> But sometimes I just try
to will myself to sleep, </joey>
<joey> and five minutes passes I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> (sighs) "I'm awake now. Fuck my life. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the real world." </garnt>
<connor> - I used to do that but I
don't ever try that anymore. </connor>
<joey> I think sometimes I'm
like, "Yeah. Whatever. </joey>
<joey> Just get on with it." </joey>
<joey> - "I'll just dream it
again tomorrow night." </joey>
<joey> - Just dream it again. </joey>
<joey> - Well, do you have a theme
to most of your dreams? </joey>
<joey> Are your dreams, </joey>
<connor> Because they say that your dreams </connor>
<joey> are normally reoccurring. </joey>
<connor> They're similar events.
- No. </connor>
<joey> - No, not really, for me. </joey>
<joey> It's all over the place. </joey>
<connor> - I just die in a lot of my dreams. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Don't know what that says about me. </connor>
<connor> There could be some dream expert, </connor>
<connor> But even that. </connor>
<connor> You know how people are like-
- Dreamologist. </connor>
<connor> - "Yeah. The dreams, they, </connor>
<joey> Whatever you do in a dream, </joey>
<connor> there's a real meaning
to it in real life." </connor>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - If you stressed out </connor>
<joey> then you'll dream about
your teeth falling out </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that? </joey>
<joey> - Something like that. </joey>
<connor> Where they think that every single thing </connor>
<connor> that you can dream of has
a real life counter part. </connor>
<connor> Emotionally or feeling. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure there is to some extent, </joey>
<connor> but there's definitely- </connor>
<joey> - Probably too complex for us
- Yeah. Way to complex. </joey>
<garnt> to be able to solve it
with modern science. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I get really high
concept dreams sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> I told you the dream I just had, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes I just
dream and then I wake up </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "That was a really cool
fucking film idea." </connor>
<connor> That was a really cool film idea. </connor>
<connor> - How Garnt gets his videos ideas. </connor>
<connor> - Basically. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird, I don't
know how my mind works, </connor>
<garnt> because sometimes I'm just
like, "Damn, I dreamed that. </garnt>
<garnt> That was such a cool fucking idea. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> How the fuck did my mind
come up with that concept? </garnt>
<joey> - What language do you dream in? </joey>
<garnt> As being as all three of
us can speak two languages. </garnt>
<garnt> What language do you usually dream in? </garnt>
<joey> - No. English. </joey>
<joey> - English for me. </joey>
<garnt> I've rarely dreamed in Thai </garnt>
<garnt> unless it's when I'm living in Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm using it more often. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> 90% of my dreams are in Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. What language
do you think in, though? </garnt>
<joey> - Depends. </joey>
<garnt> - That's probably why. </garnt>
<garnt> That's probably why. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I don't normally think in Thai </garnt>
<joey> but there's been points
where I've lived in Thailand </joey>
<joey> and then my thoughts
start getting jumbled up, </joey>
<joey> and I start thinking in a
different language as well, </joey>
<joey> which is, </joey>
<joey> How do you describe thinking
in a different language </joey>
<joey> to somebody who only speaks one language? </joey>
<connor> I don't know how to properly describe it. </connor>
<connor> - Thinking about how
you think is also weird. </connor>
<connor> Now I'm like, "I don't talk
to myself when I think. </connor>
<connor> I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> But maybe I do talk to
myself when I think. </connor>
<connor> I'm not sure." </connor>
<joey> - Some people can't, though. </joey>
<joey> Some people physically
can't think out in the air. </joey>
<connor> - Now that you're telling me </connor>
<connor> that I'm talking to
myself while I'm thinking, </connor>
<joey> now I'm doing it. </joey>
<joey> But I'm pretty sure I don't do it. </joey>
<joey> I think I just do things.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I just do things.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't think I talk to myself in my head. </joey>
<garnt> I talk out loud if I talk. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember
reading about deaf people </connor>
<connor> thinking in sign language, </connor>
<connor> and that blows my fucking mind. </connor>
<connor> I can't even come close
to conceptualizing it, </connor>
<connor> but I know it happens. </connor>
<joey> I know people do it. </joey>
<garnt> It's so weird to me. </garnt>
<joey> - This episode is
sponsored by Express VPN. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] When you use the bathroom, </connor>
<connor> you always close the
door behind you, right? </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - You don't want a random
passer by looking in on you. </connor>
<connor> - Ewe. </connor>
<connor> - So why would you let
people look in on you </connor>
<connor> when you go online? </connor>
<connor> Using the internet without Express VPN </connor>
<connor> is like going to the bathroom
and not closing the door. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you know that your
internet service provider </garnt>
<garnt> knows every single website you visit? </garnt>
<garnt> And what's worse is that
they sell this information </garnt>
<garnt> to ad companies and tech giants, </garnt>
<garnt> who use your data to target you. </garnt>
<garnt> (screaming) </garnt>
<connor> - Is that why there's milf's in my area? </connor>
<joey> - Well, the good thing
is, is that Express VPN </joey>
<joey> puts a stop to all of that. </joey>
<joey> It creates a secure, encrypted tunnel </joey>
<joey> between your device and the internet </joey>
<joey> so that your online activity
can't be seen by anyone. </joey>
<connor> - I use Express VPN on all of my devices. </connor>
<connor> It works on everything. </connor>
<connor> Phones, laptops, even routers, </connor>
<connor> so everyone who shares your wifi </connor>
<connor> can still be protected, even
if they don't have Express VPN. </connor>
<garnt> - And the best part is using Express VPN </garnt>
<garnt> is as easy as closing the bathroom door. </garnt>
<garnt> You just fire up the
app, press one button, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you're protected. </garnt>
<connor> - So if you're like me </connor>
<connor> and you believe your online
activity is your business, </connor>
<connor> secure yourself by visiting
expressvpn.com/trashtaste today. </connor>

<garnt> - Back to the show.
(gibbers) </garnt>
<connor> - Back to the show. </connor>
<connor> - I would love to be able
(X-Files theme song) </connor>
<connor> to turn on my lucid dreams. </connor>
<connor> If I had that fucking power. </connor>
<garnt> That is literally, </garnt>
<connor> - So it's not normal or you
to be aware you're in a dream. </connor>
<garnt> - No.
- I didn't know that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's not normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, are you always aware? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Most of the time. </garnt>
<connor> I'd say 80% of the time
I know I'm in a dream. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, my God.
- Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You're that kid in school </joey>
<connor> that aces the tests without studying. </connor>
<joey> (stammers) </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Because he knows he's in a
dream but he can't control it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I can't control it.
- Oh. </joey>
<joey> - That's like getting, </joey>
<connor> becoming a lucid dreamer </connor>
<garnt> without having the fun part
of being a lucid dreamer. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird because I'm
aware I'm in a dream, </connor>
<garnt> and I know that I can want things. </garnt>
<garnt> I know I feel that I want
the thing in the dream </garnt>
<garnt> but it doesn't always happen. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know how that works. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a super
power when you're in a dream? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Many times. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, define super power.
- But then I die, normally. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's too much power
to handle for one man. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally, in your own mind
you're playing on hard mode. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize it was that possible. </garnt>
<joey> - He gets all these super
powers and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Guess I'll die." </joey>
<connor> - I'm trying to think, </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Yeah. I always know at some, </connor>
<connor> I'd say 80% of the time, I
feel that half way through, </connor>
<connor> or at some period in the dream,
I know that I'm dreaming, </connor>
<connor> because things don't add up in my head </connor>
<connor> when I'm in the dream. </connor>
<connor> It's weird because it feels
like I'm conscious in the dream, </connor>
<connor> so I know what's happening, </connor>
<connor> and I know that some things don't add up, </connor>
<connor> and I'm aware that I have the knowledge </connor>
<connor> from my normal human life, </connor>
<connor> and I have that in said dream, </connor>
<connor> so if somebody fucking
teleports behind me, </connor>
<connor> at some point, after that happens </connor>
<connor> X amount of times or something, </connor>
<connor> I'm aware then that this
is now not possible. </connor>
<connor> Or if I reset. </connor>
<connor> When I die and I would come back. </connor>
<connor> - What is this reset mechanics? </connor>
<garnt> So much in your dream. </garnt>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't happen often
but when it has happened, </garnt>
<joey> if I die but I'm still dreaming, </joey>
<joey> I immediately know that
now I'm in a dream. </joey>
<joey> Because I died. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Because you died? </connor>
<joey> - And also, generally,
- "You can't reset real life" </joey>
<joey> - You know what's weird as well </joey>
<joey> - Must be in a dream.
- I don't know </joey>
<joey> if this is a strange thing
but when I'm in danger, </joey>
<joey> that's normally a good way that I know. </joey>
<garnt> Because rarely in life
am I ever in danger, </garnt>
<garnt> in weird situations. </garnt>
<garnt> So being in danger is not a
normal emotion I ever feel, </garnt>
<garnt> so when I end up coming
across it in the dream, </garnt>
<connor> if somebody's chasing me, </connor>
<connor> that's normally one really
weird way that I get in tune </connor>
<connor> with the fact that I'm in a dream. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because I also
very rarely dream, for one, </garnt>
<garnt> but even more rare is
for me to get nightmares. </garnt>
<connor> - I see all of mine are nearly nightmares. </connor>
<joey> I want to say, again, 80% are
probably in the bad things. </joey>
<joey> - How do you sleep at night? </joey>
<joey> - I don't mind. </joey>
<connor> You see? Okay, here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> When something bad's
happening to me in a dream, </connor>
<connor> because, again, I know it's a dream, </connor>
<connor> I feel these emotions
towards it but then I also, </connor>
<connor> because, again, I'm aware it's a dream, </connor>
<connor> I have this weird sense of, </connor>
<connor> "Well, let's just see what could happen." </connor>
<connor> Because I don't feel like
it has any impact on my- </connor>
<joey> - Right. Because there's no consequences. </joey>
<garnt> - on my actual emotions
I'm aware that it isn't, </garnt>
<garnt> Is this strange? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like if you have
nightmares that often then- </garnt>
<connor> - But that's the thing, </connor>
<connor> I don't wake up from a
nightmare being like, (grunts) </connor>
<connor> like in the movies, (grunts) </connor>
<connor> That's why I always
find that shit so dumb. </connor>
<joey> Because I'm looking for
a nightmare and I'm like- </joey>
<connor> - Well, that happens to me. </connor>
<joey> - What? No. </joey>
<connor> I wake up from a nightmare
I'm like, "Oh, get my phone." </connor>
<connor> - No. I wake up and, </connor>
<joey> If it's really bad nightmares, </joey>
<joey> which I've had every now and then, </joey>
<joey> I wake up in an actual sweat. </joey>
<connor> - I've had my entire life,
in every single aspect, </connor>
<connor> ruined in dreams before,
and waking up like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, that's good. I'm feeling better now." </connor>
<connor> Because when I wake up I feel much better. </connor>
<garnt> Because I'm like, "Oh, good. It's-" </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I've had nightmares
where something bad has happened </garnt>
<connor> and then you wake up </connor>
<connor> and you just have this
instant sigh of relief. </connor>
<connor> When you're like, "Oh, my God. Thank fuck. </connor>
<connor> I though my life was ruined.", </connor>
<joey> and it's like, "It's great.
It's fucking great right now." </joey>
<joey> - I'm comfy in this bed.
- I'm comfy in this bed. </joey>
<joey> - It's all in, baby. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not in jail. </joey>
<joey> - I've had so many dreams
- I've got my charging cable. </joey>
<joey> It's all good. </joey>
<joey> - I think I've had a dream </joey>
<connor> where I've literally had to tell my mum </connor>
<connor> I'm about to go to jail.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yes, yes, yes. I've had that. </connor>
<connor> - You've had that as well?
- I've had that. </connor>
<connor> - Seeing her cry and break down </connor>
<joey> - That's cruel. That's cruel.
- was just the, </joey>
<joey> - I wake up and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Why does my mind do this to me?" </joey>
<connor> That was the most
heartbreaking feeling I've had, </connor>
<joey> which is telling my mum
I'm about to go to jail, </joey>
<joey> and I remember her fucking
crying and breaking down, </joey>
<joey> and me feeling like a, </joey>
<joey> Me just feeling like the
worst human in the world. </joey>
<joey> I wake up and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I've never loved my life
more than I have now. </joey>
<connor> I've never felt more fulfilled." </connor>
<garnt> - I've never had that. </garnt>
<connor> - So people in your world </connor>
<connor> have really depth emotional ability? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - See? That's weird, </connor>
<connor> because in mine it's like I'm
the only person who is aware </connor>
<connor> of how emotions work and
everyone seems to be robotic. </connor>
<joey> - So everyone's like
an NPC in your dreams? </joey>
<connor> - Kind of. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> The depth isn't there. </connor>
<connor> Even when my parents are in
the dream, the reason, again, </connor>
<connor> this is another weird things, </connor>
<connor> the thing that gives it away, though, </connor>
<garnt> - The depth isn't there. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The thing that normally makes me- </connor>
<connor> - Not enough world building. </connor>
<garnt> - Clearly. </garnt>
<connor> This is another thing, </connor>
<connor> where it wakes me, When I
feel like I become, again, </connor>
<connor> in tune into the dream,
that I know it's a dream, </connor>
<connor> is when people aren't acting </connor>
<connor> the way my brain knows they are. </connor>
<connor> But it's weird because my
brain is the one making this. </connor>
<connor> So why does my brain make
the people like this, </connor>
<connor> but then in the dream, my brain also, </connor>
<connor> It's like I'm playing
checkers against myself, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Fantastic move, Connor. </connor>
<connor> You've figured out the plan." </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like what is happening in my brain? </connor>
<garnt> - Even when you sleep you're
just trying to beat yourself. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm beating myself. </connor>
<connor> - You're literally creating, </connor>
<connor> You're literally creating
a game for you to beat </connor>
<connor> while you sleep.
- What is happening? </connor>
<connor> - The absolute state. </connor>
<connor> The absolute state of Connor dreams. </connor>
<connor> - It actually makes so much
sense because, I swear, </connor>
<connor> every one of my dreams
is like a Isikai to me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I literally get transported
into my own fucking story, </connor>
<connor> in my own fucking world. </connor>
<joey> There's depth in the world building there. </joey>
<joey> There's some high concept
dreams that I remember. </joey>
<joey> Characters in my dram </joey>
<joey> actually act like characters in real life. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt's like, "Finally I can self-" </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes when I wake
up, and someone's done, </joey>
<joey> I remember one time I had a dream </joey>
<joey> where Sydney murdered my family, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> and I remember waking up, </joey>
<joey> I remember waking up, just as I found her, </joey>
<joey> I woke up and I turned to
her with such fucking anger, </joey>
<joey> be like, "You bitch. </joey>
<joey> I can't believe you did
that to my mum and dad. </joey>
<joey> How dare you." </joey>
<joey> - "Better have a good reason. </joey>
<joey> You better start explaining." </joey>
<joey> - We were about to go to trial- </joey>
<joey> - I will see you in court.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Because at the time,
the emotions felt so, </joey>
<joey> The emotions felt so real to me. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes when I wake up and
the dream isn't resolved, </joey>
<connor> I still have those
emotions fresh in my body, </connor>
<connor> and fresh in my mind, that
it's hard to sometimes </connor>
<garnt> - That's so strange.
- Get rid of it. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like those stereotypical, </joey>
<joey> the girlfriend dreams about
the boyfriend cheating </joey>
<joey> in the girlfriend's dream. </joey>
<joey> Wakes up, slaps the boyfriend. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "What the fuck? Who is she?" </joey>
<joey> It's like, "What the fuck are you on?" </joey>
<joey> - It's the exact same. </joey>
<connor> I've never understood that but now I do. </connor>
<garnt> - I've never spoken
about my dreams in depth. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the first time
I'm thinking, "Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe my dreams are weird. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I'm the weird one."
- Yeah, that's probably it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought I didn't
remember much of my dreams </garnt>
<garnt> but now that I'm thinking about it, </garnt>
<joey> maybe I do just remember a lot of, </joey>
<joey> Because I don't dream often, </joey>
<joey> but when I do dream, it's
like an event for me. </joey>
<joey> It's literally like watching a film. </joey>
<joey> It's great. It's great. </joey>
<connor> - This one's going into the memory bank. </connor>
<connor> - Also, sometimes I have dreams, that I, </connor>
<connor> at least can only remember,
that are very brief dreams. </connor>
<connor> 30 seconds of a dream that I can remember, </connor>
<connor> and I've woken up. </connor>
<connor> The latest one I remembered
that I was cooking meat. </connor>
<connor> I don't remember why. </connor>
<joey> I didn't know I was in that dream either. </joey>
<connor> - It's the mystery meat.
- I just woke up, </connor>
<connor> and I was, Probably the thing
that gave me food poisoning. </connor>
<connor> I don't know.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> I remember I was cooking meat and yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Do you get food poisoning
in your dreams as well? </connor>
<joey> - I haven't. I don't think I have. </joey>
<joey> I dint think I have. </joey>
<joey> That's another thing. </joey>
<joey> I don't think I ever
get sick in my dreams. </joey>
<connor> From all the ones I've remembered, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've ever
gotten ill in a dream. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever
gotten ill in a dream. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, you've
gone one step above, </joey>
<joey> and you just straight
up die in your dream. </joey>
<connor> - I never die from, </connor>
<connor> It's never like a dream with
me on the bed and I'm... </connor>
<connor> I'm always getting stabbed,
getting thrown, getting shot. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, in your dream, </connor>
<connor> you should be in your peak performance. </connor>
<connor> - Imagination, go. </connor>
<connor> - Your peak form. </connor>
<connor> I think it would be pretty sad </connor>
<joey> if your imagination's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Nah, you're a frail mother fucker, boy. </joey>
<joey> You're a frail mother fucker. </joey>
<connor> In your dreams? Nah, you can't fly" </connor>
<connor> - "How many times would
you like to die tonight?" </connor>
<garnt> - But it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I've had drams where other
people have been sick in them, </garnt>
<joey> and I've been around, The whole dream </joey>
<joey> has been around this person </joey>
<joey> who is progressively getting more ill. </joey>
<joey> - And those dreams are really depressing. </joey>
<connor> Because, even though, again,
I'm aware that I'm in a dream, </connor>
<connor> I can't do anything to
help them, I feel like. </connor>
<connor> And I still feel sad </connor>
<connor> because seeing this dream sad
version that I've made up, </connor>
<connor> of them getting more
dead, is really saddening. </connor>
<connor> This is so strange. </connor>
<connor> This is really bizarre. </connor>
<connor> - I think one of- </connor>
<connor> - This is why Inception was so good. </connor>
<garnt> - I think one of the
weirdest dreams I had, </garnt>
<garnt> which actually would be a cool concept, </garnt>
<garnt> is I remember one time, I woke up, </garnt>
<connor> and for some reason, </connor>
<connor> I knew I was the second coming of Christ. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I knew I was- </connor>
<connor> - The chosen one. </connor>
<connor> - I knew I was the Messiah.
- The chosen one. </connor>
<garnt> - I knew I was the Messiah, </garnt>
<garnt> but the problem is- </garnt>
<joey> - I believe that's called
the sigma male, Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - So the problem is, The problem is, </garnt>
<connor> I knew I was the Messiah, </connor>
<connor> but for the life of me I could
not prove it to the world. </connor>
<connor> So I would try to go out, </connor>
<connor> - You sound like every crazy guy. </connor>
<connor> - So I would out and I
would perform miracles, </connor>
<connor> I would go out, I would walk
on water, and shit like this, </connor>
<connor> and I remember I would be
like, "Guys, I am the Messiah." </connor>
<connor> And everyone would be like,
"That's a magic trick. </connor>
<connor> Where's the mirrors at?
Where's the mirrors at? </connor>
<connor> And it was just me getting
progressively more, more, more </connor>
<connor> and more anger. </connor>
<connor> I think I even went on Joe Rogan
at one point in this dream. </connor>
<joey> - "I am Jesus Christ. I am Jesus Christ." </joey>
<joey> - Be like, "I am Jesus Christ.", </joey>
<joey> and he goes, "Prove it then." </joey>
<joey> And I remember I- </joey>
<joey> - "I'll turn the frogs gay right now." </joey>
<connor> - And I remember I took my hand out, </connor>
<connor> and I just made fire in my hand. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "That's not impressive. </connor>
<connor> I've seen magicians do
that. Do something real. </connor>
<garnt> Do a real miracle." </garnt>
<garnt> - All I'm hearing is, the dream gotten </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't actually about you becoming a god, </garnt>
<connor> it was that you're furious with
the current state of magic, </connor>
<connor> catching up to real life miracles. </connor>
<garnt> - It was me thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> if there was an actual Messiah
that got born into our world, </garnt>
<connor> how would they go about proving it? </connor>
<connor> What would they need, </connor>
<connor> - Do sorcery. </connor>
<garnt> - That was just me-
- it's very hard </garnt>
<joey> in the modern era, </joey>
<joey> because of special effects
and all this stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Well, now that you say that, </connor>
<joey> someone's going to make
a fucking Jesus Isikai. </joey>
<joey> Literally take that concept. </joey>
<garnt> I'm Jesus and I was
reborn into this world. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember waking up, I was just like, </connor>
<joey> "That's a really cool
concept." I'm glad my, </joey>
<joey> That was a cool concept.
- Jesus Isikai. </joey>
<joey> Fucking copyright that. </joey>
<joey> - Now that you've said it.
- Copyright that right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Now that I've said it, </garnt>
<garnt> someone can go write a story about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you guys ever had sleep paralysis? </joey>
<garnt> - Yes.
- One time. One time. </garnt>
<joey> - I have literally seen
sleep paralysis demons. </joey>
<joey> - Have you?
- Yes I have. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. I've never seen.
- Wait, that's not a meme? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's not a meme. </joey>
<joey> - I've never gotten to the demon part, </joey>
<joey> but I've definitely had it. </joey>
<joey> Because I didn't believe in
sleep paralysis until I got it. </joey>
<joey> - And it's so fucking
weird because it's like, </joey>
<joey> to explain what sleep is, </joey>
<joey> is basically you're awake
but your body's asleep, </joey>
<joey> essentially,- </joey>
<connor> - You mind's awake but your body, </connor>
<connor> So I believe when you go to sleep, </connor>
<joey> your body excretes a, </joey>
<joey> - Chremical.
- Your mind excretes, </joey>
<joey> a chremical, </joey>
<joey> Your mind excretes a chemical </joey>
<connor> that paralysis your body
while you're sleeping, </connor>
<connor> I believe.
- Something like that. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Sound like some Hunter Hunter shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And so what sleep paralysis is </connor>
<connor> is that that chemical's
still in your body, </connor>
<connor> so you can't move </connor>
<connor> but your mind is still awake.
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't sound right. </connor>
<connor> - Is that right, Ashley? </connor>
<garnt> Can you Google that? </garnt>
<connor> (Ashley speaks indistinctly) </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] You're conscious
but you are not able to move. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I've only had it once in my life, </connor>
<connor> and I though this was nonsense before, </connor>
<connor> and it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was on Joey's couch. </connor>
<joey> - What? Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - When was this? </joey>
<joey> - Just to say, I mean,
- I've never know that. </joey>
<garnt> - Hadn't proven any concrete cause, </garnt>
<connor> (Ashley speaks indistinctly) </connor>
<connor> - Demons. </connor>
<garnt> - Your sister was there. </garnt>
<garnt> Your sister had come. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, </garnt>
<garnt> it was weird because they
were speaking about me </garnt>
<garnt> and I was trying to get up
to say hello, but I couldn't. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I was face-down on Joey's couch,
trying my best to wake up. </connor>
<connor> I was fully aware. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't open my eyes, </connor>
<connor> but I was fully awake, </connor>
<connor> and I couldn't move my arms or legs. </connor>
<connor> But it didn't feel like I was paralyzed, </connor>
<connor> it felt that even though I was
willing my body to wake up, </connor>
<connor> my arms and my legs, my
whole body wasn't listening. </connor>
<joey> - Your eyes were closed, </joey>
<joey> because when I had sleep
paralysis, my eyes were open. </joey>
<connor> - Oh. My eyes were closed. </connor>
<joey> I could feel, I was well
aware that I was awake, </joey>
<joey> and I was aware of everything
that was going on around me, </joey>
<joey> but I couldn't, </joey>
<joey> it just took a moment. </joey>
<joey> And I felt like there was a battle. </joey>
<connor> When I was telling myself to
wake up, it wasn't doing it. </connor>
<connor> It felt like I'm pulling a chainsaw chord. </connor>
<connor> (imitates chainsaw) </connor>
<connor> I could feel like I was
trying to get through </connor>
<joey> and it wasn't happening. </joey>
<joey> I didn't understand why. </joey>
<joey> And eventually I woke up. </joey>
<connor> - For me it was so fucked, </connor>
<joey> because I clearly just
remember opening my eyes, </joey>
<connor> looking around. </connor>
<connor> It was like five in the morning. </connor>
<connor> I saw the clock. </connor>
<connor> I was looking around. </connor>
<connor> - Your eyes were moving around? </connor>
<connor> - I was darting my eyes around, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like," Why can I
not talk or hear anything </joey>
<connor> or move my body?"
- That's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - It was so fucked.
- You couldn't hear anything? </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't hear anything either. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't hear anything. </connor>
<joey> I tried to open my mouth to say something </joey>
<joey> and my mouth just wouldn't move. </joey>
<connor> - See? This is one of those things </connor>
<connor> where I feel like it's
definitely the mind. </connor>
<joey> Like this is like a fucking, A glitch. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah. </connor>
<joey> What the fuck else do you think it is? </joey>
<connor> The demons? </connor>
<joey> - This is why I think, </joey>
<connor> it's a chemical, I'm like,
"I don't know though. </connor>
<connor> Because to me it just
sounds like a neuron fuck up </connor>
<connor> in your head, like you hear
the (imitates Windows shutdown) </connor>
<garnt> It's restarting. It's
trying to figure out. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what happened? </garnt>
<garnt> Did you go back to sleep
after your sleep paralysis? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> I woke up after 15, 10 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I went back to sleep. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, because this was,
I'd had a full sleep, </joey>
<joey> and I was waking up, </joey>
<joey> and I woke up and I just
couldn't move my arms or legs </joey>
<joey> for a little bit. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't like a, </joey>
<joey> it wasn't like I was trying to
move it and it wasn't moving, </joey>
<joey> I could even figure out how to move it. </joey>
<garnt> Really strange. </garnt>
<connor> I don't understand how this works. </connor>
<connor> - So I remember the one
time I got sleep paralysis, </connor>
<joey> and I literally saw a
sleep paralysis demon. </joey>
<connor> - What? What did it look like? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. I call it a sleep paralysis demon. </connor>
<connor> It just look like a ghost. </connor>
<connor> So what happened is, I
was sleeping on my bed </connor>
<connor> and I remember not waking up immediately, </connor>
<connor> but I remember just opening my eyes a bit </connor>
<connor> and seeing this ghostly figure. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What the fuck is that?" </connor>
<connor> Immediately I punched my eyes open </connor>
<connor> and I see this female figure
praying above me or something, </connor>
<connor> - Sydney. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No. It wasn't Sydney. </connor>
<connor> - She was like, (grunts) </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> But it was literally this,
looked like a nun or something, </joey>
<joey> that was just praying above me. </joey>
<connor> And I start freaking out
because I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck? There is a
literal ghost floating above me </connor>
<connor> right now. </connor>
<connor> - How old were you? </connor>
<connor> - I was around 24. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So I wasn't young, </connor>
<connor> I was, yeah, around 24. </connor>
<connor> I remember my mind going
into fight or flight mode. </connor>
<joey> I start panicking. </joey>
<joey> Because obviously if you
see a fucking ghost floating </joey>
<joey> floating above you, you start panicking. </joey>
<joey> So I try to start moving my
fucking body to do something, </joey>
<joey> and I remember my body
just would not move. </joey>
<garnt> It was a terrifying experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's so strange. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It was a terrifying
fucking experience. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, it took
me about 10 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> 10 to 15 minutes for me
screaming at my body, </garnt>
<garnt> just like, "Aah. Go on. </garnt>
<joey> Move. Move </joey>
<joey> You're going to die. You're going to die. </joey>
<joey> You're going to die now." </joey>
<garnt> - This sounds like a dream. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't a dream. </garnt>
<garnt> It felt like, No. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it felt like a dream </garnt>
<garnt> and not like a dream at the same time. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I was obviously in my
room but after 10, 15 minutes, </garnt>
<joey> I actually, finally was able
to will my body to just sit up. </joey>
<joey> I remember I immediately sat up, </joey>
<joey> I looked up and I could see the figure </joey>
<joey> literally fading away as I sat up. </joey>
<joey> It was super, super fucking surreal. </joey>
<joey> That's why I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, was that the fucking
sleep paralysis demon </joey>
<garnt> that everyone fucking memes about? </garnt>
<garnt> You mean that thing actually exist? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? That's so weird. </garnt>
<joey> - That's like some Persona shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe it was just my Stand. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just lost your Stand, Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> You could've gotten a Stand. </joey>
<connor> (imitates anime character) </connor>
<connor> - Put a dick in my
mouth right now, please. </connor>
<connor> Please, I'm begging you. </connor>
<connor> - All right. Another question. </connor>
<connor> When you dream, do you
visually see your surroundings </connor>
<connor> the exact same way? </connor>
<connor> Because I don't-
- What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. I'm seeing this right now. </connor>
<connor> I'm seeing the real world. </connor>
<joey> It's way fuzzier when I
see things in my dreams. </joey>
<joey> - Aah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Let's say I know there's a table there </joey>
<joey> but I can't give you the detail of it. </joey>
<joey> I know what everything is around me. </joey>
<joey> - You just know that object is there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I know everything's around me, </joey>
<connor> but I can't visually see
everything that's happening. </connor>
<garnt> Really strange. Do you have this as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. Mine's in fucking RTX, on 4K, </garnt>
<joey> - See? That's so strange.
- 60 FPS, man. </joey>
<connor> - Mine's in a fish-eye lens. </connor>
<connor> - That's why for me,
- What? </connor>
<connor> - That's why for me, </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is wrong with us? </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes it's so hard for
me to tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between when I'm dreaming
and when I'm awake </connor>
<connor> because my dreams are so vivid and so, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, they have
a lot of depth to them </connor>
<connor> that sometimes I wake up </connor>
<connor> and sometimes I immediately
know that I've just woken up, </connor>
<connor> and sometimes it takes me
a few moments to realize, </connor>
<connor> "Okay. I'm actually awake now. </connor>
<garnt> This is the real world. I'm
not in dream world anymore." </garnt>
<joey> - I think, for me, things that are fuzzy </joey>
<connor> is things that don't exist in reality. </connor>
<connor> If it's like a table for instance, </connor>
<connor> then I can clearly see that it's a table. </connor>
<joey> But if it's a fucking fairy, </joey>
<joey> then it will probably look fuzzy. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you know when
you're trying to remember </connor>
<connor> a moment that happened, </connor>
<connor> you have a picture of it in your head. </connor>
<connor> You don't have it in 4K,
RTX, the way that you saw it. </connor>
<connor> It's fuzzy. </connor>
<joey> You remember where
everything was, you think. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> The way that you recall
things that happened, </joey>
<joey> it's like that, the way
I see stuff in dreams. </joey>
<joey> I don't see it perfectly. </joey>
<connor> If I'm focusing on this
table, I know Garnt's there, </connor>
<connor> for example, but I can't see Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Does that make sense? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Items that I'm aware that
are there in the dream, </connor>
<connor> I don't see them unless I'm
then paying attention to them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because then your
brain has to render out. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. It's rendering. </connor>
<connor> It's rendering. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Because you know it's there
but your brain's just like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't want to render
this out right now. </joey>
<joey> I know that Garnt's there, I
just don't want to render out." </joey>
<garnt> - You got to upgrade you
brain's graphic card. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's true. It's true. </connor>
<connor> Because when I picture Garnt now, </connor>
<connor> I don't need to see that
Joe's in the corner of my eye </connor>
<connor> because it's in the corner of my eye. </connor>
<connor> But when I'm trying to
remember the whole picture, </connor>
<joey> in my head, when I'm in
the dream, it's like that. </joey>
<joey> When I can't- </joey>
<joey> - Your brain does a sequential rendering? </joey>
<garnt> - Are you still running a 1060? </garnt>
<garnt> What's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> - My draw distance is low as possible. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> When I'm walking up to the building, </connor>
<joey> it starts to come into frame. </joey>
<joey> It's a load of shit. </joey>
<joey> What a weird fucking, What a weird shit. </joey>
<joey> It's like that, though,
where the dream doesn't exist </joey>
<connor> unless I'm focusing on it in the dream. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a
dream that's taken place </garnt>
<garnt> in somewhere that you're
very familiar with? </garnt>
<joey> - All of my dreams are in
places that I've been to </joey>
<joey> in real life. </joey>
<connor> - See? </connor>
<connor> Most of the time my
dreams are in new places </connor>
<connor> that I'm not aware of. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is. </connor>
<joey> - I think my brain is capable </joey>
<joey> of coming up with new
locations in my dreams. </joey>
<connor> - What I think it is, I
think it's stitching together </connor>
<joey> things that I've seen
in passing or a picture. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And what I, </joey>
<joey> I can't visualize a lot of things </joey>
<connor> but I just know what's
happening and I have an idea. </connor>
<connor> It's really strange. </connor>
<joey> - A lot of my dreams are in my house. </joey>
<connor> They take place in my house. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- That's strange. </connor>
<connor> I never have dreams in my house, ever. </connor>
<joey> - But all sorts of fucked
up shit happens in my house </joey>
<joey> that shouldn't happen in my house. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait. Which house? </joey>
<connor> Japan? Japan? </connor>
<connor> - The house that I'm currently in. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, the house- </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> When your dream start, I'm
sure it's not, credit sequence, </connor>
<connor> shot to do, Joey opens up, "Hey." </connor>
<connor> Do you just wake, </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Game start." </connor>
<connor> You just start in a weird ass location, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "What
the fuck is going on?" </connor>
<joey> - No. It's always mid conversation. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I never remember the start of my dreams. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just like, "Oh, wait. </joey>
<garnt> Oh, I guess we're here
now.", kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess I only remember my dreams </garnt>
<joey> when I realize I'm in a dream. </joey>
<joey> So I never remember how I get there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't see the
PlayStation boot up logo. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> it's just like, "Oh, I'm in the game." </joey>
<connor> - Just like, "Oh,
Dreamcast start. Brilliant. </connor>
<garnt> Okay." </garnt>
<connor> - It's almost weird because I
feel like when I'm dreaming, </connor>
<connor> I'm watching a video and
at some point in the video </connor>
<joey> I'll know that's me. </joey>
<joey> Does that make sense? </joey>
<joey> It's a series of events unfolding, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm not necessarily
constantly in that brain </garnt>
<garnt> of the person experiencing it. </garnt>
<garnt> This is so strange. </garnt>
<garnt> This is really weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even stranger question, </garnt>
<joey> have you ever dreamed in third person? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That, to me, is the
weirdest fucking dream </joey>
<joey> because for some reason, in my dream, </joey>
<connor> it makes sense that I'm
seeing myself in third person. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Even though I've never
experienced that in my life. </garnt>
<connor> - That prison one, it was
weird because I remember, </connor>
<connor> this is going to sound so strange, </connor>
<connor> I remember shooting the guns, </connor>
<connor> but then I also remember watching me </connor>
<connor> after shooting the guns. </connor>
<joey> - So it flicks between
first and third person? </joey>
<connor> - And the weird thing is, </connor>
<connor> is that I then was able to
feel the emotions of both. </connor>
<garnt> When doing the dream act </garnt>
<garnt> and then when watching
me do the dream act, </garnt>
<joey> This is so, This is so, </joey>
<joey> I've never spoken about this before. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never spoken
about his before either. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that your talking, </garnt>
<garnt> Now that you're making
me think about this, </garnt>
<connor> I'm realizing how weird
this sounds to say out loud. </connor>
<connor> This must sound so bizarre. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if anyone else is- </connor>
<joey> - I don't think a dream
conversation is going to be normal. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never had a conversation </garnt>
<garnt> just about my dreams before with anyone. </garnt>
<connor> - The best way I can describe how it is, </connor>
<connor> is, you know when you're playing Halo </connor>
<joey> and there's that theater mode, </joey>
<joey> where at just any point you
can just unclip from the camera </joey>
<connor> But I'm not choosing where the camera goes </connor>
<connor> but I'm seeing it from a perspective, </connor>
<connor> and I don't understand who's
or what it is occasionally. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes I have amazing
cinematography in my dreams. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how. </garnt>
<connor> - If only the YouTube videos could match. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how it happens </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes I'm in first person </garnt>
<connor> and then I go to a new area or something </connor>
<connor> and I have this really-
- Area unlocked. </connor>
<connor> - A new area on the map or something </connor>
<joey> and my dream switches to
this establishing shot </joey>
<connor> of this new landscape that I'm in. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's swamp. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just, </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking in the dream, </connor>
<connor> "Damn. That looks cool as fuck.", </connor>
<garnt> and then I load back into
my character or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how to describe it. </garnt>
<joey> It's so fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, your dream has cut scenes? </joey>
<joey> Is that what you're saying? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> This man's dreams
literally has cut scenes. </joey>
<joey> And when it's over he goes
back into first person. </joey>
<joey> Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes I dream in games or- </joey>
<joey> - Your dream sounds like
a Kojima game, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Sometimes I dream in games </joey>
<joey> and sometimes I dream in movies, </joey>
<joey> which is why it never makes sense to me </joey>
<joey> how I can possibly dream in third person, </joey>
<joey> and at the time it makes it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> Because you never see
yourself in third person. </joey>
<joey> - By third person, do
you mean like in a movie, </joey>
<joey> from a movie camera standpoint? </joey>
<joey> Or are we talking GTA, behind yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes both.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's weird
really because, again, </joey>
<connor> I know that I'm in this situation </connor>
<connor> and I fully understand that it's a dream, </connor>
<joey> but I never, ever think
that this is wrong. </joey>
<joey> Because I'm in the moment </joey>
<joey> and it's what my mind is making up, </joey>
<connor> so it always feels natural
when I'm in this dream. </connor>
<garnt> - For some reason, I'm just
fucking remembering this now, </garnt>
<connor> talking to you, every time
I'm in an interrogation room, </connor>
<joey> it's never POV interrogation room, </joey>
<joey> it's always side,
- It's the interrogation shot? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's always side view. </joey>
<joey> Like this is fucking JCS </joey>
<joey> Criminal investigations or something. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why.
- That sound fun. </joey>
<joey> Anytime I have a conversation
in the interrogation room, </joey>
<joey> I'm always in third
person, I don't know why. </joey>
<garnt> It always feels like I'm in
control of what I'm saying. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure that's purely because
we've just consumed media </joey>
<joey> where they portray those things like that. </joey>
<joey> I'd be interested to see if another person </joey>
<joey> who has never scene an
interrogation scene in a movie, </joey>
<joey> how they would view that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Because I've never been in
an interrogation in my life. </connor>
<garnt> So I guess it makes sense. </garnt>
<connor> - I've also found, </connor>
<connor> that if I'm highly anxious about something </connor>
<connor> when going to bed, there's a 90% chance </connor>
<connor> my dream is going to be about that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's only ever happened a few times, </connor>
<connor> and that's only ever happened </connor>
<garnt> with homework and exams for me. </garnt>
<connor> - I was playing that
Pogostuck game recently and, </connor>
<connor> - Did it give you nightmares?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I had nightmares that I
was stuck in this game. </connor>
<connor> And that I couldn't
stop playing this game. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't beat it. </connor>
<connor> Because I was making, I
played it for eight hours </connor>
<connor> and I made no progress. </connor>
<connor> And then I went to bed, </connor>
<connor> all I could feel was me
playing the game in the dream, </connor>
<connor> and then I was playing it
and I couldn't get out. </connor>
<connor> It was horrible.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's a nightmare. </connor>
<garnt> - That was a nightmare.
- That's a true nightmare. </garnt>
<connor> - That was a horrible nightmare. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a scarier
nightmare than you dying. </garnt>
<connor> - The worst part was, I knew
that I was in a nightmare, </connor>
<connor> and I was getting more annoyed
because why am I wasting time </connor>
<connor> where I could be actually doing this? </connor>
<connor> But instead I'm in the nightmare, </connor>
<connor> stuck in a cycle playing
it in my nightmare. </connor>
<garnt> What a weird thing to dream up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you ever have moments
where your dream is so intense </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't feel like
you've slept at all? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I wake up more tired than
before I went to bed. </joey>
<joey> - No. I've never had that. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes, because you go
on such an emotional journey </garnt>
<joey> in this dream, or at least I do, </joey>
<garnt> that I wake up just exhausted. </garnt>
<joey> - So what do you do then? </joey>
<joey> Just get another eight hours? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't. I get up. </garnt>
<garnt> I get up but sometimes I just feel </garnt>
<garnt> like I haven't slept at all, </garnt>
<garnt> just because I feel like
I was awake in my dreams, </garnt>
<garnt> so I really didn't sleep at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. It's really weird. </garnt>
<joey> - The worst nightmares
I've had is I go to sleep, </joey>
<garnt> obviously tired, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm probably not even
in the right state of mind </garnt>
<garnt> before I go to bed, </garnt>
<garnt> hence the reason why I have the nightmare, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I have that nightmare. </garnt>
<connor> I wake up in that fucking cold
sweat, like (breaths rapidly) </connor>
<connor> "Fuck." </connor>
<connor> I'm so tired after that but I
don't want to go back to bed. </connor>
<connor> I know if I close my eyes right now, </connor>
<garnt> it's just going to be
like, "To be continued." </garnt>
<garnt> It's just going to happen again. </garnt>
<joey> - Why is it where you have a fun dream, </joey>
<joey> you can never get back into the dream? </joey>
<joey> When you have a nightmare-
- The nightmares </joey>
<joey> are waiting for you. </joey>
<garnt> - When you have a nightmare,
you go back to sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> you re enter the nightmare? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I think it's
putting stress and stuff. </connor>
<joey> It's probably a mental state. </joey>
<joey> - It just comes out from behind the tree. </joey>
<joey> - Like Freddy's like, "Hey, guy. Hey, boy. </joey>
<joey> Oh, you sleeping yet? </joey>
<joey> No?" </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I don't know why. </joey>
<garnt> I find it so much easier
to re enter my nightmares </garnt>
<garnt> than to re enter my fun dreams. </garnt>
<joey> - Can I get a round of applause, everyone? </joey>

(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. So since we're on the dream topic, </joey>
<connor> do you guys sleep talk? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I sleep talk.
- Really? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think I sleep talk. </garnt>
<garnt> - I generally just, </garnt>
<garnt> this is going to sound
terrible, just screams. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you serious?
- I shout in my dreams. </joey>
<joey> - It's probably every time you die, right? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, he died. </connor>
<connor> - You've been around me
when I've sleep talked. </connor>
<joey> - I've never heard you sleep talk. </joey>
<joey> I've heard you snore very heavily. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know if you're screaming </garnt>
<connor> - Or just a loud cuddle snore.
- or snoring, </connor>
<garnt> or if it was Chris fucking snoring. </garnt>
<garnt> (screams) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Not that loud but like, (screams) </connor>
<connor> Like that.
- Really? </connor>
<garnt> - Did you ever sleep talk
when you did your subathon </garnt>
<garnt> where you slept on stream? </garnt>
<garnt> - I muted the mic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you muted the mic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just in case I was fighting that dragon </garnt>
<connor> that can only be defeated by racism. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I only ask </joey>
<garnt> because Ahki has recently
started sleep talking a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm concerned because, </garnt>
<garnt> by sleep talk, she
randomly shouts out phrases </garnt>
<garnt> that just don't make sense </garnt>
<joey> when you think about it
in a sequential manner. </joey>
<joey> Ahki is the kind of person </joey>
<joey> who, literally, head touches the pillow, </joey>
<joey> three seconds later she's snoring. </joey>
<joey> Instantly like that, which
I'm so fucking jealous of. </joey>
<joey> But then, now it's gotten to the point, </joey>
<joey> where three seconds after
the head hit's the pillow, </joey>
<connor> start snoring, five seconds
later she says a random thing. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, The first time she did it, </connor>
<connor> I thought she was joking, </connor>
<connor> because it happened in
the spa of 10 seconds. </connor>
<connor> So I just started laughing. </connor>
<connor> I remember her, </connor>
<joey> She's like, "All right. Good night.", </joey>
<joey> goes to sleep, starts snoring,
and then she just goes, </joey>
<joey> "legs"
(laughing) </joey>
<connor> I was like," What the fuck was that?" </connor>
<connor> - Maybe she was in one of Garnt's dreams, </connor>
<connor> she's reading the title card.
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Chapter 3. Legs.
- Chapter 3. Legs. </joey>
<joey> - And then I started laughing, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Come on,
sweety. What are you doing?" </joey>
<joey> But she continues to snore. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Wait. Are you serious?" </joey>
<joey> And then she goes, "butt fries" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And so I had to shake her awake. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Are you
fucking with me right now?" </joey>
<joey> And she wakes up and she's
like, "What time is it?" </joey>
<joey> I was like, "It's been 20
seconds. What are you on?" </joey>
<joey> Because in her head it's
like an hour has passed </joey>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<connor> - Again, whenever I sleep, </connor>
<connor> I always know how much time
has passed when I wake up. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand how. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Sydney has a lot of
nightmares when she sleeps. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know when she's
going through a nightmare </garnt>
<garnt> because she's just in panic mode. </garnt>
<garnt> I can tell when she's running
away from a fucking monster, </garnt>
<garnt> because she's just, (breaths rapidly) </garnt>
<garnt> like that.
- Too much NTR. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I have to wake her up and be like, </connor>
<joey> "You were in a nightmare, honey. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry. Don't worry. </joey>
<joey> You're in the safe zone. </joey>
<joey> I'm here. I'm here." </joey>
<joey> - Is she like when a dog
has a dream of running </joey>
<joey> and they just start kicking their legs? </joey>
<joey> - Yes.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's so obvious. </joey>
<joey> It's so obvious. </joey>
<joey> Not only when Syndey is dreaming, </joey>
<joey> but the type of dreams she's having. </joey>
<joey> Because she won't say words
but she'll make noises, </joey>
<joey> depending on the type
of mood that she's in. </joey>
<joey> So if she's having a nightmare,
which is most of the time, </joey>
<joey> she'll start panicking. </joey>
<joey> She'll have a panic attack in her dreams </joey>
<joey> and all this kind of shit. </joey>
<joey> When she's happy she'll just laugh </joey>
<joey> and just smile at all this shit. </joey>
<joey> It's so obvious to say, </joey>
<joey> sometimes I see her </joey>
<garnt> and she just as the
biggest smile on her face, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I wish I
was you right now, Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you're having
a fun dream right now." </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know why seeing someone </joey>
<garnt> with a huge fucking grin as they sleep </garnt>
<joey> is the creepiest ever. </joey>
<joey> Could you just imagine
walking into the room </joey>
<joey> and someones just as they sleep? </joey>
<joey> - That's really creepy.
- That's so creepy. </joey>
<joey> - I completely forgot. </joey>
<joey> I don't scream, sometimes I
physically laugh myself awake. </joey>
<joey> Something really funny happens </joey>
<joey> or someone said a really funny joke, </joey>
<garnt> and I actually physically laugh. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, "Oh. I was dreaming" </garnt>
<connor> - Now that you mention it, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've ever had funny dreams. </connor>
<joey> - I've never had a funny dream either. </joey>
<joey> - You've never had funny dreams? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- No, wow. </joey>
<joey> That's so strange. Now
that you've mentioned that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm depressed, even in my dreams. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's always something
fucking extreme in my dreams. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. I've never had funny dreams </garnt>
<garnt> where I guess I'm in a deep sleep, </garnt>
<connor> but most of the times. </connor>
<connor> Have you ever had a micro dream? </connor>
<joey> It's when you're really, really tired, </joey>
<joey> and you're not completely, </joey>
<connor> It's so weird to describe </connor>
<connor> because you don't feel like
you're completely asleep </connor>
<connor> but then you start
hallucinating some shit. </connor>
<connor> - Like a day dream? </connor>
<garnt> - No. Not like a day dream. </garnt>
<garnt> What does a day dream count to you? </garnt>
<garnt> Count for you? </garnt>
<joey> - Day dream is just, you're
just bored, sitting there </joey>
<joey> and you just start imagining some shit. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> So you're actually,
really physically tired </garnt>
<garnt> and you start going to sleep. </garnt>
<connor> You're not completely in a deep sleep </connor>
<connor> but you still start dreaming as well. </connor>
<connor> So it's half, </connor>
<connor> I would say it's like half a lucid dream </connor>
<connor> because it's so easy. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes I wake myself up by falling over </joey>
<joey> and you get the fucking jerk, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </joey>
<joey> - The Inception method. </joey>
<connor> - The Inception method. </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, "For fuck's sake. </connor>
<joey> I was so, I was so close to being asleep </joey>
<joey> and then I had to jerk myself awake. </joey>
<joey> And then sometimes someone
says something funny </joey>
<joey> in that brief, micro dream
and I laugh myself awake. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "For fuck's sake.
I was so close to sleeping. </garnt>
<garnt> I was so close to actually being asleep." </garnt>
<joey> - I want to be there
when you experience that. </joey>
<joey> Just to see how fucking weird
it is from my perspective. </joey>
<joey> Just Garnt just sitting
there and just, (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> "Oh." </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen Garnt do this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - I very rarely micro dream. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, it's really weird. </joey>
<joey> You must have had the dream
where you jerk yourself awake. </joey>
<joey> Have you ever had that? </joey>
<joey> - You could've phrase that better. </joey>
<joey> - Why are you saying it like that? </joey>
<joey> - You could have phrased that better. </joey>
<joey> - Your body literally jerks </joey>
<joey> because you hallucinated that you're, </joey>
<connor> Is there another word I could use? </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's the best,
- Jolt. </connor>
<connor> - Jolt?
- Jolt. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Jolt yourself awake. </connor>
<joey> - "Did you jerk yourself awake?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. "Did you jerk your, </joey>
<joey> Oh, thank God. You're awake." </joey>
<joey> - "Oh, I'm back, baby. </joey>
<joey> I'm back."
- Oh, thank God. </joey>
<garnt> - Jolt. I've never used the word jolt. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going to wake up, aah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think I've
ever used the word jolt. </connor>
<connor> - We need some synonyms
for jerk right now. </connor>
<joey> - I've had those stereotypical,
on the train times, </joey>
<joey> where you're just closing your eyes </joey>
<joey> because it's a long rain ride. </joey>
<joey> And you have that thing
where you fall forward </joey>
<joey> and you're just like that. </joey>
<garnt> Is that what you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> I'm talking about where you literally- </joey>
<joey> - Or you're literally in the dream? </joey>
<joey> - You're literally in half a dream </joey>
<garnt> and then you imagine falling
over or tripping over. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that happens a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I do that. </garnt>
<connor> I kick my leg out or something. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I'm talking about. </connor>
<connor> But instead of imagining that I'm falling, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I imagine someone
saying something funny </connor>
<connor> or something funny happening
and then I just laugh. </connor>
<joey> - So it's an emotional joke. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. It's like an emotional joke. </garnt>
<joey> - No I don't have that.
I don't have that at all. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you imagine
a ball flying towards you </joey>
<connor> and then you jerk yourself awake as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. That's happened a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - That's happened a lot
in my dream as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird </garnt>
<connor> because sometimes I won't
be dreaming of anything </connor>
<garnt> and then it will very quickly cut </garnt>
<garnt> to a ball being thrown at me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand why that happens. </garnt>
<garnt> - Think fast. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll literally not be in a dream, </connor>
<connor> not a dream, not a dream. </connor>
<connor> And then something just
flies at me and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> And then I just fall back to sleep. </connor>
<connor> It's not like I'm full awake. </connor>
<connor> - No. That's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> It's a micro dream where
you're not fully asleep </connor>
<garnt> but you're not fully awake. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you brains just
like, "Haha, think fast." </garnt>
<garnt> Think fast, mother fucker. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. </joey>
<connor> You're fine. </connor>
<connor> Go back to bed. Go back to bed. </connor>
<joey> You all right. </joey>
<joey> - Like sleep walking.
- It's just a prank. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever met
anyone who sleep walks, </joey>
<joey> ever sleep walk yourself? </joey>
<joey> - No. No. </joey>
<joey> - My uncle, apparently, used
to be a really, really bad </joey>
<joey> sleep walker and sleep talker. </joey>
<connor> My dad would tell me
stories of how my uncle, </connor>
<connor> because they used to sleep in a bunk bed. </connor>
<connor> - So bizarre, isn't it?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's such a crazy thing.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then he'd just,
there was one time where, </connor>
<connor> Actually, no. </connor>
<connor> I have a story of when
I sleep walked once. </connor>
<connor> The only time, apparently,
that I ever sleep walked, </connor>
<connor> was when I was little. </connor>
<connor> I was maybe four, five years old, </connor>
<connor> and apparently I walked
into my parents room </connor>
<connor> and I was asleep. </connor>
<connor> And my mum saw it. </connor>
<connor> She was like, "What the
fuck are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> And the she realized
that my eyes were closed. </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Oh,
fuck. He's sleep walking. </connor>
<connor> I was saying something to her
but it wasn't really words. </connor>
<connor> It was just like, (babbles) </connor>
<connor> - "Wake up, you dumb fuck." </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> The moment she went,
"Wake up, you dumb fuck.", </joey>
<joey> was when I walked over to
the corner of their room </joey>
<joey> and there was a washing basket, </joey>
<joey> and apparently I pulled my
pants and tried to pee into it. </joey>
<connor> - No. That's so weird. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - And then my mom was like, (exclaims) </joey>
<connor> - I have a worryingly
similar story. Not of me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's so crazy. </connor>
<connor> So my little brother had a sleep over </connor>
<connor> with one of his friends. </connor>
<connor> And I was the one who was, </connor>
<connor> I'd stay out awake a little
longer than I should have. </connor>
<connor> I played on my Game Boy, whatever. </connor>
<connor> And our house, the floorboards
creek really fucking loudly. </connor>
<connor> And obviously I've been
in this house for years, </connor>
<connor> so I could tell, based off what creek, </connor>
<connor> where someone was in the house </connor>
<connor> and where they were coming from. </connor>
<connor> And what point they were on the stairs, </connor>
<joey> what point they were </joey>
<joey> like some kind of fucking Dare Devil shit, </joey>
<joey> except only for my house. </joey>
<joey> So I heard someone who kept walking </joey>
<joey> to the middle top of the stairs </joey>
<connor> and then back to my little brother's room, </connor>
<connor> and then back to the stairs, </connor>
<connor> and then back to my little
brother's room really slowly. </connor>
<connor> And then after this
happened twice, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> So I went and I watched, </connor>
<connor> and he just walked to
the top of the stairs, </connor>
<connor> mumbled something and then went back. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> And then he went to the top of the stairs, </connor>
<joey> and this is where I was getting worried </joey>
<joey> because I'm like, "What if
he just like falls down?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's dangerous. </joey>
<connor> - So he just starts walking
down the stairs really slowly, </connor>
<connor> and this is where I was
like, "What do I do?" </connor>
<connor> Because I didn't know
what you're supposed to do </connor>
<connor> when someones sleep walking. </connor>
<connor> I've heard loads of,
you've heard myths like, </connor>
<connor> " IF you wake them up they
can die.", or something. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "It seems
like he's doing it okay." </connor>
<connor> I didn't want to wake him up
because what If he wakes up </connor>
<connor> be like, </connor>
<joey> I would. </joey>
<joey> I'd jump. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Think fast." </joey>
<connor> - "Haa. You're awake" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, " Shit. What do I do?" </connor>
<connor> So I see that he starts
walking down the stairs </connor>
<joey> but doing this thing where
he's going back and forth, </joey>
<joey> so I'm like, "Guh." </joey>
<joey> And I saw that he was mumbling, </joey>
<joey> so was like, " I think
he's sleep walking." </joey>
<joey> So I go, I follow him, </joey>
<joey> and he's going down the
stairs really slowly, </joey>
<joey> and he gets to the bottom of the stairs, </joey>
<joey> and so I go to the bottom of the stairs </joey>
<joey> and then he opens the
door to the living room </joey>
<joey> and just goes in the living room. </joey>
<joey> This is like the fucking, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, this was a horror film. </joey>
<joey> He stood there, pitch black </joey>
<joey> because I didn't turn the lights on. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> It's so scary. </joey>
<joey> - All I had was my Game Boy SP Advanced, </joey>
<joey> so I light the thing.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I didn't want to turn the lights on </joey>
<joey> because I didn't want to- </joey>
<connor> - Think Phasmaphobia. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, the shitty
max brightness slider up, </connor>
<connor> trying to figure out what's
going on and I see him. </connor>
<connor> And he's just standing there mumbling </connor>
<connor> for a good 10, 20 seconds. </connor>
<connor> And I'm freaking out </connor>
<connor> because I'm like, "What do I do?" </connor>
<connor> Do I go and wake my little brother up, </connor>
<connor> do I go tell my parents? </connor>
<connor> Because I don't know
what he's going to do. </connor>
<connor> So I was just watching him, making sure. </connor>
<connor> Bare in mind, I was 14, 15. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know what the fuck was going on. </connor>
<connor> And so he's standing there in
the middle of this living room </connor>
<connor> and then just slowly starts
walking towards the T.V </connor>
<connor> and then walking back to where he was. </connor>
<garnt> And then he walks to the T.V, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's my video games
all there in one of those old, </garnt>
<garnt> 2000's metal racks where
you just slide it in. </garnt>
<connor> And then he just starts
pulling down his pants </connor>
<connor> and then I was like, "No, no, no, no." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Not on my games"
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> And that's where I woke
him up and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no, no, no." </connor>
<connor> And then he woke up was
and was like, (babbles). </connor>
<connor> Like that. It was really weird. </connor>
<garnt> - How did he react to you just standing- </garnt>
<connor> - He acted like I was the weirdo. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I remember that. </connor>
<connor> I remember being like,
"What are you, What?" </connor>
<connor> He reacted like I was being
weird because I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Stop. Stop.", shaking him. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I was exactly the same as well. </joey>
<joey> My parents were like, "What
the fuck are you doing?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What do you
mean what the fuck am I doing?" </joey>
<joey> And then I looked down
and my pants were down, </joey>
<connor> and I was like, "Oh.
Okay that makes sense." </connor>
<joey> - He hadn't gotten them
down but he was undoing them </joey>
<connor> And that's where I was like, </connor>
<joey> "You're not pissing on
my fucking PS2 games." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. My pants were fully down. </joey>
<joey> My hand was on my dick
and I was ready to go </joey>
<joey> on this full basket of laundry. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Oh." </connor>
<joey> - So when you woke up, </joey>
<joey> did you momentarily think
they were the weirdos? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Okay. See? </joey>
<connor> That's what... </connor>
<joey> - Because I looked over and my
mum was, really worried look </joey>
<joey> and shaking me.
- That's what I got. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, "What's the problem?" </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even really know this kid. </connor>
<connor> I barely knew him so I
was, we never really, </connor>
<connor> Whenever I saw him, it was
always awkward after that </connor>
<connor> because he just always
remembered that time </connor>
<connor> where he woke up, and I
was like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<garnt> - Well, he almost pissed on your games. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> He nearly pissed on my PS2 collection. </connor>
<connor> My Wii, probably, I
don't know what it was. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Did you ever get to the point </connor>
<garnt> where there's something
happening in the real world, </garnt>
<garnt> where you hear a sound or something, </garnt>
<garnt> or you need to go to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> and it gets integrated into
your dream for a good while? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, Maybe, but
I probably don't remember. </joey>
<garnt> - The most annoying thing for me is, </garnt>
<garnt> is when I need to go to
the toilet in my dream </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't immediately
wake up when I go to the toilet </garnt>
<connor> or when I need to go to the toilet, </connor>
<connor> but luckily my brain has a disconnect </connor>
<joey> between my body and my brain </joey>
<joey> because there has been several times </joey>
<connor> where I really, really needed-
- I'd shit the bed. </connor>
<connor> - There's been several times </connor>
<connor> where I really, really needed to piss. </connor>
<connor> In my dream, I don't know I'm dreaming </connor>
<connor> but I acknowledge the fact </connor>
<connor> that I really, really need to piss. </connor>
<connor> So I've had several five
minute pisses in my dreams </connor>
<connor> and the feeling of the
piss just won't go away </connor>
<connor> because obviously I'm
only pissing in my dream </connor>
<connor> and not in real life. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm urinating and I get
so frustrated in my dream </garnt>
<connor> because no matter how much I urinate, </connor>
<garnt> the feeling of needing to
urinate never goes away. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's really weird. </garnt>
<connor> - If I feel something, if
I piss myself in my dream, </connor>
<joey> I'm pissing myself really. </joey>
<joey> That's 100% happening. </joey>
<connor> - I almost shit myself doing that once. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Hold up. Hold up. </connor>
<connor> First of all, let me ask
another few questions. </connor>
<connor> How can you replicate
the feeling of pissing </connor>
<connor> so accurately in a dream? </connor>
<joey> To me, that's weird.
- Without actually pissing </joey>
<connor> in real life. </connor>
<connor> - I can't replicate feelings. </connor>
<connor> I know that it's not
accurate in the dream. </connor>
<connor> Does that make sense? </connor>
<connor> When I get punched in a dream, </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't feel like a real punch. </garnt>
<garnt> I can distinguish between that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay no. </garnt>
<garnt> For me it feels real.
- You must be on some </garnt>
<connor> Inception, fifth level dream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I'm not getting this shit. </connor>
<connor> What are you experiencing?
- We're still on level one. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sad that I'm like, "So what?" </connor>
<connor> - I'm like five level deep,
- Holy shit, bro. </connor>
<connor> - Five levels deep </connor>
<connor> and I'm in front of this urinal, pissing, </connor>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Why is the feeling
urinating not going away?" </joey>
<joey> - Holy shit. You're on some other level. </joey>
<joey> - Is there an establishment
shot of the toilet as well </joey>
<joey> before you start? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - You're at level 10 dreaming. </connor>
<connor> I'm at level two. </connor>
<garnt> This is insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> At some point in the dream, </garnt>
<connor> I just give up on trying to
get rid of this urination. </connor>
<connor> I go on with the dream and
then I wake up and being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh. </connor>
<connor> That's why I needed to
piss, because it was a dream </connor>
<connor> and I need to piss in real life. </connor>
<connor> - And you hadn't pissed your pants? </connor>
<joey> - No. I hadn't pissed my pants. </joey>
<joey> And I had the most
satisfying piss in my life </joey>
<garnt> when that happens. </garnt>
<joey> - Because, for me, every
time I've had a dream, </joey>
<joey> when I was a kid, of going to the toilet, </joey>
<joey> I have 100% pissed my pants.
(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I wake up and I'm just like, "Oh, fuck". </joey>
<connor> - I love the confidence. </connor>
<joey> I'm doing it. 100% </joey>
<joey> - And because of that, one
time I almost shit myself </joey>
<connor> when I was asleep.
- And he's 24. </connor>
<connor> - Here's the problem of </connor>
<connor> growing up with a bidet your whole life </connor>
<connor> and with a heated toilet seat, </connor>
<joey> is the fact that, as a kid, </joey>
<joey> you're just ingrained into your head of, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, my butt is warm?
I'm sitting on a toilet." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> so in my dream I'm on the toilet </joey>
<joey> and can feel that my butt is warm </joey>
<joey> because it's a heated toilet seat. </joey>
<joey> So in my head I'm like, "Oh, butt warm. </joey>
<joey> I'm on a toilet. This is reality. </joey>
<joey> I'm actually going to take a shit. </joey>
<joey> And so in my dream, </joey>
<connor> I remember I almost start taking shit </connor>
<connor> but then I was like,
"Something's not right. </connor>
<connor> Why can I not shit right now?" </connor>
<connor> I had the feeling that I
needed to shit but I couldn't. </connor>
<joey> Nothing was coming out. </joey>
<joey> And it wasn't a
constipation type of thing. </joey>
<connor> It was literally I know I need to shit </connor>
<connor> but nothing's coming out. </connor>
<garnt> - How come we always talk about shit? </garnt>
<joey> - And then I woke up </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh, now
I actually need to shit." </joey>
<joey> I was prairie dogging. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, God. </joey>
<joey> I was this close to
shitting myself in my bed. </joey>
<joey> - That's so strange. </joey>
<connor> In my dream I'm able to
communicate to my non-dream brain </connor>
<joey> being like , "Oh, you need to piss." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. I'm not like that. </joey>
<connor> - So I can stop the
dream if I need to pee. </connor>
<garnt> I can control that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. There's been so many instances </garnt>
<garnt> where I know I'm in a
dream, I'm in a nightmare. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. It's every time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in a nightmare. I
know I'm in a nightmare. </garnt>
<joey> I can't wake up. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Garnt, wake
up now. Please wake up." </joey>
<joey> - I remember one time I was getting chased </joey>
<joey> by this murderer or someone like that. </joey>
<joey> It was like a scene out of, </joey>
<connor> What's that Jack Nicholson film? </connor>
<connor> The Shining. </connor>
<connor> It was like the scene out of The Shining, </connor>
<connor> where I'm getting chased
by fucking Jack Nicholson </connor>
<connor> or something and I knew
I was in a nightmare, </connor>
<garnt> I just didn't want to
experience dying in the dream </garnt>
<garnt> because it still felt real.
- Yeah. Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, "Garnt, wake up." </garnt>
<garnt> Nothing happens. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Garnt, I know
you're dreaming right now, </garnt>
<garnt> I know you're fucking dreaming, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking murderer goes around the corner, </garnt>
<garnt> start fucking legging it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Garnt, I know
you're dreaming right now. </garnt>
<joey> Wake up" </joey>
<joey> And my body refused to
wake up until I died. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why my
brain is such an asshole </joey>
<joey> that I can't wake myself up. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Nah. You
want to experience this. </joey>
<garnt> - But I think I can only force, </garnt>
<joey> I choose to wake up when
I need to pee or shit. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Okay.
- Oh, I can't even do that. </joey>
<connor> - In the dream, I'll feel it. </connor>
<joey> I know that when I'm
experiencing this dream, </joey>
<joey> that I can feel this urge.
- Sensation, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I know that I need to do it. </connor>
<connor> I won't stop the dream
unless I get to a point </connor>
<connor> where it feels uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> and then I think I'll just
be like, (exhales sharply) </connor>
<connor> - Damn. You're on 5G, I'm on dial up. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's so strange.
- "You need to piss. </connor>
<connor> You need to piss." </connor>
<joey> And my brains like, "All right. Hold on </joey>
<joey> Sending the morse code right now. </joey>
<joey> It's going to take a while." </joey>
<connor> - Weird, man. </connor>
<connor> I wonder.
- And then it's too late. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure people in the comments
have even weirder dreams. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm curious now </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't think I've
ever had such an in depth talk </garnt>
<connor> about my dreams before.
- I've never spoken </connor>
<connor> about my dreams before. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even know it was, </connor>
<garnt> I thought it was normal that
you knew you were in a dream. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that was normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a lucid dream. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why they call it a lucid dream. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not for you. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like everyone had that. </connor>
<joey> Because that's mainly the one I have. </joey>
<joey> - I've tried using methods to lucid dream </joey>
<joey> because there's tutorials on,
"Here's how to lucid dream." </joey>
<joey> One of them was like, "Cut
a ping pong ball in half </joey>
<joey> and put them on your eyelids. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> - So people want to lucid dream? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Why? </connor>
<garnt> - Because they want to
control their dreams. </garnt>
<joey> They want to do whatever
they want in their dream. </joey>
<joey> - Because most people when
they now they're in a dream </joey>
<joey> can control their dream. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I have no, 99 times out of 100, </joey>
<garnt> I have no control of my dreams. </garnt>
<joey> - It's weird. When I have- </joey>
<joey> - Why would you want to
control your dream, though? </joey>
<connor> - So you can do whatever
the fuck you want. </connor>
<connor> - Just use you imagination. </connor>
<garnt> Just fucking do it normally. </garnt>
<garnt> Do it awake.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No. I can't fly in my dreams. </garnt>
<joey> I can't fucking </joey>
<joey> run at a million miles an hour. </joey>
<joey> - I can if my brain forces
me to experience it. </joey>
<connor> But I can't just be like, </connor>
<connor> I can't just be like, "All right. </connor>
<joey> Tonight I'm going to dream
about fucking 100 bitches. </joey>
<connor> I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - Doesn't that take away
the excitement of dreams </connor>
<connor> if you choose what you're doing? </connor>
<garnt> - No. It just means, </garnt>
<garnt> like I said, it's literally, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like playing GTA with cheats on. </garnt>
<connor> Where you just have fun. </connor>
<connor> To me, it's just having
fun in this open world. </connor>
<connor> At that point people are NPCs, </connor>
<connor> when I realize that this is
a dream and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Haha. I can do whatever I want. </connor>
<connor> I can fly to a different city. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I can jack cars." </connor>
<connor> Its fucking great. I have so much fun. </connor>
<joey> - Weird. </joey>
<joey> - I would be interested </joey>
<joey> in someone psycho analyzing our dreams. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Honestly. </joey>
<joey> - Because we all, obviously, </joey>
<joey> have three different
perspectives on how we dream </joey>
<connor> and the experiences we have when we dream. </connor>
<connor> - It's so bizarre.
- This has been </connor>
<garnt> a very bizarre episode of "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<connor> - Dreamologists out there,
is that what they're called? </connor>
<joey> - Dreamologists. </joey>
<connor> - Sounds like a Disney job. </connor>
<garnt> - Dreamologist?
- Dreamologist? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> What are your experience with dreams? </connor>
<connor> Do you relate to us? </connor>
<connor> Do you have something entirely different? </connor>
<connor> Let us know because I, Genuinely I- </connor>
<connor> - Joey or Kahn? </connor>
<connor> Garnt.
- Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Connor, Joey or Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Genuinely because I've
never heard of anyone, really, </connor>
<connor> talking about their dreams in depth. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Strange. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. This is a first
time for me as well. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. Weird. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what isn't weird though? </garnt>
<joey> Our Patreons.
- Hell yeah, they're not. </joey>
<garnt> - I bet they have awesome dreams. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing)
- Hell yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - They can control their dreams </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> just like you can control yourself </connor>

<connor> Like the fucking wacky
fucking dreams that we've had. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> it's going to be the wildest
week in the subreddit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But that's been this dream
filled episode of trash taste. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't worry. This wasn't a dream. </connor>
<garnt> - This entire episode has felt
like a fucking fever dream. </garnt>
<connor> That's how this episode started, actually. </connor>
<garnt> Talking about fever dreams. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm going to wake
myself up from this dream. </connor>
<garnt> Sorry, I need to piss. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. Have a good one, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Bye.
- Bye. </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle RnB music) </garnt>
