<joey> - What's up you delicious
dickheads, sorry? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) Welcome back to another episode </joey>
<joey> of "Trash Taste" podcast.
- What was that? </joey>
<joey> You said, you delicious dickheads? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why those
are the first two words, </joey>
<joey> I came up with. </joey>
<joey> - Why is this episode demonetized, Joey? </joey>
<connor> Why, why? </connor>
<joey> (soft music) </joey>
<joey> - No, please, it was just
a greeting YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> it's nothing special, but
welcome to "Trash Taste" podcast. </joey>
<joey> - He's Australian. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- This is what you expect. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, you can't expect
me to say nice things, okay? </connor>
<connor> But, I'm a host for the day, </connor>
<joey> the Australian boy- - He
just spilled water. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He just spilled water all over himself, </joey>
<joey> during my fucking intro. </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry, I'm just
pissing myself right now. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm here with the boy
who pissed his pants, </joey>
<joey> and the boy who shits his pants. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's me, that's me. </connor>
<joey> People are gonna be
like, is there a story? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, no, there's a story. </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna start that off? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Guess we're starting strong then. </joey>
<joey> Hey I shit myself. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Am kidding, I didn't, but I did. </connor>
<garnt> - You had a full week
of shitting yourself. </garnt>
<connor> Since last week apparently.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm still shitting myself. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So, after the podcast, </joey>
<joey> we went to Izakaya, </joey>
<joey> which we'll talk more about later. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And we had liver and- </joey>
<joey> - Well, you and our producer did. </joey>
<joey> - Only me and Meilyne had liver. </joey>
<connor> And, Meilyne, didn't tell me, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Is anyone else sick?" </connor>
<connor> And, Meilyne, was like, "No, no, nobody." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then five days later- </connor>
<connor> - Meanwhile she's like (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - Then five days later, she was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah, I was sick by the way, </connor>
<connor> I just didn't wanna think that you... </connor>
<connor> I gave you COVID or something." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck, telling me you're sick." </connor>
<garnt> - Way to go, Meilyne, thanks a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you so much. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you for endangering your hosts. </connor>
<joey> - So, I'm pretty sure it was like that, </joey>
<joey> that got me food poisoning. </joey>
<connor> Got the food poisoning-
- Because, Garnt, </connor>
<joey> and I didn't have the liver. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember you messaging us, being like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, is anyone feeling tired?" </joey>
<joey> And, Joey, said, he's feeling fine. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Yeah, I'm might
be feeling pretty fatigued. </joey>
<joey> Maybe we've just done a lot. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't realize, Connor, was
just dying in the next room. </garnt>
<connor> - So, the day after, I
remember I had a call, </connor>
<joey> at 10 am, and I was fine, </joey>
<joey> and then I got a bunch
of Jojo Merch shipped. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Cool, great, I opened it. </joey>
<garnt> - Day in the life of Connor. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right.
- So, like Jojo merch came in, </connor>
<connor> very normal day for me, </connor>
<joey> and then after I opened it, put it down, </joey>
<joey> I was like, fucking, holy shit, I'm tired. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm weak.
- ]Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Oh, my God." </joey>
<joey> And then later on in the day I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, I'll order a curry." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know... </connor>
<connor> - That's a good idea. </connor>
<connor> - I have no idea why I thought a curry, </connor>
<joey> was the best idea, and I ordered a lot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And I also ate a lot of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I had a whole naan, </joey>
<joey> like shit tons of rice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Real fucking spicy curry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Sides, as well, </connor>
<connor> for some reason I went all out. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, what
my body needs is energy. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- That's what it needs. </joey>
<joey> - And the best way to get energy, curry. </joey>
<joey> - Dirtiest, dirty curry. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Dirty curry. </joey>
<joey> - So, and then I was like,
okay, I feel a little better, </joey>
<joey> like from the first five minutes, </joey>
<joey> and immediately after I was
like, "Oh no, I'm in pain." </joey>
<connor> My stomach started really hurting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I was like fuck. </connor>
<connor> And then this whole time, I'm thinking, </connor>
<connor> do I have COVID, do I have COVID? </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's the first thing that goes </joey>
<joey> over anyone's mind. </joey>
<joey> - Right now, yeah- </joey>
<joey> - Who gets ill right now. </joey>
<joey> Like sometimes I have like a slight fever. </joey>
<connor> I'm like shit, shit, shit. </connor>
<connor> - I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. </connor>
<garnt> - I cough in public, bro I've got it. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm dead, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's gonna think I have COVID. </joey>
<joey> - No, I was especially worried with you. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you texted me being like, </joey>
<joey> bro, I almost fucking fainted. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so that night, </connor>
<joey> I texted you that the next day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the night of, I was
like curled up in a ball </joey>
<joey> in my bed, boiling, but like shivering. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Sweating nonstop, my
bed was damp as fuck, </joey>
<joey> when I woke up, disgusting,
I know, I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> And then I had a horrible, horrible fever, </joey>
<joey> couldn't get out of bed, </joey>
<joey> I had such bad stomach pain at night, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, all right,
I gotta vomit (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Alex] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I vomited and I
was like, great, I feel good. </joey>
<joey> And then I sleep for one hour, </joey>
<joey> and then I gotta vomit again. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I'm shitting myself all day. </joey>
<joey> I'm dying, I can't get off the floor, </joey>
<joey> I like nearly fainted, and
then like an hour later, </joey>
<joey> I fainted, and I was like,
oh my God, all right, </joey>
<joey> I gotta go to hospital, </joey>
<joey> 'cause what if this is like COVID, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, there's like a hospital
right next to our house, </joey>
<joey> which was lucky. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a five minute walk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I had a friend call them up, </joey>
<garnt> and see if they could let me in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they were like,
yeah, sure, come on down. </garnt>
<connor> And so they were like,
yeah, come through the back. </connor>
<connor> - Come on down!
- Come on down! </connor>
<connor> - They were like, yeah, man, </connor>
<connor> just bring that insurance. </connor>
<connor> Bring that big old insurance
card, and just come on down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then I went there, </connor>
<connor> and they were like
someone like, (indictinct) </connor>
<connor> or something was gonna greet me. </connor>
<connor> And someone comes out in
a fucking hazmat suit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he was like, Connor san? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, yeah, yeah, hi. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> And they bring me in, they
lock me in this room alone, </joey>
<joey> 'cause obviously they
think I might have COVID, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I had COVID symptoms. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then they're like
(speaks in foreign language) </joey>
<joey> and I was like, (speaks
in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> And then they were like, "Oh, okay, okay." </joey>
<joey> So, then they bring a
nurse in who can speak, </joey>
<joey> pretty broken English, but good enough. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they would, luckily, </joey>
<connor> there's one doctor in this building, </connor>
<connor> that could speak semi decent English. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So, he came in, </connor>
<connor> he was like, "You have COVID symptoms. </connor>
<connor> So we give you test." </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh,
cool, cool, yeah, sure." </joey>
<connor> And then he's like, "I will
put this in your nose." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Okay." </connor>
<connor> And then he just fucking grabs
my head like this, right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like from a distance.
- Come here! </connor>
<connor> - From a fucking distance, grabs my head, </connor>
<connor> and shoves this thing
in, and I'm like, ah! </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's quite long. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's like this big, right? </connor>
<connor> It's fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> And then he puts it in, and
then he puts it in a little bit, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Okay, this is fine." </connor>
<joey> Then he's like (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> You know how like when they
put the sword in the stomach, </joey>
<joey> and put it in a little bit, </joey>
<connor> and then fucking turn it in? </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's how
they used to give lobotomies. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, that's what I was thinking. </garnt>
<garnt> They push it in, and then they
start drilling away, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he was like doing that </garnt>
<connor> and then he fucking shoved it in. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, ah! </connor>
<connor> I was like, (speaks in foreign language). </connor>
<connor> And then the nurse was laughing at me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'm like, all right. </joey>
<connor> - It's like you knew this champ. </connor>
<joey> - Bear in mind, in this whole time, </joey>
<joey> I have no idea what's really happening. </joey>
<joey> And they sent me to do a bunch
of other tests and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and I feel like a lab rat. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just like in this room,
I don't know what's happening, </connor>
<connor> and then they're like, sure, okay. </connor>
<connor> And then immediately after that I'm like, </connor>
<connor> (speaks in foreign language). </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> And then they're like laughing, </connor>
<connor> 'cause obviously I have
like very selective words, </connor>
<connor> that I can choose from.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know the actual words, </connor>
<connor> so I'm tryna pick the closest word, </connor>
<connor> to describe what's happening. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like how many times... </garnt>
<garnt> How many ways, can I use the word </garnt>
<connor> (speaks in foreign language)? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (foreign language) </connor>
<connor> And then she's like, </connor>
<connor> and then she immediately, after, right, </connor>
<connor> when I'm like this, right? </connor>
<connor> She grabs my arm, starts putting
the blood thing around me, </connor>
<connor> and starts tightening it, </connor>
<joey> I literally was like </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm still, I'm faint. </joey>
<joey> I'm already feeling
feverish, I'm fainting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna faint, </joey>
<joey> please, you just shoved
this thing in my mouth. </joey>
<connor> I'm dying, I literally said, </connor>
<connor> (speaks in foreign language). </connor>
<connor> Again, she's giggling and
I'm like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just like sticks it
in, and I'm like, okay, </connor>
<joey> I got no say in this, and then
she's doing it, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language), </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't know how
to say I'm gonna faint. </joey>
<joey> But then she takes it out, </joey>
<joey> and she's like props me on the
bed, and I'm like, all right. </joey>
<joey> She's just like </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, okay, cool, cool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For the COVID results. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then she comes in the room, </joey>
<joey> and she looks at it, turns around, </joey>
<connor> and she's looking really happy, </connor>
<connor> she's like, "Oh, (speaks
in foreign language), </connor>
<connor> it's (foreign language)." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> No joke, she says, "Bad," and I'm... </joey>
<joey> And she's like, it's bad. </joey>
<connor> - You got it, son. </connor>
<connor> - It's bad.
- You did it. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like it's bad? </connor>
<connor> I'm like negative, positives? </connor>
<connor> She's like, "Oh, oh, negative" I'm like... </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Are you fucking kidding me? </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> Don't scare me like that. </connor>
<joey> - That is the most beautiful
Google translated conversation </joey>
<joey> I've ever seen. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just sitting there, the
whole 30 minutes thinking, </connor>
<connor> all right, if I have COVID, </connor>
<connor> I got to tell like, Joey,
and got to tell Garnt, </connor>
<connor> got to tell everyone I've
been in contact with, </connor>
<joey> I've got to tell them
everywhere I've been, </joey>
<joey> I've got to stay at home for two weeks, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, fuck, fuck, </joey>
<joey> like everything.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then when she said that to me, </connor>
<joey> I'm like fuck, oh no! </joey>
<joey> - It's bad. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's bad and then
luckily it was nothing, </connor>
<joey> and then they did more tests to me, </joey>
<connor> it was really fast though,
it was like two hours. </connor>
<connor> I didn't have to wait or anything. </connor>
<garnt> - As someone from the
UK, it's really weird, </garnt>
<connor> going to any other healthcare system, </connor>
<connor> and just being able to get your results, </connor>
<connor> and going and seeing
the doctor the same day. </connor>
<connor> - Having an x-ray on the day of, </connor>
<garnt> and getting the results on the day, </garnt>
<joey> that doesn't happen in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - I remember, I thought I broke my leg, </joey>
<joey> and they made me make an appointment </joey>
<joey> for like a week and a
half to get the x-ray. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - And I thought, what? </connor>
<connor> Bro my leg is like fucked now, </connor>
<connor> what do you mean- (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I need the x-ray now. </connor>
<connor> - What'd you expect me to do with this </connor>
<joey> for a whole week and a half, yeah? </joey>
<joey> - I guess, 'cause it's free, right? </joey>
<joey> Everyone gets it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- So, I mean, </joey>
<connor> I guess you can argue,
which is better, right? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you have to
pay for it here, right? </joey>
<connor> - You pay 1/3 right? </connor>
<joey> - It's very cheap. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I paid 1/3, and I
paid $77 for a COVID test, </joey>
<connor> a blood test and a CT, a CAT scan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Americans are probably
like losing their shit. </connor>
<connor> - They're like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Like a CT scan, for $77?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I got the breakdown, </connor>
<connor> and the COVID test was 600 yen so like $5. </connor>
<joey> - Like five bucks, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> It was like nothing. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember I had to
take Aki to the hospital once, </joey>
<joey> this was like a year ago. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think she squirted
shampoo directly into her eye. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And she was like, I can't see, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've gone blind. </garnt>
<joey> So I had to call up the hospital, </joey>
<joey> obviously get an ambulance
over and everything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the entire ride,
such an American mindset, </joey>
<joey> the entire ride to the
hospital she's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, this is gonna
be so expensive, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Like this thing is gonna be so..." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> We'll just fix your eye up, whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- We get to the hospital, </joey>
<joey> it's like 2:00 am.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We get to the hospital, </joey>
<joey> doctor does a quick little
check and she's like, </joey>
<connor> okay, you're all good,
you're not blind or anything, </connor>
<connor> it's just really red,
it's really burnt out. </connor>
<connor> we wash it out for you,
here, take some meds, </connor>
<connor> and you'll be all good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then in Japanese
hospitals, there's like a kiosk, </joey>
<joey> that you have to go to like pay for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right, so we go to the kiosk
with like this little receipt </joey>
<joey> and we're just like, oh my God, </joey>
<garnt> this is gonna be like couple
100 bucks at least, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause she's thinking in
the American mentality. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] American mentality.
- [Connor] Yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I had never really gone
to a Japanese hospital before. </garnt>
<connor> So I had no idea either, I was
like, oh shit it's the same? </connor>
<connor> as like, if she says it's
like a couple 100 bucks, </connor>
<garnt> then I guess I'm prepared
to spend a couple 100 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, it was like $12. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> And we looked at it and she's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Wait, ambulances are free?" </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Because in America you
have to pay like two, $300, </garnt>
<joey> to get a fucking ambulance. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I think it's more, </connor>
<joey> I think it's like 1,000 plus. </joey>
<connor> - It's something like that. </connor>
<joey> Like I've heard stories of like </joey>
<joey> a couple of my American friends, </joey>
<joey> who broke their arm for example, </joey>
<connor> and they're like call an Uber. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was because we're not
paying for a fucking ambulance. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So we're just gonna call an Uber, </joey>
<joey> with like your arm hanging off a thread. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's tragic 'cause,
I think I remember, </joey>
<joey> Aki wanted to get an allergy test, </joey>
<joey> in, not in Australia, sorry, in America, </joey>
<joey> and it was like $800. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Jesus.
- For an allergy test. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Here you'd pay like $10 </joey>
<garnt> for an allergy test. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And I guess in the UK, </joey>
<garnt> do you guys have free health care? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we have free health care. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think doctors won't give
you stuff like that there, </garnt>
<joey> unless they think you need it though. </joey>
<joey> Like, so it's kind of hard
to get stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, all right. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause in Australia, </joey>
<joey> you can go get an allergy
test whenever for free. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I've never done one I can't comment. </connor>
<garnt> - Some very specific
medicines you get for free, </garnt>
<garnt> others you kind of have to pay for, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like with UK, it's very specific </garnt>
<garnt> on what illness you have, </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes you have like
this really common illness, </garnt>
<garnt> they just tell you to just go home, </garnt>
<garnt> and sleep it off basically. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, UK doctors a lot of the time, </connor>
<connor> are very reluctant to like do anything. </connor>
<connor> I mean, at least the doctors I've had. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if you just go to a
general practitioner, right? </joey>
<joey> Like to get a checkup,
it's usually free, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Whereas the only other, </joey>
<garnt> I guess, experience I've
had with health care, </garnt>
<connor> outside of the UK is Thailand </connor>
<connor> and normally it's pretty, </connor>
<connor> it's about the same price as it is here, </connor>
<connor> in terms of medicine </connor>
<connor> and going to see the
doctors and everything, </connor>
<connor> and what I found is that doctors here, </connor>
<garnt> in Asia at least, are way
more willing to give off, </garnt>
<garnt> some kind of medicine for
whatever illness you have. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely.
- I guess there's an argument </connor>
<connor> to make that also could
be dangerous though, </connor>
<connor> just giving off medicine constantly. </connor>
<joey> I mean that's why there's
an opioid epidemic </joey>
<joey> right now in America. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Over prescribing. </joey>
<connor> But, I mean, healthcare is a loaded topic. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a loaded topic, </garnt>
<garnt> that I certainly do not know enough about, </garnt>
<garnt> to contribute to the conversation. </garnt>
<connor> - Either way, I had a good
time, my doctors were very nice, </connor>
<joey> except they scared the
shit out of me that was- </joey>
<joey> - Literally scared the shit out of you. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm still shitting.
- Several times. </connor>
<garnt> - Actually, and I think
that what's good is, </garnt>
<connor> there was a pharmacy
right around the corner </connor>
<connor> and they obviously knew I
couldn't speak Japanese, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I told them, I was like, </connor>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> And then they were, they made
me fill out a form in English, </joey>
<joey> and I was like fuck, how do I tell them, </joey>
<joey> I have this blood condition? </joey>
<joey> And so, I Googled the kanji for it, </joey>
<joey> and I like wrote this kanji,
which is fucking hard kanji, </joey>
<joey> there was like swishes, </joey>
<joey> when there's not lines,
straight lines, I'm like fuck! </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - There's a curve in this, damn it! </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And then I had to write this </joey>
<joey> and it must have looked like </joey>
<joey> a two-year-old wrote this kanji- </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I really wanna see
that now, just to see. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, whatever
the Kanji for hemophilia </joey>
<joey> is on the screen right now. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was, and so I gave it, </joey>
<joey> and I was like I made sure, I was like, </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language), </joey>
<joey> and they're like, </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> And then they gave me the medicine, </joey>
<joey> and then they gave me a
printed A4 paper in English </joey>
<joey> explaining what all the medicine was, </joey>
<joey> and why I should take it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh, wow, that's cool." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause normally in
Japan, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> oh, you don't speak Japanese? </connor>
<connor> - Good luck.
- Yeah, good luck. </connor>
<connor> - Well shit, I think
this medicine will work. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You might have a reaction to it. </joey>
<joey> - Riperoni, kid! </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like better find out. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like most American
medicine I can't take, </connor>
<connor> and I always find that out. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when I was a kid,
I didn't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> I was like, yeah, I'll take it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Is this a pill off a offer? </garnt>
<connor> What does it do? </connor>
<connor> - I'll give it a go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, when I was 12, I
was like, oh it's medicine? </connor>
<connor> Yeah I'll take it, like
it's good, it must be good. </connor>
<connor> And then when I got
older and I started like, </connor>
<connor> when someone told me,
you can't take ibuprofen </connor>
<connor> and my dad had been giving
me ibuprofen for five years. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like oh shit,
I could have like died. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I can't take ibuprofen, </connor>
<garnt> and there's so many drugs in America, </garnt>
<garnt> that contains stuff
that I just can't have. </garnt>
<connor> So, I can't have those generic ones. </connor>
<garnt> - As a kid, did you love
the taste of Calpol? </garnt>
<connor> I think that was American Calpol. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love calpol.
- Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - It's like an orange kind of thing? </connor>
<connor> - It's like there was an orange Calpol, </connor>
<garnt> and a black currant one as well. </garnt>
<joey> - The black currant- </joey>
<joey> - Was that like cough
medicine or something? </joey>
<garnt> - No it's kind of general cold medicine. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, just like general cold medicine, </joey>
<joey> but as a kid, it tasted
way to good for it-- </joey>
<garnt> - I used to love getting sick. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Every time I would have a sick day, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like mom, bring out the Calpol. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Cracking bottles. </connor>
<connor> - Get the top shelf, and get the Calpol. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you're only supposed
to take it like one spoonful, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes I just act like extra ill, </connor>
<joey> so I can be like, I think
I need another one mom. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause that shit tastes
too good to be a medicine. </garnt>
<joey> - We had something like that in Australia, </joey>
<joey> but it was cough syrup. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - And normally, </joey>
<joey> it's like strawberry
flavored cough syrup right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it still tastes like cough syrup. </connor>
<connor> It has the aftertaste of cough syrup. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But the initial thing is like </connor>
<connor> a goop of like strawberry
flavored, like jelly, basically. </connor>
<connor> So kids would just like fucking
downing shots of that shit. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Very safe. </connor>
<connor> - We were just like, please father. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I am sick. </joey>
<connor> (Joey coughs) </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<joey> - Turning kids into drug addicts. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, legit. </joey>
<joey> - Did you ever in school
wanna break an arm? </joey>
<connor> To be like everyone to care? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - No. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't that desperate for attention. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone would like write
on the kid's broken cast, </connor>
<connor> I was like, I want that, I want
everyone to write on my arm. </connor>
<connor> - Mom can I break my arm, please? </connor>
<connor> - I think whatever, if there is a God, </connor>
<joey> He knew I wanted to break something, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've never broken
a bone in my fucking life, </joey>
<connor> I've like done disgusting shit
that should've broke bones. </connor>
<joey> - There was a time where, </joey>
<connor> I would see the cast
thing and I'd be like, </connor>
<joey> that one's so cool. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, that's not what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> Like, I don't wanna break a bone, </joey>
<connor> but I'm saying that I wanna have like- </connor>
<connor> - I wanna have a cast, and I remember, </connor>
<connor> it was climbing a tree, and I fell off, </connor>
<connor> and I landed on my arm. </connor>
<connor> - So get a cast. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in the back of
my head I was like, yes! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> See, finally! </connor>
<connor> - I just worded it wrongly. </connor>
<connor> - But I wasn't like
willingly like all right, </connor>
<connor> let me find the closest tree. </connor>
<joey> - I was just like trying
to yee myself on a tree, </joey>
<connor> I was just like it would be
cool though if I did break it. </connor>
<connor> - When I found out it was
just like a really bad bruise </connor>
<joey> I was like that's not cool- </joey>
<garnt> - You get a cast though?
- It's just a bruise. </garnt>
<connor> I don't get anything from this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, what the hell?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Alex laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I've also never broken
a bone in my body. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know the
thought scares me now. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't know what it feels like. </garnt>
<joey> - The older you get. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I see so many people... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, I went to a high school </joey>
<joey> that was very predominantly sports based. </joey>
<joey> - [Conner] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So, boys would be breaking their wrists </joey>
<joey> or their ankles, their
arms, their legs, whatnot, </joey>
<joey> like constantly. </joey>
<joey> And every time I would ask, </joey>
<joey> because I don't know why
I've never broken a bone </joey>
<joey> in my body. </joey>
<joey> I would always ask, does it hurt? </joey>
<joey> And they're always just
like, "Oh no, not really." </joey>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Bullshit." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've had splinters and they fucking hurt. </connor>
<connor> Of course that fucking hurts. </connor>
<joey> What are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> - Because people who
realized that don't realize, </joey>
<joey> like that fingers are broken or something </joey>
<joey> at some point it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's a guy at my school, </joey>
<connor> didn't realize his finger was broken </connor>
<connor> until like it sat like wonky. </connor>
<connor> (Alex laughs) </connor>
<connor> Because he didn't go to the hospital. </connor>
<connor> And it just sat- </connor>
<garnt> - How do you not realize that shit? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, oh my finger kind of hurts. </connor>
<connor> It looks kind of weird too- </connor>
<joey> - It's like at 90 degrees, </joey>
<connor> that's kind of strange. </connor>
<garnt> - What's up with that? </garnt>
<garnt> - And meanwhile there's
me I get paper cut. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like get the fucking bandages. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Can you see a bone? </garnt>
<garnt> Can you see a bone? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Get the alcohol, quick. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - I'm too British, I feel
like if my hand was impaled, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, no, well, I mean... </connor>
<connor> - It's just a flesh wound. </connor>
<connor> - Put a bit of sanitizer on it </connor>
<connor> and I think it should be fine. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I think the
smallest injuries hurt the most. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel sometimes. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, paper cut or splinter
hurts like a motherfucker. </joey>
<connor> - What's the worst injury you've ever had? </connor>
<connor> Like that hurt the most? </connor>
<joey> - The worst injury I've ever had- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I'm sure do you have one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember once when I was a kid </garnt>
<connor> we were playing tag or it's. </connor>
<connor> As we would call it. - A brutal game. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's a sports for barbarians. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was playing with my cousins </garnt>
<garnt> and this one time I ran like head... </garnt>
<garnt> I full on sprinted, right? </garnt>
<joey> And my cousin was standing next to a pole </joey>
<joey> and then I full on sprinted
to try and get him, </joey>
<joey> and then I tripped and I
face planted into this pole. </joey>
<joey> And I don't think I got any brain damage </joey>
<joey> or anything like that,
didn't get a concussion. </joey>
<joey> But what I did get was
this Tom and Jerry type, </joey>
<joey> massive bump on my head- </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It was massive, okay? </joey>
<joey> To this day, I've never seen
another injury like this </joey>
<joey> where my forehead was just like this </joey>
<connor> and the entire evening my
parents were just spinning the... </connor>
<connor> I was on my mom's lap
and she would have to... </connor>
<connor> She had to literally
press it back in slowly </connor>
<connor> over the course of this entire night. </connor>
<garnt> - You should just been
like, it's my giga brain. </garnt>
<garnt> Just try to come out. </garnt>
<joey> It's trying to escape from my head. </joey>
<garnt> - You know that point
where you've got an injury </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't know how bad it is, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you see it, and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, shit!" </garnt>
<connor> This is way worse than I
thought it was initially. </connor>
<connor> - [Alex] Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause initially I'm
like, yeah, yeah I'm good. </connor>
<connor> I'm good, I can handle this. </connor>
<connor> - Walk it off. </connor>
<joey> - And then I saw myself in the mirror, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> when I saw that massive lump, </joey>
<joey> that's when the wave of
pain just came towards it. </joey>
<garnt> So, I don't know if it
was a psychological thing </garnt>
<garnt> but it was- </garnt>
<joey> - Probably the worst one I had was... </joey>
<joey> I was out like camping with friends, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I always used to
go camping every year </joey>
<joey> with my family and family friends. </joey>
<joey> And we were maybe 10
years old or something </joey>
<joey> and my friend, and I
were just grabbing rocks, </joey>
<connor> there was this big cliff face, </connor>
<connor> and we were just kind of just
throwing rocks at the cliff </connor>
<connor> because what do you do-
- This is not gonna go well. </connor>
<connor> - What do you do when
you go camping, right? </connor>
<joey> While the dads are setting up the tent, </joey>
<joey> we're like, all right, fuck it, </joey>
<joey> let's just throw rocks or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And one of the rocks had bounced... </joey>
<joey> Like my friends threw the
rock against the cliff </joey>
<joey> It bounced back and my hand was pressed up </joey>
<joey> against another stone, 'cause
I think I was sitting down </joey>
<joey> and the stone came back and
just slammed into my fingers, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, ouch, initially, </joey>
<connor> but then I looked down
and both of my fingernails </connor>
<connor> had just completely chipped off. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - And it was really weird,
it was kind of your thing, </connor>
<joey> where it hurts until you
look at it and it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, now it really fucking hurts." </joey>
<joey> - Ah, that's so gross. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so both of these
fingernails were gone </joey>
<joey> for a month maybe until they regrew back </joey>
<joey> and, yeah, that's probably the worst. </joey>
<joey> - That's so gross. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think the most pain I've been in, </connor>
<joey> I was snowboarding and
I went, but you know... </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> - Just like, "Oh, God, it's
like four years ago, as well. </connor>
<joey> You know having some snow ski resorts, </joey>
<joey> they have some area that's
designated for tricks </joey>
<joey> and do hot pile. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I know, I like going
there and I try to... </joey>
<connor> I normally can do like a 360 in the air. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, like it's not clean. </connor>
<connor> - Stop bragging. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But now I'm too scared to do it. </connor>
<connor> Because one of them, I didn't go off right </connor>
<connor> and I just kind of span halfway
on my back was facing... </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<joey> And so, I was up in the air
maybe like, I don't know... </joey>
<joey> I landed in the bottom of the ramp. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - For the next jump. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah-
- Just hard ice. </connor>
<joey> And I must've been up in the air I dunno, </joey>
<joey> like three or four meters off the ground. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Just slammed on my back, </joey>
<joey> thought I broke my back, I was so winded, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't breathe, 'cause my lungs </joey>
<joey> had just been like fucking
pancakes, I was like... </joey>
<joey> (inhales deeply) </joey>
<connor> And they were like should
we get the skiing ambulance? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, no. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'll walk it off. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'll walk it off. </connor>
<joey> Ant then I'd like broken the fall </joey>
<joey> by putting my hand there, as well. </joey>
<connor> So, I sprained my wrist as well. </connor>
<connor> It was fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've had a lot
of snowballs and skiing. </connor>
<connor> - They hurt the most. </connor>
<connor> - I had something similar like that, </connor>
<connor> but I obviously wasn't
in the air for as long. </connor>
<connor> And also I always make sure
whenever I do the jumps, </connor>
<joey> I can do like 180 and 360 as well, </joey>
<joey> but I always make sure </joey>
<joey> that the bottom of it is like powder snow, </joey>
<joey> just so if I fuck up the landing, </joey>
<garnt> then it's just like a
pillow, be like (indictinct). </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, this feels nice. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes you like, I really
wanna do this sick jump, </connor>
<connor> but there's no snow at the
bottom, but I'ma fucking do it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - (indictinct) moments before a disaster. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause up until that
jump, I was doing 180, 180, </connor>
<joey> I was like, I'ma do the big one. </joey>
<joey> I'ma do the 360. </joey>
<joey> And then I went for it and
it just completely failed. </joey>
<joey> And then I had to be like
dragged out of the way. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause people were waiting to go as well, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like a line system. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some mates had to drag
me with their skis on, </garnt>
<connor> I was like, "Oh my God," it's horrible. </connor>
<connor> - I think my most painful memory </connor>
<garnt> is actually also my earliest memory. </garnt>
<joey> So, this is my earliest memory of my life </joey>
<joey> that I can remember.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I was... </joey>
<joey> I think I was about three years old </joey>
<joey> and it's obviously very vivid, </joey>
<joey> but it's given me a phobia of bees, okay? </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - To give you an idea about
where I'm going with this story. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - So, here's my very earliest memory. </joey>
<joey> I remember I was in my parents' restaurant </joey>
<joey> and I see this thing just buzzing around. </joey>
<garnt> It was like this black
dot just buzzing around </garnt>
<garnt> and all I remember thinking was, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna bat the shit out of this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - As a three year old? </garnt>
<connor> - As a three-year-old kid,
I'm just like, (indictinct). </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it's moving fast and
I'd never seen a bee before. </garnt>
<joey> So, I'm just like, I'm gonna
bat the shit out of this. </joey>
<joey> - That's like some cat brain, right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> This thing is moving, I must hit it. </joey>
<joey> - Literally cat brain. </joey>
<joey> And then all I remember
was I tried batting it </joey>
<joey> and I remember it moving
in a circular motion, </joey>
<joey> just closing in on my eye, okay? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - It was like this, I remember it. </joey>
<joey> And then the next thing I feel is just </joey>
<connor> this sharp pain on my fucking eyes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<connor> - And it is... </connor>
<connor> It scarred me for life. </connor>
<connor> This pain I still remember to this day </connor>
<connor> and this is why I have a phobia of bees, </connor>
<connor> because that shit was so painful, </connor>
<connor> and so I run to my mom
and she looks at my eyes </connor>
<connor> and I would never forget my mom's face, </connor>
<connor> it was just pure shock,
just like, "Oh shit!" </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the stinger was
still in my eyeball, </connor>
<connor> So the-
- Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - The bee had stung me on my eyeball. </connor>
<connor> Like it-
- Bulls eye bro. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And we had to go to the doctor. </connor>
<connor> We had to go to the doctor, </connor>
<garnt> because they had to tweeze
out the stinger from my eyes. </garnt>
<joey> - How did you not go blind from that? </joey>
<garnt> - I just
- It mustn't </garnt>
<joey> have gone deep enough, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It must not have gone deep enough </connor>
<connor> and I think it was on
the whites of my eyes, </connor>
<connor> it was my pupil. </connor>
<connor> So, I probably just
narrowly escaped blindness </connor>
<connor> from that fucking bee. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, ever since then,
I learned an important lesson. </joey>
<joey> Don't fuck with bees. </joey>
<joey> - Don't fuck with bee's. </joey>
<garnt> Don't fuck with any wildlife, honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the advice I always give </joey>
<joey> to people who wanna go to Australia. </joey>
<joey> It's like how do all these
Australians avoid all </joey>
<connor> of these poisonous snakes and spiders? </connor>
<connor> Don't fuck with them </connor>
<connor> and they won't fuck with you. </connor>
<connor> If you go over to a poisonous
snake and start poking it, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna get fucking bitten. </joey>
<joey> Don't do that and they won't bite you. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's really easy. </joey>
<connor> - I think most animals
don't want to attack you. </connor>
<joey> - No. It's a defense mechanism. </joey>
<garnt> Don't fuck with them </garnt>
<joey> and they won't fuck
with you, really simple. </joey>
<connor> - Speaking about animals, boys, </connor>
<connor> not that there is
anything to do with anime. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna talk about animation, </garnt>
<garnt> we've even done that, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, sure.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Remember when we started
off as an anime type podcast </connor>
<garnt> and then we just didn't
talk about anime at all? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, we always wanted it to be a... </joey>
<joey> Whatever the fuck you wanna talk about, </joey>
<joey> but anime is gonna be a big one. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, of course.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What have you guys been watching recent? </connor>
<joey> - Fuck all, man. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - You're not watching
anything with Aki, right now? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, Aki, watched,
Uzaki Chan the other day? </joey>
<garnt> - Ah, how was that? </garnt>
<garnt> - She watched the first
episode and then she was like, </garnt>
<connor> you're gonna want to watch this. </connor>
<connor> So, I watched the first
episode actually this morning, </connor>
<connor> right before we came to the office </connor>
<garnt> and I can't fucking stand it. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry.
- Yes. Same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm Sorry.
- Same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aki, fucking hates
it, I fucking hate it. </garnt>
<joey> It is so fucking boring. </joey>
<connor> - I saw clip of it, </connor>
<connor> I haven't watched it by the way, </connor>
<connor> but I saw a clip where
she got stuck in a bush? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And to me it just looked
like the porn hub thing </connor>
<connor> where they get stuck
in the washing machine. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> You want me to get stuck
in a washing machine? </joey>
<joey> You only get stuck in a washing machine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I thought it was a hint time. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, "Oh,
is this an evolution?" </connor>
<joey> - I think I would enjoy it </joey>
<joey> if it was a hint time. </joey>
<joey> Because that is like hint time material. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's literally
like the stuck in the war tag </garnt>
<garnt> that you have without the actual fucking. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought, because the laundry thing </connor>
<joey> had been blowing up recently. </joey>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> The hint time porn, I thought it was like- </garnt>
<connor> - I know, man, it's always
been a thing in hint time. </connor>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> - But I, I mean it's propped
up a lot of porn recently. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I thought, "Oh,
it's a hint time thing. </garnt>
<connor> Which is, I guess- </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's just like what every
one assumes what anime anyway. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's a hint time thing. </joey>
<joey> - Animated hint time, yes. </joey>
<connor> - What is it about? </connor>
<garnt> - It's literally, just a slice of life </garnt>
<joey> where you follow this loud lolly- </joey>
<joey> - Big tities. </joey>
<joey> - Who has big tities. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I get the appeal
of it, because it's- </joey>
<joey> - Why is it blowing up? </joey>
<joey> - Because, she's a loud lolly </joey>
<garnt> with big tities, that's why. </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally it. </garnt>
<connor> - It looks shit. </connor>
<connor> - That is her... </connor>
<connor> Her body is her personality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, it's... </garnt>
<joey> She's become the new meme
girl of the month, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because she... </joey>
<joey> The manga has been pretty popular </joey>
<joey> or at least popular
within certain circles, </joey>
<joey> because I see her face everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> I don't understand why? </connor>
<joey> - Well, I reckon what it is, is that... </joey>
<joey> It was Uzaki Chan for this new year </joey>
<joey> or I guess maybe this, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to say this generation, </joey>
<joey> but it's essentially
the same as Umaru Chan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> Umaru Chan is the exact same type of show </joey>
<joey> where, if you can stand Umaru Chan </joey>
<connor> and you can relate, and like, Umaru Chan, </connor>
<connor> then you probably love Uzaki, right? </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't stand Umaru Chan. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't stand Umaru Chan. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, this little turd, </connor>
<connor> is fucking taking advantage of a brother </connor>
<connor> so, fucking hard, I would've
slap the shit out of her. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna club stomp Umaru Chan. </connor>
<joey> - (indictinct) Unless you hit- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> And so, I feel that Uzaki Chan </joey>
<joey> is kind of a similar show </joey>
<joey> where if you don't like
Uzaki Chan, as a character </joey>
<joey> then you won't be able to stand the show, </joey>
<joey> because she is the entire show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Watamote, as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't like Coroki, which I didn't, </garnt>
<joey> I couldn't stand it. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause like the whole show </garnt>
<garnt> is just basically her
annoying the fuck out </garnt>
<joey> of the main character. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the main character just- </joey>
<garnt> (exhale deeply) </garnt>
<joey> Oh, I hate you bro. </joey>
<joey> - That's her personality (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> Is that she's fucking annoying. </joey>
<connor> Which is really funny,
because people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, she's not that annoying." </connor>
<connor> When a lot of people don't
realize, the name Uzaki, </connor>
<joey> is a play on words in Japanese
for (foreign language), </joey>
<joey> which means annoying. </joey>
<joey> That's why she's called Uzaki. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Because she's annoying. </joey>
<garnt> Because I know so many people,
like friends of Al's, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like Dakota's a massive fan of that show. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like, why? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Dakota, why? </garnt>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<joey> - Why Dakota? </joey>
<joey> - What does it say about you as a person? </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it because she
has a fucking skin fang </garnt>
<garnt> and has two big tits, is that it? </garnt>
<joey> Like, why? </joey>
<joey> - What's with the fang? </joey>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<joey> - I'll tell you why, </joey>
<joey> it's 'cause the Dojo's she's in are good. </joey>
<joey> But like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This is one of those shows </joey>
<joey> where it's own specific
genre now, I swear to God. </joey>
<joey> Where I swear, there were just some shows </joey>
<joey> or some manga that I swear people make, </joey>
<joey> just 'cause they like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, this gonna be
good Dajinshi material. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's what it- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<garnt> - This is gonna be the
top 10 Dajinshi material. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the genre of these shows. </garnt>
<garnt> The genre is Dojinshi material. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause they always have the meme girl, </garnt>
<garnt> it's always focused on this one meme girl </garnt>
<garnt> that a lot of people may find annoying, </garnt>
<garnt> but for some reason she
just works in really good... </garnt>
<garnt> Like in any situations in Dojinshi, </garnt>
<garnt> they just like... </garnt>
<garnt> They're just golden. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, because as much as I don't dig </garnt>
<garnt> the uzaki Chan anime,
men, the Uzaki Chan Dojo's </garnt>
<garnt> are fucking lit. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Oh, my God. </joey>
<garnt> - (indictinct) Degenerates, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Every single one that
I have seen so far, </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, deim son. </joey>
<joey> - I wish I could read porn. </joey>
<joey> I just can't, a monkey brain, man. </joey>
<joey> It's like- </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you don't have to. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you don't read anyway- </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Let alone read porn. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> So, how am I gonna read... </joey>
<connor> That's even worse than the
gaming thing with reading. </connor>
<connor> I wanna read my porn, I want shitty acting </connor>
<connor> and I wanna skip to five minutes in </connor>
<connor> and then decide what I'm gonna do. </connor>
<connor> - It's because, Uzaki Chan's personality </connor>
<connor> is so fit for Dojinshi. </connor>
<connor> Because she's like that, </connor>
<connor> always teasing kind of character, right. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, well, </connor>
<connor> if you put that in a sexual aspect, man, </connor>
<connor> that makes for some spicy Dogen's. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they are. </joey>
<joey> They're really good. </joey>
<joey> Her big tits don't help. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Honestly, her body proportions
do not help, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I would enjoy
the Uzaki Chan's Dogen's, </joey>
<joey> if her body was just normal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But because it's so disproportionate </joey>
<connor> and built for Dogen's I'm just- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> They were clearly planning
for this in Dogens. </connor>
<connor> - It's just the show
that's made for Hint time. </connor>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<connor> - Even more so than some fan
surveys (indictinct) shows. </connor>
<connor> There are just... </connor>
<connor> There were like some edgy shows </connor>
<connor> and then there are edgy
shows that are made, </connor>
<connor> I feel, just for like the
fan material under the Danjis </connor>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like being, "Oh, yes,
this new era gay came out, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm gonna get the
old ages version instead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you do that to yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> Why, what's the point in that? </garnt>
<garnt> - So, out of 10, the first episode? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - At least. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds generous. </garnt>
<garnt> - It looks good. </garnt>
<joey> That's all I'm gonna... </joey>
<joey> Like, Uzaki Chan... </joey>
<joey> Okay, I'll admit, Uzaki
Chan's character design, </joey>
<joey> fucking amazing, I love it. </joey>
<joey> It's great. </joey>
<joey> - I reckon that's why a lot
of people got Jordan's web, </joey>
<joey> because her character design is great. </joey>
<garnt> I love her character design. </garnt>
<joey> And she has such a good memorable face. </joey>
<joey> You know that one girl that every season </joey>
<joey> that just has the best facial expression. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like this season is definitely... </garnt>
<garnt> It's definitely Uzaki Chan, </garnt>
<joey> like her smug face, the smuggling NG, man. </joey>
<joey> - The smug face, yeah, that's what it is. </joey>
<joey> - She's got like the perfect smug face. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - Anamei funs are just
like, "It's a great show. </connor>
<joey> She's got a smug face,
I'm sold. I'll pay." </joey>
<joey> - This is art, this is art- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Congratulations, smug face. </joey>
<connor> - Aname fans are the real monkey brains. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> can I just say that? </connor>
<connor> - I just genuinely want to know, </connor>
<joey> for people who are watching this right now </joey>
<joey> and saying that they love Uzaki Chan, </joey>
<joey> what is it about the show that you like? </joey>
<garnt> Because I tried, right. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I always do my best. </joey>
<connor> Even if it's a show I don't like, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Okay, why is it that people </connor>
<connor> are getting to the show?" </connor>
<connor> What aspects is it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I looked at, Uzaki Chan, and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> the only thing I can think of is her tits. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's the only redeeming
factor about this show. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel bad, because I feel like </joey>
<connor> that's the easy to go to joke- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Of like, "Oh, this show
has no substance or anything, </connor>
<connor> but I legitimately, I'm just curious. </connor>
<connor> I wanna know why people, like it? </connor>
<connor> - It's not like I'm
trying to diss on people </connor>
<joey> who like the show, by all means, right? </joey>
<joey> But I just wanna know, what is it? </joey>
<joey> Is it the tits? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Because if that's the case- </joey>
<garnt> - Is this like a call for help- </garnt>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Because if that's the case, </joey>
<garnt> then you can literally, just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, I fucking hate this Anime, </garnt>
<joey> but if I add tits, seven out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - This feels like my intervention. </joey>
<joey> It's like, just admit you have a problem. </joey>
<connor> Just tell us. </connor>
<connor> - Just admit that you like the tits. </connor>
<joey> And that's the only reason
why I enjoy the show. </joey>
<joey> - What, have you been
watching anything else </joey>
<connor> this season, Jerry or not really? </connor>
<connor> - Not really. No. </connor>
<joey> - Could I'll tell you
why I've been watching, </joey>
<connor> Rent A Girlfriend. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, me too- </joey>
<joey> - And that is... </joey>
<garnt> Is that a guilty pleasure? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if that's
a guilty pleasure. </connor>
<connor> - I genuinely think it's like
the best show this season. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's a really good show. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I'll say it's the best show
this season they're gone. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, Real Zero is... </garnt>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> Real Zero, head and
shoulders above the rest. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. - At the moment. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, Real Zero, the last episode, </garnt>
<garnt> have you watch the last episode? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<connor> I was crying like a fucking baby- </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Holly shit. </connor>
<connor> - Real zero, shit... </connor>
<connor> We'll get into Real Zero in a minute. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But Rent A Girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> That is just, why does it work? </connor>
<connor> Because it's such a
generic heron plot, right? </connor>
<joey> - I hate the protagonist or something. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I read the synopsis of that, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, this seems really in silly. </garnt>
<garnt> - No- </garnt>
<garnt> - It seems like it's made for Incell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the protagonist
is a living bro moment. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Every time he does something, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like for fuck's sake,
why are you doing this bro? </connor>
<garnt> Seriously, bro. </garnt>
<connor> - No, bro. </connor>
<connor> The problem is now this anime comes out, </connor>
<connor> people are gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> "Wait, we should actually
make this a thing." </connor>
<connor> They're gonna be like, 'We should do this, </connor>
<connor> this is normal." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We should normalize this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Normalize paying girls. </joey>
<joey> That we all ready did that with online- </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - The gaming, the (indictinct)
realgirls.gg or something, </joey>
<joey> whatever it is. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, gameofgold.gg or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, whatever the fuck (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm surprised
you're enjoying it though. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it was really fun. </garnt>
<connor> I mean I hate the main character </connor>
<garnt> and I saw it when you tweeted out, </garnt>
<connor> saying, "Oh he's irredeemable." </connor>
<connor> There were people like, </connor>
<connor> "No, he's not irredeemable." </connor>
<connor> It's like, bro he's
annoying as fuck right now. </connor>
<joey> - That's the incell's
protecting their boy. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I know, it's probably
like the, monguritus, </garnt>
<connor> who's like, well he gets kind of- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure he will. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Which, I'm looking forward </connor>
<connor> to seeing him become a better person. </connor>
<connor> But right now, I can't
remember what I called him, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like a- </connor>
<connor> - Cum stain (indictinct). </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like a cum stain. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, cum stain protagonist. </connor>
<connor> Which is so accurate, it's so accurate. </connor>
<joey> He's a cum stain. </joey>
<connor> - The way I view him is like, </connor>
<connor> I fucking hate Backer girl
from My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But everyone fucking loves him. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, he's a piece of shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He's so selfish. </connor>
<connor> - I don't get it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why are you people... </connor>
<garnt> Why are you booing me, I'm right. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think that's the
thing that really pisted me off, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just how selfish he was. </garnt>
<garnt> - He is so selfish. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's ridiculously selfish. </garnt>
<garnt> Unlike if you're one of those
people, who relate to him- </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's the people who related
to Subaru in the start, </connor>
<garnt> it's like, what's wrong with you? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, okay. </connor>
<garnt> Like if you are my mate and
you were acting like him, </garnt>
<joey> I would have... </joey>
<joey> I would need to talking to you... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I would have to talk to you. </joey>
<joey> - You would catch these hands. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> The person who I liked
the most wasn't him, </joey>
<connor> but he was his best mate. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like he was a true bro who like... </connor>
<connor> Who was looking out
for him and everything. </connor>
<connor> And so far the main protagonist </connor>
<joey> hasn't done anything
that's made me feel like, </joey>
<joey> man, he deserves a best girl. </joey>
<joey> Man, he deserves his bros. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he definitely does, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So, I'm looking forward </joey>
<joey> to seeing his character development, </joey>
<joey> which I assume is what happens- </joey>
<joey> - Still, but- </joey>
<garnt> - In the Manga. </garnt>
<connor> - Or it's the Manga real. </connor>
<joey> Just being the Manga is be- </joey>
<joey> - If this was shit that
happen in real life, you... </joey>
<joey> And this was in your friend group, </joey>
<joey> you'd never be forgiven for it. </joey>
<joey> - No- </joey>
<connor> - For doing the shit that he's pulled- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<connor> No, you would absolutely
be clowned on by bro's. </connor>
<joey> - So, he like rents a
girlfriend, she's great. </joey>
<joey> I mean, this just spoilers
the first three episodes. </joey>
<joey> And then, this girl that dumped him, </joey>
<joey> he immediately gets back with her. </joey>
<connor> Even though she's talking shit about him. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In front of his friend. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, what are... </connor>
<connor> What, I can't believe this shit. </connor>
<connor> This is where you would be like, </connor>
<joey> "Wow, this guy's my friend." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - This is where you would be like, no... </connor>
<connor> - I'm friends with an
absolute cunt, right? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You selfish asshole. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's one of the
first Hera manama where </garnt>
<connor> there's clearly a best girl. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause she's girl real,
fucking girl of the seasons. </connor>
<connor> She's such- </connor>
<garnt> - MVP. </garnt>
<connor> - MVP. </connor>
<connor> - She's coming through. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - She's not only helping him out, </connor>
<connor> she's like, with the grand
situation, oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (indictinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'm there in my corner, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking cheering. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, I kinda
don't wanna cheer, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, cheering means that she has </garnt>
<connor> to end up with this person at the moment. </connor>
<connor> And it's so hard to be like- </connor>
<connor> (cheering) </connor>
<connor> Go protagonist. </connor>
<connor> - I hope she gets like a giga charge, </connor>
<connor> just to make incells mad. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I wanna incells mad, bro. </connor>
<connor> Man, I've... (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> Seen the incell takes on Twitter, man, </joey>
<joey> they get me fucking fuming. </joey>
<joey> Oh, my God, you guys have
never left your room. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Is this your first Heroin Manama </garnt>
<garnt> that you've been following then? </garnt>
<joey> - Weekly? </joey>
<joey> - Because Heroma don't really seem, </joey>
<joey> like a thing you would watch. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's why I was like... </garnt>
<connor> That's why I was surprised </connor>
<connor> when I heard you were watching it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I normally watch them, </connor>
<connor> but I think, because they make life </connor>
<connor> so difficult for themselves, </connor>
<connor> it's so frustrating to watch. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you didn't have
to make this difficult. </connor>
<connor> You like, you made your life shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You could've spoke to her, </connor>
<connor> but you fucking sat there. </connor>
<joey> Okay, one thing that you would
never do in real life, right? </joey>
<joey> If your girlfriend, whatever, walks off, </joey>
<connor> even if it's your rental girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You go after her. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's a universal thing. </joey>
<joey> Even idiots and people who
are the most nervous people </joey>
<joey> on earth and shy, they go after the- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> And if they don't, your friends
will immediately be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Yo, dude, go, right now." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Like the thing that pisted me off is, </garnt>
<joey> in a lot of these situations, </joey>
<joey> his friends are acting like
his friends should act. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Bro, get
your girl, get your girl." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And he's getting angry </joey>
<joey> that they don't know the full situation, </joey>
<connor> even though he's put
himself in this situation. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, you go after the
girl if she storms out angry </garnt>
<connor> that's like rule number one. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even if it's a fake girlfriend, </garnt>
<garnt> I would still go after my girl. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - The other thing, the reason why I might, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I like Harams is 'cause, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe in my head I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm trying to speed run it in my mind. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh God, what would I do </connor>
<connor> for optimal straps to get the girl? </connor>
<connor> Like, no, no, you did the wrong route here </connor>
<connor> that you just lost 20 seconds. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - But I think that's the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, you're trying to like watch </joey>
<connor> these kinds of shows- </connor>
<connor> - To relate, to like... </connor>
<connor> - You're basically, if we were relating </connor>
<connor> it's like speed runs, right? </connor>
<connor> You're trying to be like, all right, </connor>
<garnt> how am I gonna speed run this, </garnt>
<garnt> while watching 100% run. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like why are they
taking the optimal route? </garnt>
<garnt> Not knowing that they're
trying to do 100%. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I think you've put harems into </joey>
<garnt> the wrong genre then. </garnt>
<connor> - I just... </connor>
<connor> Most of the stories I
find really underwhelming </connor>
<connor> and I don't, like some of
them I've really enjoyed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But some of them- </joey>
<joey> - A lot of them are
very like, come on bro, </joey>
<joey> just get to the fucking point. </joey>
<joey> - Most of them, like you watch three </joey>
<connor> and you feel like you've
watched all of Hararm, </connor>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Oh, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, for me, the closest
thing I would relate harem to, </garnt>
<connor> actually, is sports. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay, here's the thing. </connor>
<joey> Here's the- </joey>
<joey> - What's the formula? </joey>
<joey> - Here's the enjoyable
part of Harem, right? </joey>
<connor> It's picking a team, picking your girl </connor>
<connor> and then fucking cheering for her. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> This isn't about speed running the shit, </joey>
<joey> this is about getting caught teased, </joey>
<connor> about who's the protagonist's
gonna end up with. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, I guess that's Harams, </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry that, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I was about to say, if
there's only one main, </joey>
<joey> I was like- </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - That's just the romance at that point. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Romance I don't like, romance... </connor>
<connor> Haram is, but 90% of
Harems, you already know. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, but why don't
you like romances then? </joey>
<joey> Because that's the speed run, if anything. </joey>
<connor> - Because sometimes they
just do dumb shit in it </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, no one would ever do this. </connor>
<connor> - Well, they have to make
a cohesive story, right? </connor>
<connor> They're not just gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> all right, I met this girl, episode one, </connor>
<connor> episode three, em' together. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> End of the story, baby. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes they do shit in romance </connor>
<connor> that I'm like, this shit... </connor>
<connor> Okay, I knew it shouldn't be realistic, </connor>
<connor> but then also there's just some stuff </connor>
<joey> that it's like hard for me </joey>
<joey> to ever believe whatever happened. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm trying to think of a case. </joey>
<joey> I can't off the top- </joey>
<joey> - What romance anime have
even seen then? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Named a bunch of
iconic ones and I'll see. </joey>
<garnt> - Golden Time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Golden- </garnt>
<garnt> - Totadora. </garnt>
<connor> - Totadora, I really liked. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I think I like most of them, </connor>
<connor> I just never seek them out. </connor>
<connor> It's something that if a friend recommends </connor>
<joey> and I have nothing better to do, </joey>
<joey> and I put it on, I'll probably enjoy it, </joey>
<joey> but it's not a thing that
I seek out for myself. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure a lot of people
can relate to this. </joey>
<joey> Especially those people
who watch Only Shownin. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, get that shit outta here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's no fight scene. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like Harem, especially, </joey>
<joey> I feel that most shows that I've watched, </joey>
<joey> it's like, oh, that's the one. </joey>
<joey> If any of these girls are gonna get it </joey>
<joey> which is, even a mystery. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause 90% of the time,
nothing fucking happens. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, the
protagonist, supervene, </connor>
<connor> that's the show and it ends, right? </connor>
<connor> What was that one from a few years ago </connor>
<connor> where it was like, they
will all like wizards. </connor>
<connor> And the one guy could like counter magic </connor>
<connor> and it was awful. </connor>
<garnt> - You just described like fucking 90% </garnt>
<connor> of most like magic high school Hermn show. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it'll be like eight girls. </garnt>
<connor> And they all have one personality trait. </connor>
<garnt> And that's it. </garnt>
<connor> It's like the most boring shit. </connor>
<connor> - Are you talking about Index? </connor>
<connor> - That's what I thought. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the only thing
like counter magic- </garnt>
<connor> - Like Index is the guy
who he's like the magic- </connor>
<garnt> - He has like the right
hand that can counter magic. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's also the Irregular
Of Magic High School. </garnt>
<connor> - I love that series. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was around that, the same season. </joey>
<joey> - (indictinct) Straddles? </joey>
<joey> - Some guy, I don't fucking know this guy. </joey>
<joey> - They all sound the same. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> - I'll try and find it today. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like trying to pinpoint an Easter </garnt>
<connor> by saying, "What was that one show </connor>
<connor> where they go against
transported to the other world?" </connor>
<joey> And gets overpowered and stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I find what it is, </garnt>
<garnt> it's on the screen right now, </garnt>
<joey> if not, I'm just holding my
hands up, like an asshole. </joey>
<connor> - Night in Magic, maybe that one. </connor>
<connor> - I'll fucking find... </connor>
<connor> I'll find it. </connor>
<connor> - They're all crap. </connor>
<connor> - They're just garbage. </connor>
<connor> - The thing about Heroin anime is that, </connor>
<connor> I can never watch two at once, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when I'm watching two at once, </connor>
<connor> that's like me watching
the same show twice, </connor>
<connor> but every time a new one comes on, </connor>
<connor> then this time it's Rent A Girlfriends. </connor>
<connor> And boy, what I will say
about Rent A Girlfriend, </connor>
<connor> is that it's just very addicting to watch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I also thought it is. </connor>
<connor> - And I think because the main character </connor>
<connor> is the way he is, as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you're sitting there fuming, </connor>
<connor> but you click on that next episode. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you wanna see... </garnt>
<garnt> You're like cheering for
him to become a better guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And just act the way
that you want him to act. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it funny how it's like
the opposite of real life. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> You're like, the moment
you see it, your like, </joey>
<joey> get out of my life- </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> For an animate, please get better. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on. I know you can. </garnt>
<connor> - You can do it. </connor>
<connor> You can do it. </connor>
<connor> - Like imagine the scenario
of Rent A Girlfriend </connor>
<connor> in real life. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> One of your mates- </connor>
<garnt> - Especially in this climate, as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Find out one of your mates </joey>
<joey> is paying for a girl just
to rent her as a girlfriend </joey>
<joey> and parade her around. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, bro,
that's a real bro moment. </joey>
<joey> That aint cool bro. </joey>
<joey> - I can think of like several
people who would do that. </joey>
<joey> - But like in anime, for some reason, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, because
sometimes there's scenarios </joey>
<joey> that I feel wouldn't work in real life </joey>
<joey> or even in like live action series. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - But because it's anime
and because it's animated, </joey>
<garnt> my suspension of disbelief
is just a bit more so like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<connor> You get to hear their thought process. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean actually, hear that
they have compassion and stuff, </connor>
<connor> so you can kind of- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because a live
action rent a girlfriend </joey>
<joey> would be probably one
of the cringes things </joey>
<garnt> you'll ever watch. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<connor> - So have you ever completed
a Hera man-made to the end- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Where the best girl wins? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if a best girl won. </connor>
<connor> Wait, what... </connor>
<connor> Name a few famous Hera manama. </connor>
<connor> - Nisekoi. </connor>
<joey> - Nisekoi I didn't watch. </joey>
<joey> - Toloveru. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't watched Toloveru. </joey>
<connor> - Orimo. </connor>
<connor> - Orimo. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've watched many. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aeromonas. </garnt>
<connor> - The World God Only Knows. </connor>
<connor> - The World God Only Knows I watched. </connor>
<joey> - All to the end? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, all like three
seasons or whatever. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, deim. </joey>
<connor> - And that was good. </connor>
<connor> But I don't know what happens. </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't seem like
a show you would watch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just like, "Oh, you
watched that one, okay." </joey>
<connor> - I watched all of it. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, wait, I
have to read the Monga now. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean, we have three seasons, </joey>
<joey> don't stop now, keep going. </joey>
<joey> I thought normally when
it gets to season three </joey>
<garnt> that's normally like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> we're only here for the
long run, we keep going. </garnt>
<connor> And then it just ended. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> That's a really good show, I loved that. </joey>
<garnt> - So you've never gone to the end </garnt>
<joey> where like there's a winning girl. </joey>
<joey> Where there's an actual- </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - Winner. </joey>
<joey> - I probably have, I probably
just can't remember it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, 'cause they're
all probably generic. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like, again, like we
all know I have monkey brain. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Most like the anime </connor>
<connor> that's, if it's not an eight
out of 10 or higher for me, </connor>
<joey> it probably is like in the forgotten. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's in the (indictinct) category, right? </connor>
<connor> - It's in the, okay, it's good. </connor>
<garnt> But not a good enough for me </garnt>
<garnt> to retain memories of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because that's the
reason I watch harem anime. </garnt>
<garnt> Because once you watch one,
you basically watched them all. </garnt>
<connor> So to me- </connor>
<connor> - I love watching the
same thing over again. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I do watch- </connor>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Its the Isakaya man, after all. </joey>
<joey> - But I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> it's just fun being in the race, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And part of the fun is
being in the community </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing all the salt
and tears from the losers. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's like real sport. </garnt>
<garnt> Part of the fun is shitting
on the losing side. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Very, very long sports game. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - An all week long sports game. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's why you can get... </garnt>
<garnt> That's why you get so invested in it, </garnt>
<garnt> because you're reading this... </garnt>
<garnt> You're reading this Monga. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause normally it's a Monga. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I can hardly, I can, it's really rare </garnt>
<garnt> for an anime Harem to actually
go through to the end. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, you normally follow
the Monga for like weeks </garnt>
<garnt> and weeks, and sometimes it's years. </garnt>
<garnt> And that final chapter
where your girl wins, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like a euphoric feeling. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Wouldn't know. </joey>
<joey> - I've experienced that recently with, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is it (foreign language). </joey>
<garnt> - We Never Learn. </garnt>
<joey> - We Never Learn. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because they recently ended that </joey>
<joey> and best girl won and I was
just like, yes, finally. </joey>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - If you had to give me a recommendation </connor>
<connor> for a hera monga to read,
what would you tell me? </connor>
<joey> - I would recommend, We Never Learn. </joey>
<joey> - Really. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's really cute. </joey>
<joey> I've read so much harem stuff </joey>
<joey> and this is one of the few
series where I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> wow, I like all of these girls. </joey>
<connor> Like there isn't a single girl... </connor>
<connor> Like all of these girls can easily win </connor>
<connor> and all of these girls
are fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't too mad or... </connor>
<joey> I mean, I was happy because
my favorite one, won. </joey>
<joey> But I think when I saw her
around in the community </joey>
<joey> when people were routing for all the girls </joey>
<joey> that were like, my girl didn't win, </joey>
<joey> but I ain't complaining,
I'll take the second place. </joey>
<joey> It's all right. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's all good, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Its all fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just seeing how people
justify their losing position. </garnt>
<joey> It's beautiful. </joey>
<joey> It's beautiful when you're
in that winning girl. </joey>
<joey> When you're backing that winning horse </joey>
<joey> it's just like all the
tears taste so good, man. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, you're watching one now </joey>
<joey> with Rent A Girlfriend. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's good. </joey>
<joey> - Would you follow up on the Monga </joey>
<garnt> if the anime ends and that
you just, it just ends. </garnt>
<connor> - If I'm really into,
yeah, I probably would. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It have to be pretty damn good though. </garnt>
<connor> It'd have to end like on
an amazing cliffhanger. </connor>
<connor> - Do you read a lot of Mongo? </connor>
<connor> - It's hard, 'cause I feel that </connor>
<connor> the time when I would read Mongo, </connor>
<connor> I'm normally doing something else. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I've seen you reading
quite a few (indictinct). </joey>
<connor> I mean, you read all of Terraformers. </connor>
<connor> - If I read a Monga. </connor>
<joey> It's like nonstop. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I cannot put it down. </joey>
<connor> So it's very like hard
for me to get into it. </connor>
<connor> - So I don't think you'd enjoy then </connor>
<joey> if it's like a currently (indictinct). </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't read currently serializing </connor>
<joey> except for One Punch Man. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's always a
treat whenever it pops up. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, a new chapter. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like fuck yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Action happens in every chapter- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, One Punch Man
monger is fucking beautiful man. </garnt>
<joey> That shit is amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I love that shit. </connor>
<connor> And then I try to read the web comic, </connor>
<joey> but I was like. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You know that meme, where
the guy took off the headset, </joey>
<connor> he's like... </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, it's good. </connor>
<connor> It's funny. </connor>
<joey> But it's like, the best- </joey>
<joey> - You can't go back to the web Mungo, </joey>
<joey> once you've experienced- </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly, the art is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> And it blows my mind </garnt>
<joey> that the first season actually managed </joey>
<joey> to capture how hype his art was </joey>
<joey> and maybe even exceeded it at some points. </joey>
<garnt> But like his art is fucking insane. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I've loved
Eyeshield since issue 21. </joey>
<garnt> When I found out he was
doing One Punch Man, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, yes, the best. </joey>
<joey> - Issue 21 is still one of
my favorite sports mangroves. </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<garnt> - That's something I've downloaded </garnt>
<garnt> to actually read at some point. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's like every time I'm
gonna start a sports Mongo, </garnt>
<connor> it's like Slam Dunk or EyeShield. </connor>
<connor> And then I just I'm like fuck, </connor>
<joey> which one should I choose? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Just do both, man. </joey>
<garnt> Honestly, those are my top two- </garnt>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - And those are like the two sports manga </joey>
<joey> that you should definitely
read the sports monga </joey>
<joey> and not watch- </joey>
<connor> - Don't watch anamie. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Don't watch- </connor>
<connor> - Cause they have not aged well. </connor>
<connor> Mostly because their matches
take so fucking long. </connor>
<connor> This is back in the day of Dragon Ball Z. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember the first
time I watched Slam Dunk </connor>
<connor> and I remember thinking, why
is a match like 10 episodes? </connor>
<connor> How can they possibly stretch
a match over to 10 episodes? </connor>
<connor> And I watched the entirety
of the Slam Dunk anime </connor>
<connor> and then I read the manga,
and then it just felt, </connor>
<connor> like when Rock Lee had taken
off his training weights, </connor>
<connor> like it was moving so fast. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, I didn't know. </joey>
<connor> I didn't know the story,
could move this fast. </connor>
<connor> - This is how ,its supposed to feel. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, yeah like definitely, </joey>
<garnt> I think not enough
people read sports Mongo </garnt>
<garnt> or sports anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Every single sports anime
that I've consumed, I've loved. </connor>
<connor> Like Yo Mushy Pedalwi surprised me. </connor>
<joey> I really fucking loved that. </joey>
<joey> - I finally now have an excuse
to start reading Haikyu, </joey>
<connor> now that it's finished. </connor>
<connor> - I do wanna read that, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I found the anime a little boring. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've heard- </garnt>
<connor> - How come? </connor>
<connor> - I got half of it the second season </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, why does it feel
like I'm watching season one? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> I just felt like I was
watching season one again. </connor>
<connor> Is that bad? Is that a fair take? </connor>
<connor> - No, I mean... </connor>
<connor> I feel like he gets better
and better every season. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember it's a high Q. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every one says that. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I'm in the
(indictinct) minority. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every one say that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I was
properly sold in haiku, </connor>
<garnt> like properly, properly into it. </garnt>
<garnt> The last match of season two </garnt>
<connor> and then season three came along, </connor>
<connor> and season three is just one match. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking to
myself before the season started </connor>
<connor> how can they make an entire
season from just one match? </connor>
<connor> We're going back into slam dunk territory. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That would be insane. </connor>
<connor> - This is way too dragged out. </connor>
<connor> And then I watched it and I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God, this is the best season. </garnt>
<garnt> So far, this has taken
it to another level. </garnt>
<connor> - But when I know that its
going to be a full season </connor>
<connor> what I'm thinking in my head is, </connor>
<connor> "Whoa, that was amazing." </connor>
<connor> But I'm like, fuck I'm not
gonna find the conclusion </connor>
<connor> for like 20 episodes. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I think I know roughly
what's going to happen- </joey>
<joey> - This boy is trying to
speed, run a sports book. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause what's going to happen. </connor>
<connor> And they don't know the pacing. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, great. </joey>
<connor> This is awesome. </connor>
<connor> I'm shocked. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what to expect. </garnt>
<garnt> If I would go into it now and thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, I'm gonna get, what is it? </garnt>
<garnt> 12 episodes? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was only like nine episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> It was less. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. That's good. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, nine episodes, is manageable, </garnt>
<connor> what if it's 25. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, all the
season was 25 episodes. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, I can't do it. </connor>
<connor> I can't. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's why the Slam
Dunk and Eye show 21 mongers </joey>
<joey> is so good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because the pacing in
that for every single match </joey>
<joey> is legitimately, like this
could end in two chapters </joey>
<joey> or it could end in a hundred chapters. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna try reading one of them </connor>
<joey> actually I wanna read Monga on stream. </joey>
<joey> I've been trying to get permission </joey>
<joey> from our company to be able to do that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You should do that. </connor>
<joey> I think that would be high. </joey>
<joey> - Dude do a stream where you
read Eye Shield or Slam Dunk, </joey>
<garnt> I'll tune into that,
'cause I wanna know. Right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna know how you think they are. </joey>
<joey> - I probably be like the most
boring reactor of all time. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm that guy, </garnt>
<garnt> who just doesn't get
hype when I'm watching </garnt>
<joey> or reading something. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude I tried to do an
anime watching stream </garnt>
<garnt> a couple of times. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I walked back on the vault. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I need to delete these. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It is the most... </garnt>
<joey> I'm literally just, I fucking
jinxed it the entire time. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, all right, yep. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - With Monga, I thought, </connor>
<joey> well, if I can voice out most of it, </joey>
<joey> I mean, that would be very draining. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that's more entertaining. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That more entertaining, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's not like the natural reaction. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where you're just reacting to it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause for me, </connor>
<connor> when I'm watching something, </connor>
<garnt> I'm literally like dead eye. </garnt>
<garnt> The hyper shit could be happening </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just still like... </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's pretty much me, </connor>
<joey> unless it's sad. </joey>
<joey> Then I'm just sobbing my eyes out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like fucking crying. </connor>
<joey> When I'm in that mood, I
will fucking cry at anything. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I fucking cried at The
God Of High School episode. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, why? </connor>
<connor> This shit was fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - God Of High School, why? </connor>
<connor> God Of High School... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, 'cause I
just wanted to cry that day. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I need some thing. </connor>
<connor> - And so that was the episode- </connor>
<garnt> - So, wait at what scene, at what scene? </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> Must've been like, we
turn to episode five now. </connor>
<connor> You've watched episode five? </connor>
<connor> - I've watched... </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I've watched episode five. </connor>
<connor> - There's some one with his
backstory, with his friend. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this isn't
even that fucking sad. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And they completely ruined the show for me </connor>
<connor> the episode before with the wedding. </connor>
<connor> And I was like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - All right I'm out. </connor>
<connor> Fucking (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So dumb. </connor>
<joey> That wedding episode
was the dumbest episode. </joey>
<joey> - And then you cried at the next episode. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because I was
in one of those moods </connor>
<connor> where a fucking Cheeto commercial, </connor>
<connor> where they will be like- </connor>
<connor> (crying) </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - No I don't know what you mean. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I get there's moods where sometimes, </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to cry, </connor>
<connor> but I know that crying
will me feel better. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even though I'm not sad, I'm not sad. </connor>
<connor> I'll just cry. </connor>
<connor> Just cause it'll help. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's people
who can relate to this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I'm sure, but I don't
think you're gonna find them </joey>
<joey> in this podcast. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'm with like two giga
brain, like floating, </connor>
<connor> meditating geniuses, they
don't experience this kind of- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know man. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the biggest... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like the fucking opposite,
opposite of you, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I could have... </garnt>
<garnt> You could show me the
saddest fucking story. </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes I'm like stonewall,
dead face, feel nothing. </garnt>
<joey> You play like the Anahata ending, </joey>
<joey> at the Anahata ending song
or a certain piece of music. </joey>
<joey> I'm bawling my eyes out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Music for me is such an
important factor to make me- </joey>
<garnt> - It all goes back to that music episode. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was listening to music
the other day and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh yeah, my favorite songs is
just the ones with no talking. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I like the noise </connor>
<connor> - I did appreciate Kevin Penkins tweets. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Just be like, how he was so giga tilted </joey>
<connor> when he watched that episode. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he tweeted out being like, </connor>
<connor> okay, people are linking me </connor>
<connor> to this particular trash taste episode. </connor>
<joey> I gotta go check it out. </joey>
<joey> And then like two hours later, </joey>
<joey> he just tweets out being
like, Corner, we have to talk. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Kevin doesn't make, except for like, </connor>
<joey> in Made In The Bass. </joey>
<connor> But normally his songs don't
have people singing in them, </connor>
<connor> so that's nice, I can appreciate the beeps </connor>
<connor> in the boots that Kevin makes. </connor>
<connor> I love your boots and beeps Kevin. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> (air whooshing) </joey>

<joey> Mr. Pipi on the Titi,
whatever my name was, out. </joey>
<garnt> (indictinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (air whooshing) </garnt>
<garnt> - (indictinct), what do you
think of God Of High School? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just kind of pretty
and that's kind of about it. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's kind of, I hate to say it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I really do want the web tune anime </joey>
<joey> to like kill it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't know if it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know who wrote it, the story. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if the
inexperienced that first time, </connor>
<connor> but the story kind of does feel like </connor>
<garnt> it's a little all over
the place right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because God Of High School for me </garnt>
<garnt> is the one show I really,
really wanna like. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna like God Of High School. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's a fucking
just a tournament talk </joey>
<joey> of an anime, right? </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> It should be my wet dream, </connor>
<connor> but for some reason I
just can't get into it. </connor>
<connor> I think he blew his loads too quickly, </connor>
<garnt> because it just started
with tournament Arg. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm not invested
in any of the characters. </garnt>
<garnt> It just feels weird. </garnt>
<connor> - I can see why it would
work in like a Monga formula. </connor>
<joey> - I've read the manual or
the original web to manual. </joey>
<garnt> - What's the manual like? </garnt>
<garnt> - The manual it's like... </garnt>
<joey> I dunno, the parts I like about the manual </joey>
<joey> is kind of the same parts
I like about the anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it doesn't mean that it's like, </joey>
<joey> as you said, it's not... </joey>
<joey> I think it did kind of
kick off a little too hard </joey>
<joey> at the beginning where it was just like </joey>
<joey> you gotta give me time to
like kind of ease into it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Because then the fights, </connor>
<joey> when you get the
flashbacks halfway through </joey>
<joey> it just kind of feels like weird. </joey>
<joey> Like a cliche. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm just like- </joey>
<joey> - Of course they have a backstory. </joey>
<joey> Everyone has a fucking backstory. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Who doesn't have a backstory. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Did it need to be in
the middle of the fight </joey>
<joey> that's the question, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> Most, shown in fat bad flashbacks </joey>
<connor> are in the middle of the fight. </connor>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Then it's on characters </garnt>
<connor> that we already have
some understanding of, </connor>
<joey> most of the time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then it builds upon it. </joey>
<joey> But when it's the only
introduction you have </joey>
<joey> to that character. </joey>
<connor> Like the guy, when he's
sick friend, it's like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just go to Stonewall before. </connor>
<connor> And now you want me to give a
shit cause his a sick friend? </connor>
<joey> - Now its like, Oh, shit we
have to shoe horn a personality, </joey>
<joey> right now, quickly. </joey>
<connor> - Bro it's 2020, everyone
has a fucking sick friend. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<connor> And the main villain, it
just kind of seems like, </connor>
<connor> why would anyone make
a deal with that guy? </connor>
<connor> - I Don't know. </connor>
<connor> - That guy looks like a loan shark. </connor>
<connor> When the guy comes up, she's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'll save your friend
if you fight for me." </connor>
<connor> That sounds like the sketchiest deal ever. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like what. </connor>
<connor> It's like a green to do
like a homeless fight. </connor>
<connor> And for some meth it's of
course the homeless man </connor>
<connor> isn't gonna give you meth. </connor>
<connor> You're fighting a homeless man. </connor>
<connor> It's not illegal, is this legal. </connor>
<connor> It was a mess. </connor>
<connor> The whole thing was, just you watch it </connor>
<connor> and you're like, none of this is good, </connor>
<connor> but I'll keep watching 'cause it's pretty- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - I really want to like it because it's, </connor>
<connor> it looks so good. </connor>
<connor> - It's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Mapper, blew it out of the
park with the flight animation. </connor>
<connor> And it's every episode has a really, </connor>
<connor> really good looking fight. </connor>
<connor> And I've really, really want
to be invested in this flights. </connor>
<connor> But for me, it's just
like watching fireworks. </connor>
<joey> It's like really pretty. </joey>
<joey> And then I get nothing out of it </joey>
<joey> and I'm going to watch it next week, </joey>
<joey> because I really want to get invested. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> I hope it turns around and gets better, </joey>
<joey> because at the moment it's
just not doing it for me. </joey>
<joey> And even though something
like Tower Of God, </joey>
<connor> is that feel worse animated. </connor>
<connor> That drew me into his
world and characters, </connor>
<garnt> and then like everything so
much quicker and so much faster. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now I agree with that. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean, control
is more originals coming, </connor>
<connor> so I'm hoping one of them is- </connor>
<joey> - Isn't Noblesse getting an anime from- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> What I've heard. </joey>
<joey> I'm probably most looking forward to that, </joey>
<joey> because I think out of the three, </joey>
<connor> like, God Of High School,
(indictinct), Noblesse. </connor>
<connor> I've probablu enjoy the
Noblesse probably the most. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and then they
make an original shows. </connor>
<connor> - And now they're making a bunch
of original shows, as well. </connor>
<garnt> So yeah, it's gonna be interesting. </garnt>
<joey> - When are they gonna start
animating the adult manual. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, dude, I was just about to say. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (indictinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - No I just wanna talk about adult manuel- </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude if they make an
anime for like six a size. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or like, what's the other
one, the one with the- </garnt>
<garnt> - Sweet Guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sweet Guy, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sweet Guy. </garnt>
<joey> - That's my fucking favorite dudes. </joey>
<connor> - That's a Hara Monga. </connor>
<connor> - Sweet Guy, oh, my God,
you need to read Sweet Guy. </connor>
<garnt> Sweet Guy its basically a
Hera Monga, but for adults. </garnt>
<connor> - That sounds really familiar. </connor>
<joey> - Sweet Guys is the one where the guy, </joey>
<joey> gets like zapped by
like an AB like machine. </joey>
<connor> And then he develops the power </connor>
<garnt> to make any girl horny
just by touching her. </garnt>
<garnt> So he has the power of
the cum touch, right? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And his this guy who's basically like, </garnt>
<connor> the Rent A Girlfriend protagonist. </connor>
<joey> - Like Joni Sins. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> He is. </connor>
<joey> He's like Korean Johnny Sins. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's this incell who
gets this superpower. </joey>
<connor> - Its always an incell. </connor>
<joey> - Its always the incell. </joey>
<joey> - Where he gets the super power of like, </joey>
<joey> basically anytime he touches a girl, </joey>
<joey> he can make them horny and wanna fuck him. </joey>
<joey> And then he does a lot of fucking. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> A lot of fucking. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds great. </joey>
<joey> - But the one main girl
that he's aiming for, </joey>
<garnt> the power of the cum
touch doesn't work on her. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It only kills her headaches. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<connor> - Extremely useful. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - She's like, deim I have
these searing headaches. </joey>
<garnt> And the guy's like, let me help you. </garnt>
<joey> (inhales deeply) </joey>
<joey> Oh, its gone, thank you. </joey>
<joey> - My headaches gone. </joey>
<connor> And he was like, deim it, </connor>
<connor> I wanted you to get horny. </connor>
<connor> - Why are you not wet? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think, what the one
series I've been getting into </connor>
<connor> or was, had gotten into was Miss Mystic. </connor>
<connor> What I recommended for you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I discovered Miss Mystic, </connor>
<connor> after I binged Domestic Girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I want
something spicy in my life. </connor>
<connor> I need to keep the spice train going. </connor>
<connor> And Miss Mystic I feel is
that it's that perfect mixture </connor>
<garnt> of just a nice spicy story
and like unlike sex, as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much, it's
like a really compelling, </joey>
<joey> I actually give a shit, </joey>
<joey> about the mystery behind the whole thing. </joey>
<joey> While also being like, "Oh, yay, boobies." </joey>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<joey> - Gonna explain to Cornner
what the main plot- </joey>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<joey> So there's of course incell
protagonists (indictinct). </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's always the incell protagonist. </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I made
this joke in my video, </connor>
<connor> but I'm like, why is it
that all of these fucking, </connor>
<connor> incell protagonists have
to go through a clumsiness, </connor>
<connor> litmus test and pass
it with flying colors. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's so true. </connor>
<connor> - It's always the clumsy
motherfucker, right? </connor>
<connor> Because, he's on a train. </connor>
<connor> He sees this really pretty girl </connor>
<connor> and he's like, deim she's hot. </connor>
<joey> And then of course his
clumsiness kicks in, </joey>
<joey> spills coffee all over her. </joey>
<joey> He guides her to the toilet
to help her get changed </joey>
<joey> or whatnot, he's waiting outside. </joey>
<joey> And then suddenly he gets this message </joey>
<joey> from the girl and she's
masturbating in the toilet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> She's just full on
masturbating in the toilet. </joey>
<garnt> - She basically just
sends a premium Snapchat </garnt>
<garnt> to (indictinct) essentially. </garnt>
<garnt> But he can't save it and
there's no traces of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And so he's like, what the fuck </joey>
<joey> is this actually the
girl that I just helped </joey>
<garnt> and where the fuck did the
video come from and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And so now there's this entire mystery, </garnt>
<garnt> behind this main girl that
he's trying to get with. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like, who the fuck is she? </connor>
<connor> And why is she fuck with my life- </connor>
<joey> - That sounds oddly amazing, </joey>
<connor> but also, this is like coming
on the mystery expression </connor>
<garnt> or something. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, it totally is, 'cause the more... </garnt>
<connor> Basically the more he gets
involved with this girl </connor>
<garnt> and the more his life gets fucked up. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So, he's already has a girlfriend- </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't stick your dick in (indictinct). </garnt>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - He doesn't know if it's
this girl that's causing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just coincidentally, </joey>
<joey> when he met this girl his life started... </joey>
<joey> His life just- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Fucking good. </joey>
<connor> - It's really good. </connor>
<connor> Its really good. </connor>
<connor> - Viral downwards. </connor>
<joey> And like a lot of things
keep happening to him, </joey>
<joey> like messages being sent </joey>
<joey> or like videos being
leaked and everything. </joey>
<joey> And there's no way to trace it. </joey>
<joey> And he doesn't know who
is fucking with him. </joey>
<garnt> He doesn't know who's fucking with him. </garnt>
<garnt> Why they're fucking with him. </garnt>
<joey> But someone is. </joey>
<joey> - Because the girl that
he's trying to get with </joey>
<joey> is, looks and acts really
innocent in front of him. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then there's this entire mystery </joey>
<connor> of like, is she the one that's actually- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - Fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - It's really good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I wanna read that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> It's the mystery is so well-prepared </joey>
<joey> that you actually give a shit about it </joey>
<joey> and you're not just reading it </joey>
<garnt> for the tits and ass, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he's... </garnt>
<joey> Actually, he's not an incell, </joey>
<joey> 'cause he has a girlfriend,
doesn't he, in this one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of like 10 years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I forgot. </joey>
<joey> He's actually gonna get
married to this girl. </joey>
<garnt> And so like, whatever happens, </garnt>
<garnt> starts fucking up with their relationship- </garnt>
<joey> - His mentality goes
more and more in-sober. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does. </garnt>
<joey> - He bowls into an incell. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And what's really good
about it is the story is... </joey>
<joey> The story compliments the sex scenes, </joey>
<joey> as much as, it's not just
sex for the sake of sex. </joey>
<joey> They actually, compliment each other. </joey>
<joey> There's actually a reason why he's in all </joey>
<joey> of these different situations. </joey>
<joey> - And the art and character
design is so good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I wanna talk about that with web comics. </joey>
<joey> How does everyone- </joey>
<joey> - Why are they also good? </joey>
<garnt> - Why is the art also good </garnt>
<garnt> and why they all colored? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's exactly what I say it might be, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, why is it... </garnt>
<garnt> Is it just like a
coincidence that every Manuel </garnt>
<joey> that I looked up for this video, </joey>
<joey> just happened to have the
most godly fucking art </joey>
<joey> and character design, </joey>
<connor> because I don't get
that frequency in Mongo. </connor>
<connor> Mongo for me is like a very
hit and miss sometimes. </connor>
<connor> It's like, sometimes it's like, okay, </connor>
<joey> the story's really fucking good, </joey>
<connor> but the art is kind of (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> Talking about (indictinct). </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> And then sometimes it's the
other way around, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, man, this Mongo
would be so fucking good </joey>
<joey> if only the story was good. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the art looks amazing. </joey>
<joey> But for some reason, every
Manuel that I've read </joey>
<joey> it's always like scored. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Both ends of the spectrum. </joey>
<joey> I dunno if it's just my
expectations of Manuel, </joey>
<joey> it's just so low that
anything will impress me </joey>
<garnt> or if it's genuinely good. </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's one thing I can compliment, </garnt>
<joey> about every Manuel I've met </joey>
<joey> is that the art is always fantastic. </joey>
<connor> And it's colored. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you get it. </connor>
<garnt> Imagine getting a full color chapter. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like a gift from Jesus </garnt>
<garnt> or something every time it come out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Reading Joe Joe colored was amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, Fan Don I think, </joey>
<joey> all the fans colored. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like (indictinct). </connor>
<joey> - And in the world of web comics </joey>
<joey> this shit is just normalized. </joey>
<joey> - I know it's crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
reading Solo Leveling, as well. </joey>
<joey> Which is, on paper, the most generic, </joey>
<garnt> power fantasy show ever. </garnt>
<connor> - Sounds like it's up your alley there. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Of course I fucking loved it. </garnt>
<connor> - Why did you love power
fantasy one so much. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, because, okay. </garnt>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - He wants to feel strong. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know I figured this out </garnt>
<garnt> is because power fancy shows to me </garnt>
<garnt> are like the turn my brain off. </garnt>
<connor> These shows are the ones that
activate my monkey brain. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was, for the
longest time, I couldn't- </connor>
<connor> - We all have a monkey brain. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - For like the longest time. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't figure out the
appeal of slice of life. </connor>
<connor> Like a lot of people like slice of life. </connor>
<connor> I've just never been able to get into- </connor>
<connor> - I like slice of life. </connor>
<joey> - And then I realized,
I think my mentality </joey>
<joey> when watching these trashy
Sekai power, fancy shit </joey>
<connor> it's the same kind of mindset </connor>
<connor> when people have when
they watch slice of life. </connor>
<connor> Which is just switch
my brain off and just- </connor>
<connor> - Just enjoy what you're watching. </connor>
<connor> - Just enjoy what I'm watching. </connor>
<connor> Power fantacy has given me the
minimal amount of engagement. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Just the minimal, just enough
to activate the monkey brain, </garnt>
<garnt> but not enough to make me think anything. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it like, 'cause you liked the idea </connor>
<connor> that it could be you in
the powerful position. </connor>
<connor> Is that why? </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - It's like the biggest
compliment, yet biggest diss. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's why I
call them trash, right? </joey>
<garnt> Cause I know they're fucking trash. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't watch them to
engage myself in any way, </garnt>
<garnt> shape or form. </garnt>
<joey> - So, it's not a matter of
like immersing yourself. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I know how it feels to be like 15 </connor>
<joey> and watching Sao and you're
like, God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<joey> - I wanna be Kaito so bad. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna be so fucking OP in real life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then you realize shit, </joey>
<connor> that's kind of incell. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Hella incell. </connor>
<connor> - Like all my problems will be solved </connor>
<connor> if I'm just better than everyone else. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> If this is a world that relies on strength </connor>
<connor> and I'm just disgustingly over power- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> My life will just be easy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - No one can call me an asshole or- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> - Alpha male way of thinking. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's what it is though. </connor>
<connor> Like, especially when you're younger, </connor>
<joey> and you think like, all my life- </joey>
<connor> - I wanna grow up to be like that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you're like, </connor>
<connor> okay, well maybe I'm not
fitting in at school. </connor>
<connor> I wanna be (indictinct) and fuck shit up. </connor>
<connor> I bet he gets ass if he wants it. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There was definitely a
point in my teenage hood. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think in a lot of other people, </garnt>
<garnt> when they were teenagers where, </garnt>
<garnt> we watched power fantasies, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we want to be the
fucking main character. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the appeal like
there's always still </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of appeal, that I
don't think I've ever lost that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really. </garnt>
<connor> I think it grew out of that. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I still have that with Hara Monga. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause when I was like, grow up, </connor>
<connor> I thought like when I was like 15 </connor>
<connor> I thought Talavera was
like a gift from God. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm just like, bro </connor>
<joey> I wanna be Rito is so fucking hard </joey>
<joey> and get all these girls. </joey>
<joey> And now I have read over it again, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, your the same. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That feeling is still there dude. </joey>
<joey> - It's like reading Sweet Guy. </joey>
<joey> - God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<joey> - You get to see this
guy, fuck a load of girls. </joey>
<connor> And you're like, it's like, </connor>
<connor> oh I'm feeling the power of
fancy I felt when I was 15. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<garnt> - It's really weird, right? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you in like very
long-term relationships, </connor>
<connor> yes, I just want to fuck
everybody (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - You got to play that
question real safe boys. </connor>
<connor> - Why you put me in an edge like that? </connor>
<connor> - Sidney's like listening. </connor>
<connor> You wanna fucks other
people Garnt? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like Sidney's watching
with eagle eyes right now. </connor>
<garnt> Just like, oh, what's he gonna say? </garnt>
<connor> - Just say it (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - Say it. </connor>
<connor> - Say I'm not good enough for you. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, but I feel like a
lot of guys never grow out </garnt>
<garnt> of that phase when they're a teenager. </garnt>
<joey> There's always a little bit of teenager. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Everyone has that horny monkey brain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like one show I've been
really enjoying recently </joey>
<joey> has been a Demon School Academy, </joey>
<joey> which is power fantasy. </joey>
<garnt> But it takes it to another fucking level. </garnt>
<garnt> This guy is like more
OP than any other wise- </garnt>
<joey> - Is that the white head
like huge buff character is- </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<joey> - Or is that something else? </joey>
<connor> - Wasn't that the really
shitty animated one, </connor>
<joey> The Tale Of Gary or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that one. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - No, it's like tale of
like Greg or something. </connor>
<connor> It's a really white name. </connor>
<connor> - Its the one who fucks the ogres. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember, as well. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the tail, right, of fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> - I know exactly what I'm talking about. </garnt>
<joey> - Like fucking clip art animation. </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - All I remember is that he
has the whitest name in imagine </connor>
<connor> it's like Glen or like Greg or something. </connor>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> The legend of Gary (indictinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - But I know this guy
from Demon School Academy, </garnt>
<garnt> he opens up the episode with him, </garnt>
<garnt> beating up a guy to
death with his heartbeat. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, this is so over the top. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like the most satirical, </garnt>
<garnt> non-statistical show I've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> He's so OP that you're like, </garnt>
<joey> they can't be taken this seriously, </joey>
<garnt> but it is played off in the
series totally seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> But the situations themselves
just feel satirical, </garnt>
<joey> because he dies about... </joey>
<joey> He's died about three times
in the shows in the show now. </joey>
<joey> But he's so OP that he's like, </joey>
<joey> you think that killing would make me... </joey>
<joey> Would be enough to make me die? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes I have seen that. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I saw that meme. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm enjoying the shows for
like totally different reasons. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just monkey, my monkey
brain is like clapping now. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fucking fantastic. </garnt>
<joey> - It sounds like a (indictinct) I know. </joey>
<joey> If I wanted to just like fucking around </joey>
<joey> and just be like, I'm gonna
make the most generic, </joey>
<joey> satirical just parody of
power, fantasy, I know, </joey>
<joey> that would be the plot. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the Kanye West,
the power fantasy light levels. </garnt>
<joey> Because it's just become
a parody of itself. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> You know what power
anime I really enjoyed, </connor>
<joey> it was the one with that fucking, </joey>
<joey> I was gonna say the schools, </joey>
<joey> but that doesn't help at all. </joey>
<joey> The one with the, it's a magical school </joey>
<joey> and he has no powers. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<garnt> It's a different one. </garnt>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> It's different. </joey>
<connor> It's the one with the guns. He makes guns. </connor>
<connor> He's a famous gun maker. </connor>
<connor> - He makes guns. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> He makes guns in the show. </connor>
<connor> It's like a certain magical,
not a certain magical Index. </connor>
<connor> It's like, a fucking, a
certain magical high school </connor>
<connor> with some fucking shit. </connor>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking losing my mind here. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like he describing... </connor>
<joey> You just went from Index to
like fucking rail gun now. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like fucking similar
vibes to that show. </joey>
<joey> - Is it an Easter guy? </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - It's just a power fantasy- </joey>
<connor> - The guy who everyone
thinks he's gonna his sister </connor>
<joey> in the school. </joey>
<joey> - Again, your not
narrowing it down at all. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I know the one. </connor>
<connor> Is it the one with the white and green- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know the one I'm on about. </joey>
<garnt> - I know the one your on about. </garnt>
<connor> Mahoka, I think... </connor>
<garnt> - Don't know the full name. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, the irregular high school one. </joey>
<joey> - That's it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I said before. </connor>
<connor> You were like no, that's not it. </connor>
<connor> - No, I was talking about a
different one at that time. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That was a hera Manama. </connor>
<connor> This one's a different
one about a power fantasy. </connor>
<connor> - Wait so were you talking about before? </connor>
<joey> - No not that, I was talking
about a different one. </joey>
<joey> - I cleaned it up being like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, you're the one you
were talking about before </joey>
<joey> was the irregular magic (indictinct). </joey>
<connor> - When we take our next two minute break, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna look it up. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I'm frustrated now. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, okay, </joey>
<joey> we're done with the regular high school. </joey>
<connor> And you're like, what's the one- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't talking about a
regular magic high school before, </connor>
<connor> I am now, Joey. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's a good show. </connor>
<garnt> End of comment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is like the fact that these shows </garnt>
<garnt> are so generic, they're trying
to distinguish between them, </garnt>
<connor> and it becomes impossible to us. </connor>
<connor> So, what did you like
about that show, Connor? </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - The exact same shows as
every other (indictinct). </connor>
<joey> I don't know, it was a good show. </joey>
<joey> - I did not enjoy that show, </joey>
<joey> because, again, as you said
it was exactly the same </joey>
<connor> as every other fucking power fantasy. </connor>
<joey> - For some reason that shows... </joey>
<connor> I don't know- </connor>
<connor> - Its so popular here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I see it fucking everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - I kinda get it, 'cause
I fucking loved it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I loved
it, but I loved it. </connor>
<joey> - It's so boring. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, this is exactly the same </connor>
<joey> as every other light novel I've ever read. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I've tried to justify why I
like certain power fantasies, </garnt>
<garnt> or certain generic,
light novel adaptations </garnt>
<garnt> more than others, and I've just given up. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like they're all trash, </garnt>
<garnt> I like this one, I have no idea why, </garnt>
<garnt> and I guess I'm just trash as well. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Fair enough. </joey>
<joey> - Okay I described it the same way, </joey>
<joey> that I described the
appeal of light novels, </joey>
<joey> or how I perceive the appeal
of like a slice of life, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Slice of life, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So like, why do you like Slice Of Life? </connor>
<connor> What's the appeal to you? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause to me, how people view, </connor>
<garnt> like these Powell fancy
Easter Carla, whatever shows, </garnt>
<garnt> is how I view Slice Of Life. </garnt>
<garnt> To me, they're all the fucking same. </garnt>
<joey> - No, they are. </joey>
<joey> And I don't deny that, </joey>
<joey> because I've gotten a lot of criticism, </joey>
<joey> in the past being like,
you like Slice Of Life? </joey>
<joey> You could be doing anything else </joey>
<joey> and yet you're watching
the fictional lives, </joey>
<joey> of these fictional characters. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I think that's
the part about it though, </joey>
<joey> because it's like, again,
when I watch an anime, </joey>
<joey> I'm thinking way too hard about it, </joey>
<garnt> like I always have to,
I'm always looking at it, </garnt>
<garnt> like some kind of
analytical, kind of like, </garnt>
<joey> okay, why do I like this show,
why do I not like this show? </joey>
<joey> And slice of life just provides nothing, </joey>
<garnt> that nothing becomes a something,
do you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because- </garnt>
<garnt> - This is getting
philosophical now. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I've always tried describing like this, </garnt>
<joey> because there's nothing there </joey>
<joey> that nothing becomes something. </joey>
<joey> And that thing, because
they're not doing anything, </joey>
<connor> everything they do becomes entertaining. </connor>
<connor> Because there's just
nothing there to begin with. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't do it. </garnt>
<connor> I can't, I can't. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe you should have
been the monk Joey. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, right? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah man, shave that
hair Joey, let's go. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I mean maybe
there's a part of me as well, </joey>
<joey> the reason why for example, I
really like "Non Non Biyori". </joey>
<joey> Right, it was like, because it's sat </joey>
<joey> in the middle of the nowhere, </joey>
<joey> in like the butt fuck
middle of nowhere of Japan </joey>
<joey> in the mountains, right? </joey>
<joey> And where I grew up, like
at my grandma's place </joey>
<joey> it looked very similar. </joey>
<joey> So, I think a lot of
that kind of atmosphere, </joey>
<connor> is brings me back to my childhood, </connor>
<garnt> of like, just being in like
the middle of a rice field </garnt>
<garnt> and just trying to find anything to do </garnt>
<garnt> for entertainment sake, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And just watching these
characters go through that, </garnt>
<joey> it's just like, okay,
yeah, I can relate to that. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of cute and wholesome, right? </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think the only Slice Of Life, </garnt>
<garnt> I've enjoyed ever, like
pure Slice Of Life, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think, I can't
even remember the name, </garnt>
<garnt> it was the one with the two girls, </garnt>
<garnt> going around to the post-apocalyptic- </garnt>
<joey> - Girl's Last Tour... </joey>
<garnt> - Is it "Girls Last Tour"?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't even, yeah, "Girls Last Tour". </joey>
<joey> - Because that's one of
my favorite Slice Of Live. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the only Slice
Of Life I've ever enjoyed. </garnt>
<joey> And I still couldn't finish it. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because I need to
be in a very specific... </joey>
<joey> I needed to be in like
such a specific mood </joey>
<joey> to watch that show and be
able to like not fall asleep. </joey>
<joey> - It's one of the most quieter
shows I've ever watched. </joey>
<garnt> Because a lot of the times, </garnt>
<garnt> there's only these two girl characters, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's almost no
fucking music or background, </garnt>
<connor> it's very avant garde, </connor>
<connor> it's like watching a fucking art school, </connor>
<connor> like project it's black and
white and spoken in French, </connor>
<connor> and it's like... </connor>
<connor> - The opposite of what I want. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it looks and
feels very pretentious, </connor>
<joey> if you don't understand the
deeper meanings behind it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause I feel like
I need the bare minimum, </garnt>
<joey> of engagement for me to enjoy a show, </joey>
<joey> Even if it's just the
same kind of engagement </joey>
<connor> I've seen a million times before, </connor>
<connor> I will take that over Slice Of Life. </connor>
<connor> - When I like used to watch shows, </connor>
<joey> without looking what they were. </joey>
<joey> I was just watching a show, right? </joey>
<joey> On the contrary, I just click it. </joey>
<joey> And then I'm watching a Slice Of Life </joey>
<connor> and I get two episodes and I'm like, wait, </connor>
<connor> nothing's gonna happened. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> They're not gonna do anything are they? </connor>
<joey> - Why is it like you'll
like monkey brains, </joey>
<connor> just like it lags for a minute, </connor>
<connor> and it takes you to whole episodes. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> Hold on. </joey>
<garnt> - In this case, I actually
agree with Connor. </garnt>
<connor> - You get like two
episodes then you're like, </connor>
<connor> wait, they're not gonna do
a single thing are they? </connor>
<connor> They're not gonna go anywhere. </connor>
<garnt> - Because, I remember
when I first watched Kaon, </garnt>
<connor> and the "Kaon" that... </connor>
<garnt> The entirety of the Kaon
fandom hates me now, </garnt>
<joey> because of that one
review that I did on Kaon. </joey>
<joey> Because I didn't understand
the appeal of Slice Of Life, </joey>
<joey> back then. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I watched "Kaon" with
the same kind of expectations. </joey>
<joey> - Anything would happen. </joey>
<joey> - Any other show. </joey>
<joey> And people have told me
the appeal for "Kaon", </joey>
<joey> and I understand it now, but
I can never relate to it. </joey>
<joey> Because I still can never
get that same kind of, </joey>
<garnt> connection to a Slice Of Life show. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I don't blame anybody, </joey>
<joey> who says that they don't
like Slice Of Life, at all. </joey>
<joey> Like in any Slice Of Life, </joey>
<joey> they'll just be like, no, it's all boring, </joey>
<joey> nothing fucking happens, </joey>
<garnt> I'd rather be watching like
a show anime or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a generic show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I totally get that, </garnt>
<garnt> because again, I don't wanna
say it's an acquired taste </garnt>
<garnt> or anything, but I feel it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It is an acquired taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I'm gonna say the
same thing about Isekai Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - And that's okay man, it's good man. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna say that about music. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Music isn't acquired taste. </connor>
<connor> - Okay if I'm gonna watch Slice Of Life, </connor>
<connor> I'd rather just watch, I don't
know, real life, I guess. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather watch like a documentary, </connor>
<connor> about something that's real I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - But even like a documentary, </garnt>
<connor> there's, I don't know- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like a story line. </connor>
<connor> - It's still engaging. </connor>
<connor> - Stuff happened. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the closest
thing to RL Slice Of Life, </connor>
<connor> is, what's that Japanese
TV show, Terrace House. </connor>
<connor> Have you ever seen it? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, fuck it, I can't
watch Terrace House. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's like Slice Of Life, IRL. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you wanna watch that, and
I'm like, what's the appeal, </connor>
<connor> it's like oh, you can just watch
them do their daily things, </connor>
<connor> and have your thoughts about that. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, I can have my
thoughts about my real life. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> I don't need to fucking
think about something like- </connor>
<connor> - Well, it's the exact same reason, </connor>
<garnt> why people wanted to watch
"Big Brother", right? </garnt>
<garnt> - They wanted to watch it
like a shit show though. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like "Terrace House"
is very like just polite. </connor>
<connor> They were always just like... </connor>
<garnt> - I never watched it. </garnt>
<joey> - I could never get into
Big Brother either though. </joey>
<joey> - Now I could relate to that. </joey>
<joey> - I liked watching "Big Brother", </joey>
<joey> just because the people
that they had on there, </joey>
<joey> were just the most fucking
degenerative fucking way- </joey>
<garnt> - That was like finely selected. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah- </garnt>
<joey> - Craziest people they could find. </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe these
are not real people. </joey>
<joey> And then later I found out
that the entire show scripted, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, oh that
makes a lot of sense. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, they obviously put a lot of work </garnt>
<connor> behind the scenes to make it entertaining, </connor>
<garnt> whereas I feel with Terrace House, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just here are just
people living their lives, </garnt>
<joey> and there's a camera watching them. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't get why that's
fun, I just don't get it. </joey>
<connor> Maybe I'm too monkey brain. </connor>
<joey> - There was a show-
- I'm with you dude, </joey>
<joey> I'm with you, on this one I'm like... </joey>
<joey> - I got my own life to worry about, </joey>
<joey> how the fuck I worry
about what other people, </joey>
<joey> just having an awkward conversation, </joey>
<joey> I can experience that myself. </joey>
<joey> - There was a show that
preceded "Terrace House", </joey>
<garnt> and I don't know if
it's still going on now, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's called Inori. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was a show that's kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> similar to "Terrace House", </garnt>
<joey> but there was like a
romance element to it. </joey>
<garnt> It's essentially think
of a Harem anime, IRL. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the only way I can describe it. </garnt>
<garnt> So, they would like gather- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it like "Love Island", </garnt>
<joey> or some shit like that. </joey>
<joey> - It's similar to that. </joey>
<joey> But, they would get a
bunch of guys and girls, </joey>
<joey> single guys and girls, and
they put them on this bus, </joey>
<joey> and they would take the bus, </joey>
<joey> and they would basically just
do an entire tour of Japan. </joey>
<joey> Like wherever the fuck they wanted. </joey>
<joey> But at every stop, one
of the guys or the girls, </joey>
<joey> had to like confess basically,
to be like, I like you. </joey>
<joey> And if they responded back positively, </joey>
<joey> then the bus would leave the two there, </joey>
<joey> and then basically just left
them, do their own thing. </joey>
<joey> - In the middle of nowhere? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it was, </joey>
<joey> but it was harsher when
the other person denied it, </joey>
<joey> because then the person who confessed, </joey>
<joey> would be left there,
basically, on their own, </joey>
<joey> and just watching like a guy </joey>
<joey> or a girl get denied on that show </joey>
<joey> was the most heart wrenching, </joey>
<joey> yet somehow the most
fucking entertaining thing </joey>
<joey> that you've ever seen. </joey>
<joey> Because it's just like, is he gonna? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it was, it was like a Harem anime, </connor>
<connor> where like, one of the best goals </connor>
<connor> is getting prepared to
confess to the main character- </connor>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> Come on, come on, </joey>
<joey> I've seen you like go
camping with this dude man, </joey>
<joey> like you gave us some good vibes, </joey>
<joey> you got this girl, you've got this. </joey>
<joey> And then when the guy's like </joey>
<joey> "No sorry there's another
girl there I like." </joey>
<joey> And the sad music just starts playing. </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, no, it's
like watching your... </connor>
<joey> Going back to the whole
sports thing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like watching the grand finals, </joey>
<joey> and the one team's just like flubbing it </joey>
<garnt> at the last second. </garnt>
<joey> Just like, no, I lost the game. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but I prefer that over "Terrace." </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I gave Terrace House a go. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, it would seem like on paper, </connor>
<connor> because I like Slice Of Life, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It would seem like this is
a show made for me, right. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, here's what confuses me. </joey>
<joey> Do you have a favorite Slice Of life </joey>
<joey> and how do you justify that? </joey>
<joey> (Joey exhales heavily) </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I mean 'cause so many shows can be, </joey>
<joey> defined as Slice Of Life shows
and yet they're not, right? </joey>
<joey> I mean, like, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> I guess "Lucky Star" will
probably be my favorite, </joey>
<connor> just because... </connor>
<connor> - It because Meimeis? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because of the Meimeis, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it appeals to the
Otaku culture, right? </joey>
<joey> And like that was a huge part... </joey>
<connor> That was like when I was deeply
rooted in the Otaku culture. </connor>
<joey> So that anime spoke to me,
dude, it hit different. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That was a slice of life that- </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - Gonna go a whole episode- </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No dude. </joey>
<connor> No, but I'd said that's
probably my favorite, </connor>
<connor> for those reasons, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Gentlemen, I found out
what the show was called, </joey>
<connor> it's called "Trinity Seven". </connor>
<joey> - I have watched that. </joey>
<garnt> - I have not even watched that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can tell you it is exactly the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garbage. </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally the
same, just a bit older. </joey>
<joey> - I think he can like block magic, </joey>
<joey> or can counter it or something? </joey>
<joey> - It's garbage, essentially. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's was hot garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really bad. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, wait, here's a
question for you guys then. </joey>
<joey> What is the worst show that you think... </joey>
<joey> What is your guilty pleasure, I guess. </joey>
<joey> Do believe in guilty pleasures, 'cause... </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> Absolutely, I mean, I
mentioned how I got my friend, </garnt>
<garnt> to watch "Kiss Sis" with me, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> I own all 23 volumes of
"The Manga," as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indictinct) </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you fund that shit man? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's so bad yet so good. </garnt>
<joey> It's like it is... </joey>
<joey> I have a lot of guilty pleasure
shows, I'd like to admit. </joey>
<joey> - Mm-hmm. </joey>
<joey> - But I think the biggest for
me where I can openly be like, </joey>
<joey> yeah I know this thing sucks,
but man, I can't put it down, </joey>
<joey> it's definitely "Kiss Sis". </joey>
<joey> - There's so many shows I like that suck, </joey>
<connor> but I wouldn't call it a guilty pleasure. </connor>
<connor> I'm fine with being
like, yeah I like that. </connor>
<connor> - So you don't believe
in a guilty pleasure or? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, maybe I've
just gotten to the point </connor>
<joey> where I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<connor> - That's my point now, I just like shows. </connor>
<joey> - I just don't give a fuck anymore. </joey>
<joey> - But I guess I put some
shows in different categories, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause it's a different kind of enjoyment, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I would never recommend, </connor>
<connor> I would never actively
recommend some of these, </connor>
<connor> fucking shows I watch, </connor>
<joey> but I definitely have some
shows that I put in an ad, </joey>
<joey> like an actual good kind of enjoyment, </joey>
<garnt> if there is anything as like
kind of a good enjoyment. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I say "Kiss Sis"
is my guilty pleasure right, </joey>
<connor> but I'm not guilty for liking that show. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's just my pleasure. </connor>
<joey> I'm not guilty, it's just my pleasure. </joey>
<connor> But, again, I just call
it a guilty pleasure, </connor>
<connor> because I don't openly be like,
have you watched Kiss Sis, </connor>
<connor> like I don't openly recommend it, </connor>
<connor> unless you're my friend
from high school, right? </connor>
<connor> Unless you're my friend from high school. </connor>
<joey> - It's a Yahudi scene about to happen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> But, I have lots of shows like that, </garnt>
<garnt> like "Yosuga No Sora" is another one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still need to watch that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched that entire thing, </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember when Dee was like, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause Dee Revel House, </joey>
<joey> he has this series called
"The Surviving Series", </joey>
<joey> where he goes and like
basically to get people, </joey>
<joey> to watch these like
absolutely hot garbage shows, </joey>
<joey> and I remember he did an entire episode, </joey>
<joey> on "Yosuga No Sora" and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> bro I'm glad you didn't
call me onto this show, </joey>
<connor> because I would have been
praising the fuck out of the show </connor>
<connor> the entire time, I'm
like, I know this sucks, </connor>
<joey> I know that there is some
mad wind set shit going on </joey>
<garnt> in this show, but man,
it's so good. (laughs). </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he never called me, </joey>
<joey> to go on the "Domestic
Girlfriend" episode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - For good reason, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I still love domestic girlfriend, </joey>
<joey> it's hot garbage, the ending sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Would that be your guilty pleasure? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, because I would say, </joey>
<joey> the manga for "Domestic
Girlfriend" for like, </joey>
<joey> 80% of the manga for
"Domestic Girlfriend", </joey>
<joey> I still think it's a
fucking well-written show. </joey>
<joey> The way I describe it, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like a soap opera, </joey>
<joey> but the characters are actually
well-written in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> but the things that, the
events that happened, </joey>
<joey> in the soap opera are still
very soap opera stuff. </joey>
<joey> But the way they handled
it is still very good. </joey>
<joey> The anime I feel that's garbage. </joey>
<garnt> Because that skips, over a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of the actual character development. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Basically the anime speed run's shit. </garnt>
<garnt> The anime just took the
trashest moments from the manga, </garnt>
<garnt> and put it all in one package. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, well then Connor will like that. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I won't lie, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a speed run anime, right? </connor>
<connor> - But like the "Domestic
Girlfriend" manga ending, </connor>
<connor> everyone pretty much
agrees it's all garbage, </connor>
<garnt> and I've had time to sit in it now, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think I actually like the ending </garnt>
<garnt> of "Domestic Girlfriend" just because... </garnt>
<joey> - You're going through
the phase that I had, </joey>
<joey> with School Days, basically- </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's just like the
first time you watch it, </garnt>
<connor> and your just like, man,
this is hot garbage. </connor>
<connor> But then the more you think about it </connor>
<garnt> your like, you know what,
this actually might be genius. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, I think that
the series started off </garnt>
<garnt> as a flaming dumpster fire. </garnt>
<connor> And it ended in like a nuclear fallout </connor>
<connor> kind of dumpster. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it was on theme. </connor>
<connor> It was on point. </connor>
<connor> Like who got on this train, </connor>
<garnt> knowing he was about to crash </garnt>
<garnt> and thought he was gonna parallel park. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> We all started watching
Domestic Girlfriend, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we knew it was a fucking car crash. </garnt>
<garnt> What were we expecting? </garnt>
<garnt> - They let you know from episode one, </garnt>
<garnt> like literally the opening scene, </garnt>
<joey> you were just like, </joey>
<joey> this is gonna suck. </joey>
<garnt> This is gonna be messy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the best thing
it did was trick us into... </garnt>
<joey> Because it tricked us into thinking </joey>
<joey> it could have ended well, </joey>
<joey> because there was a lot of
well-written moments in it. </joey>
<joey> - They tricked us. </joey>
<joey> - They tricked us and they made us forget </joey>
<joey> that it was a dumpster fire- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> Because of the way it ended </joey>
<joey> it will forever stick in my mind. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm gonna reread that shit someday. </garnt>
<connor> - His telling his grandkids about this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah- </garnt>
<garnt> - I will tell my fucking
grandkids about the ending </garnt>
<garnt> of Domestic Girlfriend. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Do you have one like that Connor. </joey>
<joey> - No, not really. </joey>
<joey> I never really like... </joey>
<joey> - Or do you just not even
bother with like shows that? </joey>
<joey> - No, I feel like with... </joey>
<connor> Yeah, with shows normally I tend not to. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to think of what
have been some big animated, </connor>
<garnt> end controversially. </garnt>
<garnt> The bit that people didn't
know the ending of already. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, because of the Mongo. </garnt>
<connor> So its kinda hard animeted feel. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know right? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, you're talking about
anime original endings now </joey>
<joey> or like original anime. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Or if it's like from like a
game like school days, right? </joey>
<garnt> - What about something like
Darling And The Franks, </garnt>
<connor> which is the closest- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - That's was a fun (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I feel if darling... </connor>
<connor> If I watched Darling And The Franks, </connor>
<connor> without having been in
the anime community, </connor>
<connor> I would hate it. </connor>
<connor> But I loved the experience
that it gave me, </connor>
<joey> just like being a part
of the dumpster, fire. </joey>
<joey> - Like threatening the voice actors. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> That shit was ridiculous. </joey>
<connor> - Why is it the first thing that happens, </connor>
<connor> whenever someone's like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause the same thing happened
with Domestic Girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where the author just got death threats </connor>
<garnt> and like people would just
shit talking them online. </garnt>
<garnt> Like why do you do this? </garnt>
<joey> - It's because, I guess
they're just like the face </joey>
<garnt> of the show, right? </garnt>
<joey> Or the face of the problem
that resides in the show. </joey>
<joey> So it's just like, </joey>
<joey> they don't blame the
directors or the producers, </joey>
<joey> 'cause no one can see those people, right? </joey>
<joey> It's always the front facing people. </joey>
<connor> - Is it the Japanese
audiences is doing that? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I swear, I didn't
see any of that online. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't on my Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - I think it was kind of universal. </connor>
<joey> Like in the case with Domestic Girlfriend, </joey>
<joey> a lot of it was like the, </joey>
<joey> it was definitely the Asian population. </joey>
<connor> I don't know if was
specifically the Japanese. </connor>
<joey> I know I saw a lot of
like Chinese, Korean. </joey>
<garnt> - I think, because the author had </garnt>
<garnt> to actually come out and
say it was like foreigners. </garnt>
<garnt> So it wasn't people from Japan. </garnt>
<joey> I don't where it was from. </joey>
<garnt> - Might've been from the West, </garnt>
<connor> might have been from
other Asian countries- </connor>
<connor> - I know that at least in
the West all Meme culture, </connor>
<joey> pretty fucking cryptic if you're not from- </joey>
<joey> - It's shrouded in a very
large vail of circusim, right? </joey>
<joey> - Look extremely aggressive to someone </joey>
<joey> who doesn't understand this. </joey>
<joey> Probably like a competition- </joey>
<connor> - Wasn't there Japanese illustrator, </connor>
<connor> who's like apologizing for
all the sarcastic tweets </connor>
<connor> that will being made- </connor>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> - Someone like commented,
I think I saw this, </connor>
<connor> it was like, someone
had replied to that post </connor>
<connor> with the emoji with the gun, like huffing, </connor>
<connor> like keep posting. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it's so good, right? </joey>
<joey> We understood it. </joey>
<connor> But obviously the Japanese couldn't- </connor>
<connor> - And they were fighting back being like, </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> Please don't point that at me, </connor>
<connor> they took that at face value, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The took down that post, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they were like, they thought </joey>
<garnt> they were offending- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But all fucking memes are fucked up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I remember the, when
Villain Saga was airing, </connor>
<connor> people were sending like tweets </connor>
<joey> to the author of Vilan Saga,
calling him like a goat, </joey>
<joey> the goat. </joey>
<joey> - The goat. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And the author was like, why
are people calling me a goat? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Am I doing bad. </connor>
<connor> Have I done something bad? </connor>
<joey> - Memes do not translate. </joey>
<joey> - No, they do not translate well. </joey>
<connor> I don't like Japanese memes, </connor>
<garnt> I've always been curious how
the Japanese meme culture is? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, a lot of the
Japanese means that make it, </joey>
<joey> well, I mean a lot of the
best memes in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> stay on 2Chan. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> If you know anything about
2Chan, they're pretty bad. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I know they're like
even most than 4Chan. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> If you thought 4Chan was bad, </joey>
<joey> never gone to 2Chan. </joey>
<joey> I remember one of my friends, </joey>
<joey> he used to be on 4Chan a lot. </joey>
<joey> And then when I told him about 2chan, </joey>
<joey> he's like man for the
first time in my life, </joey>
<joey> I'm glad I never took Japanese. </joey>
<joey> Because if I could understand </joey>
<joey> what these threads were saying, holy shit, </joey>
<joey> I would just be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, I didn't know humans, </joey>
<joey> could say such horrible
things to one another." </joey>
<joey> It's really fucking brutal over there. </joey>
<joey> But the memes are very funny. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> The memes are great. </joey>
<joey> And luckily I think a lot of the best, </joey>
<joey> probably the safest
memes that start on 2Chan </joey>
<joey> do eventually make it on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> And man those fucking blow
up on Japanese, Twitter. </joey>
<joey> Like so crazily. </joey>
<joey> Like if you thought memes
on like Western Twitter, </joey>
<joey> were like, whoa, 50,000
retweets, holy shit. </joey>
<joey> Dude, I've seen Japanese memes </joey>
<joey> that have like a million retweets. </joey>
<joey> - Deim. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just like fuck, I
mean, yeah, it's a good meme, </connor>
<joey> but God deim guys. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, Western Twitter is just Tik Tok, </connor>
<joey> re-uploaded right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, basically. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, some of them are some of them </connor>
<connor> are pretty good to be fair. </connor>
<joey> - Your sure how long that's gonna last. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Conversation that
we're having right now. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Some of them were good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel from what I can see </joey>
<joey> with Japanese social media in general, </joey>
<joey> we've talked about internet hates a lot </joey>
<garnt> on this podcast before and
it feels like with Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> it's either you're really nice and polite </garnt>
<garnt> or it's like the fucking worsted. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude there's a reason why I never wanted </joey>
<joey> to start a Japanese YouTube channel. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I thought about it. </garnt>
<joey> When I first moved here, I was like, </joey>
<joey> should I start a separate channel </joey>
<joey> where I've, it's aimed towards
a Japanese audience, right? </joey>
<joey> It doesn't necessarily
have to be anime related. </joey>
<joey> I was just gonna do just a
regular vog style channel, </joey>
<joey> but all in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And then I watched a bunch
of Japanese YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> 'cause before I'd never really
watched Japanese YouTubers </joey>
<joey> and I saw their comments sections, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Nah, I don't want that. </joey>
<joey> I don't want any of that shit," </joey>
<joey> because, man, some of
the fucking like hate, </joey>
<joey> like some of the fucking hate movements </joey>
<joey> that happen towards Japanese
YouTubers are crazy. </joey>
<connor> I remember there was
one Japanese YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> who, and on Japanese
YouTubers, you fuck up once, </connor>
<connor> your career is done. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they will hold on to that shit </connor>
<connor> for the rest of your
career, until you're gone. </connor>
<garnt> Because there was one Japanese, YouTube- </garnt>
<garnt> (indictinct) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but to a completely
different degree. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know about that. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, people have very short memories. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> How many times is the Pole Bro fuck up </garnt>
<garnt> and they still get decent views, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But there was this one, Japanese YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> who didn't even do anything bad. </garnt>
<joey> He had a pet goldfish
and the goldfish died. </joey>
<joey> And so, he threw the goldfish... </joey>
<joey> He drained it down the toilet. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. All right. </joey>
<connor> - Basically, right. </connor>
<joey> Really standard, right? </joey>
<joey> Of course that's what you'd normally do. </joey>
<joey> It got so much hate that even at this day </joey>
<joey> and this happened like
four or five years ago, </joey>
<joey> I don't know about the accuracy of this, </joey>
<joey> don't quote me on this. </joey>
<joey> But it happened like
four or five years ago </joey>
<joey> and since then, every
single one of his videos </joey>
<joey> have gotten a 50% dislike ratio. </joey>
<garnt> - Deim. </garnt>
<joey> - Just from that one thing that he did </joey>
<joey> and people are still
holding onto it for it. </joey>
<garnt> For years now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just think they keep onto hate </garnt>
<joey> for like another level. </joey>
<joey> And I think that's why
the idol culture here, </joey>
<joey> must be so scary. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you fuck up once here </connor>
<connor> if you're an idol or
voice actors or something </connor>
<connor> and your career just done. </connor>
<joey> - They just expect perfection from you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It definitely feels like they... </joey>
<joey> The image that you
build, they immediately, </joey>
<joey> I'm in control of it. </joey>
<joey> And that if you... </joey>
<joey> Like you said, if you fuck up once, </joey>
<joey> it's like, they're almost
like entitled to you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - And if you ruin it, </joey>
<joey> well, you've ruined this
thing I liked, you did that. </joey>
<connor> You ruin this thing I enjoyed. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's like, what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> It's just me. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<joey> And sometimes they forget
that some of these people </joey>
<garnt> are just humans, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's kind of this mentality where </garnt>
<joey> they're not allowed to be
human in a lot of ways. </joey>
<joey> And that's what it feels like. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember the
first story I've ever heard </joey>
<joey> about this kind of situation happening </joey>
<joey> in the anime community
was probably with Hirano. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of like how his voice actress. </joey>
<garnt> Like there was a scandal
like back in the day- </garnt>
<joey> - Scandal quote, unquote. </joey>
<garnt> - Scandal, back in the day </garnt>
<garnt> when she was voicing in Harohe, </garnt>
<connor> she was voicing in Lucy Star, </connor>
<connor> she was like the triple
alias celebrity here. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - She was like one of the
hottest names in this industry. </connor>
<connor> And I think what happens is that, </connor>
<connor> she had a music career, as well. </connor>
<garnt> She had a band and I think she slept </garnt>
<garnt> with everyone in the band, </garnt>
<garnt> except for the bass guitar player. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Every bassis, (indictinct). </joey>
<garnt> - Like a moment of silence
for the bass guitar player. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every five or four subscribers- </garnt>
<joey> - Why is it always the basis, men. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> But, yeah, that story got outed </garnt>
<garnt> and her career just like
went from like A plus, AAA </garnt>
<garnt> to she had a trouble getting (indictinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, she completely
disappeared after that. </garnt>
<garnt> And since then she's disappeared. </garnt>
<garnt> And its crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Since then she's only had
like a few bigger roles. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the only last
role I remember her doing </garnt>
<joey> was doing Mickey from,
what's that, Para Side. </joey>
<joey> - Para Side, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I don't think I've
heard her in anything else </connor>
<garnt> that I can remember? </garnt>
<connor> - Like that would kind of
happen in the West though. </connor>
<joey> A little bit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<joey> - Like an entire career getting destroyed. </joey>
<joey> - Not an entire career being destroyed, </joey>
<connor> at least fucking Twitter
would be clowning on you. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> But this happened way before </connor>
<connor> the Twitter thing came out. </connor>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<connor> - This happened in like the mid 2000. </connor>
<connor> - The dudes online are like fucking like, </connor>
<connor> what do you mean you've slept with- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, this seems to be scary. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Scary men. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Would someone's career be over, </joey>
<garnt> just because, can you
think of a single person </garnt>
<connor> whose career would literally be over </connor>
<connor> if they had slept with someone </connor>
<connor> or if they came out to have
a boyfriend or something, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I can't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You get clowned on
you'd lose subscribers. </garnt>
<garnt> You'd lose viewers, maybe- </garnt>
<connor> - Actually you wouldn't,
actually lose your thing, </connor>
<connor> but, yeah, you would be clowned on pretty- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean the only person I can think of </connor>
<connor> is Pokemon, right? </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> I didn't know whether
to bring that up or not, </joey>
<joey> but I mean, if we're talking about </joey>
<joey> the most recent thing, right? </joey>
<joey> But, even then like what she's getting </joey>
<joey> is nowhere near as bad as
what some of these like idols, </joey>
<garnt> and musicians are getting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if Pokemon came out
today and she was like, </garnt>
<connor> Hey, I have a boyfriend. </connor>
<connor> She probably get less
attention than she does now. </connor>
<connor> But her career wouldn't be over. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - She'd still easily have a career. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought it was confirmed, right? </garnt>
<connor> It was. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it... </connor>
<connor> I dunno- </connor>
<joey> - I think the whole point was it's like, </joey>
<joey> well yeah of course she's human, </joey>
<joey> she's gonna have a relationship </joey>
<joey> and not everyone needs to know that. </joey>
<connor> It's fine. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> It's her choice if she wants to hide it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> There're those (indictinct),
man, they just like... </joey>
<connor> (breathing deeply) </connor>
<connor> - Dude, when YouTubers make videos, </connor>
<connor> like whether they were in
like a one week relationship, </connor>
<joey> like we're together,
it's like, (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I get like real fuck it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think like it says so
much about you and to me- </connor>
<joey> - At least wait a couple of months, man. </joey>
<connor> Like try and figure out if
it's like a real thing, right? </connor>
<joey> - To me it feels like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Not to be like, to say it,
but it's kind of like a, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'm going to have
sex for the first time. </connor>
<connor> I should announce it to the world." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, its is I slash, I had sex, right? </joey>
<connor> - It kinda is like... </connor>
<connor> I feel like it says a lot
about your maturity level </connor>
<connor> to do that, I think. </connor>
<connor> And it's normally I wouldn't
associate with a YouTube </connor>
<connor> who does that? </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it's also just </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people can do it
for click Bay, as well. </garnt>
<connor> - They do. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But either way, normally, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no good connotation </garnt>
<connor> that comes along with doing that, right? </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - There normally nothing
good that's coming... </connor>
<connor> Sure, they're probably very
happy, I'm glad for them. </connor>
<connor> But, let's be honest, at our age, </connor>
<joey> which most of the YouTubers are, </joey>
<joey> most of their relationships fail </joey>
<joey> when they are that early on. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Most of them do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, again, it's fine
if you wanna come out, </garnt>
<connor> but like, as you said,
if I watch like a... </connor>
<connor> If I watch like a coming out kind of video </connor>
<joey> and it's just like, we're together now, </joey>
<joey> I met her last week. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like... </joey>
<joey> (exhales deeply) </joey>
<joey> All right, I'm counting down the days </joey>
<joey> of the we broke up video, right? </joey>
<joey> - Be together for like a few weeks, months </joey>
<joey> or I get comfortable (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> In your head, why would you not be like... </joey>
<connor> Feel like you're secure,
before you make this video. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, do you introduce
this girl to your parents </garnt>
<garnt> a week after you just started dating? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Probably not. </connor>
<connor> - But this YouTubers,
probably introducing it </connor>
<connor> to their audience before their parents. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, bro, backwards, backwards. Come on. </connor>
<joey> - Cause I know Aki and I
waited about, three months, </joey>
<connor> before- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You probably felt pretty comfortable. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause we wanted to
enjoy our time together, </connor>
<connor> just like privately. </connor>
<connor> And we did. </connor>
<connor> And then we were like, okay, </connor>
<joey> now if we want to actually
do more stuff now, </joey>
<joey> instead of like hiding about it, </joey>
<joey> then I think now is the right time. </joey>
<joey> Like, we're comfortable now. </joey>
<connor> - Especially- </connor>
<connor> - Get it out. </connor>
<joey> - In your position it's kind of forced </joey>
<joey> to tell people. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna be together. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't hide that shit, right, forever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Both of you posting constantly- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We know, both of you are together </joey>
<joey> in a lot of pictures. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - People are gonna connect the dots. </joey>
<joey> - Is she just going to
go hang out with him? </joey>
<connor> Is that how it is, really? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, both of you are
in YouTuber relationships </joey>
<joey> was there normally the landmine
waiting to just go off? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> What are you saying? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, normally at least
you guys are in the clear now, </joey>
<joey> I feel like you've got to
the stage where it's like, </joey>
<joey> all right, it's mega serious. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - (indictinct) Gonna be fucking married, </garnt>
<garnt> get out of my sight. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You fucking simps. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm fucking tired of these
fucking happy people around me. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> When your like, dude... </connor>
<connor> Especially, my size now I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> I'd be way too scared to
date another YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> that's like- </connor>
<joey> - No. I mean, I get that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, for me with Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of a bit different. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, she... </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, she has been on
YouTube for a very long time, </garnt>
<connor> but I wouldn't really
call her like a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> where she does this as a job. </connor>
<connor> She's kind of grown pretty recently. </connor>
<connor> - She does (indictinct) YouTuber? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - And I mean, we started
dating when I wasn't... </connor>
<connor> This was before I came back to do YouTube </connor>
<connor> for full-time anyway. </connor>
<connor> So, we've been dating for
like a very long time, </connor>
<connor> like a good five, six years. </connor>
<connor> But yeah. </connor>
<connor> I remember seeing your video, </connor>
<joey> like, was it nerve wracking
for you guys coming out </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Hey, we're
a YouTuber couple." </joey>
<garnt> - Definitely, because- </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the reaction, like? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean the reaction was
mostly really, really positive. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank God. </garnt>
<joey> But I remember, Aki losing </joey>
<joey> a very significant portion
of her male audience. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I lost a very significant
portion of my female audience. </joey>
<connor> - What kind of percentage? </connor>
<joey> What kind of numbers are we talking about? </joey>
<connor> - I probably, I dunno. </connor>
<joey> Before we came out, I think I had... </joey>
<joey> I think I had like a 60,
40 female to male ratio, </joey>
<joey> which I was like, "Wow, okay." </joey>
<joey> I thought more males
would be (indictinct). </joey>
<joey> But then the moment I came out, </joey>
<joey> I think that dropped by
like 10, 15%, at least. </joey>
<joey> It was a really significant number. </joey>
<joey> And the same thing with Aki, as well. </joey>
<connor> As about at least a 10, 15% drop. </connor>
<connor> But we kind of expected that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because, we'd had been
to conventions enough times </connor>
<connor> and we saw- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a lot of people were speculating- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - We saw a lot of people
were speculating, right? </joey>
<connor> - I think I remember watching your AX vlog </connor>
<joey> and then people had saw
that you had like a hickey. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, oh is Joey- </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Joey, getting it on here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - We're not proud of that. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I knew Aki falling (indictinct), </joey>
<joey> was like God deim it Joey, you left that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we're not proud of that. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's all right. </connor>
<joey> That's all right. </joey>
<connor> We were young. </connor>
<garnt> We were young, that's whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's cute, men. It's cute. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's cute when we look
back on it, it's fine. </garnt>
<joey> - Must have been stressful back then </joey>
<joey> where people were just speculating every- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - (indictinct) Enhance. </garnt>
<garnt> Enhance. </garnt>
<connor> - CSI people. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Is that a hickey or a burse? </connor>
<connor> - Get the blue light out. </connor>
<joey> - We need to know. </joey>
<joey> - Check for fingerprints. </joey>
<connor> - Someone's in that dark room. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But like, I think it was
nerveracking for the both of us, </connor>
<connor> because it was the first time </connor>
<connor> that we'd ever had to
make a video like that. </connor>
<connor> And we knew we had to make
a video like that, right? </connor>
<joey> Eventually, we weren't gonna hide it </joey>
<joey> for the rest of our career, right? </joey>
<joey> So, I think it was stressful at the time. </joey>
<joey> And you can see it in
our coming out videos, </joey>
<joey> that were very nervous and like... </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, we're going together
now, kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time,
after that video went out, </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "Oh, thank God. </connor>
<connor> Now I don't have to fucking hide about </connor>
<connor> the fact that I have a girlfriend now. </connor>
<connor> - Really pleasant as well, </connor>
<connor> must have (indictinct) a lot of support. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> There was a lot of support. </connor>
<joey> I had a lot of fucking like
YouTubers approached me, </joey>
<joey> who had never spoken to me. </joey>
<joey> I remember Garnt fucking tweeted out. </joey>
<garnt> - This was, I think our interaction, </garnt>
<joey> since that time we thought
we hated each other. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It was the first interaction. </garnt>
<garnt> It was the first interaction on Twitter </garnt>
<connor> where like Gard was like congrats </connor>
<connor> to (indictinct) Aki and Joey
are doing this together. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "Oh my gosh." </connor>
<joey> - I remember this too? </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, "Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't hate me." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I think he like me. </joey>
<joey> No, a lot of (indictinct)
Tubers tweet at us, </joey>
<joey> being like, yeah, the two
biggest anmie Tubers are together </joey>
<joey> and blah, blah. </joey>
<joey> It was like a really big deal. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, it's not that big a deal guys. </joey>
<joey> We're just getting
together, it's all good. </joey>
<joey> But no, we were really happy about it, </joey>
<joey> because, again we were
a little bit worried </joey>
<joey> about like maybe there
might be some kind of, </joey>
<joey> hidden thing that put us in
some kind of a negative light, </joey>
<joey> but no, it all came out really fine. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember watching that video </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember thinking, man, they... </garnt>
<garnt> I think they definitely
approached this the right way, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause everyone knew if you were dating </joey>
<joey> this was something that
you would have to address, </joey>
<joey> sooner or later. </joey>
<connor> Because your both big
personalities on the platform. </connor>
<connor> I think you definitely went
about it the right way. </connor>
<connor> And I remember just wanting
to quick congratulate you. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I know the trouble's go through </joey>
<joey> with long distance relationship, as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - With Sydney, man, that shit's tough. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, tell me about it. </joey>
<joey> We were in a long distance
for two and a half years, man. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my monkey brain can't handle it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was long distance with
Sydney for like a good year </connor>
<garnt> or something and that was
one of the hardest years </garnt>
<connor> of my life. </connor>
<connor> - When you were like still single online </connor>
<joey> did you messages people like, </joey>
<joey> would you ever do long distance? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - So, how long though? </joey>
<joey> - Are you available or a long distance? </joey>
<connor> - What kind of time zone
differences is okay? </connor>
<joey> And I'm like just fucking say it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like what are you expecting me to say? </joey>
<joey> It's like, if it's less than
eight hours, then it's doable. </joey>
<connor> But any more than that, bro (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> - When I used to live stream, </connor>
<connor> doing like, Austine and Sebastian stuff, </connor>
<connor> the most common thing
that I would often get </connor>
<connor> is like, this is a long distance? </connor>
<connor> What's your thoughts on that Connor? </connor>
<connor> What are your thoughts on that? </connor>
<connor> You dating anyone by the way? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - They don't just say it, </joey>
<joey> they just like, are you perhaps
considering the possibility? </joey>
<connor> Or they'll say, what's
your ideal partner like? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - I got that a lot when
I was doing panels- </connor>
<joey> - I'm trying to say </joey>
<connor> that I'm like a giga chat </connor>
<connor> and everyone just can't help themselves. </connor>
<connor> But, you just get people who like- </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I think you
can say that as the 93% </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you should
expect that at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> When there's thousands of subscribers </connor>
<joey> there's gonna be like one or two of them </joey>
<joey> that are interested in you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That are gonna try and see
what ways they can pursue that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - From a formerly written
email, which is many times. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Or they'll do a, not so subtle donation. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is their logistics
of us pulling up together </garnt>
<garnt> in this long distance relationship. </garnt>
<connor> - What I gotta do is, </connor>
<connor> I gotta some episode I end
up doing a presentation </connor>
<joey> of all the different ways
people have tried to hit me. </joey>
<joey> Power point presentation. </joey>
<connor> The most interesting ways it's happen. </connor>
<connor> - Top 10- </connor>
<connor> - I'm not trying to brag. </connor>
<connor> I'm not trying to do any... </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to say it's
really fucking interesting. </connor>
<joey> The way that people try
to like get in there. </joey>
<connor> - Top 10 confessions in anime. </connor>
<connor> - Its so interesting when
you realize it the way... </connor>
<joey> 'Cause there's like routes in their mind, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to go this way. </connor>
<joey> - I'm going to direct
route the curve ball route. </joey>
<connor> - It's like a fucking visual novel. </connor>
<connor> - There's levels of difficulty, </connor>
<connor> there's like YouTube comment, </connor>
<connor> impossible for him to ever date me. </connor>
<connor> To like- </connor>
<connor> - Level 99. </connor>
<joey> - To like donate $10,000
so you can not ignore me. </joey>
<joey> And there's so many
in-between, it's so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, if you guys
are interested in that- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Download if you wanna hear the power... </joey>
<garnt> I'll actually be- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm interested. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will legit prepare a
PowerPoint presentation. </garnt>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<joey> - Were going to screen
for something, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'll do it, I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to think of like, </joey>
<joey> what a weird thing that a
lot of people do on YouTube? </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<connor> Just weird stuff they might say often </connor>
<joey> that I'm trying to think. </joey>
<joey> - What, like the whole thing of like, </joey>
<connor> there's always that one
comment in every video, </connor>
<connor> which is like, Joey is not gonna see this. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> He's not gonna reply,
just because I'm first </connor>
<connor> in the comments section. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Woman] What kind of thing? </joey>
<joey> - I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm tempted to call
and to prove them wrong </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, no, that's what you want. </joey>
<connor> - No, I'm going to fall into the bait, </connor>
<connor> you almost got me there. </connor>
<joey> - No, you are right. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna see this. </joey>
<joey> Fuck you. </joey>
<connor> Fuck you for thinking
you're entitled to my time. </connor>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Actually what I like
to do to those comments </joey>
<connor> is like, I just, I don't even heart it. </connor>
<connor> I just like it. </connor>
<connor> So, that the only one that knows </connor>
<joey> is that person. </joey>
<joey> And the easier reply might be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, Joey liked my comment." </joey>
<joey> And everyone's like, no, he didn't. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because there's no way to prove it. </connor>
<connor> There's no way to prove it. </connor>
<joey> Then they get the notification being like, </joey>
<joey> there men, I liked your comment. </joey>
<joey> Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> I'm so mean. </joey>
<joey> I think it's because I've been getting, </joey>
<joey> like growing a bunch, but
I've just noticed more, </joey>
<joey> a bunch of nonsensical
comments on my videos. </joey>
<joey> Like comments that don't relate to it. </joey>
<joey> Well, just people being
like, yeah, I'm tired. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And it's like, </connor>
<connor> why are you throwing this
shit under my void, right? </connor>
<joey> - There's always ones as well that, </joey>
<joey> are relating to other commenter's. </joey>
<joey> They're like, oh, I see that </joey>
<joey> the guy with the mustache is
not in the comment section. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ever get commenters that just have </garnt>
<joey> a full on fucking
conversation with each other </joey>
<joey> in your comments section. </joey>
<garnt> - It turns into a forum </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, this video has 10,000 comments </garnt>
<joey> and you look down to like
5,000 of them are just like, </joey>
<joey> so how you been? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm all right. </joey>
<joey> - Like an MSN messenger
chat or fucking Skype chat. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, you do realize
this is why we have </joey>
<connor> a discord for, so that
you can do that there. </connor>
<connor> - I saw one is this dude having like </connor>
<joey> a fucking mental breakdown
arguing with this person </joey>
<joey> to be like, you're fucking wrong. </joey>
<joey> You don't understand the nuances. </joey>
<connor> And some one replied are you okay. </connor>
<connor> And the guy replied like
honestly, no, not really. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm glad that someone finally asked me. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, what am I reading? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a therapy session- </garnt>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - I've seen those exact
same comments, as well. </connor>
<connor> - It's like bro are you okay? </connor>
<connor> It's like, honestly, no. </connor>
<connor> And I'm glad somebody finally asked. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm not okay. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck am I reading? </connor>
<garnt> - How did this happen? </garnt>
<joey> How did we get here? </joey>
<garnt> - And I guarantee as well, </garnt>
<joey> the person who originally
commented the, you okay, </joey>
<connor> is just sitting there like, </connor>
<connor> oh, fuck, now I have to- </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Now I have to like
coach them through this. </connor>
<joey> - Or like when they're like, </joey>
<connor> wow, that's a reference
to X Timmy Minecrafts. </connor>
<connor> And it's like (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> Like people will comment and be like, </connor>
<connor> oh, this is a reference to game grumps. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, they've have so many episodes, </connor>
<connor> they probably set the whole fucking- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - They even like give the reference, </joey>
<joey> like where it is, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, I didn't know what, I
don't know who this person is </joey>
<connor> that you're telling me I'm referencing. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, bro, this
video is just a copy </joey>
<joey> of Minecraft players, 69. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, who? </joey>
<joey> And then I look up the channel </joey>
<connor> and they have like 12 subscribers. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, how the
fuck am I supposed to know? </connor>
<joey> - Two view the video,
like you copied them. </joey>
<joey> It's like... </joey>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<connor> What do you mean I copied them. </connor>
<connor> No one could have copied
them if they wanted to. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause nobody saw the video. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its so true, because I think </garnt>
<garnt> this is the first time I'm hearing that. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I was the only
person who got those comments. </garnt>
<joey> I think referencing this random video </joey>
<joey> or this random YouTuber </joey>
<joey> that I have never seen before. </joey>
<joey> And apparently, you're
just copying their joke. </joey>
<joey> You made exactly the same joke maybe. </joey>
<connor> I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> - The internet is massive. </connor>
<connor> People are gonna make
the same joke eventually, </connor>
<connor> it's gonna happen, just get over it. </connor>
<connor> - You know what type of comment I finally, </connor>
<connor> just want to see gone. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - It's the fucking nobody. </joey>
<joey> Literally nobody. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Joey. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I'm just letting
you know guys right now. </joey>
<joey> None of them are funny. </joey>
<connor> I'm just saying that,
none of them are funny, </connor>
<connor> none of them are unique. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes I chuckle. </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes, it's like one
out of like a thousand, maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - There are some videos where the comments </garnt>
<garnt> are just fucking gold. </garnt>
<garnt> But most of the times comments </garnt>
<joey> are just like this big circle joke </joey>
<joey> where it's the same type of comment </joey>
<garnt> that gets up-voted every time. </garnt>
<joey> - Like the funniest comments in my videos </joey>
<joey> are always the ones that have zero likes. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, why does
this not have any likes? </joey>
<joey> It's always the ones I heart, as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm just like, here you go guys, </joey>
<joey> this is a funny comment. </joey>
<joey> Look, learn from this comment. </joey>
<joey> None of you guys are like this comment, </joey>
<joey> all like it, because
this is some funny shit, </joey>
<connor> that you guys should be tweeting more. </connor>
<connor> Not the fucking literally. </connor>
<connor> Literally nobody. </connor>
<connor> Joey, (indictinct). </connor>
<connor> I'm like, the have just
like a copy pasta ready </connor>
<connor> for these comments. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - To just be like immediately
be like yep throw it in. </joey>
<joey> - A semi awkward moment or a funny moment, </joey>
<joey> all right, that's it, that's it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the one. </connor>
<garnt> That's the thing that
literally nobody does. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, that's it. That's the one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you guys remember the
era of YouTube comments, </garnt>
<joey> before they ranked them? </joey>
<joey> And it was just like,
it was just going by- </joey>
<joey> - Like free for all. </joey>
<joey> - It was just a free for all. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I heard that was when YouTube
was a fucking SAS pool, man. </joey>
<joey> At least now it's like somewhat organized </joey>
<garnt> and it's just basically
become rated in a way. </garnt>
<joey> But it's better than... </joey>
<garnt> It's better than it used to be. </garnt>
<joey> - I think, like the
funniest comments sections, </joey>
<joey> I always see are like the, at
least with this year, right? </joey>
<joey> It was all the comments
on the fucking Rose </joey>
<joey> and big Ed episodes. </joey>
<joey> Like that comments, I've
never laughed that hard </joey>
<connor> for like reading a comments section. </connor>
<connor> - From the 90 Day fiance- </connor>
<connor> - 90 day fiance episodes like the clips, </connor>
<joey> because it's some of the meanest comments </joey>
<connor> that I've ever seen. </connor>
<joey> But at the same time, it is so funny. </joey>
<connor> - I realize watching reality TV shows, </connor>
<connor> like 90 Day Fiance are so less fun </connor>
<joey> when you can't read a comment section. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like I tried
watching the show normally, </joey>
<joey> like a different season
and it was just not fun, </joey>
<joey> 'cause every time something
really obnoxious happened </joey>
<joey> or one of them said something
really like just stupid. </joey>
<joey> I wanted to immediately go
down to the comments and see- </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Oh, that's it, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know, when you're
watching a YouTube video </joey>
<joey> and something happens, you're like, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to the comments section. </connor>
<joey> I wanna see people talking about this. </joey>
<connor> I missed it. </connor>
<connor> I don't get that when I watch
90 Day Fiance, normally. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - What I wanna experience
is what it would be like </garnt>
<garnt> if you had like whole anime episodes, </garnt>
<connor> uploaded on a YouTube- </connor>
<garnt> - Comments section. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, what would the comment
section be like, right? </garnt>
<connor> - We have (indictinct), but
context is like garbage. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean that doesn't work, </garnt>
<garnt> because like who the leaves a comment </garnt>
<garnt> on the Crunchyroll web? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> Who does that? </garnt>
<garnt> Who are you? </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you leaving
comments on a (indictinct)? </garnt>
<connor> - Cause people are given
they're like 48 hour passes- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, work is add control. </connor>
<garnt> We gotta fill this common section, guys. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause most of the comments
are just like the gift passes. </joey>
<garnt> And then there's people
that actually comment </garnt>
<garnt> on the episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I'm just thinking, man... </garnt>
<joey> - But it's so like non-stops
is like very good episode. </joey>
<joey> Smiley face. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I Rent A Girlfriend to episode one </connor>
<connor> and the comment was, God, </connor>
<joey> this is the trashiest show this season. </joey>
<joey> I'll see you all next week. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I thought that was a good comment. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds like a YouTube
comment though, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that's what I want. </connor>
<joey> I want YouTube comments... </joey>
<connor> - There's something though
about YouTube comments </connor>
<joey> that just, I don't want to say it, but... </joey>
<garnt> - He's gonna say it. </garnt>
<garnt> He's gonna say it. </garnt>
<connor> (indictinct) </connor>
<joey> - I was going through my
light source in my hand </joey>
<connor> and just be like, what's
another word for (indictinct). </connor>
<joey> What's another word for different. </joey>
<joey> - It impacts differently. </joey>
<joey> - It impacts, yeah, differently. </joey>
<joey> - Like you just read it. </joey>
<joey> Like I can't stand right at discussions. </joey>
<joey> Like they're the most, </joey>
<joey> I'm smarter than you discussions always. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> At least you're on YouTube,
everyone knows they're an ape. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> Like no one tries to like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Reddit comments are the
epitome of I'm actually. </joey>
<connor> - I love Reddit, but I
hate looking past the meme. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Some time you'll see some
funny stuff on Reddit. </joey>
<joey> - If there's ever a comment thread </joey>
<garnt> that's a discussion it's like </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest minefield I've ever seen. </garnt>
<connor> - Just a bunch of people
who wanna validate </connor>
<connor> their intelligence. </connor>
<connor> And it's just so sad. </connor>
<connor> I can't read it. </connor>
<joey> It's just pathetic half the time. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes there's really good threads </joey>
<joey> with really solid advice. </joey>
<joey> But most of the time's actually when </joey>
<joey> it's like the argument
threads changed my opinion or- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or am I the ass hole? Fuck me. </joey>
<joey> - Was like, I don't care. </joey>
<connor> I can't read. </connor>
<connor> Every one posted their sub-reddits
like, am I the ass hole? </connor>
<connor> Everyone who posts that sub-reddit, </connor>
<connor> knows they're not the ass hole. </connor>
<connor> Except for like that one, dude... </connor>
<connor> That one dad who deleted
his kid's Minecraft. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Of course you're the ass hole. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So as a punishment,
this one dad on Reddit, </connor>
<connor> apparently thought it was a good idea, </connor>
<connor> because his kid wasn't doing work. </connor>
<connor> He deleted his kids, Minecraft </connor>
<connor> and all the stuff that he built in it. </connor>
<connor> I went to read it being
like, am I the ass hole, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I deleted my
kid's Minecraft account </connor>
<connor> and all the stuff he built. </connor>
<joey> And everyone's like,
yes, of course you are. </joey>
<connor> At least that kid worked
hard on that stuff. </connor>
<connor> Of course you're the ass hole. </connor>
<connor> And it was on like Twitter and everything. </connor>
<connor> That shit blew up. </connor>
<connor> It was so- </connor>
<joey> - That's like, your kid like building </joey>
<joey> like an actual house or
like from the ground up. </joey>
<connor> And then it's like, no, I don't like </connor>
<joey> the way you made that room. </joey>
<joey> And just blows up the house. </joey>
<connor> Start again. </connor>
<connor> - It is like 90% of Rettit
is very self-serving </connor>
<connor> and it's like 10%, it's
like a dumpster fire </connor>
<connor> that you're like, I wanna watch. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I enjoy Reddit for the memes. </connor>
<connor> - Memes are great, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The memes are great. </connor>
<garnt> And when, whenever there's a
good meme threads or something </garnt>
<garnt> that's where I enjoy Reddit. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, that's why I like Alsop Reddit. </joey>
<garnt> (cross talk) </garnt>
<garnt> It's just all memes. </garnt>
<connor> So reddit.com/r/Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> You see that segue boys. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - My Reddit name is
literally, I came for meme. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That literally my reddit name- </joey>
<connor> - People don't believe
you, that that's you. </connor>
<joey> I saw a thread on Reddit being like, </joey>
<joey> who is this mullet? </joey>
<joey> Like where's Connor. </joey>
<joey> Who is this, I came from memes guy </joey>
<joey> and everyone's like, that's Conner. </joey>
<joey> And everyone's like, all
the new people are like, </joey>
<joey> no, that's not him. </joey>
<joey> I'm looking for see dog VA, where is it? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I literally
only made the account, </connor>
<joey> so I can up vote the memes I liked. </joey>
<joey> - Fair enough. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that luckily I also rented </joey>
<connor> this for memes, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's the best part of Reddit. </joey>
<connor> Like I feel like when Reddit
takes itself too seriously </connor>
<connor> it's just really grating. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you guys feel the same- </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - Not everywhere over the internet, </joey>
<connor> because it's the same thing
with Twitter, as well. </connor>
<connor> And the only difference
with some Reddit threads </connor>
<garnt> and Twitter threads I see </garnt>
<garnt> is Twitter has an avatar behind it. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's basically the
same kind of toxicity. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's the discussion
they have on Reddit </connor>
<connor> are ones that I only
feel can be constructive </connor>
<joey> in posting with someone. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like having like a- </joey>
<connor> - Like every argument over the internet. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Which is why you haven't
argued with some one, </connor>
<connor> let's just call, I don't
wanna fucking text you. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you know that
shit don't go anywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - My thumbs were tired. </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - You wrote a paragraph. </connor>
<connor> I'm not reading that fucking shit. </connor>
<connor> Come on, get on call. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, here's a question for you. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you guys ever had like the comments </garnt>
<garnt> or like a comment on your YouTube, </garnt>
<connor> or like someone saying
something on Twitter </connor>
<connor> that you know you can destroy- </connor>
<connor> - Slam Dunk. </connor>
<connor> - Slam Dunk them in an argument, </connor>
<joey> but it's equally as annoying, </joey>
<joey> because you want to and you know you can, </joey>
<joey> but there's too many of
these types of comments, </joey>
<joey> like address them all. </joey>
<joey> And if you dress one, </joey>
<garnt> then you start just opening
Pandora's box or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - I've done that. </joey>
<joey> I've been on both sides of that. </joey>
<joey> Just being like, okay, I
see this dumb ass comment, </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, okay, I can't say anything. </connor>
<connor> - It's a lot of restraint. </connor>
<connor> - Control yourself, </connor>
<connor> like Zen mind right now with this. </connor>
<connor> Don't get tilted. </connor>
<connor> Just keep it in yourself. </connor>
<connor> Like at least like go to your IRL friends </connor>
<connor> and bitch about it to them. </connor>
<connor> Like they'll understand. </connor>
<connor> And then sometimes I just look at it, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, no, this kid's
small brain as fuck. </joey>
<joey> I gotta put him in his position. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I quote, retweet being
like look at this clown. </connor>
<joey> I feel like the amount
of restraint it takes </joey>
<connor> is like, just stop and go piss mid stream. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> (indictinct) </joey>
<joey> - It's like the bottle's getting full, </joey>
<connor> don't let it over flow. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I don't need this. </joey>
<joey> I don't need the same idea. </joey>
<joey> I'm okay. </joey>
<connor> Like I'm don't need to engage with this. </connor>
<connor> Like you're right a fucking idiot. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the first
day of going vegetarian </joey>
<garnt> you go to like a steak house, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like... </garnt>
<joey> (breathing heavily) </joey>
<connor> No, I can do this. </connor>
<connor> I can do this, please. </connor>
<connor> - I just like, sometimes if
they comment something dumb, </connor>
<connor> I'll give them a holla. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I want everyone to see </connor>
<connor> how stupid you are. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna engage it, </connor>
<connor> but I'm gonna push this to the top, </connor>
<garnt> just so everyone could see
how stupid this comment was. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like that one out of a million time </garnt>
<garnt> when you do acknowledge it
or reply, it's always there. </garnt>
<connor> They're always like this. </connor>
<connor> - Get ready, get ready. </connor>
<connor> - No, they're always like the
surprise peak at you face. </connor>
<connor> They're like, oh, I can't
believe he saw my comment. </connor>
<garnt> What, I was talking shit
and he replied to me. </garnt>
<garnt> it's like what's? </garnt>
<joey> - That only applies on Twitter though. </joey>
<joey> It's like, how many situations can you go </joey>
<connor> in IRL where you absolutely
slam dunk someone </connor>
<connor> and then they reply
with a punk face, right? </connor>
<connor> It's just like- </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Did you see that, he
just completely dunk me, </connor>
<garnt> I'm so happy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know... </garnt>
<garnt> I understand the mentality where </garnt>
<joey> if you say something on
Twitter or on social media </joey>
<joey> to like a big creator or platform, </joey>
<joey> you don't expect them to ever see it. </joey>
<joey> But I think you'd be surprised
about how many comments </joey>
<joey> that we do actually end up seeing, </joey>
<joey> most of them, we just,
we just keep scrolling, </joey>
<garnt> but some of the comments do
actually stick out to us. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially the ones where are like, </garnt>
<garnt> really criticizing or really grating, </garnt>
<connor> or one of those ones. </connor>
<connor> - I had the thing that happened, </connor>
<connor> maybe like a few months ago, </connor>
<garnt> it was the first time
it's ever happened to me. </garnt>
<connor> And this one annoyed
me more than anything. </connor>
<joey> Like they weren't shitting on me. </joey>
<joey> Or they really were shitting on me, </joey>
<joey> but it was someone else tweeting </joey>
<joey> about how they really
enjoyed all my videos. </joey>
<joey> And then someone was shitting on them </joey>
<connor> for enjoying my videos. </connor>
<connor> For some reason that really pissed me off. </connor>
<connor> I was like, bro, you can
shit on me, for like... </connor>
<joey> Why are you gotta shit on someone else </joey>
<joey> for enjoying, like,
what's wrong with you man? </joey>
<joey> And yeah, that was just a mess. </joey>
<joey> - So did you reply to that? </joey>
<joey> - I replied being like, yo dude, </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's cool if you don't like me, </joey>
<joey> but why are you gonna
shit on someone else? </joey>
<joey> - Just leave them alone. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then they just kept
light antagonizing us </connor>
<garnt> and I was just like fuck it, </garnt>
<connor> I'm not dealing with this. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the one comment </garnt>
<garnt> that's like still angers me to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> - I realized we've talked
about a lot of hate comments. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We're very tilted man, as you can see. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's the comments
that stick out to us, right? </garnt>
<connor> But I think the one that
sticks out to me the most </connor>
<connor> and I probably won't ever forget. </connor>
<connor> Is when I got engaged,
when I proposed to Sydney, </connor>
<joey> like I don't really talk
about my personal life </joey>
<joey> too much on my Twitter, because I like </joey>
<joey> to keep that separate from
like me talking about anime- </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> But it was like the one... </joey>
<joey> One of the few times </joey>
<joey> that I actually let out my
personal life to the public, </joey>
<joey> just because I wanted to show
the entire fucking world- </joey>
<joey> - Very important time of your life. </joey>
<connor> - How happy I was. </connor>
<connor> And how this was one of
the most happiest moments </connor>
<connor> of my life and I wanted to share that. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember I made it like... </connor>
<connor> Me and Sidney are very close. </connor>
<connor> I'm glad that I can
make jokes with Sydney. </connor>
<connor> And like some of like the most
crucial points in my life. </connor>
<connor> And like, when I proposed </connor>
<connor> I was like, man, you're my wife, </connor>
<connor> but I still can have
my wife who Sydney car </connor>
<connor> is still my number one. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> That was just a funny joke. </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> That's just the kind
of relationship I have. </joey>
<joey> I'm glad I'm with someone
who I can joke around </joey>
<joey> with like that. </joey>
<joey> And so Sydney posted that joke </joey>
<joey> and somebody's like, quote... </joey>
<joey> They didn't even like
quote, retweets that one. </joey>
<joey> They just, they screen shotted it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, that the worst. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like at least give me, </joey>
<garnt> like some fucking credit, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> They think you can't fucking
see it if they screenshot it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there's nothing
that leads it back to them. </joey>
<joey> But they screenshot it </joey>
<joey> and they posted on their personal Twitter </joey>
<garnt> and was like, woman you
should have better standards </garnt>
<garnt> for your men. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't let your man get away
with this kind of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, you know
nothing about my relationship </garnt>
<garnt> with Sydney, right? </garnt>
<joey> - That is the biggest, </joey>
<garnt> I know more about your life than you do, </garnt>
<joey> like common right? </joey>
<garnt> - Like they were judging me, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was making this joke, </garnt>
<joey> which some some girls won't be happy with </joey>
<joey> and if you're not happy
with that kind of joke </joey>
<joey> that's completely kinda fair- </joey>
<joey> - Don't be with that kind of person. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Really simple. Right. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> I was with someone I could
trust to make that joke. </joey>
<joey> But then Sydney actually
like commented on it. </joey>
<joey> Like she quote tweeted
it and commented on it. </joey>
<joey> And the reaction they
made was just, such a... </joey>
<joey> Like, why you like this? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, when she replied she was like, </joey>
<joey> I can't believe they've actually outed me. </joey>
<joey> Like they've just sent
all their followers to me. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like getting cyber bullied right now. </garnt>
<joey> And your like, what do you expect </joey>
<garnt> if you talk shit online
and you can't take it back? </garnt>
<joey> Like, how would you think we feel? </joey>
<joey> - I love people who do that,
because it's always.... </joey>
<joey> It's usually like young guys or girls, </joey>
<joey> like in their teens obviously, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they just expect, </joey>
<joey> like how do they not
understand the concept of, </joey>
<connor> if you're prepared to give shit, </connor>
<garnt> you better be prepared to take shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like you're talking
shit about someone. </connor>
<connor> Do you expect them to just not fight back. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, why are you
acting like the victim here? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You are here judging my personal life- </garnt>
<connor> - They have more followers than me. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, I don't give a shit dude. </joey>
<joey> Like you shit talk me, I'm a
fucking smack you right back. </joey>
<joey> You better be prepared for that. </joey>
<joey> And if you're not, then don't
save it in the first place. </joey>
<joey> Keep it to yourself. </joey>
<connor> - If you're gonna smack talk </connor>
<connor> and then you're going to
cry about being called out- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's the equivalent
of like you going up </joey>
<joey> to someone, smacking them in the face </joey>
<joey> and then they smack you
back and you start crying. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's like, what, you smack me first. </connor>
<connor> I should be the one crying, not you. </connor>
<garnt> What are you crying about? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, basically... </joey>
<joey> How to act on the internet, </joey>
<garnt> it's just like, don't act the way... </garnt>
<connor> Don't act any differently than you would </connor>
<connor> in real life, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Just be real life. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Not that you guys needed to know that, </joey>
<connor> 'cause you'll trash tasteless, </connor>
<connor> like the best taste. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> Rule number one just,
don't be a dick head. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> All right it's just really simple. </joey>
<connor> - Don't act like Subaru
from Real Zero in real life, </connor>
<connor> and you should be fine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what you mean? </connor>
<connor> Wait what do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Dude in season one he
was an ass hole, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, was he though. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, when he like confessed in front </connor>
<connor> of the whole grand court. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - She told him not to. </joey>
<connor> I was like, what are you doing, man? </connor>
<connor> She told you not to do that. </connor>
<garnt> This isn't your time to shine. </garnt>
<connor> - I wouldn't call him an ass hole, </connor>
<garnt> as much as I would just call him a clown. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I think he was an ass hole. </garnt>
<garnt> - You do? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I thought he
was in the first season. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, either way, </joey>
<joey> it's not very good, right? </joey>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> You're either a clown or an ass hole. </joey>
<connor> - Either way he wasn't
doing himself any favors. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But season two, he looks like
he's turned himself around. </connor>
<joey> - Don't be like season one Subaru </joey>
<garnt> is what we're saying, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Now season two have
been very much enjoying </garnt>
<connor> his character development. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm glad that he's
finally learning to be an incell. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Every (indictinct)
kind protagonist, right? </garnt>
