<connor> deep breath and i'm like this as [ __ ] </connor>

<connor> today but right now i have with me the </connor>
<connor> boys god and joey and i </connor>
<garnt> am monkeys you didn't even say hello you </garnt>

<connor> with this that's like </connor>
<connor> everything sales people like illuminati </connor>
<connor> conspiracy theory </connor>
<connor> every good sales pitch starts with the </connor>
<joey> hook literally reminded me of that wolf </joey>
<joey> of wall street </joey>
<connor> sell me this pen because you know now </connor>
<joey> they're listening </joey>
<garnt> they're intrigued how can we get free </garnt>
<garnt> animation what a hook </garnt>
<garnt> they don't want to know about trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste they want to know why </garnt>
<joey> i said free anime i wasn't stumbling </joey>
<joey> tell me more salesman who's totally not </joey>
<connor> shady well if you just go to the </connor>
<connor> kickstarter page </connor>
<joey> we're going to talk about that we're </joey>
<joey> going to talk about anime is that what </joey>
<joey> it's called </joey>
<joey> what's the first topic today uh two </joey>
<joey> weeks ago we want to talk about this </joey>
<connor> last week but chris came on </connor>
<connor> inconvenience stars again we would have </connor>
<garnt> spoken about this last week because we </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to talk about anime tube we know </garnt>
<joey> chris goes into fits when we talk about </joey>
<joey> it so </joey>
<connor> we're gonna be like three weeks late but </connor>
<connor> the whole the bottle is kind of finished </connor>
<joey> now yeah talking about that we have all </joey>
<garnt> the info </garnt>
<garnt> like it like lived and died within the </garnt>
<garnt> span of a day </garnt>
<garnt> i think yes pretty much it was very </garnt>
<garnt> interesting essentially what happened is </garnt>
<joey> uh this thing called anime tube popped </joey>
<joey> up on kickstarter </joey>
<joey> and yeah offered to give all the kind uh </joey>
<joey> anyone really yeah free anime free anime </joey>
<joey> and you're probably thinking well you </joey>
<joey> know they probably only got like you </joey>
<garnt> know c rate shows yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah really terrible now what </joey>
<garnt> do they have they they said they were </garnt>
<garnt> gonna </garnt>
<garnt> they were in talks to get evangelion </garnt>
<connor> love hina which has been stuck in </connor>
<connor> copyright halibut knock up right now </connor>
<connor> licensing specifically love hina i don't </connor>
<connor> know i don't know </connor>
<garnt> who like just specifically picks lafina </garnt>
<garnt> attack on titan format alchemist even </garnt>
<connor> though these were already all on </connor>
<connor> streaming platforms already yeah you </connor>
<joey> know and i imagine that the ones that </joey>
<joey> aren't have been out of print for the </joey>
<garnt> past </garnt>
<garnt> twenty they say zero as well uh i didn't </garnt>
<joey> i didn't see the list </joey>
<joey> they've got everything it's animate </joey>
<connor> shoes you know i mean you know and so i </connor>
<connor> i can't </connor>
<connor> i don't know how much these properties </connor>
<garnt> are worth but i can't i can't imagine </garnt>
<garnt> you getting evangelion for less than </garnt>
<garnt> like 100 million or something ridiculous </garnt>
<garnt> you know probably sounds absurd but </garnt>
<connor> it's probably worth that much right yeah </connor>
<connor> so clearly these guys are big bucks to </connor>
<garnt> spend around i mean i'm just glad </garnt>
<garnt> a company is giving the power back to </garnt>
<joey> the people and taking on small indie </joey>
<joey> companies like </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] license holders yeah so taking </joey>
<joey> on small indie companies like </joey>
<joey> sony and att you know like you know </joey>
<connor> someone's going to take these what were </connor>
<connor> they going to do what were they going to </connor>
<garnt> do with it so yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> essentially this kickstarter promised </garnt>
<garnt> that and it and it raised in like one </garnt>
<connor> day </connor>
<connor> like 110 000 yeah it literally came out </connor>
<garnt> nowhere because i remember we were we </garnt>
<garnt> literally came in the trash taste studio </garnt>
<garnt> in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was just all over my twitter </garnt>
<garnt> timeline i was like what the hell was </garnt>
<joey> going on </joey>
<joey> and we all looked at it and we were just </joey>
<joey> like wait this kickstarter </joey>
<joey> launched yesterday and it's raised over </joey>
<joey> a hundred thousand dollars </joey>
<joey> promising people free anime legally and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> what is going on right now it was an </garnt>
<joey> absolute disaster </joey>
<joey> april was about three months ago guys </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you're a bit late to the joke right now </joey>
<connor> yeah it was just uh </connor>
<joey> a mess it was hilarious it was a mess </joey>
<joey> the the you know i think it it's so many </joey>
<joey> levels to it </joey>
<joey> there's so many things that are really </joey>
<joey> sad about it one um </joey>
<joey> you know i think it's safe to say that </joey>
<connor> this was uh </connor>
<connor> either the most over ambitious </connor>
<connor> kickstarter of all time </connor>
<joey> yeah uh or it was uh they were lying </joey>
<joey> all the most genius scam now yeah i mean </joey>
<connor> you know you have to be careful when you </connor>
<connor> say these guys because you can get uh </connor>
<connor> sued so trying to get trash take suit </connor>
<connor> here jerry okay but from what i i i saw </connor>
<connor> yeah it's </connor>
<connor> a scam </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<garnt> yeah well i mean i'm protecting myself </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not going to say the s </garnt>
<connor> word but uh i'm going to say that it </connor>
<connor> looked very sus </connor>
<garnt> i'll say the other little sassy scam </garnt>
<garnt> it's a sassy bucket is what it is you </garnt>
<connor> know i genuinely wonder because </connor>
<connor> you know again they promised to have all </connor>
<joey> these titles that </joey>
<joey> there's absolutely you know not even </joey>
<joey> netflix or amazon can get all of these </joey>
<joey> shows right </joey>
<joey> this is some serious amount of cash and </joey>
<joey> negotiating power </joey>
<connor> that i doubt a kickstarter would be able </connor>
<joey> to convince the japanese </joey>
<connor> investors flicks and like sony can't </connor>
<connor> even get the rights to some of these </connor>
<connor> yeah what what suggests to anyone that </connor>
<joey> this kickstarter group will be able to </joey>
<connor> like evangelion literally couldn't be </connor>
<joey> even been out of print for the past 20 </joey>
<joey> years you couldn't get the license trip </joey>
<connor> until netflix somehow </connor>
<connor> probably don't even want to know how </connor>
<joey> much netflix is playing for that oh no </joey>
<joey> the creator didn't even have the rights </joey>
<joey> to it for the longest time until i had </joey>
<joey> to [ __ ] fight with guy naxx to get </joey>
<connor> back </connor>
<connor> it's insanity yeah i mean the thing is i </connor>
<joey> think </joey>
<joey> there's as you said there's so many </joey>
<connor> layers to it because you know in theory </connor>
<connor> it's a nice idea you know having </connor>
<joey> somewhere where you can watch anime </joey>
<joey> legally </joey>
<joey> feels bad because we're like laughing at </joey>
<joey> they're like imagine trying to take on </joey>
<joey> the big guy hahaha funny </joey>
<joey> yeah but but like if it was a good </joey>
<garnt> attempt i would be yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> right if it was a good attempt but like </garnt>
<garnt> keep in mind you're taking on like </garnt>
<garnt> companies like sony like netflix you </garnt>
<garnt> know like like </garnt>
<garnt> people who you know have have a bit of </garnt>
<connor> dollar in their pocket you know </connor>
<connor> and like yeah i i don't think we're </connor>
<connor> trying to be like yeah we love </connor>
<connor> corporations and stuff like that because </connor>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<connor> i feel like a lot of this was driven by </connor>
<connor> you know the people's hatred </connor>
<connor> towards corporations and you know i get </connor>
<connor> it you know if you don't want to support </connor>
<connor> the big corporations </connor>
<connor> because of whatever reason you know i </connor>
<garnt> get it but there's there's a difference </garnt>
<garnt> between </garnt>
<garnt> not wanting to support like big </garnt>
<garnt> corporations and then like </garnt>
<connor> supporting like whatever this is yeah </connor>
<connor> right it's blindly accepting anything </connor>
<garnt> it's like not wanting </garnt>
<garnt> it's like not wanting to buy paracetamol </garnt>
<garnt> for your pharmacy so you go to like the </garnt>
<garnt> local drug dealer </garnt>
<garnt> you know like like what's the yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> i guess </connor>
<joey> it's like it's like betting in a horse </joey>
<connor> race but the horse's two legs that's why </connor>
<connor> i felt so kind of just sad about it </connor>
<connor> really i felt sad that there was </connor>
<joey> enough weebs out there that were this </joey>
<joey> desperate to like stick it to the carpet </joey>
<joey> it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> they would throw that money into a void </joey>
<joey> dude weebs want free [ __ ] man </joey>
<connor> at the end of the day this is also what </connor>
<connor> i don't understand is that we have weebs </connor>
<connor> that are this dedicated to say [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> to companies </connor>
<connor> that are willing to give money away but </connor>
<joey> you could they could just </joey>
<joey> pirate if they really want to really get </joey>
<joey> it for free i'm not saying you should </joey>
<joey> i i condone that do not do it but </joey>
<joey> i mean it's also like you're kind of </joey>
<connor> basically composing i mean it's also </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> the money that they gave to this </joey>
<joey> kickstarter right because like there </joey>
<joey> were a lot of people who are giving like </joey>
<joey> hundreds of dollars to this kickstarter </joey>
<joey> and like some some people i saw were </joey>
<joey> giving literally thousands of people </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean there was starter when i </connor>
<connor> looked there was </connor>
<connor> a thousand backers giving a hundred </connor>
<joey> thousand so it's </joey>
<joey> rough on average a hundred dollars each </joey>
<connor> given a lot of money that's like </connor>
<connor> you know a year's subscription yeah to </connor>
<connor> netflix </connor>
<connor> but it's not what the message i'm </connor>
<joey> sending </joey>
<joey> it's about sending a message the message </joey>
<joey> of i got scammed </joey>
<garnt> yeah well i mean it's it's the it's the </garnt>
<garnt> thing is where </garnt>
<joey> if anyone just like literally used a </joey>
<joey> single brain cell </joey>
<joey> like you think about like the logistics </joey>
<joey> of this </joey>
<joey> the logistics like just the logistics of </joey>
<joey> why this </joey>
<joey> would not work in the first place or </joey>
<garnt> like you know a hundred thousand seems </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of money </garnt>
<garnt> to like any normal person it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> drop in the [ __ ] bucket </garnt>
<garnt> for like anime licensing features and </garnt>
<connor> all that stuff </connor>
<connor> you can maybe license half an episode no </connor>
<connor> no not even that </connor>
<connor> you can maybe license the thumbnail </connor>
<joey> about an image half an episode of like a </joey>
<garnt> c to your </garnt>
<garnt> much yeah anime i mean yeah like we and </garnt>
<garnt> what surprised me is that they were </garnt>
<garnt> the shows that they were listing as the </garnt>
<garnt> shows they were going for </garnt>
<garnt> what like the [ __ ] triple a titles </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> are worth millions and millions of </garnt>
<joey> dollars right i mean god knows how much </joey>
<joey> netflix actually paid to get evangelion </joey>
<joey> out of licensing hell because evangelion </joey>
<joey> was out of like life </joey>
<joey> couldn't be licensed by any western </joey>
<joey> company for like feels </joey>
<joey> like a decade literally since it was </joey>
<joey> made yeah yeah like since since like </joey>
<joey> since adv like collapsed i can't think </joey>
<garnt> of any other </garnt>
<garnt> like company that has successfully </garnt>
<connor> licensed evangelion </connor>
<connor> and i think people like to think of </connor>
<connor> anime still this kind of underground </connor>
<garnt> thing but some of these shows are easily </garnt>
<garnt> you know worth over hundreds of millions </garnt>
<garnt> of dollars like these types </garnt>
<garnt> right like i think the merchandising of </garnt>
<connor> these shows as well right think about </connor>
<garnt> like the ips shows i think about the </garnt>
<garnt> mega shows like any of the shonen jump </garnt>
<connor> shows like my hero </connor>
<garnt> how much does attack on titanfall </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] demonstrate yeah right </garnt>
<joey> i mean a billion dollar property yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah exactly it's already proven to be </garnt>
<joey> that yeah so i </joey>
<joey> it's really i just i don't understand </joey>
<connor> like every </connor>
<connor> none of this i who were these thousands </connor>
<connor> of people who gave money like i </connor>
<joey> legitimately wanted that yeah i </joey>
<joey> legitimately want to know </joey>
<connor> it's obviously very young impressionable </connor>
<joey> anime fans right who are just </joey>
<connor> hoping for this yeah society right i </connor>
<connor> wonder if some parts of it we're just </connor>
<joey> completely like oblivious about like </joey>
<joey> we take for granted some of them like </joey>
<joey> because we yeah i mean we work with </joey>
<joey> japanese companies we know how these </joey>
<joey> things are </joey>
<joey> you can't go around saying you're in </joey>
<garnt> talks that is that is like the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> no-no in business </garnt>
<garnt> like and especially here i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's never a done deal until it's done </garnt>
<garnt> dealing </garnt>
<joey> did you read the faq what was that that </joey>
<joey> what do they say </joey>
<connor> oh okay i read some of it what was the </connor>
<connor> do you remember the thing about </connor>
<garnt> licensing or something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i remember like one of the faqs uh one </garnt>
<joey> of the questions was uh </joey>
<joey> isn't anime licensing really expensive </joey>
<joey> yes </joey>
<joey> and they they legit went um actually </joey>
<joey> um anime licensing isn't as expensive as </joey>
<joey> everyone makes it out to be </joey>
<joey> the only reason nobody does it and </joey>
<garnt> nobody talks about it is because of ndas </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> we are in talks with real japanese anime </garnt>
<garnt> licenses </garnt>
<garnt> and uh that was pretty much that was </garnt>
<garnt> pretty much the answer to the question </garnt>
<joey> can they get anime licenses they </joey>
<joey> literally just shot themselves in the </joey>
<joey> foot they just </joey>
<connor> they didn't have to answer that question </connor>
<joey> you can't say you're talking to these </joey>
<joey> companies like it's </joey>
<joey> very also it's all very secretive you </joey>
<joey> know yeah intentionally so </joey>
<joey> all these companies are like yeah do you </joey>
<connor> know this guy yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah because there was a guy there was a </connor>
<joey> so they also uh i think the </joey>
<joey> person uh i'm not sure the ceo someone </joey>
<joey> representing right stuff </joey>
<joey> anime yeah yeah which is the american </joey>
<joey> company i think which uh buys the </joey>
<joey> licenses for </joey>
<garnt> again i'm not sure either way they they </garnt>
<joey> buy a license or they sell or they sell </joey>
<garnt> dvds </garnt>
<garnt> they reached out being like uh so </garnt>
<garnt> apparently you've listed some of our </garnt>
<garnt> titles </garnt>
<garnt> uh and you say that we're in talks and </garnt>
<garnt> the guy tweeted him saying that we've </garnt>
<connor> never been in talks </connor>
<connor> and then they replied saying we sent you </connor>
<connor> a message on linkedin </connor>
<connor> that was there we're in talks i'm in </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] talks with all the people that </connor>
<joey> email me about weird [ __ ] then oh no </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> it's just like bro bro i dm'd you why </garnt>
<joey> didn't you dm back i see you my linkedin </joey>
<joey> dm please respond </joey>
<joey> we're in talks now right hundreds of </joey>
<garnt> millions of dollars are at stake because </garnt>
<joey> of my linkedin i sent you a dm please </joey>
<joey> give me </joey>
<garnt> um the anime license please give me the </garnt>
<joey> ips that's that's </joey>
<joey> they haven't responded yet but we're in </joey>
<connor> talks we're working on an arrangement </connor>
<joey> it's just insanity we're part of this </joey>
<joey> one-sided conversation it was just </joey>
<connor> it was just it all burned down in flames </connor>
<garnt> luckily but yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was just oh my god it was such a it </garnt>
<garnt> was just so bizarre to see and </garnt>
<garnt> you know we knew it was gonna like come </garnt>
<garnt> down in flames yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i think right now it's like been taken </garnt>
<garnt> off kickstarter right </garnt>
<connor> as far as i can so yeah okay </connor>
<joey> it's still there but but the funding is </joey>
<garnt> stopped </garnt>
<garnt> oh okay so so now i'm going to give them </garnt>
<joey> anymore </joey>
<joey> that's good okay that's good okay okay </joey>
<joey> so yeah it is so kick start suspended </joey>
<connor> 111 000 yeah i like i don't know how </connor>
<garnt> true this is but i did see a screenshot </garnt>
<garnt> i might </garnt>
<garnt> prop up my timeline the other day though </garnt>
<garnt> that uh shows that they haven't given up </garnt>
<garnt> they've started like a newsletter which </garnt>
<garnt> you can </garnt>
<garnt> they which you can subscribe to for a </garnt>
<garnt> dollar </garnt>
<garnt> so for a dollar for this newsletter you </garnt>
<joey> can subscribe for updates </joey>
<joey> people are just taking updates of what </joey>
<garnt> talks in the end </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i legit don't know and it's </garnt>
<joey> like it is like on this week's </joey>
<joey> newsletter </joey>
<joey> we're in talks with adv trying to get </joey>
<connor> the right it's just it's just absolutely </connor>
<connor> tragic </connor>
<connor> like it's obvious that you know i'm not </connor>
<connor> being funny but there's a reason why </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> netflix doesn't have its own discord </connor>
<joey> server as well they had their own </joey>
<joey> discord </joey>
<joey> server and they started banning people </joey>
<joey> and it's like what is this </joey>
<joey> this is [ __ ] yandere devs game what </joey>
<joey> is this this is like </joey>
<joey> what's going on here it's so obvious </joey>
<garnt> because they've done this like two times </garnt>
<garnt> before yeah as well and they failed </garnt>
<garnt> twice </garnt>
<garnt> i saw they've made other kids so so </garnt>
<garnt> they're trying to make this kickstarter </garnt>
<garnt> this is their third attempt </garnt>
<garnt> and i think another app similar to it </garnt>
<garnt> popped up </garnt>
<garnt> on the microsoft store and was taken </garnt>
<connor> down before as well so yeah </connor>
<connor> they have a history of doing this and </connor>
<connor> failing and whatever but clearly </connor>
<connor> you know every time it comes around it </connor>
<connor> seems to get some money so i </connor>
<joey> i guess why not i guess i got some real </joey>
<connor> balls to do it like three or four times </connor>
<connor> no shame man </connor>
<joey> i'm sorry if you [ __ ] gave money to </joey>
<garnt> that kickstarter like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like like i i would say like </garnt>
<connor> i like the idea no </connor>
<connor> intentions yeah intentions aside i like </connor>
<joey> the idea of it </joey>
<joey> everybody wishes for it i mean everyone </joey>
<joey> everybody wishes for because i feel like </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> in the era we're we're in now i think </joey>
<joey> like we're past the golden age of </joey>
<joey> streaming </joey>
<joey> because we'll pass the point in time </joey>
<joey> where you could get </joey>
<joey> every show that you've physically </joey>
<joey> feasibly watched on one platform and </joey>
<joey> it's unfortunate that that's the case um </joey>
<joey> but it's kind of evolved into </joey>
<joey> like a similar era to what the cable era </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> but i mean when p when corporations </joey>
<joey> started to realize that there was money </joey>
<joey> in streaming this was </joey>
<joey> this was going to be the way that things </joey>
<joey> were going to evolve unfortunately </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> unfortunately money talks you know and </joey>
<joey> if there could be a platform where </joey>
<garnt> every anime you ever watch was on a </garnt>
<garnt> single platform i'm sure someone would </garnt>
<garnt> have done that already </garnt>
<garnt> you know i'm sure someone with a lot of </garnt>
<joey> money would have done that already i </joey>
<joey> hate to be the bearer of bad news but </joey>
<joey> anime is a business </joey>
<connor> streaming is one of those people is </connor>
<garnt> where it's nigh on impossible to get </garnt>
<connor> into it unless you've got like </connor>
<garnt> yeah massive investors yeah like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like 10 15 years ago </garnt>
<connor> that's good maybe you know if you at the </connor>
<joey> start of the </joey>
<joey> streaming age like when crunchyroll </joey>
<joey> first started but like that time's past </joey>
<garnt> now you can't just you can't just be </garnt>
<garnt> like the little guy </garnt>
<garnt> taking on the big guy anymore oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's like quibby as well i had like what </connor>
<joey> like six billion dollars yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> it was made it was founded by the guy </joey>
<joey> who uh left disney and founded </joey>
<joey> dreamworks </joey>
<joey> uh come from his name um and made quibby </joey>
<joey> a streaming service </joey>
<connor> and it was an absolute dumpster </connor>
<connor> but it had like billions of dollars in </connor>
<joey> investments </joey>
<joey> but it disappeared after like two weeks </joey>
<joey> right or something well it was like you </joey>
<connor> got a free trial then you had to pay </connor>
<joey> and like it literally just tanked like </joey>
<joey> immediately yeah yeah yeah like and but </joey>
<garnt> they they </garnt>
<garnt> paid for so many original shows as well </garnt>
<garnt> they're just wait who's on there </garnt>
<connor> i don't [ __ ] know i i didn't go on i </connor>
<garnt> didn't i didn't yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't even know about this oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah how did you know about this a </garnt>
<garnt> couple of years ago i think was it a </garnt>
<connor> couple of years ago </connor>
<joey> was like two years ago i think yeah no </joey>
<joey> it was like a year ago was it i think it </joey>
<joey> might i don't [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> it's a recent map i don't even count </joey>
<connor> last year last year frankly just flew by </connor>
<joey> i i can't i can't remember anything did </joey>
<joey> that happen 2019 it was a year ago yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm still 22 as far as i'm concerned </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] king crimson like existed in </garnt>
<garnt> 2020 </garnt>
<garnt> and just like [ __ ] erased the entire </garnt>
<garnt> year and we just skipped it literally </garnt>
<connor> felt like last month </connor>
<connor> was like april 2020. this is really </connor>
<joey> weird </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean we're already halfway </joey>
<garnt> through 2021 which is terrifying didn't </garnt>
<garnt> mixer die as well </garnt>
<connor> yeah mixer died oh yeah yeah man [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> wish i got offered to move to mixer </connor>
<garnt> i'd have got a nice cash out and ninja's </garnt>
<garnt> just like set for life and </garnt>
<garnt> he's the only reason anyone knows about </garnt>
<garnt> mixer i think </garnt>
<garnt> um but like yeah i mean like even with </garnt>
<garnt> those failed platforms they had like </garnt>
<garnt> millions and billions of dollars </garnt>
<garnt> invested into them by angel investors </garnt>
<joey> yeah they definitely weren't started by </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] kickstarter </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and and unfortunately like </garnt>
<garnt> even if you have like </garnt>
<joey> what's what what would be like the most </joey>
<garnt> successful kickstarter of all time </garnt>
<garnt> what what i don't know what's like </garnt>
<connor> that's very telling that we can't think </connor>
<garnt> of one </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm sure there is some good ones </garnt>
<garnt> out there i just i </garnt>
<garnt> i've never been interested yeah to get </garnt>
<garnt> pursued any good kickstarter you can </garnt>
<connor> just buy the thing when it [ __ ] comes </connor>
<garnt> out yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and and because i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> thinking with the money that with the </garnt>
<garnt> money that </garnt>
<garnt> kickstarter can be people can invest </garnt>
<garnt> into kickstarter even like the most </garnt>
<garnt> successful kickstarter of all time would </garnt>
<garnt> probably have trouble </garnt>
<garnt> getting into the streaming field the </garnt>
<joey> only one i remember </joey>
<joey> was those like sunglasses that had the </joey>
<joey> built-in headphones into it </joey>
<joey> remember those that was successful there </joey>
<joey> was a kickstarter i remember it because </joey>
<joey> it was like during </joey>
<joey> my uni days but there was this there's </joey>
<garnt> this pair of sunglasses where on the </garnt>
<garnt> brim </garnt>
<garnt> here it was like this new technology and </garnt>
<garnt> audio where </garnt>
<garnt> it would vibrate and the vibrations </garnt>
<garnt> would travel </garnt>
<joey> through your ears and the music will </joey>
<joey> come into yours and i remember it was a </joey>
<joey> successful kickstarter i was like </joey>
<joey> millions of dollars </joey>
<joey> but that's not successful yeah but is </joey>
<garnt> that the most successful kickstarter of </garnt>
<connor> all time </connor>
<garnt> is the most success are you kidding me </garnt>
<garnt> nabi number eight </garnt>
<joey> oh number eight the who yeah is like how </joey>
<joey> much money did the ouya raise </joey>
<joey> uh eight million five hundred ninety six </joey>
<connor> thousand eight yeah but you gotta bear </connor>
<connor> in mind right even if even if someone </connor>
<garnt> raised </garnt>
<garnt> 20 million </garnt>
<connor> even if somebody raised 200 300 million </connor>
<connor> dollars that doesn't mean </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] for streaming you can't you can't </connor>
<garnt> buy much with that </garnt>
<garnt> no that's what that's what i'm trying to </garnt>
<garnt> say like even with the most successful </garnt>
<garnt> kickstarters of all time </garnt>
<connor> to get into this field you need external </connor>
<connor> investors </connor>
<connor> if if they really want to challenge the </connor>
<connor> big guys you know because there's a </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of money in there right </connor>
<connor> was it broke yeah </connor>
<joey> you could gather all the anime fans in </joey>
<joey> the wall and it probably won't even be </joey>
<connor> enough don't understand people can </connor>
<connor> invest in kickstarter after like it's </connor>
<connor> just track record it's just </connor>
<connor> poorly have you ever donated to a </connor>
<connor> kickstarter no why you saved like 20 </connor>
<connor> and you got to put 100 in for some [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> and it's like i'll just wait till it </connor>
<connor> comes out </connor>
<joey> i've done i've done a few but not like </joey>
<connor> the stupid amount of money that some </connor>
<connor> people like </connor>
<connor> every time i look at a kickstarter and i </connor>
<connor> see like the you know the top tiers </connor>
<joey> which are like </joey>
<joey> a thousand ten thousand dollars and you </joey>
<joey> see like one left two left i'm like who </joey>
<joey> are these people </joey>
<joey> because they're just dropping ten </joey>
<connor> thousand dollars for stuff that </connor>
<joey> genuinely needs the money i would be </joey>
<joey> more inclined like a game or something </joey>
<joey> that i like i'm into i would but </joey>
<joey> i haven't though but yeah most of the </joey>
<joey> time the stuff that gets the most is </joey>
<connor> just like [ __ ] pre-orders essentially </connor>
<connor> you're just </connor>
<connor> the products made they know what they're </connor>
<garnt> doing and you're just pre-ordering yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean with kickstarter i feel like if </garnt>
<garnt> it's a small indie project or something </garnt>
<joey> that you can see </joey>
<joey> feasibly getting funded on kickstarter </joey>
<joey> yeah i would support it i mean i </joey>
<joey> i think the last kick starter i </joey>
<connor> supported was actually uh the </connor>
<connor> trigger anime i think they funded </connor>
<joey> the second ova of like little witch </joey>
<garnt> academy yeah yeah yeah i supported that </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> that makes sense to me that seems like a </connor>
<connor> like this is why kickstarter should </connor>
<garnt> exist </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but like if you're if you're </garnt>
<garnt> coming in trying to change like </garnt>
<garnt> stir up an entire industry or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> kickstarter is just not going to do it </garnt>
<garnt> anymore i think kickstarter is really </garnt>
<garnt> good for </garnt>
<garnt> you know a small indie team to do some </garnt>
<garnt> kind of project </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] industry changing project </garnt>
<garnt> you need something else </garnt>
<joey> usually kickstarters is for like you </joey>
<joey> know like kind of it stops at an </joey>
<joey> artistic level right </joey>
<joey> it's not really the thing that you go </joey>
<joey> into to be like </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna cause a scene in the in the </joey>
<connor> industry you know [ __ ] everything on </connor>
<connor> kickstarter is the same </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] it's like all right get the stock </connor>
<connor> image of people running </connor>
<joey> play the play the music mood and the the </joey>
<joey> the you know the you know the </joey>
<joey> the ukulele on that one or like there's </joey>
<joey> always there's always some like </joey>
<joey> motivational thing and then it's just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> have you ever had this problem that </joey>
<joey> isn't a problem well now we can solve it </joey>
<connor> and then it looks amazing and then you </connor>
<connor> think about it like it's all [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it's always it's always the same type of </joey>
<joey> people that are kick-started too isn't </joey>
<joey> it yeah it's always like the way to </joey>
<joey> overly enthusiastic like </joey>
<connor> my name is kyle it'll be either it'll </connor>
<joey> either be someone from california or </joey>
<joey> someone from eastern europe </joey>
<joey> yeah like with a really thick accent </joey>
<joey> explaining why </joey>
<joey> his fridge is the best fridge and it's </joey>
<joey> like okay </joey>
<joey> that's cool that's fine i just don't </joey>
<joey> want it with our last project the </joey>
<joey> walking fridge </joey>
<joey> we raised two hundred thousand dollars </joey>
<garnt> that's insane i just i just realized </garnt>
<garnt> that kickstarters are basically the </garnt>
<garnt> modern infomercials </garnt>
<connor> yeah i just don't believe </connor>
<connor> any any any single advertisement </connor>
<connor> where someone gives it to a random </connor>
<joey> person </joey>
<joey> and they're like whoa it's amazing i </joey>
<joey> just don't believe that i if even if it </joey>
<joey> actually happens </joey>
<joey> i just don't want i don't i don't even </joey>
<connor> believe it when there's another thing </connor>
<garnt> which says like not a paid actor yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you sure about that oh you did you said </garnt>
<joey> go back to anime tube </joey>
<joey> did you see the [ __ ] testimonials </joey>
<joey> they had </joey>
<connor> i think they just got like some random </connor>
<garnt> people they found on discord to give </garnt>
<garnt> them testimonials of that app or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that </garnt>
<joey> it's good what was the testimonial </joey>
<garnt> let me let me let me see let me see let </garnt>
<joey> me see if i can bring it up right now </joey>
<connor> but uh yeah i mean it's it's all it's </connor>

<connor> a third party's website you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean even some third-party websites </connor>
<connor> right like even amazon they're all </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] right like and especially if it's </connor>
<connor> on your website </connor>
<connor> no i don't trust your review five stars </connor>
<connor> no way it's on your website i just don't </connor>
<joey> trust amazon reviews in general like </joey>
<joey> especially in japan </joey>
<connor> there's i mean we've talked about this </connor>
<joey> before right yeah but </joey>
<joey> i mean that's why uh they have like the </joey>
<garnt> certified seller thing certified uh </garnt>
<garnt> buyer </garnt>
<garnt> yeah bought it which makes more sense </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um we need more people like melin </garnt>
<joey> with the hard opinions </joey>
<garnt> i'm a [ __ ] reviewer because i don't </garnt>
<garnt> really give a [ __ ] as long as it does </garnt>
<joey> the thing </joey>
<joey> i i don't care some people could have </joey>
<joey> you know written a review for like you </joey>
<joey> know something or anything </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm always five or one star i'm </joey>
<joey> that guy i'm that kind of guy </joey>
<connor> because that's the tim might see me it </connor>
<connor> either works or it does yeah </connor>
<garnt> and like if it looks fine fine that's it </garnt>
<garnt> if it does the thing i paid for it to do </garnt>
<joey> five stars that's great </joey>
<joey> those [ __ ] were like two out of ten </joey>
<connor> the box was bruised </connor>
<connor> like people people like rate furniture </connor>
<connor> and they're they're like it was </connor>
<joey> complicated to build </joey>
<joey> uh two stars and i'm like but that's </joey>
<joey> truly that's just like that's on you bro </joey>
<joey> yeah i feel like that's that's a </joey>
<joey> interpretation thing like is the thing </joey>
<connor> good yeah at the end of the day you're </connor>
<connor> only going to build it for like one hour </connor>
<garnt> or two hours or so there are some times </garnt>
<joey> when i'm just like how </joey>
<joey> like i'm pretty sure you need a phd to </joey>
<joey> translate okay this </joey>
<connor> is the instruction manual that they gave </connor>
<garnt> every item there's just like one </garnt>
<garnt> thing i know what you mean but at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time like my okay i have a coffee </garnt>
<garnt> table right now that was </garnt>
<garnt> so over engineered and the amount of </garnt>
<garnt> screws and [ __ ] for it was </garnt>
<joey> totally stupid yeah that was three hours </joey>
<joey> out of like the two years i've been </joey>
<joey> using it </joey>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] about those three </joey>
<joey> hours looking back now that's why i </joey>
<joey> write the review like three months after </joey>
<joey> i get it because then i'm like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah it's good it's just still </joey>
<joey> standing that's why i wait if it breaks </joey>
<joey> after like one month all right fine but </joey>
<joey> that's one star i shouldn't have broke </joey>
<joey> one month if i use it but like </joey>
<joey> people these people who write it and </joey>
<connor> they're like um the cardboard box was </connor>
<connor> slightly damaged you know the furniture </connor>
<connor> took a little longer than i'd like to it </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] off the delivery man had a bad </joey>
<joey> attitude like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it's got nothing to do with anything and </connor>
<connor> then as well even if it breaks i'm like </connor>
<connor> all right how long reasonably did i </connor>
<connor> expect it to last </connor>
<connor> like my bed's broken is that but it's </connor>
<connor> two years is that </connor>
<connor> he also spent like 100 bucks on it it </connor>
<connor> was 300 bucks for the mattress and the </connor>
<joey> bed </joey>
<joey> which is very cheap for a bed </joey>
<garnt> considering how much we've spent </garnt>
<garnt> uh like on amazon to get like our first </garnt>
<garnt> furniture i think </garnt>
<garnt> the furniture i have right now has </garnt>
<connor> lasted very well um </connor>
<connor> my bed is like the this design of this </connor>
<connor> bed is when i was building that i'm like </connor>
<joey> huh this doesn't seem </joey>
<joey> super structurally stable i understand </joey>
<joey> why i was three stars now yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> well basically you know that meme with </joey>
<joey> the cheeto in the door holding the </joey>
<joey> door closed there's like a tiny plank </joey>
<joey> like a piece of plywood </joey>
<connor> that basically is like holding up the </connor>
<connor> middle of the bed and like all the way </connor>
<connor> on it </connor>
<joey> that doesn't sound safe no and uh </joey>
<joey> when you stood on that and jumped on it </joey>
<connor> would just crack right well one time i </connor>
<connor> i think i like just like like because i </connor>
<joey> don't know i i wouldn't say i get into </joey>
<joey> bed aggressively yeah </joey>
<joey> but i'm not like i'm not polite about it </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna be like </joey>
<joey> i'm not like i'm not like like sneaking </joey>
<garnt> into my bed you know i just kind of like </garnt>
<connor> you know just </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] lady beard and just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> does a clothesline on the bed or </connor>
<connor> something like that </connor>
<connor> boom no so i just like </connor>
<joey> plopped on my bed and i just heard the </joey>
<joey> boom and then and then i like looked </joey>
<joey> under my bed and this thing had just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] went lit to the side and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh that's our [ __ ] no no </joey>
<joey> it's literally just like </joey>
<joey> put in with the weight it's just a plank </joey>
<joey> of like like literally like if this is </joey>
<joey> the bed </joey>
<joey> make sure i don't trip the like it's </joey>
<joey> just like this you just got to like </joey>
<joey> center this piece of wood </joey>
<joey> it's literally like this size as well oh </joey>
<joey> my god and so when i when i </joey>
<connor> i looked and it was like this i was just </connor>
<joey> like oh sorry so i'm just like </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> so i do that every time it does it now i </connor>
<garnt> mean that's that that works right </garnt>

<garnt> springs though why </garnt>

<connor> it to like actually get the right shape </connor>
<garnt> but then it's amazing </garnt>
<garnt> i want to like feel some bounce on it </garnt>
<garnt> with with the memory foam one it feels </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm sleeping in quicksand </garnt>
<garnt> where you just sink in and you're just </garnt>
<joey> like oh yeah that's the thing though </joey>
<joey> like the comfort envelopes </joey>
<connor> but i feel like the thing is you know i </connor>
<connor> mean uh i feel like that's like </connor>
<connor> admitting you're just single if you get </connor>
<joey> a memory foam one </joey>
<joey> because it's like it's not it's not an </joey>
<joey> exciting bed you know </joey>
<joey> what do you mean do i need to explain </joey>
<garnt> god please there's no bounce </garnt>
<joey> i got chances right i mean it's just </joey>
<connor> depressing it's it's it's </connor>
<garnt> it's like [ __ ] on a bean bag you know </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i don't i don't use memory foam </garnt>
<connor> beds so </connor>
<connor> you go then you know what i mean i like </connor>
<connor> the bounce i mean i like to bounce </connor>
<garnt> normally when i'm sleeping </garnt>
<joey> you know what are you [ __ ] sleeping </joey>
<connor> like this </connor>
<connor> you can like rebound them </connor>
<joey> i need some balance when i'm fighting my </joey>
<connor> sleep paralysis </connor>
<connor> get do i up need to explain this come on </connor>
<connor> i get it i get it sometimes you know </connor>
<joey> sometimes you just want to play a bit of </joey>
<garnt> basketball right </garnt>
<connor> just want to dribble some balls </connor>
<joey> sometimes you need to like dribble you </joey>
<connor> know what i mean </connor>
<connor> can you catch my drift guys </connor>
<garnt> but like spring breads are like awful </garnt>
<joey> for that they they're they are </joey>
<joey> good you can use this same bread </joey>
<joey> didn't i you literally said stupid </joey>
<connor> have you ever slept on a water bed </connor>
<garnt> before i imagine i imagine that must be </garnt>
<garnt> fun </garnt>
<garnt> that's really fun it's like literally is </garnt>
<garnt> that actually fun is it comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> it's really okay i find it to be super </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] comfortable but that's because </garnt>
<garnt> again it's like </garnt>
<joey> it's but i find memory foam to be really </joey>
<joey> comfortable so it's kind of like that </joey>
<joey> because like </joey>
<joey> the the mattress kind of follows you as </joey>
<connor> you're moving around </connor>
<joey> but then like if you're if you're like </joey>
<joey> in a if you're like you become the </joey>
<joey> mattress you get a double memory foam </joey>
<joey> mattress so </joey>
<joey> you guys are like never going to touch </joey>
<connor> each other you guys are going to be like </connor>
<connor> we have our we have our crevice it is </connor>
<garnt> set </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's why that's what i don't like </garnt>
<connor> about memory foam mattresses that's </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> it's a single like a single bed there's </connor>
<connor> no movement i'm not seeing enough </connor>
<connor> movement </connor>
<connor> anywhere on a memory foam mattress you </connor>
<connor> sink in and that's just it </connor>
<connor> that's what that's what couples do when </connor>
<connor> they like agree that they're just not </connor>
<connor> having sex anymore like that's </connor>
<joey> that's what that is true everything so </joey>
<connor> let me just sink into my car yeah </connor>
<connor> because you have your </connor>
<connor> you literally if your memory foam is </connor>
<connor> like set you it's so uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> to move to a position where it isn't set </connor>
<joey> what about what about memory foam </joey>
<joey> pillows </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i like the pillows yeah do you </joey>
<garnt> like the pillows nah </garnt>
<garnt> i i like feeling that i like it i like a </garnt>
<garnt> little resistance i like a little bounce </garnt>
<garnt> on like whatever i'm [ __ ] the </garnt>
<joey> pillowcard </joey>
<joey> i like when the pillow fights yeah </joey>
<garnt> i think the pillow needs like a little </garnt>
<joey> bit of firmness i like when the pillow's </joey>
<garnt> at scenario you know like </garnt>
<garnt> if you see if you're sinking too much </garnt>
<connor> then i feel like being able to like you </connor>
<connor> know if i'm </connor>
<joey> kind of just not happy with the pillow i </joey>
<joey> can just like punch the [ __ ] out of this </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah literally until you're like all </connor>
<garnt> right it is refreshed </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because you guys sometimes you </garnt>
<connor> could just you just gotta [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> tenderize the pillow right you [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> gonna get the [ __ ] steak tenderizer </connor>
<connor> all right now it's perfect i used to i </connor>
<connor> used to use two pillows exclusively but </connor>
<connor> now for some reason i can't use two is </connor>
<joey> that like getting old is that an old </joey>
<joey> no i've i've actually gone the opposite </joey>
<joey> i used to be able to sleep on one pillow </joey>
<joey> but now i need two </joey>
<connor> i can't do two anymore it has to be one </connor>
<joey> what i don't know </joey>
<joey> maybe because my when i was a child uh </joey>
<joey> when i was a child sorry my mom already </joey>
<joey> bought </joey>
<connor> the shittest thinnest pillows maybe that </connor>
<connor> was why ah so i was like yeah i always </connor>
<connor> sleep with two and i'm like this </connor>
<joey> yo i always stick with two pillows no i </joey>
<joey> was the opposite like i had like the </joey>
<joey> really really thin pillows right and we </joey>
<joey> couldn't afford another pillow so </joey>
<connor> i think that's why yeah i think that's </connor>
<joey> why i had two so i was like why am i </joey>
<joey> waking up with a headache every morning </joey>
<connor> oh it's because all the blood is rushing </connor>
<connor> to my head </connor>
<connor> like this japan has these pillows that </connor>
<connor> you get in like hotels and stuff that i </connor>
<joey> hate </joey>
<joey> which ones like double-sided ones yeah </joey>
<joey> um but </joey>
<joey> but double-sided pillows double-sided no </joey>
<joey> no so like that there's two different </joey>
<joey> types of material on each side </joey>
<joey> and one of them is literally like solid </joey>
<joey> bean bag like it's like a bean bag that </joey>
<joey> you have to like </joey>
<joey> physically like move around it's the </joey>
<joey> sand one right yeah it's horrible </joey>
<connor> i love it and it's like sticking into </connor>
<joey> your neck it's now what yeah what </joey>
<joey> i love like you know when you're like </joey>
<joey> sleeping on a futon like the the sand </joey>
<connor> pillows that you get on i know i hate </connor>
<connor> those give me something soft i love </connor>
<joey> those because it again like it gives me </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> perfect height where it makes me sleep </garnt>
<garnt> so well did you just say sand pillows </garnt>
<joey> it's it feels like saying it's like a </joey>
<connor> speed yeah </connor>
<connor> rock solid though yeah it's it's like if </connor>
<joey> you packed a </joey>
<joey> a bean bag a little with too much beans </joey>
<connor> yeah i stayed in a hotel one time and i </connor>
<connor> was like when i left i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that was horrible oh you just flipped it </joey>
<joey> like what </joey>
<joey> i didn't know that you can just most of </joey>
<connor> them are two-sided so the other side </connor>
<joey> will be like a normal pillow oh i always </joey>
<joey> just like go to the hotel just touch the </joey>
<joey> sand side i'm like dude </joey>
<connor> i'm satisfied i'll take it i hate the </connor>
<joey> sand maybe because i used to sleep with </joey>
<joey> those at my grandma's place </joey>
<connor> that's all she had she might it just </connor>
<connor> makes me feel like i'm in a hospital i </connor>
<connor> don't know why </connor>
<joey> hospital but the hospitals have like the </joey>
<joey> super like pillows that kind of go </joey>
<joey> out like this right </joey>
<connor> i don't know i don't think i've never </connor>
<connor> stayed in hospital </connor>
<garnt> you've never stayed in a hospital no </garnt>
<garnt> i've stayed in a hospital </garnt>
<garnt> once i'm trying to remember if i have i </garnt>
<connor> definitely have it's just </connor>
<connor> it's not a common occurrence obviously </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<garnt> maybe i have some time in my childhood </garnt>
<joey> i'm just taking a weekly trip to the </joey>
<connor> hospital which is casual it's a free </connor>
<connor> hotel in the uk if you get injured </connor>
<joey> have you ever like injured you have you </joey>
<joey> ever like been to the hospital like </joey>
<joey> with an injury and stuff like that have </joey>
<joey> you ever talked about that like you've </joey>
<joey> injured yourself so bad that you had to </joey>
<joey> go to the hospital </joey>
<garnt> not like breaking a bone or anything </garnt>
<joey> i've i've never had any bad injuries i </joey>
<joey> don't think </joey>
<joey> um no you i had once like i have like </joey>
<joey> stitches </joey>
<joey> but you can still kind of see it right </joey>
<joey> right there on my finger um that was the </joey>
<garnt> only time </garnt>
<garnt> because like i fell when i was like two </garnt>
<garnt> years old and i landed </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of like my hands like that and </garnt>
<connor> a piece of glass just went </connor>
<garnt> straight into there so they had to pull </garnt>
<connor> it out and give me stitches but that's </connor>
<connor> about it really that wasn't boring yeah </connor>
<connor> that was really fun </connor>
<connor> drink my milk bro i've had some pretty </connor>
<connor> bad injuries but something i've never </connor>
<connor> had like never been like i've always </connor>
<joey> been like walking off or get off </joey>
<garnt> just your arms falling i probably have </garnt>
<garnt> like broken my toe or something i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> not knowing about it you know </garnt>
<connor> that's pretty common i feel like it's </connor>
<connor> pretty common i've sprained my wrists </connor>
<joey> yeah it was from like i think i told the </joey>
<joey> story when i failed like a jump scheme </joey>
<joey> snowboarding right and that was [ __ ] </joey>

<connor> i've been very lucky </connor>
<joey> wanting yourself so hard you dislocate </joey>
<connor> your wrist or something i don't know i </connor>
<connor> think about all the injuries i've had </connor>
<connor> and how i've just </connor>
<connor> never had any damage from it i'm like </connor>
<connor> that's very lucky tipped a quad bike </connor>
<connor> when i was like 10 on myself </connor>
<garnt> and you didn't go to the hospital i </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't injured at all jesus hipped a </garnt>
<garnt> quad bike on yourself yeah how'd you do </garnt>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> i tipped a quad bike so my uh because </connor>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> my mate owned a farm and i love getting </joey>
<joey> his house because it's just basically </joey>
<joey> like a free theme park </joey>
<joey> yeah and farms are great when you're </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like everything's just </joey>
<joey> a quad bike and he had a quad bike yeah </joey>
<joey> and his dad </joey>
<joey> didn't give a [ __ ] he was just like you </joey>
<joey> need to go on the quad bike right so you </joey>
<joey> just let us go on the quad bike </joey>
<joey> um and i i i was like uh one of those </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] danger addicts when i was </joey>
<joey> like a 10 year old i just wanted to like </joey>
<joey> do dangerous things </joey>
<joey> yeah so uh my friend he was used to </joey>
<joey> going on the quad bike </joey>
<connor> and uh he was just like yeah it's all </connor>
<connor> right just don't go too fast and i was </connor>
<connor> like all right </connor>
<connor> immediately went too fast i'm like i was </connor>
<connor> just turning really really fast </connor>
<connor> and when i was going so fast the bike </connor>
<connor> just went like oh </connor>
<joey> it just flipped over jesus did like a </joey>
<joey> barrel roll but i i </joey>
<joey> so it like tipped and i think i was </joey>
<joey> small enough where like i don't i don't </joey>
<joey> know how it happened but it tipped </joey>
<joey> yeah i sneaked into the guy i didn't get </joey>
<joey> hurt at all and i just got up </joey>
<joey> and the bar was a little [ __ ] on the </joey>
<connor> thing but we like hit it into place and </connor>
<joey> it was good and then i went back on it </joey>
<joey> you went back on it yeah i would not </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] go back on it </connor>
<joey> i was like yeah dude that was so fun </joey>
<joey> let's do it again almost died let's do </joey>
<garnt> it again </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i haven't mentioned like have you </garnt>
<garnt> guys had any near-death experiences </garnt>
<garnt> before </garnt>
<connor> i told the story about how i'd like got </connor>
<connor> launched with a bounce castle right </connor>
<garnt> yes oh yeah that was probably one as </garnt>
<garnt> well yeah cause i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> remember telling you this uh like a few </garnt>
<connor> days ago but uh i think the nearest </connor>
<connor> death experience i had was like </connor>
<garnt> the most probably the most lamest story </garnt>
<connor> i could tell yeah but uh it was during a </connor>
<garnt> snowball fight </garnt>
<garnt> right so so in university </garnt>
<garnt> uh in england we don't get lost though </garnt>
<connor> we get like snow once or twice a year </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> right and so anytime it snows everyone </garnt>
<garnt> takes the opportunity to play around in </garnt>
<connor> the snow and in university </connor>
<joey> what that means is we just go out and </joey>
<joey> have a bunch of snowball fights right </joey>
<joey> so it was uh like one dorm versus </joey>
<joey> another dorm and we were like </joey>
<joey> having a snowball fight in the middle of </joey>
<joey> this like residential area in bristol </joey>
<joey> right so it wasn't like in the middle of </joey>
<joey> a field or something it was literally </joey>
<joey> like on the roads and the pavements uh </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> i remember we were just throwing </joey>
<joey> snowballs and </joey>
<joey> one [ __ ] right you you know you have </joey>
<joey> like the snowballs and some you you </joey>
<joey> the common courtesy is you make the </joey>
<joey> powder snowballs yes of course of course </joey>
<joey> right of course one [ __ ] decided to </joey>
<connor> make an ice ball </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean the ones where it's </connor>
<joey> like melted ice and you [ __ ] pack it </joey>
<connor> in and it's on the side of the road yeah </connor>
<garnt> on the side of the road where you just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> this didn't put a stone in it people </connor>
<joey> used to do that in my school </joey>
<garnt> seriously i feel like ice balls are like </garnt>
<joey> even worse because you get you get the </joey>
<garnt> you get the hardness of the ice and the </garnt>
<garnt> coldness as well which is like numbing </garnt>
<joey> as well it's basically just getting a </joey>
<garnt> cold rock yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i was i was standing right by </garnt>
<garnt> the side of the road and </garnt>
<garnt> i see the snowball coming and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like it's a snowball whatever </garnt>
<garnt> hits my [ __ ] balls and then i realize </garnt>
<garnt> number one </garnt>
<garnt> that is perfect aim because it literally </garnt>
<garnt> hit my balls </garnt>
<garnt> number two that is not a snowball i just </garnt>
<garnt> felt </garnt>
<garnt> that is a solid ice ball that just came </garnt>
<garnt> full force right onto my [ __ ] balls i </garnt>
<joey> i have a really similar story but he </joey>
<garnt> said total opposite it was at the beach </garnt>
<garnt> right and uh and my dad and i were at </garnt>
<joey> the beach i think i was like maybe </joey>
<joey> 11 12 years old right and my dad and i </joey>
<joey> were kicking like the </joey>
<joey> the rugby ball around and like one thing </joey>
<joey> i really liked was trying to catch </joey>
<joey> like the ball that gets kicked really </joey>
<joey> high up and then you kind of get under </joey>
<joey> it yeah </joey>
<joey> like that right so we were doing that a </joey>
<joey> couple of times i was practicing that </joey>
<joey> and one time my dad just kicks it really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] high up and i was like alright i </joey>
<joey> got it </joey>
<joey> sun's in my eyes but i got it i think i </joey>
<joey> got this and it </joey>
<joey> comes down it misses my arm and it just </joey>
<joey> perfectly </joey>
<joey> flicks my knob </joey>
<garnt> it just flicks out that's the brush </garnt>
<garnt> land on my balls it just flicked it like </garnt>
<garnt> it went </garnt>
<joey> like that on my knob and i just </joey>
<garnt> collapsed yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was because like i like if if you if </garnt>
<joey> you're not a guy if you're not a male </joey>
<joey> it's really hard to describe </joey>
<garnt> the pain you feel when your knob gets </garnt>
<joey> flicked or some </joey>
<joey> and so obviously this happened to me and </joey>
<joey> i was in total agony </joey>
<joey> right because your mind just goes blank </joey>
<joey> so i </joey>
<joey> i start like walking forwards and i </joey>
<joey> didn't realize i was walking right into </joey>
<garnt> the middle of a road right because i was </garnt>
<joey> just like i was just like </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] and then </joey>
<garnt> the last thing i remember is my mate go </garnt>
<garnt> go what the [ __ ] and he grabs my bag and </garnt>
<joey> pulls me back right everyone pulls me </joey>
<joey> back and then i just see this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> bus just going </joey>
<joey> right in front of me and uh yeah that </joey>
<garnt> was that was the </garnt>
<garnt> that was the closest i've come to dying </garnt>
<joey> i think imagine </joey>
<joey> dying while grabbing your balls i think </joey>
<connor> you actually just missed out on your own </connor>
<joey> isa guy story yeah right </joey>
<garnt> that was your chance that that was one </garnt>
<garnt> drop yeah that was that was literally </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> an easter guy origin story yeah i got a </garnt>
<garnt> snow i i got an ice ball </garnt>
<joey> i want to watch an instagram story that </joey>
<garnt> literally starts out like that where the </garnt>
<connor> protagonist gets </connor>
<connor> smashed in the balls and then gets </connor>
<joey> transported to another world jesus </joey>
<connor> christ that's scary yeah but </connor>
<connor> i don't know if i've had any near-death </connor>
<joey> experiences i had a really stupid </joey>
<joey> accident one time mm-hmm </joey>
<joey> we owned like one of those big </joey>
<joey> trampolines like the uh it's like </joey>
<joey> the the big ones there's like two sizes </joey>
<joey> right they're small and then there's a </joey>
<joey> big one yeah yeah yeah yeah have one of </joey>
<joey> those </joey>
<joey> and uh i love doing like front flips </joey>
<joey> backflips all the works on it </joey>
<joey> you name it i jumped it right yeah i </joey>
<joey> jumped it i flipped it yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and uh uh one time i was like i'm </joey>
<joey> just gonna do it on my knees </joey>
<joey> like i was like practicing like doing </joey>
<joey> tricks on my knees and one time i just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> did something landed on my knees and </joey>
<joey> instead of like </joey>
<joey> me jumping back my back just went like </joey>
<connor> like while i was still on my knees </connor>
<connor> so my back oh jesus like that and i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i've never had this pain in my life i </connor>
<connor> want to like throw up immediately i </connor>

<joey> watching you where you you literally </joey>
<joey> oh you had the trampoline at your house </joey>
<joey> yeah your parents are like he's probably </joey>
<joey> having fun on the trampoline </joey>
<connor> having a trampoline in your house is </connor>
<connor> great when your friends came over </connor>
<connor> because you could just [ __ ] fight on </connor>
<joey> it yeah we didn't have a </joey>
<joey> backyard big enough for a trampoline </joey>
<garnt> yeah i didn't have that much space yeah </garnt>
<joey> my backyard's pretty big </joey>
<garnt> um well you're a country boy aren't you </garnt>
<garnt> what's whales </garnt>
<garnt> most people have a pretty decent sized </garnt>
<joey> backyard it's really good though i mean </joey>
<joey> yeah it's great we just fight on it and </joey>
<joey> stuff </joey>
<joey> as you do so in other news uh japan is </joey>
<garnt> back on lockdown </garnt>
<garnt> no way we you know what we had a </garnt>
<joey> pleasant </joey>
<joey> two weeks </joey>
<joey> what blows my mind is that they they </joey>
<joey> cancel spectators like </joey>
<joey> now for the olympics it's starting this </joey>
<joey> month right yeah like in a couple weeks </joey>
<joey> yeah what the [ __ ] actually by the time </joey>
<joey> this is up it's </joey>
<connor> probably probably started yeah it's </connor>
<joey> insane to me that they cancelled it </joey>
<joey> this like the spectators this late when </joey>
<joey> you know but the athletes are still live </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean that's that's i mean i get </joey>
<joey> that but like as if they didn't know how </joey>
<joey> bad the situation </joey>
<joey> was it's like whoa [ __ ] didn't get </joey>
<joey> better suddenly what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you know it's just to me it's insane </joey>
<joey> that you know it's also just </joey>
<joey> irresponsible as well because it's </joey>
<joey> probably people who booked </joey>
<joey> hotels you know because even in japan </joey>
<joey> right you can come from </joey>
<joey> hokkaido wherever the [ __ ] you are you </joey>
<joey> can come and watch poor people probably </joey>
<connor> book time off work maybe probably booked </connor>
<joey> some hotels yeah they use their limited </joey>
<garnt> like payless </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the cyberpunk release but just </garnt>
<joey> like on a scale 10 times that you know </joey>
<connor> if somebody booked time off work in </connor>
<connor> japan they ain't playing around no </connor>
<garnt> that doesn't happen like the japanese </garnt>
<connor> government just puts out a tweet which </connor>
<joey> is just like the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> the yellow thing yeah we have delayed </connor>
<connor> the olympics </connor>
<joey> we have cancelled spectators we </joey>
<garnt> apologize </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's just yeah unfortunately </garnt>
<garnt> you're not we're gonna have to wait even </garnt>
<garnt> longer for the new figure episode </garnt>
<garnt> because uh we </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we're still under a new lockdown </garnt>
<garnt> and it just feels like </garnt>
<garnt> this entire year has just been a </garnt>
<garnt> lockdown but not really for us </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like now that the rest of the </garnt>
<garnt> world is kind of getting back to normal </garnt>
<garnt> it's really weird seeing timelines where </garnt>
<garnt> people are having parties and going out </garnt>
<garnt> with our masks and stuff and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> here like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this is just this is just life this </garnt>
<garnt> is life yeah this is just life now for </garnt>
<connor> us right </connor>
<connor> it's it's weird because it's like i </connor>
<connor> don't i know we've talked about this a </connor>
<connor> lot before but it's because it's such an </connor>
<connor> ongoing thing and it changes throughout </connor>
<connor> the time it's like all right restaurants </connor>
<joey> open </joey>
<joey> all right okay cool but now they're </joey>
<joey> close to eight all right okay but now </joey>
<joey> they consider alcohol okay but now they </joey>
<joey> can't it's like </joey>
<connor> what's going on what the [ __ ] is going </connor>
<joey> on it's just i'm so confused </joey>
<joey> three no the limit is six the limit is </joey>
<connor> four yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and then it's like all right and then </connor>
<joey> google maps is completely unreliable now </joey>
<joey> because now </joey>
<joey> all the opening and closing times are </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] live yeah because it's totally </joey>
<joey> dependent on the place and whether </joey>
<joey> they're doing it and </joey>
<joey> most of the time they're not the ones </joey>
<connor> updating their google page so you don't </connor>
<connor> even know if shit's open or not </connor>
<joey> the only thing that has stayed </joey>
<joey> consistent throughout this entire thing </joey>
<joey> is that's literally corn only thing that </joey>
<garnt> stayed consistent pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you want to go to a new place now </garnt>
<garnt> you check out on google maps oh they're </garnt>
<garnt> they're open you turn up at the door </garnt>
<garnt> and they're not open and then you try to </garnt>
<garnt> find another place and it's just kind of </garnt>
<joey> like playing a roulette wheel </joey>
<joey> of just seeing what you can do because </joey>
<joey> it's it's locked down has been really </joey>
<joey> weird because we say lockdown but it's </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> you can you can still go out and work </joey>
<joey> you just can't really </joey>
<connor> do anything else about that i mean the </connor>
<garnt> trains are still </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] packed as [ __ ] oh yeah if you </connor>
<joey> get an eight o'clock train still </joey>
<garnt> you know you're [ __ ] yeah it's you </garnt>
<joey> know you do </joey>
<joey> you still get squeezed in like that </joey>
<joey> there will be people pushing you in </joey>
<joey> still uh during all of this and that's </joey>
<joey> why a lot of the experts say it's </joey>
<joey> so worrying uh in tokyo because the </joey>
<garnt> density is insane </garnt>
<joey> yeah you can't you can't just social </joey>
<garnt> distance anywhere in this [ __ ] town </garnt>
<joey> um and yeah did you see that thing with </joey>
<joey> the tokyo </joey>
<connor> hotel or something where it was like the </connor>
<connor> foreigners have to get a different </connor>
<connor> elevator </connor>
<garnt> from the japanese yeah i saw that i saw </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> classic japanese xenophobia i i heard </joey>
<joey> that it was a misunderstanding i don't </joey>
<joey> know if this is true that's what they </joey>
<joey> all </joey>
<joey> so i heard this was a misunderstanding </joey>
<connor> of especially for people who came from a </connor>
<connor> foreign country </connor>
<joey> uh right even though realistically right </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> you're probably safer if you've come </joey>
<connor> from a foreign country </connor>
<connor> yeah i think that was a lot of the even </connor>
<connor> though like some people were trying to </connor>
<connor> defend it being like no no they meant </connor>
<connor> people who just came in from like </connor>
<joey> america or whatever you know </joey>
<joey> and but a lot of people arguing so like </joey>
<joey> yeah well japan has not handled this </joey>
<joey> very well i don't think they're in the </joey>
<connor> place to be able to </connor>
<joey> you know i don't even think what is this </joey>
<joey> like less than ten percent of the </joey>
<connor> populations </connor>
<connor> got the vaccine right it's something </connor>
<connor> it's probably higher now but yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah but i mean still it's like it's </joey>
<joey> nowhere near where it should be </joey>
<joey> considering the olympics </joey>
<connor> to me it just seems like why not just </connor>
<connor> socially distance in general </connor>
<connor> in the elevator why not just let two </connor>
<connor> people go in at a time on the opposite </connor>
<connor> end why </connor>
<connor> have to make it like the distinction it </connor>
<joey> just yeah i don't know it's uh </joey>
<joey> i mean they could be that's just japan </joey>
<connor> is just a little </connor>
<connor> you know the thing that sucks about </connor>
<joey> japan is that they're just a little too </joey>
<joey> quick on the decision to make it harsh </joey>
<joey> on </joey>
<joey> with making foreign rules they're always </joey>
<joey> like a little too </joey>
<joey> like it's like something it's like is </joey>
<joey> something wrong it's the foreigners </joey>
<connor> they're just a little it's just it's </connor>
<connor> just the speed at which they'll be like </connor>
<connor> maybe we should just maybe just </connor>
<connor> discriminate a little bit </connor>
<joey> i'm feeling a little discriminated for </joey>
<garnt> it today it's like the image of that guy </garnt>
<garnt> falls off the bicycle and she's like </garnt>
<connor> oh it's the foreigner you know i </connor>
<connor> at the one time you know they people do </connor>
<connor> try and justify it and all that but </connor>
<connor> it's just the ease at which sometimes </connor>
<joey> japan does it </joey>
<joey> which bothers me the most like we had </joey>
<joey> that thing from uh the </joey>
<joey> i think did you talk about the podcast </joey>
<joey> the ibaraki prefecture uh </joey>
<joey> i don't think we haven't talked about </joey>
<joey> that yeah </joey>
<joey> prefecture uh gave a warning out for </joey>
<joey> people not to interact with foreigners </joey>
<joey> that's right yeah that was one of their </joey>
<joey> ones oh yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> foreigners um i think again people </joey>
<joey> defended some people found it being like </joey>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> they only have people from a foreign </joey>
<joey> country but there's no way for japanese </joey>
<joey> people to be able to distinguish between </joey>
<joey> persons who came from a foreign country </joey>
<joey> recently yeah it was very obvious what </joey>
<joey> they were trying to say </joey>
<joey> uh which was just stay away from </joey>
<connor> foreigners yeah you know which uh </connor>
<garnt> i mean it's it's it's like the massive </garnt>
<garnt> yikes if if this happened in literally </garnt>
<garnt> any other country they'd just be called </garnt>
<garnt> out for it right right you know and by </garnt>
<joey> by everyone yeah i mean luckily though </joey>
<joey> in a sense like at least what i've seen </joey>
<garnt> on social media </garnt>
<joey> they have been called out yeah that's </joey>
<joey> why they're so quick to retract and </joey>
<joey> being like oh no it was a </joey>
<connor> misunderstanding </connor>
<connor> it was it was retracted very fast and i </connor>
<joey> mean you can imagine why </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's supposed to be very it's </joey>
<joey> an inferior the hotel is </joey>
<joey> like quite a uh what's it notable </joey>
<connor> hotel it's a big friend it's a big big </connor>
<garnt> it's generally an expensive change yeah </garnt>
<connor> is it an expensive chain yeah the tokyo </connor>
<garnt> hotel is a very lightweight it's hard </garnt>
<garnt> oh i didn't i thought it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> this really it's a premium hotel like </garnt>
<connor> excessive </connor>
<connor> and you know normally for rich tourists </connor>
<joey> it's like if the hilton was like no </joey>
<connor> asians yeah it's that level </connor>
<joey> it's you know so uh it's just uh </joey>
<joey> sad very sad yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i forgot what i was going to say </joey>
<joey> something i had a really good point but </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] forgot </joey>
<garnt> i'm dumb must have been a good point it </garnt>
<connor> was such a riveting point but </connor>
<garnt> oh well lost the time yeah oh well i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i mean it's just like it's </garnt>
<garnt> you know obviously we're grateful to be </garnt>
<garnt> here but it's just it's weird that </garnt>
<joey> we it's it's not exactly that we feel </joey>
<joey> discriminated against </joey>
<joey> obviously it's just sometimes there's </joey>
<joey> just like a lot of little things that we </joey>
<joey> see </joey>
<joey> and we feel and obviously hearing news </joey>
<garnt> like this it kind of like adds to that </garnt>
<connor> little by little yeah i mean when i </connor>
<connor> speak to someone my age i've never ever </connor>
<connor> felt </connor>
<connor> that in japan at all i just feel that </connor>
<garnt> the government and like almost in every </garnt>
<garnt> country it's just yeah </garnt>
<garnt> all the people kind of out of touch yeah </garnt>
<joey> really yeah i feel like </joey>
<garnt> but i feel it's especially relevant in </garnt>
<garnt> japan because again the older </garnt>
<joey> populations gosh </joey>
<connor> the majority right yeah the difference </connor>
<connor> is that that's totally fine because </connor>
<connor> that's what the voters want </connor>
<joey> exactly literally all the voters </joey>
<joey> i mean wasn't it like one of the people </joey>
<joey> on the jab on the olympic committee </joey>
<joey> like just saying that women women </joey>
<joey> shouldn't talk </joey>
<garnt> and just stay in the kitchen or </garnt>
<connor> something like that there was something </connor>
<garnt> it was something along the lines of </garnt>
<garnt> women shouldn't be allowed to talk at </garnt>
<garnt> meetings because </garnt>
<garnt> they talk to you they talk oh that was </garnt>
<joey> it yeah yeah at the olympic olympic </joey>
<joey> meetings </joey>
<joey> like that's what dudes in the 50s used </joey>
<connor> to say to their wives </connor>
<connor> but that was the ex-prime minister of </connor>
<connor> japan was it it was the </connor>
<connor> he was the prime minister of japan as </connor>
<connor> far as i'm aware can you google it to </connor>
<garnt> confirm that but as far as i know it's </garnt>
<garnt> the ex-prime minister of japan which </garnt>
<garnt> is just very telling um </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not saying you know the uk is much </garnt>
<garnt> better we're [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah uh but again they're they're </garnt>
<joey> very quick to get called out by it but </joey>
<joey> then people calling out the </joey>
<connor> japanese government for a lot of this </connor>
<connor> stuff you know a lot of the time is the </connor>
<connor> younger people who are doing it like the </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> elderly the social media generation yeah </connor>
<connor> it was the ex prime minister of japan </connor>
<connor> but he's also he's also like what 91 </connor>
<joey> years old or something </joey>
<connor> and he's the [ __ ] like i'm not being </connor>
<connor> funny but no one 91 years old should be </connor>
<connor> making countries </connor>
<joey> i just i think at that point you were </joey>
<connor> just so far out of touch with the </connor>
<connor> country yeah absolutely you you can't </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i mean it's just like at </garnt>
<garnt> that point you don't </garnt>
<garnt> really i mean you're 91 right why would </garnt>
<joey> you care to change </joey>
<joey> for society because you know at that </joey>
<joey> point you already know who you are </joey>
<joey> you're not going to put in the effort to </joey>
<joey> change exactly um and </joey>
<joey> it's just yeah at that point you </joey>
<garnt> probably shouldn't be running a </garnt>
<garnt> yeah a country you know i mean like what </garnt>
<garnt> joe ben like 70 something but then like </garnt>
<garnt> bernie makes me always think like damn </garnt>
<garnt> okay maybe old people maybe they know </garnt>
<garnt> what's up </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah i think they forgot </garnt>
<joey> i guess that says </joey>
<garnt> that's not too political in the show </garnt>
<garnt> this is probably the most political </garnt>
<joey> we've ever gotten on the show </joey>
<joey> what's naming politicians </joey>
<joey> he said the name </joey>
<connor> yeah i don't know it's one of those </connor>
<connor> things where it's like i don't know it's </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> yeah they're a little too comfortable </connor>
<connor> with uh dishing that [ __ ] out </connor>
<joey> that then like whenever i hear stories </joey>
<joey> like that there's a part of me that </joey>
<joey> hears that kind of stuff happening and </joey>
<joey> just makes me wish that young people in </joey>
<joey> japan were a little more politically </joey>
<connor> interested </connor>
<connor> yeah they pretty much have no interest </connor>
<joey> absolutely or even if they do they don't </joey>
<connor> they don't </connor>
<connor> talk about it no one talks about it </connor>
<connor> publicly barely anyone has any interest </connor>
<connor> no one believes in the government here </connor>
<connor> they're just like yeah whatever they're </connor>
<joey> just doing their thing yeah as long as </joey>
<connor> we're not in a war with another country </connor>
<connor> we're good yeah the consensus seems to </connor>
<connor> be from what i've speak to people is </connor>
<connor> that they're like oh i don't care as </connor>
<connor> long as they don't like ruin my life </connor>
<joey> there's a lot of young people who don't </joey>
<joey> even know who the prime minister is yeah </joey>
<joey> wow </joey>
<joey> yeah it just it just goes to show like </joey>
<connor> they're that out of touch but in japan </connor>
<connor> you don't get to choose the prime </connor>
<connor> minister no you choose the party and </connor>
<connor> then they choose the prime minister </connor>
<garnt> whereas you know i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> technically the same in the uk but it's </garnt>
<garnt> not done like that at all we promised </garnt>
<garnt> who the person is when we're voting and </garnt>
<garnt> that's how it is yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah you wrote for the party uh and you </connor>
<connor> don't get to say who they pick </connor>
<joey> but again it's like i've talked to young </joey>
<connor> people you know some same age a little </connor>
<connor> a little bit younger and there's a lot </connor>
<joey> of them who don't even know what the </joey>
<joey> political parties are or what they do </joey>
<joey> they're just not </joey>
<joey> interested in it whatsoever and it's </joey>
<connor> like i kind of get the vibe </connor>
<connor> that everyone is just like so overworked </connor>
<connor> that they don't </connor>
<joey> have time to care it's the last thing i </joey>
<garnt> want to worry about </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty it's that's pretty much the </garnt>
<joey> vibe i get is like everyone's just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fighting for the life here as it </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> you know everyone's just trying to get </joey>
<joey> through the day they don't they don't </joey>
<garnt> have time to care about </garnt>
<garnt> other other issues a lot of the time i </garnt>
<joey> remember when they like raised the gst </joey>
<connor> from eight percent to ten percent </connor>
<connor> and there was like all these like mobs i </connor>
<connor> saw that there's all these mobs of all </connor>
<connor> these old people </connor>
<connor> how [ __ ] dare you me all the young </connor>
<connor> people like understandable have a nice </connor>
<connor> day i'll just work harder </connor>
<joey> it's like they just don't care it's just </joey>
<joey> like oh they made a new law </joey>
<joey> sick i guess i'm just gonna have to mold </joey>
<joey> my life around this new law now </joey>
<connor> yeah did you what was this speaking of </connor>
<connor> dumb japanese laws </connor>
<joey> you can be arrested in japan if you uh </joey>
<connor> mod uh games like save files </connor>
<joey> yeah that sounds all right can </joey>
<joey> arrested and fined 65 000 pounds </joey>
<connor> about uh about a k in dollars um </connor>
<connor> for selling breath of the wild save </connor>
<connor> files that were modded </connor>
<connor> seriously yeah no check and apparently </connor>
<connor> like i've read about it apparently one </connor>
<connor> of the main reasons why this law was </connor>
<garnt> passed was uh </garnt>
<garnt> because guess which company pushed for </garnt>
<joey> it nintendo </joey>
<garnt> yeah of course they did but obviously </garnt>
<garnt> they tried obviously that [ __ ] just </garnt>
<joey> america's like lamar no </joey>
<joey> they're not passing that law in america </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah because you have the right to </joey>
<joey> do whatever you want with the products </joey>
<connor> you buy </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but yeah nintendo somehow </connor>
<connor> managed to very much push for something </connor>
<joey> to be fair like i think </joey>
<joey> the selling part was the problem right </joey>
<connor> like if you just like put it on </connor>
<connor> but it's also it's also illegal to even </connor>
<joey> modder switch oh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> you can't mod a switch but i think it </joey>
<garnt> isn't it technically illegal everywhere </garnt>
<connor> to mod a switch or no no no </connor>
<connor> so in the us it's counted as you </connor>
<garnt> bought a product and you're allowed to </garnt>
<garnt> do whatever you want with that product </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<garnt> you can you can do whatever you want so </garnt>
<garnt> what's the illegal part then buying the </garnt>
<connor> games </connor>
<connor> getting the games apparently so i i </connor>
<connor> think the way they managed to pass the </connor>
<connor> law is that like it's still like an </connor>
<connor> ongoing </connor>
<connor> thing like a service you don't actually </connor>
<connor> own the game right you own a copy of the </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> and by changing it you're like ruining </connor>
<joey> or </joey>
<joey> if you buy a nintendo product nintendo </joey>
<connor> owns you it's insane </connor>
<connor> there is no escape you know like it's uh </connor>
<connor> didn't </connor>
<connor> apple try i don't know if it's illegal </connor>
<joey> and again can you check it if it's </joey>
<joey> illegal to jailbreak your phone </joey>
<joey> i can't i'm pretty sure it's not a i </joey>
<joey> think it is </joey>
<garnt> i think it's in every country i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know is is it or does it just break </garnt>
<garnt> warranty </garnt>
<connor> i don't know i thought i thought it just </connor>
<connor> broke warranty in the uk i can't </connor>
<joey> remember though </joey>
<joey> it definitely at least breaks warrant </joey>
<connor> yeah i know that </connor>
<garnt> yeah every everyone knows that but uh </garnt>
<connor> generally that's what the [ __ ] you want </connor>
<joey> with the stuff you own </joey>
<joey> i've never heard of anyone getting </joey>
<joey> arrested for jailbreaking well to me i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> just the idea of a like a [ __ ] a raid </connor>
<connor> going on </connor>
<joey> like into some guy's house like get down </joey>
<joey> stop drop the legend of zelda copies put </joey>
<joey> them on the floor </joey>
<joey> and you know in japan right the thing is </joey>
<joey> in japan right boys rock up with hazmat </joey>
<joey> when they arrest people in japan they </joey>
<connor> don't arrest you with two people they </connor>
<connor> send like 20 [ __ ] police officers in </connor>
<garnt> japan when they arrested </garnt>
<garnt> the boys down man they go they got the </garnt>
<joey> whole squad coming </joey>
<connor> overall it's breaking your iphone's </connor>
<joey> warrant yeah yeah yeah it's absolutely </joey>
<joey> guaranteed </joey>
<joey> i think it differs between the country </joey>
<joey> but in terms of like apple it's like </joey>
<connor> they're not going to [ __ ] sue you for </connor>
<joey> doing it yeah yeah so it's just your </joey>
<joey> warranty </joey>
<connor> yeah that's yeah that's but i mean </connor>
<joey> that's understanding well most products </joey>
<joey> do that like hey if you [ __ ] change </joey>
<connor> this thing </connor>
<connor> we're not going to fix it for you if you </connor>
<garnt> break a seal that says this </garnt>
<garnt> breaking the ceo breaks the warranty </garnt>
<garnt> then generally you know that breaks the </garnt>
<joey> warranty right </joey>
<joey> yeah but then i feel you know you also </joey>
<joey> have to understand that japan </joey>
<joey> is you know falling a little bit short </joey>
<joey> on most </joey>
<joey> common sense laws like uh fair use for </joey>
<garnt> example yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i mean failures just isn't the thing </garnt>
<connor> here just seeing </connor>
<connor> all these videos of like nintendo fans </connor>
<joey> playing with nintendo to like change </joey>
<joey> their mind and then like after living </joey>
<joey> here i'm like dude </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's not going to happen </joey>
<joey> that's not how it rolls </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like us pleading with nintendo </joey>
<joey> is not going to [ __ ] do anything </joey>
<joey> unless you should start unless you're in </joey>
<joey> the start-up </joey>
<joey> let's get them to change the law unless </joey>
<joey> unless you are unless you are </joey>
<joey> uh fully 100 japanese and in that </joey>
<joey> boardroom meeting with them </joey>
<joey> it isn't going to matter are miami it's </joey>
<garnt> not gonna change yeah </garnt>
<garnt> definitely like coming coming to live </garnt>
<garnt> here and seeing how it works on the </garnt>
<garnt> inside i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's a lot of like no matter how </garnt>
<garnt> much noise gets made on twitter i think </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time it's gonna fall on deaf </garnt>
<connor> ears yeah so </connor>
<connor> the way that i just i've come to realize </connor>
<connor> at least from </connor>
<connor> living here you can say anything you </connor>
<connor> want over an email you can explain </connor>
<connor> everything as well as you want through a </connor>
<connor> different person but unless </connor>
<connor> there is a japanese guy there in the </connor>
<connor> room yeah at the board meeting </connor>
<connor> explaining something directly to the </connor>
<garnt> person it will not get </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you can't have a zoom call no you </garnt>
<garnt> can't send an email </garnt>
<garnt> you can't send an angry tweet you know </garnt>
<garnt> you know you can [ __ ] ratio the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> out of nintendo they'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't give a [ __ ] you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> you need to have someone there </garnt>
<garnt> explaining to the person </garnt>
<garnt> in person speaking fluent japanese and </garnt>
<garnt> possibly having a japanese passport </garnt>
<garnt> before they take anything seriously and </garnt>
<joey> even then it's like uh so what company </joey>
<joey> do you work for who are your backers who </joey>
<connor> are you representing </connor>
<connor> yeah you know i've worked at places </connor>
<connor> where i've wanted to shoot there and </connor>
<connor> i've had a friend tell them who wasn't </connor>
<joey> japanese hey can we shoot that and </joey>
<joey> they're like no i don't know about it </joey>
<joey> but then you have a japanese person do </joey>
<joey> the exact same thing like if cajo </joey>
<joey> hits them up and it's like hey here's </joey>
<joey> what we're doing and then like oh okay </joey>
<joey> sure yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like what it's just like they don't </joey>
<joey> believe you like i think you're lying </joey>
<connor> because you're not japanese like you </connor>
<joey> don't understand you don't understand </joey>
<joey> how sneaky foreigners trying to </joey>
<connor> get around our ways it's yeah it's it's </connor>
<connor> bizarre it's really strange but </connor>
<connor> this is the way that it's like business </connor>
<joey> is done here like </joey>
<joey> and it's and you know it makes it makes </joey>
<joey> so much sense now why </joey>
<joey> these companies do this [ __ ] stupid </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm like oh </connor>
<joey> i totally get it and i'm i'm kind of </joey>
<joey> like sitting in that halfway point right </joey>
<joey> because like if i don't open my mouth </joey>
<joey> they'll be like this [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> the moment foreign open my mouth they're </garnt>
<garnt> like oh you're nihongo nihongo jose </garnt>
<garnt> yeah all right let's do it i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> all right let's do business yeah right </garnt>
<joey> let's do exactly i rock up let's do </joey>
<joey> business no you're a foreigner </joey>
<joey> jk i am nihongo jose actually and </joey>
<joey> they're like all right i'm sorry all </joey>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> let's do some business i'm like it's </garnt>
<joey> it's so [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> embarrassing yeah yeah and i feel like </connor>
<connor> companies in japan are very </connor>
<connor> very um what's the word </connor>
<connor> they very much stick to the hierarchy of </connor>
<joey> decisions yeah and if you're not </joey>
<joey> if you're not like the same level you </joey>
<joey> you can't comment are you talking about </joey>
<joey> the pyramid the pyramids the pyramids </joey>
<garnt> well like if you're if you're not like </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not in that like that that </garnt>
<garnt> meeting </garnt>
<garnt> your opinion doesn't matter no matter </garnt>
<joey> who you talk to right so i feel like </joey>
<garnt> when people are like all right even if </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know because nintendo has a </garnt>
<garnt> nintendo america i i'd love to know how </garnt>
<garnt> much nintendo of america has a say over </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> nintendo the japan officers i feel like </garnt>
<connor> probably not a lot i feel like people </connor>
<connor> would </connor>
<connor> yeah i think it's probably not a lot </connor>
<connor> just based off like what i've seen from </connor>
<connor> other companies here where you'd think </connor>
<connor> that they would have an input but they </connor>
<joey> don't yeah </joey>
<joey> it's doug bowser is like uh so can we </joey>
<joey> change this thing and they're like </joey>
<joey> but we're in a zoom call yeah you're not </joey>
<joey> in the office </joey>
<connor> i don't know about that i don't know </connor>
<connor> again it's all speculation but i imagine </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> if any from what i've seen here it's </connor>
<connor> very difficult to get things done if </connor>
<garnt> you're not like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so basically like the longer i live </garnt>
<garnt> in japan the more </garnt>
<joey> respect i have for suzaku and code geass </joey>
<joey> because you watch code gyasa and </joey>
<joey> everyone wants to be right </joey>
<joey> everyone wants to be the [ __ ] lelouch </joey>
<joey> bring down the system </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] the corporations but then i'm just </joey>
<joey> like yo suzaku is out there working his </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ass off to change it man </joey>
<joey> like he's the real one he's the real one </joey>
<connor> climbing that pyramid </connor>
<connor> he's driving the hierarchy man if if if </connor>
<joey> this was irl suzaku would still be a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> grunt yeah you don't get </joey>

<garnt> homesick about england </garnt>
<garnt> until kind of moved out of it and </garnt>
<joey> couldn't go back for a while </joey>
<joey> i think i think this like lockdown or </joey>

<joey> yeah which is one of the ultimate </joey>
<joey> birthdays </joey>
<connor> as well yeah um so yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> what's happening i guess i'll figure it </connor>
<joey> out what's what's the first thing you're </joey>
<joey> going to do when you go back to england </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's what i was going to ask as </garnt>
<joey> well yeah </joey>
<joey> i i i'm go i'm going to go i'm going </joey>
<joey> straight to the [ __ ] pub </joey>
<connor> check into the hotel i guess i mean </connor>
<joey> that's the practical house </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah but after that after you've </garnt>
<garnt> settled down at the hotel room what's </garnt>
<joey> the first thing you want to go to </joey>
<joey> tesco's yeah get a test actually i want </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] meal deal </joey>
<joey> they'll probably have one of the </joey>
<joey> airports i'll probably get a meal deal </joey>
<connor> at the airport tesco's meal deal banging </connor>
<connor> yeah three pound </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] dude choice of my favorite sandwich </connor>
<joey> yeah but if it's the airport it's </joey>
<joey> probably like seven pound right </joey>
<connor> i guess that's like four yeah it's just </connor>
<garnt> gonna be so weird going to like </garnt>
<connor> a shop or just a tesco's i genuinely </connor>
<garnt> miss airports </garnt>
<joey> i miss going to an airport i miss </joey>
<garnt> i was chilling at the airport i get to </garnt>
<joey> watch so much [ __ ] when you're on a </joey>
<joey> flight flight </joey>
<joey> yeah i've been able to watch tv in so </joey>
<joey> long because i haven't been on a flight </joey>
<joey> like you know what i mean you get so </joey>
<joey> much watching done when you're playing </joey>
<joey> sure </joey>
<joey> you know i'm chilling in the lobby </joey>
<garnt> having a coffee like when you when you </garnt>
<garnt> finally you've checked in your bags are </garnt>
<garnt> in the thing it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually kind of chill like that like </garnt>
<connor> hour before your flight i like the </connor>
<garnt> feeling </garnt>
<garnt> like i like the feeling of going on a </garnt>
<garnt> long-haul flight just knowing because it </garnt>
<joey> kind of like </joey>
<joey> aside from like the long-haul part of </joey>
<joey> the flight i just like the feeling of </joey>
<joey> knowing it feels like i'm going on a </joey>
<joey> holiday you know </joey>
<joey> it feels like i'm going away for a while </joey>
<joey> and it's </joey>
<joey> there's something about going to to the </joey>
<joey> airport of like your home country </joey>
<joey> it just it just feels like it just feels </joey>
<joey> feels like you know </joey>
<joey> mum's cooking or something like that it </joey>
<joey> just feels i don't know it just there's </joey>
<joey> something about it </joey>
<joey> because every time i go visit thailand </joey>
<joey> and i step out and i see like the </joey>
<joey> thai airport i'm just like i'm getting </joey>
<joey> all nostalgic </joey>
<joey> it's just the [ __ ] airport it smells </joey>
<connor> different every kind of song </connor>
<joey> no no no no every country smells </joey>
<joey> different i don't i don't know </joey>
<joey> why it is i totally get that but like i </joey>
<joey> s literally i step out of the airport go </joey>
<joey> to </joey>
<joey> the top the thai airport has this </joey>
<joey> certain smell gatwick and heathrow has a </joey>
<joey> certain smell </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like i can't describe what </joey>
<joey> it is but i just </joey>
<joey> but it just feels comforting and i </joey>
<joey> didn't know that airports smell </joey>
<joey> different until you go off the airplane </joey>
<joey> and you're like damn this </joey>
<joey> i recognize this i don't know if i'm </joey>
<garnt> like i don't know if this is the talk of </garnt>
<garnt> a madman right now </garnt>
<joey> no no i i get that whole smell thing </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah i don't i </garnt>
<joey> it's it's like when certain smells </joey>
<connor> trigger i just feel like it's like the </connor>
<joey> breathability of the country you know </joey>
<joey> like some what that makes less sense </joey>
<joey> because when you when you land in like </joey>
<joey> uh in like japan </joey>
<joey> depending on which airport you land like </joey>
<connor> the ad is like stuffy or </connor>
<connor> like when i landed in san francisco i </connor>
<connor> was like [ __ ] this s </connor>
<connor> sucks like i'm breathing in i'm like oh </connor>
<connor> my god the pollution </connor>
<joey> of some [ __ ] you're literally just </joey>
<joey> saying the same thing you see what he </joey>
<connor> said </connor>
<garnt> smells i'm like pollution level like </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo how can you tell the pollution </garnt>
<garnt> levels </garnt>
<connor> when you breathe in do you not have can </connor>
<garnt> you not like </garnt>
<garnt> breathe the quality of air you can't </garnt>
<joey> tell i i can yeah but i can't do it i </joey>
<garnt> can't do it at different [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> airports i can </joey>
<connor> when i land in the [ __ ] country i </connor>
<connor> step off the plane i take a deep breath </connor>
<joey> and i'm like this ass [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> why is this insane it's like you called </connor>
<garnt> me the [ __ ] insane </garnt>
<connor> it's </connor>
<joey> it literally sounds like the stupidest </joey>
<joey> superpower </joey>
<joey> like when i when i watch i can tell </joey>
<connor> pollution levels in the air i breathe </connor>
<joey> l.a has horrible air and san francisco </joey>
<joey> had most big cities have horrible air </joey>
<connor> oh it depends like that's what makes up </connor>
<garnt> this </garnt>
<joey> i can't tell like the air pollution </joey>
<joey> differing from like most cities you i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> like for example there's a difference </joey>
<connor> between bangkok and like tokyo is awful </connor>
<connor> tokyo is turkish that guy's fine it's </connor>
<garnt> fine </garnt>
<garnt> what are you talking you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> because you've been here too long what </garnt>
<garnt> are you talking about what are you </garnt>
<garnt> talking about it's like chocolate is </garnt>
<garnt> fine </garnt>
<connor> it is not it tastes like [ __ ] bro </connor>
<garnt> breathe it in i don't like the smell i </garnt>
<connor> don't like the </connor>
<connor> taste </connor>
<connor> you're literally surrounded by i landed </connor>
<joey> i landed in singapore airport and i was </joey>
<joey> like this is a really pretty airplane </joey>
<connor> that's why </connor>
<connor> it smells like that's why the airport </connor>
<connor> has so much plants it's the first breath </connor>
<connor> it lies to you so you think oh it's </connor>
<connor> actually good then you leave the </connor>
<connor> the plant [ __ ] because i've seen </connor>
<connor> their airports that's just full of </connor>
<joey> plants and [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> it's out of every airport i've been to </joey>
<connor> singapore airport is by far the best </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] airport </joey>
<connor> and i have no idea why the singaporean </connor>
<garnt> airport </garnt>
<joey> which country is the best tasting air </joey>
<joey> upon landing in my experience so far </joey>
<joey> amsterdam had the best air when i got </joey>
<joey> off that plane i was like damn this is </joey>
<joey> some cleaning yeah i can agree with that </joey>
<joey> there's some cleaning yeah see even you </joey>
<joey> can agree i think </joey>
<joey> when i got in charlotte </joey>
<joey> i was like get put me back on the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] plane i don't know i'm </joey>
<connor> get me out of here no it's bad enough </connor>
<connor> i'm in paris let alone having to [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> breathe this air </joey>
<joey> i was like that when i landed in jfk oh </joey>
<connor> my god </connor>
<connor> i was like you're the new york air </connor>
<connor> you're like bro i don't even need to </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't even need studies to tell me </connor>
<connor> this as politically yeah i mean like </connor>
<connor> that's what i'm saying you can tell when </connor>
<connor> you get on you get off the plane you </connor>
<joey> breathe you're like oh that's wrong yeah </joey>
<joey> but that's the same logic as what god </joey>
<garnt> was saying about it </garnt>
<garnt> it's this it smells different to me </garnt>
<joey> maybe it's the same you're always </joey>
<joey> biased about your hometown airport </joey>
<garnt> you're always biased </garnt>
<garnt> i think the uh i guarantee people living </garnt>
<garnt> in new york from new york is like jfk </garnt>
<garnt> has the best smelling airport because it </garnt>
<garnt> smells like home </garnt>
<garnt> guaranteed yeah maybe i just don't know </garnt>
<connor> what fresh air is because i'm a city boy </connor>
<joey> i was saying when i uh when i get the </joey>
<joey> train from london to wales like </joey>
<joey> when i step off the train from when the </joey>
<joey> train opens and i breathe in wales i'm </joey>
<joey> like holy [ __ ] this is what actual air </joey>
<joey> tastes like </joey>
<joey> that's because you're from there though </joey>
<joey> i'm like whoa so there's probably a bias </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like that's </joey>
<connor> like it's like no it's it's not like </connor>
<connor> super industrial it's just like there's </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] fields everywhere </connor>
<garnt> because me and me and connor were </garnt>
<garnt> walking walking to the office and connor </garnt>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> god this air tastes horrible and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like connor what the [ __ ] tokyo </connor>
<connor> is great i don't know what you're </connor>
<connor> talking about what are you on about it's </connor>
<connor> like a mega city bro the air is [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> here </garnt>
<garnt> forest city the tokyo air is actually </garnt>
<garnt> pretty good </garnt>
<garnt> could that possibly be the most </garnt>
<garnt> wankerish thing that connor said oh the </garnt>
<joey> ass </joey>
<joey> tastes horrible am i allowed to get this </joey>
<connor> out of my face </connor>
<connor> i'm just i'm just saying it doesn't it </connor>
<connor> doesn't </connor>
<joey> taste polluted that could probably be </joey>
<joey> the most privileged thing you could have </joey>
<connor> said in your life </connor>
<connor> my air is </connor>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> connor's mom comes to visit from wales </garnt>
<joey> and he just brings out she just brings </joey>
<joey> like a jar of air </joey>
<joey> just like just like connor breathe this </joey>
<garnt> in </garnt>
<garnt> what did mail what did melinda write did </garnt>
<connor> she write incest again </connor>
<connor> she's giving me uh the air quality what </connor>
<joey> is this the rating </joey>
<connor> all right let me see it let me see let </connor>
<garnt> me see this </garnt>
<connor> that's [ __ ] let me see this let me </connor>
<garnt> see this let me see oh so phil is </garnt>
<connor> terrible so air quality index </connor>
<joey> so the higher it is the more polluted it </joey>
<joey> is okay amsterdam </joey>
<joey> 69 nice </joey>
<joey> uh san fran is 31. the fact that we've </joey>
<garnt> got the whole [ __ ] office to laugh </garnt>
<joey> number 69. you know san fran </joey>
<connor> air quality index is 31. no way and then </connor>
<connor> wales </connor>
<connor> is 68. this is thrilled doesn't count </connor>
<connor> trolls are [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> so that's yeah so basically what what </connor>
<joey> mailing is saying is that san fran air </joey>
<joey> quality is </joey>
<connor> twice as better as whales yeah let's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] biased as [ __ ] malian's from san </connor>
<connor> francisco that's why madeleine pulled </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> she just like came up with a random </connor>
<connor> number no [ __ ] one she's just </connor>
<garnt> she's like facts don't care about your </garnt>
<connor> feelings maybe maybe they took that out </connor>
<connor> in some vineyards somewhere whereas </connor>
<garnt> perfect air but </garnt>
<garnt> their city is [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> if you're if you're born and raised in </connor>
<connor> the city your </connor>
<garnt> uh your nostril hair is longer </garnt>
<joey> do you know that google it google it </joey>
<garnt> what did you get on the next episode of </garnt>
<connor> scientology because your </connor>
<connor> your uh nostrils need to filter more </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] so it naturally just grows longer i </connor>
<connor> get that but where the [ __ ] did you read </connor>
<connor> that i don't know i just heard it </connor>
<garnt> i read it somewhere it's true look it up </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i believe the logic because </garnt>
<connor> it's just like that's why darlene has </connor>
<connor> these massive bushes going </connor>
<joey> she's gonna kill her i'm gonna get a </joey>
<joey> death after that </joey>
<connor> while nabby looks it up it's true but </connor>
<connor> yeah that's uh i don't know why </connor>
<connor> i heard about that i don't know man yeah </connor>
<garnt> i don't know but there is a research </garnt>
<garnt> about it </garnt>
<joey> is there actually research well what </joey>
<joey> climate helped shape </joey>
<joey> your nose no well yeah no i get that but </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> hairs type in one i'm still sitting in a </connor>
<joey> nostril </joey>
<joey> who woke up one day and was just like </joey>
<garnt> you know what i want to i want to </garnt>
<joey> measure </joey>
<joey> your hairline my friends nose hairs are </joey>
<joey> longer than mine these are there has to </joey>
<connor> be a reason we need to know these things </connor>
<connor> we don't know enough about the human </connor>
<connor> body we need to know everything </connor>
<connor> so we can determine what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> going on i mean </connor>
<connor> is this like when you were like talking </connor>
<garnt> about [ __ ] mouth breathers and all </garnt>
<connor> that [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah because like because like that's </joey>
<connor> having no chin i don't know if this is </connor>
<garnt> like one of those like lies or not </garnt>
<joey> it could be but like in my head it's one </joey>
<connor> of those things i don't even care this </connor>
<connor> is [ __ ] it makes sense yeah because </connor>
<garnt> why are you scared because </garnt>
<garnt> you were going to the dentist to get </garnt>
<garnt> like what not retainers but like the uh </garnt>
<garnt> the mouth guard the mouth guard thing </garnt>
<garnt> and you were just like i didn't want to </garnt>
<connor> breathe well </connor>
<joey> generally it's better to breathe through </joey>
<connor> your nose anyway just for air quality </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> that's the [ __ ] filter through right </garnt>
<garnt> all right all right what is it </garnt>
<garnt> well there is a steady like </garnt>
<garnt> if there are any nose hair experts </garnt>
<joey> watching this uh could you leave it down </joey>
<joey> in the comments below thank you </joey>
<joey> well yeah </joey>
<connor> it would make sense though right if you </connor>
<connor> were born and you're you were in a place </connor>
<connor> that was more polluted naturally it </connor>
<connor> would make sense for your body </connor>
<garnt> well like i feel like there's something </garnt>
<joey> your mum says be like it's a good thing </joey>
<joey> you're not in the sea right they have </joey>
<joey> long nose hairs in the sink </joey>
<joey> you don't have to trim your nose hairs </joey>
<garnt> boy i feel like that was a little </garnt>
<connor> tail i always felt like i had long nose </connor>
<connor> hair anyway so i'm like [ __ ] imagine if </connor>
<connor> i was born in the city i'd be </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] tarzan's crotch in my nose </connor>
<joey> so interactive indicator of put air </joey>
<joey> quality using </joey>
<connor> nose hair length as a rough metric for </connor>
<joey> just how much nasal fiber </joey>
<joey> one would need to catch and filter </joey>
<connor> harmful particulate matter in aegis over </connor>
<connor> there but it sounds like i'm right </connor>
<connor> does it but it's so ridiculous i i </connor>
<garnt> literally stopped listening halfway </garnt>
<garnt> through that sentence </garnt>
<connor> but yeah also get that off like wikihow </connor>
<joey> also i don't know why i started getting </joey>
<joey> recommended videos about like breathing </joey>
<joey> from your mouth and i don't know why i </joey>
<joey> was getting recommended this stuff </joey>
<joey> but i watched it i watched my other </joey>
<joey> mouth </joey>
<joey> i watched it i watched it and it was </joey>
<joey> like it was it was one of those videos </joey>
<joey> where it's like </joey>
<joey> this is this would if i wasn't dumb as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] this would be so convincing like </joey>
<connor> yeah i it felt so manipulative these </connor>
<connor> videos that they were like look </connor>
<connor> there's twins one of them was allergic </connor>
<connor> to hamsters and they had a hamster in </connor>
<connor> that room </connor>
<connor> and that thus he couldn't breathe </connor>
<connor> through his nose and look what happened </connor>
<connor> to </connor>
<connor> his chin it's all gross </connor>
<garnt> they just showed like a [ __ ] picture </garnt>
<garnt> of leafy or something like that </garnt>
<connor> oh why are you gonna do them like that </connor>
<connor> that's bullying bro </connor>
<joey> one of those leafy and the other guys </joey>
<connor> like well it was like it was like yeah </connor>
<joey> it was like </joey>
<joey> one had like a clearly defined chin it's </joey>
<joey> just like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> one had like a clearly defined chin and </joey>
<joey> one had like the i don't even know what </joey>
<joey> you call it it's like the </joey>
<joey> not really a chin it's kind of like it </joey>
<joey> leads into it yeah yeah yeah and that's </joey>
<joey> generally believed to be unattractive </joey>
<joey> amongst sigma members </joey>
<joey> i love that as well your chin is like </joey>
<connor> getting swallowed into your neck kinda </connor>
<connor> yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's one of those things where you're </connor>
<connor> like ha everyone i did meet </connor>
<connor> who i feel like had that kind of face </connor>
<joey> did breathe through their mouth i think </joey>
<joey> and then it's one of those things where </joey>
<joey> it kind of it builds on your </joey>
<joey> your just like ignorance of it and your </joey>
<joey> anecdotal evidence of it right but then </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> you know i saw more videos about it and </joey>
<joey> i was like you know the more i feel like </joey>
<joey> it the more the more </joey>
<joey> this is like feels like some kind of </joey>
<joey> sigma male [ __ ] this you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean i felt like i was getting fed but i </joey>
<joey> don't know how accurate it is because </joey>
<joey> then i start watching videos about </joey>
<joey> apparently doctors who specialize in uh </joey>
<joey> what they'll do is that they'll uh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> what they do they'll do something so </joey>
<joey> that when you sleep or when you normally </joey>
<joey> do it that you breathe through your </joey>
<connor> mouth and they go look it's fixed </connor>
<joey> his chin is [ __ ] normal well they're </joey>
<joey> just like here's some tape i don't know </joey>
<connor> put it on your mouth </connor>
<garnt> i don't particularly care to learn more </garnt>
<garnt> about it or check how real it was but </garnt>
<garnt> now it's in your head </garnt>
<garnt> now you're just like but what if i do </garnt>
<garnt> breathe but also i generally want to </garnt>
<garnt> breathe through my nose anyway because </garnt>
<garnt> it's just the whole of you know when you </garnt>
<joey> breathe through your mouth your it isn't </joey>
<joey> being filtered and [ __ ] and </joey>
<joey> yeah i i'd like to live as long as i can </joey>
<garnt> so i can be as stubborn as i can for as </garnt>
<garnt> long as i can </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like maybe i can become a </garnt>
<joey> japanese politician and make life </joey>
<garnt> healthy </garnt>
<joey> full circle i mean i feel like you do </joey>
<joey> breathe through your nose most of the </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<joey> um you can only tell who the mouth </joey>
<joey> breathers are because </joey>
<joey> can you let me finish myself okay </joey>
<joey> you can only tell who the mouth </joey>
<joey> breathers are when you're like you're </joey>
<joey> you're in a hotel room </joey>
<joey> and there's always the one snorer who is </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> you you know you know sometimes when </joey>
<joey> you're like yeah sometimes when you're </joey>
<joey> really quiet </joey>
<joey> when when you're really tired but </joey>
<joey> sometimes you you are with a group of </joey>
<joey> mates and you know who the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> snorer is right yeah and it's like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] time limit </joey>
<garnt> of just like all right i've got </garnt>
<garnt> literally half an hour to fall asleep or </garnt>
<joey> i'm not sleeping tonight and </joey>
<joey> it's and it's not just the snorers right </joey>
<joey> because there are the snorers that do it </joey>
<joey> through their nose </joey>
<joey> and then there are the snores that do it </joey>
<garnt> through there you can tell when people </garnt>
<joey> snore through their mouths yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> no it's so weird because like i grew up </joey>
<connor> breathing through my mouth </connor>
<connor> so i was a mouth breather when i was </connor>
<connor> sleeping when i was like </connor>
<connor> so funny but that's because i had like </connor>
<joey> horrible hate fever so like my nose is </joey>
<joey> constantly blocked all the time </joey>
<joey> it's a pretty good descriptive insult </joey>
<joey> because i feel like you know as much as </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> much as i i i wouldn't use it you get a </joey>
<connor> very good picture of what they're trying </connor>
<joey> to paint when someone calls you a mouth </joey>
<garnt> breather </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> i definitely became paranoid that i was </connor>
<joey> breathing through my mouth am i becoming </joey>
<joey> a male </joey>
<joey> i remember that i was like i was </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> because i feel like i have a </garnt>
<garnt> semi-defined chain i guess i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> semi-defined i don't know i i i haven't </joey>
<joey> got this </joey>
<joey> and i was like yeah i did breathe </joey>
<joey> through my nose as a kid but then again </joey>
<joey> again it's i feel like it all </joey>
<connor> goes on anecdotal evidence you know </connor>
<garnt> everything again i don't know how </garnt>
<garnt> accurate it is it seemed </garnt>
<connor> it felt like pseudoscience when i was </connor>
<garnt> watching this [ __ ] pretty much </garnt>
<connor> everything </connor>
<garnt> it was enough to make me care even </garnt>
<connor> though i know i shouldn't now you've </connor>
<connor> made like a lot of people </connor>
<connor> watching this yeah everyone watching </connor>
<connor> this can be like oh [ __ ] do whatever i'm </connor>
<joey> saying </joey>
<joey> i'm just doing this just like do i have </joey>
<joey> a chin am i good </joey>
<connor> am i good isn't it sad that we give a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] about chins </connor>
<joey> i don't care about chin why do we care </joey>
<garnt> about chins i know </garnt>
<joey> did you did your parents ever tell you </joey>
<joey> like like an old folk tale or something </joey>
<joey> to get you </joey>
<joey> to do something as a kid i don't know i </joey>
<joey> don't know i don't know what japanese </joey>
<joey> things there are </joey>
<joey> because in thailand it's like one of the </joey>
<joey> things is um if you </joey>
<joey> eat on the bed then </joey>
<joey> when you're reincarnated in your next </joey>
<joey> life you're going to reincarnate as a </joey>
<connor> snake </connor>
<connor> and i'm just remembering this now </connor>
<garnt> and that was what i was told to not get </garnt>
<garnt> me to eat on the bed and </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i guess it works because i hate </garnt>
<joey> eating on the bed now japan has </joey>
<garnt> is like infamous for all these like </garnt>
<garnt> proverbs and wives like one of them was </garnt>
<garnt> like if </garnt>
<garnt> you sleep immediately after you eat then </garnt>
<joey> you turn into a cow </joey>
<garnt> oh i think taina did something similar </garnt>
<garnt> to that as well yeah </garnt>
<connor> i guess i think my mum stopped telling </connor>
<joey> me these because whenever my mum told me </joey>
<garnt> them i would immediately go and try them </garnt>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> like i remember one time my mom was like </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] you doing i just kept </joey>
<joey> opening the umbrella indoors i was like </joey>
<joey> i want to see if something bad happens </joey>
<joey> yeah so i just kept opening yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> and nothing happened yeah i was like oh </connor>
<joey> nice well that's the thing it's like </joey>
<joey> some japanese proverbs are based on like </joey>
<joey> actual like facts that are harmful to </joey>
<joey> your body like so </joey>
<joey> so the sleeping after you eat thing is </joey>
<connor> actually has a little bit of logic to it </connor>
<connor> because like if you do sleep immediately </connor>
<connor> after you eat then all the gastric </connor>
<connor> stuff goes up your software and it makes </connor>
<connor> me your esophagus and like </connor>
<connor> damages your throat so i'm like oh okay </connor>
<connor> so there's actual reasoning behind that </connor>
<connor> that's good but then there are some </connor>
<connor> which just like </connor>
<connor> are reserved don't whistle at night </connor>
<connor> because snakes will come and i'm like </connor>
<connor> snakes are </connor>
<joey> literally death oh that sounds amazing </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<garnt> it isn't from the music it's from the </garnt>
<garnt> movement yeah from the vibrations yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<connor> the movements it's literally the </connor>
<connor> movement of this yeah the movement of </connor>
<garnt> the guy that they follow </garnt>
<garnt> how did snake charms like start life </garnt>
<joey> i could believe they just wake up one </joey>
<joey> day they're like you know what i want to </joey>
<joey> charm some snakes </joey>
<connor> i got a flute got a basket white people </connor>
<connor> stop stupid </connor>
<joey> i don't know do snapchamas even exist </joey>
<connor> anymore </connor>
<connor> i you don't really charm them do you </connor>
<joey> just make them dance a little bit right </joey>
<connor> but like is that like </connor>
<connor> a thing that's like is there a person </connor>
<joey> out there somewhere in the world that's </joey>
<garnt> like yes i am a professional snake charm </garnt>
<garnt> probably it's probably a mouth breather </garnt>
<connor> why why you're obsessed with that word </connor>
<garnt> now that you've told me it's an insult </garnt>
<connor> i'm just like </connor>
<connor> if there's [ __ ] psychics out there </connor>
<connor> that can be any job i don't really give </connor>
<joey> a [ __ ] i just feel though it's like one </joey>
<joey> of those </joey>
<joey> like pseudo occupations that were kind </joey>
<joey> of very timely back in that </joey>
<joey> it's like you know like a soothsayer </joey>
<joey> right like no one goes around being like </joey>
<joey> i'm a professional soothsayer </joey>
<connor> they're just like saying they're just </connor>
<connor> like budget magicians yeah what is that </connor>
<joey> actually a suit says like a person who </joey>
<joey> goes around and like tells fortunes and </joey>
<joey> like tells your future and stuff oh </joey>
<garnt> that's a little </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] i mean like a fortune teller like </connor>
<joey> kind of yeah that's an occupation </joey>
<joey> sounds way cooler that that's an </joey>
<connor> occupation that should have gone out of </connor>
<joey> business </joey>
<joey> i think it did go out it's fortune </joey>
<joey> telling unfortunately yeah how that </joey>
<connor> should still exist i don't know i i </connor>
<connor> have friends who do who do that and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like you're a [ __ ] idiot oh </connor>
<joey> really yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like the what the crystal ball or </joey>
<connor> the turret cards all like read their </connor>
<joey> hands and stuff </joey>
<joey> oh stuff right yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm like have you seen some of the </joey>
<joey> fish out there like do you think god </joey>
<joey> really gave enough of a [ __ ] to worry </joey>
<joey> about right putting [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> inscriptions on your hand of what your </connor>
<connor> life's gonna be like man couldn't even </connor>
<connor> finish half the [ __ ] fishes in the </connor>
<connor> ocean </connor>
<connor> are you serious bro come on no no he did </connor>
<connor> not he did not inscribe he didn't give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] about you </joey>
<joey> i mean i like doing it every now and </joey>
<joey> then just to see what they say </joey>
<connor> it we like to feel interesting as people </connor>
<connor> yeah that's an egotistical need that we </connor>
<connor> have </connor>
<connor> but i genuinely believe that we are not </connor>
<connor> interesting things </connor>
<connor> it is up to us to make our own lives </connor>
<connor> interesting and horoscopes and all that </connor>
<connor> and all that nonsense i just don't </connor>
<connor> believe in any of it because i'm like </connor>
<connor> nobody gives gives a [ __ ] about this you </connor>
<joey> don't believe in like star signs or </joey>
<garnt> anything like that no </garnt>
<garnt> honestly i don't mean either </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<garnt> like the whole like the whole thing me </garnt>
<connor> either the whole blood type </connor>
<garnt> cold blood type the whole uh lines on </garnt>
<garnt> your hands all of that [ __ ] i believe i </garnt>
<garnt> just think it's [ __ ] nice </garnt>
<garnt> i i think it's cool and i and when </garnt>
<joey> someone tells me i'll listen i think </joey>
<joey> it's cool for the sake of entertainment </joey>
<garnt> yeah i i i view as more just like an </garnt>
<garnt> entertaining thing as or like a </garnt>
<garnt> conversation starter right yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's not something i take seriously </connor>
<connor> but i'm like is your life so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> boring well this is the thing that gets </connor>
<garnt> you excited this is what you look </garnt>
<connor> forward to like </connor>
<connor> you need you need lies to tell yourself </connor>
<connor> to to to feel like you're doing </connor>
<connor> something in life </connor>
<joey> don't [ __ ] do something some people </joey>
<joey> need that man some people need that </joey>
<connor> encouragement </connor>
<connor> wow go and do something stop reading </connor>
<connor> your [ __ ] hands only mouth breathers </connor>
<connor> do that </connor>
<connor> the reason why you have no [ __ ] is not </connor>
<joey> because of it lying in your hand okay </joey>
<connor> it's because he breathes through your </connor>
<garnt> mouth </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] [ __ ] reading your hands but </connor>
<garnt> please breathe through your mouth yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's real </connor>
<connor> i i you know i think that you could like </connor>
<garnt> there is behavior that you can do that </garnt>
<garnt> can affect </garnt>
<garnt> your health and your body yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's i feel like that's fair to </garnt>
<garnt> say </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like i think that no no </garnt>
<garnt> mystical entity </garnt>
<connor> decided to carve some [ __ ] lines in </connor>
<connor> your hand and that that would decide how </connor>
<connor> your personality was gonna be no [ __ ] no </connor>
<garnt> no i mean yeah there is there is a clear </garnt>
<garnt> difference because </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like there is a lot of little </garnt>
<joey> things you just don't know about your </joey>
<joey> body </joey>
<joey> and then you don't figure it out until </joey>
<garnt> you hit like 30 or something yeah </garnt>
<connor> and then you realize oh we also don't </connor>
<connor> know a lot of stuff about the human body </connor>
<connor> we have like we're still like barely </connor>
<connor> understanding how the mind works you </connor>
<garnt> know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean we we're still like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] decades and centuries after </garnt>
<garnt> like figuring out how that works but in </garnt>
<connor> terms of all of america doesn't even </connor>
<connor> have bidets so how the [ __ ] are they </connor>
<garnt> gonna </garnt>
<garnt> have scientific breakthroughs yeah i </garnt>
<joey> don't believe that you can't have a </joey>
<joey> scientific breakthrough not with a baby </joey>
<joey> call themselves a first world country </joey>
<joey> yeah you're not having any good days if </joey>
<connor> they ever figured that out how the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> they're going to figure out what's going </connor>
<garnt> on in the brain sorry go ahead calm </garnt>
<garnt> i completely was good i forgot what i </garnt>
<connor> was going to say i'm not saying that </connor>
<connor> they haven't discovered anything about </connor>
<garnt> the brain </garnt>
<garnt> um no it's just like like part of like </garnt>
<garnt> growing up and growing into like your </garnt>
<garnt> 30s i guess is just realizing that </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you just have a problem with </joey>
<joey> your body and like as a kid i thought </joey>
<joey> everything's fixable everything will go </joey>
<joey> back to normal eventually yeah and then </joey>
<joey> you don't realize that sometimes you </joey>
<joey> just have a problem </joey>
<garnt> and then you just you just learn to live </garnt>
<garnt> with it i guess it's pretty </garnt>
<connor> sad like it's like kind of hope that you </connor>
<joey> don't get a problem that's </joey>
<joey> too much yeah yeah like kidney stones </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] if i get those </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] oh yeah like everyone everyone </garnt>
<garnt> around my age just starts talking about </garnt>
<garnt> their knees and luckily enough i haven't </garnt>
<garnt> felt </garnt>
<joey> anything about my knees yet but like </joey>
<joey> lower back pain knees </joey>
<garnt> like neck pain headaches it's just it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like god decided all right </garnt>
<garnt> everyone gets a debuff at 30. everyone </garnt>
<garnt> gets a different one </garnt>
<joey> you know it's like the moment you turn </joey>
<joey> 30 just god comes to your sleep </joey>

<connor> i was gonna watch that i i had it on the </connor>
<joey> watch later i never did yeah </joey>
<connor> because a super interesting video i </connor>
<garnt> recommend it but it's like </garnt>
<connor> explain it to me basically it's this guy </connor>
<garnt> who uh he got big off tick tock i think </garnt>
<garnt> because he's like uh </garnt>
<garnt> he's like works in forensics or </garnt>
<garnt> something but basically he </garnt>
<garnt> uses like the bodies that you know you </garnt>
<garnt> donate to science and </garnt>
<garnt> to study things about the human body </garnt>
<garnt> basically yeah and uh and this guy got </garnt>
<garnt> really big on tick tock i've got his </garnt>
<garnt> name </garnt>
<garnt> basically just doing short videos of </garnt>
<garnt> like did you know that this is this is a </garnt>
<garnt> real stomach i'm gonna open it up and </garnt>
<garnt> show you </garnt>
<garnt> how food is digested or whatever and he </garnt>
<garnt> has a youtube channel </garnt>
<garnt> and he literally gets like a real human </garnt>
<garnt> body that like </garnt>
<garnt> whether he's getting people people don't </garnt>
<connor> in their bodies to science after that </connor>
<connor> okay yeah yeah he works in like some </connor>
<joey> kind of like </joey>
<garnt> scientific research dexter or something </garnt>
<garnt> like that </garnt>
<garnt> he's one i dug up earlier it's like the </garnt>
<connor> modern day dexter </connor>
<connor> it's nice he's not a forensics expert </connor>
<connor> he's just a tick-tock </connor>
<connor> has anyone has anyone checked the </connor>
<garnt> scottish credentials </garnt>
<joey> he gets like a proper human body and </joey>
<garnt> like opens up the kidneys and like </garnt>
<garnt> explains how kidney stones form and why </garnt>
<garnt> they [ __ ] hurt and stuff and it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> man i can't imagine something that big </joey>
<joey> traveling through my dick that how big </joey>
<connor> is it </connor>
<connor> some of these are big some of these can </connor>
<joey> go like that but you have to just hope </joey>
<joey> they break down </joey>
<joey> in your kidneys like because they just </joey>
<joey> can't go through the tubes right these </joey>
<joey> ultrasound uh </joey>
<connor> ultrasonic ultrasonic yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> you're like your kidneys to break it </connor>
<joey> they literally they literally scream at </joey>
<joey> it to like crumble </joey>
<joey> essentially screams </joey>
<joey> but in worst case scenarios where like </joey>
<joey> not even that works that it's so </joey>
<joey> crystallizing so hard they literally </joey>
<joey> go through your penis with like a pair </joey>
<joey> of tweezers to just pull it out </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i did not need to hear this oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah i'm sorry i </garnt>
<garnt> need i'm sorry yeah this guy institute </garnt>
<joey> of human anatomy that's the guy </joey>
<joey> yeah really cool tick tock channel </joey>
<garnt> someone sounds like a youtube channel </garnt>
<garnt> just hope he's not a serial killer yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean he sounds nice i don't want any </joey>
<joey> tweezers going on my peepee </joey>
<joey> yeah i i can't i i literally can't </joey>
<connor> handle like hospitals at all i just like </connor>
<joey> faint immediately </joey>
<joey> that's that's why i'm like really </joey>
<joey> nervous to get older because you have to </joey>
<joey> do </joey>
<joey> you know when you hit like a certain age </joey>
<joey> you have to do that yeah annual </joey>
<joey> colonoscopy and you're like that's </joey>
<garnt> like i'm just not looking forward to the </garnt>
<joey> day where a camera has to go up my ass </joey>
<connor> late </connor>
<connor> hospitals are probably the only fear </connor>
<joey> that i have that i i think is like </joey>
<joey> irrational i guess is i guess is that </joey>
<joey> what it counts as well because lots of </joey>
<joey> bad stuff happened in hospitals right </joey>
<joey> it's just like i know that shit's gonna </joey>
<joey> happen in my body i'm not used to it i </joey>
<joey> don't like it i don't like anything and </joey>
<joey> i just i always like get so light-headed </joey>
<joey> to my phone </joey>
<joey> it's horrible you scared of needles or </joey>
<joey> anything like that no i don't give a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] about needles it's like operations </connor>
<joey> and stuff terrify me </joey>
<joey> yeah it's just it's just things entering </joey>
<joey> my body that shouldn't be there </joey>
<connor> yeah even like when i went to the </connor>
<joey> dentist the other day like just having </joey>
<connor> like the [ __ ] [ __ ] in my mouth like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] loud as [ __ ] yeah yeah i was </joey>
<joey> getting light-headed i was like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i mean that's why everyone hates going </connor>
<joey> to the dentist because like you hear </joey>
<garnt> sounds </garnt>
<garnt> in your mouth that just shouldn't be </garnt>
<connor> made anywhere near it's weird because i </connor>
<connor> didn't give a [ __ ] as a kid i really </connor>
<joey> i didn't care at all when i had to go </joey>
<joey> and do that stuff but i don't know what </joey>
<joey> happened </joey>
<connor> between like after age 18 where i </connor>
<connor> suddenly started being terrified of it </connor>
<joey> i'm not really sure why </joey>
<joey> like i can barely give myself eye drops </joey>
<joey> let alone something going into my body </joey>
<connor> you have that friend who's had like 10 </connor>
<joey> surgeries </joey>
<joey> yeah right i'm like how the [ __ ] are you </joey>
<joey> doing this how are you not like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> freaking out </connor>
<joey> right maybe they are i don't know it's </joey>
<connor> like when my dad comes back from his </connor>
<connor> annual colonoscopy right it's just like </connor>
<connor> you know it's it's it's it's the same </connor>
<joey> it's like yeah i just went to the park </joey>
<joey> legit would faint yeah right </joey>
<joey> how do i tell the doctor listen i'm a </joey>
<garnt> little [ __ ] bro i don't know what's </garnt>
<garnt> gonna happen like </garnt>
<connor> yeah like i'm gonna loop me up or </connor>
<connor> something i don't know yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> i'm lucky enough to like have never </connor>
<garnt> needed to have surgery or anything like </garnt>
<garnt> that but just like the concept of it </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> terrifies me that that's that's one </garnt>
<garnt> that's one thing that [ __ ] even if it's </garnt>
<joey> not </joey>
<garnt> life-threatening surgery you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> like like the the the whole idea of </garnt>
<garnt> being under anesthesia just like </garnt>
<connor> terrifies me oh no </connor>
<joey> i hate the surgeries where you're not on </joey>
<joey> it yeah or you're on light one like the </joey>
<joey> surgeries when </joey>
<garnt> like uh i think my parents my mom had </garnt>
<garnt> something with a heart and she had to be </garnt>
<garnt> awake for it and that </garnt>
<garnt> sounded terrifying what yeah because </garnt>
<joey> apparently i i don't know it sounded </joey>
<joey> awful like yeah </joey>
<joey> apparently you can feel it and stuff </joey>
<joey> yeah it's terrible imagine like you can </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah exactly right horrible </joey>
<joey> but if you have to have it you have to </joey>
<joey> have it right but i think i think </joey>
<joey> maybe it came from uh i had to get </joey>
<joey> because i had hemophilia where i'd like </joey>
<joey> if i bleed i you know don't stop </joey>
<joey> bleeding i had to go like every </joey>
<joey> three or six months to the hospital yeah </joey>
<joey> to go and do tests just to make sure it </joey>
<joey> wasn't getting worse or getting any </joey>
<joey> better luckily it didn't get any worse </joey>
<connor> uh but uh yeah it was awful i hated </connor>
<connor> going and i would </connor>
<connor> it was just like a terrible experience </connor>
<joey> because i think it's because of what </joey>
<joey> like the atmosphere in a hospital oh </joey>
<connor> yeah dude yeah yeah yeah hospital </connor>
<connor> atmosphere so </connor>
<joey> the ward that i'd always have to go to </joey>
<joey> was just filled with like old people </joey>
<joey> that were like dying </joey>
<joey> yeah and like some of them couldn't like </joey>
<joey> even like think or talk and it was i </joey>
<joey> felt so bad because they would talk to </joey>
<connor> me and they just didn't understand they </connor>
<connor> scared the [ __ ] out of me i was like 13. </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah i was like oh my god </connor>
<connor> not jesus yeah because it's like it's </connor>
<connor> it's that like glimpse into a possible </connor>
<joey> future </joey>
<connor> oh [ __ ] i could be like that one day </connor>
<connor> yeah and the smell </connor>
<joey> yeah they're talking about smells </joey>
<garnt> hospitals do definitely have a </garnt>
<connor> distinction </connor>
<connor> oh those are even like thinking about </connor>
<connor> the smell makes you uncomfortable </connor>
<joey> that's what i hate about the dentist as </joey>
<joey> well like the dentist has that like type </joey>
<joey> of smell that's like </joey>
<joey> oh what is that i don't know that's why </joey>
<garnt> when you get it </garnt>
<garnt> then dentists smell sanitized i don't </garnt>
<joey> know so </joey>
<joey> when you like it's like it's overly </joey>
<joey> sanitized you know where it's like this </joey>
<garnt> is too </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like you just stepped into a </joey>
<joey> crime scene yeah just like oh man </joey>
<garnt> but like it's everything's bleached yeah </garnt>
<garnt> everything's bleached to [ __ ] i hate it </garnt>
<garnt> when the doctor like doesn't talk at all </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't like crack jokes or anything </garnt>
<connor> i like it because like when the nurse </connor>
<connor> when the nurse is like funny as [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> feel so good i feel like </connor>
<connor> i'm chill the nurse is like cracking </connor>
<garnt> jerks she's like yeah i do this all the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] time </connor>
<connor> and she's like tell me about funny old </connor>
<garnt> other patients and stuff i feel so more </garnt>
<joey> at ease </joey>
<garnt> when the doctor doesn't say anything i'm </garnt>
<connor> like what's going on talk to me what's </connor>
<joey> going on yeah where the doctor doesn't </joey>
<joey> smile or anything like that yeah i'm </joey>
<connor> like whoa what's going on bro yeah come </connor>
<joey> on tell me </joey>
<joey> i know you're being serious with your </joey>
<joey> job but you know help me calm down a </joey>
<connor> little bit dude it's like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hell it's like we're at a job </joey>
<connor> interview yeah </connor>
<connor> i remember there was only one time i </connor>
<connor> ever wanted to go to the hospital and it </connor>
<joey> was uh </joey>
<joey> this one specific hospital that i think </joey>
<connor> i went to one time had uh </connor>
<joey> a gamecube right when it came out and i </joey>
<joey> was like what is this mythical hospital </joey>
<connor> right yeah but why don't more hospitals </connor>
<connor> do that and i was like all right next i </connor>
<connor> saw it and i was like </connor>
<connor> i saw it as i was leaving i was like </connor>
<garnt> next time i'm coming i'm gonna play it </garnt>
<garnt> and then i went </garnt>
<garnt> and someone [ __ ] stole the </garnt>
<joey> controllers so they had a game shoot a </joey>
<garnt> gamecube with no no </garnt>
<garnt> they're like super mario sunshine super </garnt>
<garnt> mario strikers super mario party brawl </garnt>
<garnt> they ball somehow </garnt>
<garnt> that's where you could even buy that </garnt>
<garnt> game often like yeah why did they have </garnt>
<garnt> this at a hospital </garnt>
<garnt> i think it was like a charity had given </garnt>
<joey> them a donated there's like a a </joey>
<garnt> room where it was like it was when i was </garnt>
<joey> like 12 so yeah kids </joey>
<joey> but so that makes me awesome some </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] rules even worse some [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] stole a [ __ ] gamecube </joey>
<joey> controller </joey>
<joey> from a children's hospital that have </joey>
<joey> been donating from a charity </joey>
<joey> what who does that who does that </joey>
<joey> i hope it's only a mouth where he looks </joey>
<joey> i hope it's another chicken </joey>
<joey> we're gonna get in trouble i don't know </joey>
<connor> if this is a controversial incident </connor>
<connor> controversial </connor>
<joey> i just can't take that insult seriously </joey>
<joey> anymore apparently it's a </joey>
<joey> it was an insult back in the 1940s 40s </joey>
<joey> america </joey>
<joey> so 40s jesus christ </joey>
<garnt> this is the first i'm hearing of it this </garnt>
<connor> is like this is like if i taught you the </connor>
<joey> word blessing you found out it was </joey>
<joey> racist or something </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] i've been saying the whole </joey>
<joey> episode jesus christ i i want to know </joey>
<joey> the motivation if somebody steals a </joey>
<joey> gamecube controller from a </joey>
<connor> that's all it was already a rare console </connor>
<connor> at the time honestly it's probably </connor>
<garnt> another kid right it's probably another </garnt>
<connor> kid i imagine it was another kid who </connor>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have a gamecube always wanting a </garnt>
<joey> game or they stole a gamecube from </joey>
<connor> somewhere i forgot the controllers </connor>
<connor> yeah how are you like because gamecubes </connor>
<connor> at that time i think were quite </connor>
<joey> expensive </joey>
<joey> and they were i mean the games weren't </joey>
<joey> cheap because it's nintendo yeah so i </joey>
<joey> mean the game's us </joey>
<joey> you're rich enough where your parents </joey>
<joey> buy your gamecube but not enough </joey>
<joey> controllers so you steal it from a kid's </joey>
<joey> hospital </joey>
<joey> like what what an arsenal yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know really strange really bizarre </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] that kid i was so excited to play </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] brawlers </garnt>
<connor> what are you in the hospital for yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't know i was getting checkups i </connor>

<connor> hospital please mom </connor>

<joey> chill ones just like </joey>
<joey> whatever it's like sprains like not </joey>
<joey> nothing luckily i just never broke bones </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> wow yeah i don't know how i got so lucky </joey>
<connor> because i [ __ ] my body up so many </connor>
<connor> times i don't know how i got so lucky </connor>
<joey> it's like why is my kid so enthusiastic </joey>
<connor> to go to the hospital </connor>
<connor> yeah and also sometimes you get like </connor>
<connor> your parents would like buy you like a </connor>
<connor> sweet or something afterwards they'd be </connor>
<connor> like yeah you get some like nice food </connor>
<joey> because you're all hospital i thought </joey>

<connor> we don't have cheese and onion flavored </connor>
<garnt> stuff in australia dude you're missing </garnt>
<garnt> out </garnt>

<garnt> the one brand of chips that i thought </garnt>
<connor> was [ __ ] awesome was when i was in </connor>
<connor> ireland i had potatoes </connor>
<connor> potatoes i think that's a specific </connor>
<connor> island specific to ireland but the </connor>
<joey> cheese and flavor potatoes </joey>
<joey> man orgasmic they're so [ __ ] good </joey>
<connor> but wait yeah wait [ __ ] what was what we </connor>
<joey> were on before that </joey>
<joey> squares squares squares squares are </joey>
<joey> really nice uh we also have </joey>
<joey> hula hoops all the hoops they have these </joey>
<joey> in america i'm pretty sure they do </joey>

<joey> they can fit on your fingers they're </joey>
<joey> like rings oh yeah </joey>

<garnt> like uh like marmalade </garnt>
<connor> coated crisps marmalade right i think </connor>
<joey> it's what it is </joey>
<joey> is that what it that sounds weird </joey>
<connor> what are they called what's it's in </connor>
<garnt> america as well i think they have what's </garnt>
<garnt> it like cheetos </garnt>
<garnt> yeah they kind of feel like cheetos but </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> jacob minis are sensations </garnt>
<garnt> i remember sensations oh my god they had </garnt>
<garnt> like premium </garnt>
<garnt> bagged crisps yeah but these are all </garnt>
<connor> like walker's brands right yeah they're </connor>
<connor> all one </connor>
<connor> yeah because walkers just like like </connor>
<garnt> walkers is what are they called in </garnt>
<garnt> america again </garnt>
<joey> i wish we had this conversation last </joey>
<garnt> week when shu was here because i don't </garnt>
<joey> have another australian to relate to </joey>
<joey> damn it people have like apparently </joey>
<joey> there's so many news organizations in </joey>
<connor> the uk have done </connor>
<connor> uh tier lists of crisps from like bottom </connor>
<joey> tier to like heights oh that's a that's </joey>
<joey> an after dark uh </joey>
<connor> we also had a bag of crisps that was </connor>
<connor> really popular </connor>
<connor> it was called salt and shake that was </connor>
<joey> like a bag of crisps that we hadn't been </joey>
<joey> salted and it would come with salt and </joey>
<joey> the whole gimmick of this thing was that </joey>
<connor> you put the salt in it </connor>
<joey> you should shake it up yeah you saw </joey>
<garnt> you'd literally salt it yourself </garnt>
<joey> right right right and it tastes like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> because it was like it was just unsalted </garnt>
<joey> evenly like it was the salt would stick </joey>
<joey> to like the bottom </joey>
<joey> and then the rest of the sauce just at </joey>
<garnt> the bottom yeah it was terrible </garnt>
<garnt> but like yeah and it's like if you come </garnt>
<connor> to the uk i really highly recommend </connor>
<connor> trying all our crisps </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't really rate the japanese </garnt>
<connor> ones too much nah they're pretty bad uh </connor>
<connor> the pizza potato one's pretty good yeah </connor>
<connor> that's what i'd say only the pizza </connor>
<garnt> cheese i don't know why you like the </garnt>
<connor> pizza potato ones </connor>
<connor> yeah i told chris i was like uh next </connor>
<joey> video that i want to make with him is uh </joey>
<joey> trying all the japanese crisps </joey>
<joey> just two [ __ ] super british people </joey>
<connor> complaining about crisps </connor>
<connor> because there's a lot of like meh ones </connor>
<garnt> here </garnt>
<joey> most of the ones you find here are just </joey>
<garnt> pretty meh especially the ones in from </garnt>
<connor> like the combination the </connor>
<connor> flavors they have are so bizarre and </connor>
<connor> they have doritos here but they're like </connor>
<connor> taco flavored </connor>
<joey> and it does not taste like taco well </joey>
<joey> they have cheetos here as well but it </joey>
<garnt> doesn't taste like </garnt>
<garnt> that's not about like pizza flavored </garnt>
<garnt> stuff i mean what what is the flavor of </garnt>
<garnt> pizza anyway </garnt>
<joey> right it's rust yeah no crust no no no </joey>
<garnt> crust apparently </garnt>
<joey> not a single [ __ ] crust in sight mate </joey>
<joey> you won't see a crust </joey>
<garnt> you should love it technically there's </garnt>
<joey> no crust i mean it's </joey>
<joey> not i mean it's a pizza you know a </joey>
<joey> has a unique pizza it's a pizza you need </joey>

<joey> crust by itself </joey>
<garnt> it's you hearing this </garnt>
<joey> this man's stuff i'm i'm not i'm not </joey>
<garnt> going to start we're not going to start </garnt>
