<joey> (whoosh) (pops) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Ooh! </joey>
<joey> - Wait, how do you do that? </joey>
<connor> (whoosh) (farts) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you wish you knew the powers of my (farts). </connor>
<connor> (laughs) Okay, hold on. </connor>
<connor> (pops) - Oh, it's bass. </connor>
<connor> (calm music) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Where's my lid? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] You need the lid? </connor>
<connor> - Of course I need to lid, it's a collection item. </connor>
<connor> - Whoa! (loopy tune) </connor>
<garnt> - It needs the lid. </garnt>
<joey> - Why do you have a mug with no liquid in it? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, why are you asking for a lid? </joey>
<joey> - Well, why are you asking for a lid </joey>
<garnt> if you're not gonna drink coffee out of it? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Do you need coffee? </joey>
<joey> - I need this air to be nice and cool. </joey>
<joey> - I do actually, but also you know, </joey>
<joey> I think of this mug as a collectors piece, </joey>
<joey> as should the viewers who bought it, </joey>
<garnt> and it should always have the lid on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but there's... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you don't have like Santa Claus </garnt>
<garnt> without the red suit on, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> Like you don't have the Trash Taste mug without the lid. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but you just gotta, </garnt>
<garnt> you have like a coffee cup right there. </garnt>
<garnt> And you have like a mug that's just unused. </garnt>
<connor> - Here, get this outta here, </connor>
<connor> why is there a lid on the floor? </connor>
<garnt> - Did you drink the coffee not out of the Trash Taste mug? </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] No. </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] This dude has been doing that for a lot of things. </joey>
<connor> - I don't like transferring liquids from like... </connor>
<connor> - Fake Trash Taste fan. </connor>
<connor> - I also want my Trash Taste mug. </connor>
<joey> - I don't like transferring liquids (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - I like the mug. </connor>
<joey> Look at this man's mug! </joey>
<joey> Look at this shit! </joey>
<garnt> How did you get this shit all on there? </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I've been drinking out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - This doesn't look like drinking. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a used mug. </garnt>
<garnt> - Used? </garnt>
<connor> You fucking slobbered all over it, </connor>
<connor> half the coffees on the fucking mug. </connor>
<joey> - Have you seen this man drink? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he (licks). </joey>
<joey> - He's like, he doesn't know where his mouth is. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt is like a person who used to be a dog </connor>
<connor> in another life, but just never forgot how to. </connor>
<connor> - He drinks like his mouth. </connor>
<connor> - Are you kidding me, </connor>
<connor> I would love to be a dog in my next life, </connor>
<connor> or this current life. </connor>
<garnt> Dogs have the easiest fucking lives in existence. </garnt>
<garnt> Dogs and cats. </garnt>
<garnt> You just do nothing all day. </garnt>
<joey> - They piss, shit and unconditionally love, </joey>
<garnt> that's all they do. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<connor> - That's what a dog is. </connor>
<connor> - I watched a... </connor>
<connor> - Have we done our intro yet? </connor>
<joey> - No, we haven't. </joey>
<garnt> - Hi, this is the intro, Joey's the host. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes, hello Sonic fans, I'm Joey, welcome to Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> I'm with Garnt and Connor. </joey>
<connor> - Episode 69, this deserves more. </connor>
<connor> - Hey! - More of an intro than that. </connor>
<joey> - I texted Felix earlier when we found out </joey>
<joey> that this was episode 69, 'cause a little backstory. </joey>
<garnt> So, you know, Felix, who, PewDiePie, </garnt>
<garnt> who we've been trying to get on the show, </garnt>
<garnt> can't come to Japan 'cause you know, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously 'cause of the world situation. </garnt>
<joey> So, well we hoped that by episode 69, hopefully, </joey>
<joey> he would have been able to come. </joey>
<joey> Obviously he couldn't. </joey>
<joey> So I texted him and said, I'm sorry, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Didn't he specifically say reserve episode 69? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he was like, Joey, if I'm not on episode 69, </joey>
<joey> I am just not coming on. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember you telling me that </garnt>
<joey> in like episode two or three or something </joey>
<joey> just when Trash Taste started and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> are we even gonna be around for episode 69? </joey>
<garnt> Are we even gonna have an audience by then? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, wow, Felix, </garnt>
<joey> you're very positive thinker to be like, </joey>
<joey> thinking 65 episodes ahead. </joey>
<garnt> - I was just like, I couldn't even envision episode 69 </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was just like, I'll be happy if we can last a year. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Break even with the podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - It's weird to think that we're probably gonna reach </garnt>
<joey> a 100 episodes. </joey>
<joey> - That's scary isn't it? - I was gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> which episode Trash Taste did this in? </joey>
<joey> Oh, it's 179, actually. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's weird to think that that could be a thing. </joey>
<joey> - Scary. - 'Cause when I see Joe Rogan, </joey>
<connor> it's like episode 800 or something, I'm like fuck! </connor>
<garnt> - But doesn't he record three episodes a week </garnt>
<joey> or something like that? </joey>
<garnt> - It's once every two days. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Holy, and they're four hours long. </connor>
<joey> - The man loves to talk, man. - Holy fuck. </joey>
<joey> I thought I run out of topics to talk about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - You know, just sitting through one episode of Joe Rogan </joey>
<joey> really makes me appreciate just how much shit, A, he knows </joey>
<joey> and B, how good he is at stretching out a single topic. </joey>
<joey> No, but seriously, because after 800-something episodes, </joey>
<joey> four hours at a time, you have to learn to like... </joey>
<connor> - Well, I feel like when you're very, </connor>
<joey> you do talk about current topics </joey>
<joey> and you very much get involved with politics. </joey>
<connor> - But as well, even if it's not current topics, </connor>
<joey> he's very good at kind of really extensively </joey>
<joey> going into a topic to the point where </joey>
<joey> a topic that can last maybe, what, </joey>
<garnt> 10 minutes on Trash Taste, </garnt>
<garnt> can last up to an hour on the Joe Rogan show. </garnt>
<garnt> - He really stretching out that 15 minute mark. </garnt>
<joey> - He's really thinning out his call center. </joey>
<joey> I'm just kidding (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - How many ads can we fit in here? </connor>
<joey> No, I mean, when you talk about politics, </joey>
<joey> they suddenly turn what could be two-minute conversations </joey>
<joey> into 10 hours. </joey>
<joey> - That is true. </joey>
<joey> Maybe we should do that. </joey>
<joey> - Are you fucking kidding me? - I don't wanna do that. </joey>
<joey> - Are you kidding me? </joey>
<connor> I think the reason people come to watch Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> is to escape political nonsense. </connor>
<garnt> - I come to Trash Taste </garnt>
<connor> to escape a lot of political nonsense. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, I just wanna talk with the boys. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone who talks about it, I feel like it's not, </connor>
<connor> I'd feel like no one is educated enough about it. </connor>
<connor> And so, when everyone talks about it, </connor>
<connor> I don't know which level of education </connor>
<garnt> you need in this topic. </garnt>
<connor> But I feel that no one has enough </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone seems to always have some fucking argument </connor>
<connor> that I'm like, what the fuck is going on? </connor>
<garnt> - The problem with a lot of political topics is... </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, thank you man, is that the Trash Taste mug? </connor>
<garnt> - Are you gonna drink coffee out of it? </garnt>
<joey> - You bet your ass I am. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'll take the lid as well, give me the lids. </joey>
<joey> - No, 'cause I completely agree. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause a lot of the times there are some topics </joey>
<garnt> where you just genuinely don't know which side to listen to </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause both sides are just at each other's throat. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, I don't feel like. </garnt>
<joey> - Every time someone brings up </joey>
<joey> some kind of political conversation because I, </joey>
<joey> A, just don't really care about politics in general </joey>
<joey> and B, I'm again, not knowledgeable about it anyway. </joey>
<joey> - You don't care about politics in general? </joey>
<joey> - No. - That's taking a stance </joey>
<connor> in itself, Joey. - Yeah, wow, right. </connor>
<connor> - See that's privilege, to be able to not care. </connor>
<joey> - But like everything, it doesn't matter what it is. </joey>
<joey> It could be like the most far left thing, </joey>
<joey> it could be the most far right thing. </joey>
<joey> And my only two answers is just, "Oh, that sucks". </joey>
<joey> Or, "Oh, that's good", I guess. </joey>
<connor> - I keep up with it, </connor>
<connor> but I do also really despise the era we're in </connor>
<connor> where it's all. </connor>
<joey> - Everything is political? - Well, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's not that everything's political, </garnt>
<joey> it's everyone has to be involved in it, </joey>
<joey> and has to be educated in it. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone needs an opinion about it. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like the main players are all just YouTubers, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm like, I don't trust YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a YouTuber, I don't trust other YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't trust myself. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Don't trust yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what we're like. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know for a fact that these people cannot be doing </garnt>
<garnt> that good of a job. </garnt>
<garnt> And when I listen to them, I'm like, okay, this is fine. </garnt>
<joey> You know, to me, it's also been highly monetized now. </joey>
<joey> I feel like money has become such a big player in it </joey>
<garnt> that I don't wanna watch any of these people on YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> telling me about why they believe X person </garnt>
<joey> has no rights or whatever. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, you got a horse in this race </joey>
<joey> to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> You gotta get people angry and upset about it </joey>
<joey> so you can get dollars. </joey>
<joey> - There's something in it for you. </joey>
<joey> - Which is why I also hate it a lot </joey>
<connor> and I also just don't really like talking about it online </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's a shitshow. </garnt>
<connor> And also, everyone has their own opinions. </connor>
<garnt> - It is a shitshow and I just feel like some things </garnt>
<joey> are just better discussed in private with the person, </joey>
<joey> because there's only so much you can say </joey>
<joey> in 140 characters on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> And that's unfortunately </joey>
<joey> where a lot of these opinions are being spread </joey>
<joey> and it's easy to, one, misrepresent your own ideas </joey>
<joey> and two, other people to misrepresent your ideas. </joey>
<joey> - And might take it out of context. </joey>
<joey> - It just seems like a lose-lose situation for me, </joey>
<joey> and two, I don't know why it's just so bad </joey>
<connor> or why more people just don't agree </connor>
<connor> that sometimes you just aren't educated enough </connor>
<connor> or you just don't know enough about a topic </connor>
<connor> to just have an opinion on it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and you say that and, </connor>
<joey> I feel like there's so many things now </joey>
<joey> where we just have so much information on topics, </joey>
<joey> where, yeah okay, maybe someone can, </joey>
<joey> two parties can present the complete opposite argument, </joey>
<joey> but there's enough information </joey>
<joey> where they can kind of both make that point </joey>
<garnt> because they have enough points that work with one person </garnt>
<garnt> and enough points that work with the other. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, okay, well I can get educated on all of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then when you do try and educate yourself on everything </garnt>
<joey> in a certain situation, you just realize, </joey>
<joey> I just hate all of this. </joey>
<joey> Everything is just fucked and nothing works. </joey>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> - There's no right answer. - What do I do? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've gotten to that point a lot of times </connor>
<connor> where it's just like, how do I fix this problem? </connor>
<garnt> I have absolutely no fucking clue. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know where to start. </garnt>
<garnt> The more I read, the more depressed I feel. </garnt>
<joey> - And the rest of the world was like, first time? </joey>
<garnt> No one knows the answer and that's why we're arguing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the whole thing with the, </garnt>
<joey> you should reduce your energy usage </joey>
<joey> to help combat global warming. </joey>
<joey> And then it's just the whole thing of, </joey>
<joey> but then also like BP is like spilling </joey>
<joey> the entire oil supply to the ocean. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, well, I feel like I'm not really the problem. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's not really me, </joey>
<joey> but then you see that and people get angry </joey>
<joey> and then it's like, well, but then you're like, </joey>
<joey> well change it, we should vote against these companies. </joey>
<joey> But that's been proven that doesn't, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't really fucking work half the time. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause clearly someone makes a new rule </joey>
<connor> that they can go and harvest.. - The whole game is busted. </connor>
<connor> So no matter how many times you change the rules, </connor>
<joey> it's just not gonna turn out to be the game </joey>
<joey> that you wanna play. </joey>
<joey> - It sucks! </joey>
<connor> It all fucking sucks. </connor>
<joey> - It does, and that's why we don't talk about it </joey>
<connor> on Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - It always goes to the negative for me, </connor>
<connor> which is why I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm on Trash Taste with the boys, </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna shut off the internet for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna talk about how I wanna be reincarnated as a dog. </joey>
<garnt> - It's okay to stop caring, you know, </garnt>
<connor> there's just too much, there's way too much. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause right now we're just so overloaded with information </garnt>
<garnt> and things to care about. </garnt>
<connor> - I literally gotta shit myself if somebody sneeze </connor>
<connor> within two feet of me, </connor>
<connor> and now I gotta worry about what's going on? </connor>
<connor> You know, in multiple countries now. </connor>
<garnt> I'm a UK, I live in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> gotta keep up with dual politics? </garnt>
<connor> - That's the biggest thing that's changed, right? </connor>
<joey> Because before, everyone only needed to care </joey>
<joey> about what was around them. </joey>
<joey> And now being people on the internet, </joey>
<joey> I have to care about everything going on globally. </joey>
<joey> And it gets to the point </joey>
<connor> where there are so many different cultures, </connor>
<connor> so many different points of view, </connor>
<connor> so many different like experiences </connor>
<connor> that each individual has had, </connor>
<connor> that sometimes it's impossible for a lot of people </connor>
<joey> to get the same viewpoint on things. </joey>
<joey> Because even for us who've lived in multiple countries </joey>
<joey> and have had experience with multiple cultures. </joey>
<joey> You can say we're cultured ourselves. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Saying this in like the pure, unironic sense, </joey>
<joey> because you get this sense whenever I go home, </joey>
<joey> or whenever I hear about any of us going home </joey>
<joey> and you see people who have stayed in their home towns </joey>
<joey> and you see people who have not left their home towns </joey>
<joey> and they have the exact same viewpoint </joey>
<connor> that they got raised on, right? </connor>
<connor> And coming from the place, </connor>
<joey> you kind of understand how they got that viewpoint </joey>
<joey> even though you don't agree with it. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> But you also understand that they don't have anything </joey>
<garnt> to really change their viewpoint in there </garnt>
<garnt> because they've never experienced anything else. </garnt>
<joey> - There's no new information that comes in </joey>
<joey> to stimulate that change in thought process. </joey>
<joey> So forever they just think, well this is correct, </joey>
<joey> because this is what it was like around me. </joey>
<joey> I don't know about anything else </joey>
<joey> that's happening in the world, </joey>
<joey> so this is just how I'm going to see the world. </joey>
<garnt> But then, for instance, I remember when I first came back </garnt>
<garnt> to Australia after I was living here </garnt>
<garnt> and I would go see my friends and stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> who have been there the entire time. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, things that I remember I used to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to very heavily relate with and kind of almost agree upon, </garnt>
<garnt> I found myself to be like, oh, is this how I felt? </garnt>
<joey> Is this really what my thought process was like? </joey>
<joey> And it's so weird because like that didn't even happen </joey>
<garnt> in that much of a large space of time. </garnt>
<connor> Like that only maybe happened in two years or something, </connor>
<connor> of just living here. </connor>
<connor> And I think definitely doing YouTube and stuff like that </connor>
<garnt> has got me to interact </garnt>
<garnt> with so many more different nationalities and cultures </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Doing this job, you're almost forced to be up-to-date </garnt>
<garnt> with everything that's happening in the world </garnt>
<garnt> because you have people all over the world </garnt>
<joey> who are viewing you, right? </joey>
<joey> So I have this weird pressure of being, </joey>
<joey> I don't want this one person from this one country </joey>
<joey> coming into my streams or whatever and being, </joey>
<joey> do you know what's happening in my country right now? </joey>
<joey> And me going, no, I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you get that, like what do you think </joey>
<connor> about the current gentrification of Southeast Macau, </connor>
<joey> and you're like, what the fuck? </joey>
<connor> How the fuck would I know that. </connor>
<connor> - Wat is Macau? </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You get that a lot. </joey>
<joey> You surely can't expect me to have a horse in this race, </joey>
<connor> please, come on. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just kidding people from Macau, I know what Macau is. </connor>
<garnt> But that's the thing, you're almost pressured </garnt>
<joey> to be up to date on that kind of stuff, </joey>
<garnt> because you don't wanna leave any of your viewers out </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, that causes you to just, </garnt>
<garnt> it absorbs so much information about the world </garnt>
<garnt> that when I go back to my hometown and I meet people </garnt>
<joey> who aren't up to date on that kind of stuff </joey>
<joey> who have completely different viewpoints of the world, </joey>
<joey> because the amount of information </joey>
<joey> that they absorb about the world is on a different level. </joey>
<connor> It's, I dunno, it's a bit of a whiplash. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, ooh, I can't believe I used to think like that. </connor>
<joey> That's kinda weird. </joey>
<connor> - I don't even know my I'm blood type, </connor>
<joey> so I don't even expect people to learn about the outside. </joey>
<joey> How do people expect me to keep up with weird news </joey>
<connor> in some country I've never heard of. </connor>
<joey> I think you should be the one to know your own blood type. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure I should, I have a blood disease as well. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I have a blood disease, </connor>
<joey> I don't know what my blood type is though. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. - It's pretty irresponsible. </joey>
<joey> You also had to do a blood test here, </joey>
<joey> and you were shown your blood type. </joey>
<joey> Having said that, I don't know my blood type either, </joey>
<joey> I got the same... - What! </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just as monkey-brained as him apparently. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know it's in the alphabet. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's one of them. </joey>
<joey> - It's in the alphabet! </joey>
<joey> - It's one of the four. </joey>
<connor> - What is your blood type? </connor>
<garnt> Sigma. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Delta, alpha, sigma. </joey>
<joey> - Alpha, sigma. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm like, decaf? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I don't know, and I do, like you said, </connor>
<connor> you do try to educate yourself on some things, </connor>
<connor> but there's just so, you know, </connor>
<connor> you can't be expected to keep up with so many things. </connor>
<garnt> - Like here's a question then, </garnt>
<garnt> do you feel like there's a big difference </garnt>
<garnt> between explaining to someone your perspective </garnt>
<garnt> and actually having the person really experience it </garnt>
<connor> and empathize with you? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like those are two different things. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I can sit here, I could go back to Wales </connor>
<joey> and explain Japanese culture all day </joey>
<joey> and they just won't understand it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you bow at every single, every word? </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you say, excuse me, every 10 seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, it's kind of very similar to, </garnt>
<garnt> let's say learning a language, </garnt>
<garnt> where you can explain a language, </garnt>
<garnt> you can explain grammar structures and you can explain </garnt>
<garnt> how the writing system and stuff works. </garnt>
<joey> But there's a difference between understanding </joey>
<joey> how a language works and actually just absorbing it </joey>
<joey> and really getting a feel for the language yourself. </joey>
<joey> I know there's a word for it, </joey>
<joey> acquisition, language acquisition, </joey>
<joey> versus just learning how it works on a logical sense. </joey>
<joey> And I feel the exact same way </joey>
<joey> when it comes to cultures and perspective </joey>
<joey> where there's been so many times </joey>
<joey> where someone has told me about a perspective </joey>
<joey> and you're logically like, "Yeah, I agree with that". </joey>
<joey> You know, they could be making the most sense, </joey>
<joey> but then you kind of maybe move to the country </joey>
<joey> that they're living in or you go travel there </joey>
<garnt> or you meet more people from that same culture. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, oh, I think I actually get </garnt>
<garnt> what you're talking about now, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it's like how when you're growing up </connor>
<garnt> and you hear about other countries and you think, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, it's that funny little thing that country does. </garnt>
<garnt> I know they would probably do this about Japan a lot, </garnt>
<joey> they would just show with things like Sumo, </joey>
<joey> and they'd be like, isn't that so strange. </joey>
<joey> - These big men in diapers pushing each other around. </joey>
<joey> - It's one of those things, aint it? </joey>
<joey> But I think that when you get to experience more cultures, </joey>
<garnt> your mindset on when you see stuff like that changes a lot. </garnt>
<joey> You go from thinking, oh, that funny thing, </joey>
<joey> that weird, strange thing, to thinking </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's a story behind it. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's a history, there's a culture behind it. </joey>
<connor> - I definitely felt that, </connor>
<joey> especially after I started dating Aki </joey>
<joey> and you know, through YouTube meeting a lot of Americans, </joey>
<connor> because in Australia, the image of America </connor>
<joey> is not that glamorous or positive in any way. </joey>
<joey> I'm just saying it's straight up. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think the image of Americans in America. </joey>
<joey> I love that the Americans are often the first people </joey>
<joey> to bash their own country. - Right, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I love you, America. </connor>
<connor> - It depends on where they're from. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it depends. </garnt>
<garnt> But after actually going to America </garnt>
<garnt> and talking to Americans and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> that completely flipped it over and I realized, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> the problem was just kind of my environment </garnt>
<garnt> that was pushing that agenda and the media that I consumed </garnt>
<garnt> that was kind of pushing this sort of negative agenda </garnt>
<joey> about American culture and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> But then when you actually go and you live it out, </joey>
<joey> you see it firsthand and you see everything else </joey>
<joey> that they don't show and you're like, </joey>
<joey> oh, actually it's not as insane or wacky </joey>
<joey> as the TV shows or the shit my friends were talking about, </joey>
<joey> make it out to be, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I remember when I first started dating Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when we first met and first started dating, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember early on, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause she mentioned this to me the other day. </garnt>
<joey> I asked her, so out of curiosity, </joey>
<joey> what do you actually think about America? </joey>
<joey> And she was like, oh, greatest country in the world. </joey>
<joey> And I remember. </joey>
<joey> - Was she dead-ass when she said it? </joey>
<joey> - Imagine, she came from a small town in the Midwest </joey>
<joey> - Oh when you first started dating? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, when I first started dating her five, six years ago, </joey>
<garnt> shit, seven years ago now actually. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a long time ago and I remember </garnt>
<garnt> that was the first time she had basically traveled </garnt>
<garnt> out of America, and she came from a very small town </garnt>
<garnt> in the Midwest and got raised with the values </garnt>
<garnt> that you would expect a small town to get raised in. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember she said, oh yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> America is the greatest country in the world, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, apparently she said, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, "Hmm". </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like that. </garnt>
<joey> - And she said to me at the time, </joey>
<joey> she got like genuinely offended, right? </joey>
<joey> She straight up, she got genuinely angry at me </joey>
<joey> at the time for doing that. </joey>
<connor> She was like, what'd you mean, why? </connor>
<connor> Why did you make that sound? </connor>
<connor> She said to me, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> so what constitutes the greatest country? </connor>
<joey> And why is America the greatest country? </joey>
<joey> And she was like, oh, land of the free, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> We got freedom. </joey>
<joey> - I was about to say. </joey>
<joey> And second, I'm like, "Hmm". </joey>
<joey> - I was about to say, </joey>
<joey> if she's about to drop the freedom bomb, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what I can say to that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because to me at the time, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just living up to </garnt>
<joey> the stereotypical patriotic American, </joey>
<joey> 'cause America is a good country, you know? </joey>
<joey> But my issue is, the more I travel, the more I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> is there a greatest country in the world? </joey>
<joey> And there's no way you can define </joey>
<joey> the greatest country in the world. </joey>
<joey> - Otherwise everyone will be living there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And to me, patriotism, as a British person, </joey>
<joey> is just so weird. </joey>
<joey> Like, you see it, I see American patriotism where, </joey>
<connor> you know, not saying every American like this, </connor>
<connor> but especially some of the Americans I've met </connor>
<connor> who were raised in small towns, </connor>
<connor> especially when I go back to Sydney's hometown, </connor>
<joey> it's just, you see this culture that's been, </joey>
<joey> and this idea that's just been propagated </joey>
<joey> through the small town, </joey>
<joey> and there's not really been any other perspective </joey>
<joey> to really change that perspective. </joey>
<joey> They probably believe, by their belief, </joey>
<joey> they probably believe that America </joey>
<joey> is the greatest country in the world </joey>
<joey> and there is no other thing that can challenge that. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, I can't blame them for that. </joey>
<joey> - No of course not. - And I'm not even saying </joey>
<joey> America isn't the greatest country in the world. </joey>
<joey> I'm just saying that because their belief </joey>
<joey> has been permeated so deeply that there's been nothing </joey>
<joey> to really break that mold for them. </joey>
<joey> And it took years for Sydney </joey>
<joey> to really kinda change her perspective. </joey>
<joey> It didn't take like just one trip to England. </joey>
<joey> It took years for her traveling to living with me in England </joey>
<joey> and living with me in Thailand and living with me in Japan, </joey>
<joey> for her to like really open up her perspective to be like, </joey>
<joey> you know what, maybe there are </joey>
<joey> some other good places in the world as well. </joey>
<joey> You know, maybe some other places do things as good. </joey>
<joey> And now she has recently just gone back to America </joey>
<joey> to visit her family and she's like, </joey>
<joey> wow, I really don't fit there anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah, it felt weird, </joey>
<joey> 'cause she told me that she just didn't feel </joey>
<joey> as settled as she used to be. </joey>
<joey> - Mhmm. - Ah, I get that too. </joey>
<joey> - She feels like an outsider almost. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I definitely got that </connor>
<connor> when I was back in Wales last time. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I love my hometown and I love my friends, </connor>
<connor> but you definitely feel like 'cause you've been doing </connor>
<garnt> so many things and exploring so many different cultures, </garnt>
<garnt> you definitely feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> God, I must sound like that weird fucking gap student </garnt>
<garnt> who come back, like, I've traveled the world now, </garnt>
<connor> I'm better than all of you. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I really don't wanna sound like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, no, but it does open your perspective a lot </connor>
<connor> and you do think, oh shit, it really just made you look </connor>
<joey> at stuff in your tiny town a lot differently. </joey>
<joey> And you know, how homogenous it is. </joey>
<joey> - The tiny town just feels so much more tinier, weirdly. </joey>
<connor> And you know, again, I don't blame Sydney </connor>
<connor> or anyone from the small towns who think that way, </connor>
<connor> because again, I feel, especially in America, </connor>
<connor> it really is just kind of enclosed </connor>
<connor> when it comes to the information that you can get </connor>
<connor> about the rest of the world. </connor>
<connor> It still blows my mind that in America, for example, </connor>
<joey> 24-hour news channels are a thing, but it's not world news, </joey>
<joey> it's American news for 24-hours. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what? </joey>
<joey> It's just insane to think, </joey>
<joey> for one, there's so much news happening in America </joey>
<joey> that you can just constantly run news stories. </joey>
<joey> But also, there's just so little access </joey>
<joey> or ease of access to information outside of America. </joey>
<connor> - Same in the UK though, really. </connor>
<joey> We get like, we get trickled down to America. </joey>
<joey> We don't really get to see a lot of inside America. </joey>
<garnt> A lot of British people don't really know many of the states </garnt>
<joey> outside the very famous ones. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I'm sure it's the same in Australia as well, though. </joey>
<joey> - Stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And we have very rudimentary knowledge </joey>
<joey> of outside of Europe, really. </joey>
<joey> - But do you guys have world news on your TV? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we do, we do. </garnt>
<connor> - But like world news is just mostly, </connor>
<connor> it's mostly the Middle East conflict. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, stuff that we fucked up, really. </connor>
<garnt> Stuff that we had a hand in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, fair enough. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's rare that we hear anything about Japan </connor>
<connor> or Asia in general, unless something massive has happened. </connor>
<connor> - Well, 'cause of the Olympics normally. </connor>
<connor> Because BBC scarcely reports on Japan. </connor>
<joey> I have the BBC app and I set the Japan section, </joey>
<joey> they don't do an article every three days on Japan. </joey>
<joey> And it would be very, </joey>
<joey> it'd probably be quite high profile stuff in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> Or very wacky, whoa! </garnt>
<joey> They open up a new store with M&M's, </joey>
<joey> whoa! - Whoa! </joey>
<joey> - Also, I do think as well, </joey>
<joey> the fact that a lot of people think, </joey>
<joey> one of the reasons why people </joey>
<joey> already think America is terrible is, </joey>
<joey> in the UK and also in Japan I feel this as well. </joey>
<joey> A lot of this bad stuff and injustices, if you will, </joey>
<joey> in the UK and I think Japan as well, </joey>
<joey> probably don't get as much spotlight as they do in America. </joey>
<joey> And also everything is fucking filmed in America. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] True. </joey>
<joey> - Literally everything is on camera. </joey>
<joey> - True, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - So I feel like it's way easier to catch the stuff </joey>
<joey> that makes your country look fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - When there's cameras all the fucking time, </garnt>
<joey> capturing everything. </joey>
<joey> I feel like one of the main reasons </joey>
<joey> why we see so many insane stuff for America looks good </joey>
<joey> and you hear all these horrible injustices </joey>
<connor> that have been done is 'cause there's just so much video </connor>
<connor> and there's so much attention brought to it by the media. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's also as well the fact that </joey>
<connor> just simply the population difference is one thing as well. </connor>
<connor> But it's also, again, </connor>
<connor> it's just that whole cultural mentality </connor>
<connor> or I guess group mentality of, </connor>
<joey> it's me versus the world, you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's very much an individualistic society </joey>
<garnt> where it's like, I'm the center... </garnt>
<joey> - We have that in the UK as well to some extent. </joey>
<connor> - I think the UK way more. </connor>
<joey> I think that's definitely one of the biggest difference </joey>
<joey> between East and West that I've felt </joey>
<garnt> living in both different places. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and whereas in Japan it's like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I don't wanna stick out too much </joey>
<joey> 'cause otherwise the camera might get stuck on me. </joey>
<connor> - But it's hard right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause on one hand you get society </connor>
<connor> where everyone's comfortable </connor>
<garnt> nobody oversteps their boundaries, </garnt>
<garnt> but everyone's fucking miserable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't have this utopian ideal Japan </garnt>
<connor> without also having a depressed society </connor>
<connor> where no one can have fun. </connor>
<joey> - And I feel that's like problem right now </joey>
<joey> is that regardless of if you're an individualistic society </joey>
<joey> versus a collective society, </joey>
<joey> there's still shit that happens right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like the stuff I love about the UK </connor>
<connor> is also, I'm near certain, the stuff that I love, </connor>
<garnt> or is also the reason why we have a lot of the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like about the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, same thing with Japan. </joey>
<connor> - You don't get the good things and not the bad things. </connor>
<garnt> - No, there's no perfect country. </garnt>
<connor> - There's no perfect country and I don't think </connor>
<connor> there's a perfect system. - Denmark's just like, hello. </connor>
<garnt> Allow me to. </garnt>
<joey> - Switzerland is like. </joey>
<joey> - I read an article that was like, </joey>
<joey> people who live in Denmark that are unhappy </joey>
<joey> are extremely unhappy because they're supposed to be </joey>
<joey> the happiest country on Earth. </joey>
<joey> So the people who get sad there </joey>
<joey> or their life isn't going the way they want, </joey>
<joey> they feel more depressed because they're supposed to be. </joey>
<joey> - Because everyone around them is happy. </joey>
<joey> - You're supposed to be in the happiest place on Earth. </joey>
<joey> You can't fucking win. </joey>
<joey> No matter what goes wrong, you can't win. </joey>
<joey> But I think, obviously, that also depends on </joey>
<joey> if you can afford to be healthy and all that stuff. </joey>
<joey> So that all changes, obviously. </joey>
<joey> Being healthy is pretty good. </joey>

<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you guys patriotic? </garnt>
<joey> - Uh, no. </joey>
<joey> Only in like sport, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - To Wales, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty much the most patriotic I get is towards sports. </garnt>
<connor> - But you have to, okay, so I think Wales' patriotic </connor>
<connor> and being in the UK is a very different. </connor>
<garnt> - How many times, how often do you get </garnt>
<garnt> to be patriotic about Wales? </garnt>
<connor> - Anytime England fucks up. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Basically right. - That's the truth. </joey>
<joey> - You're just like, I'm not part of that. </joey>
<joey> - So that's what I'm saying, it's not. </joey>
<garnt> Patriotism in Wales is not like </garnt>
<garnt> the rest of the world patriotism where it's like, go us! </garnt>
<garnt> It's just fuck England. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like that's just - That's literally all it is. </connor>
<connor> - Wales, Scotland and Irish? </connor>
<connor> Like Northern Irish patriotism. </connor>
<connor> - Right, that's why, I feel like UK patriotism </connor>
<garnt> is a completely different brand to other. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we get very proud of Welsh people, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> But we get the most proud when it is </garnt>
<garnt> to the detriment of England. </garnt>
<joey> So when people are like, oh, you're English though, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, no, I'm not even, I have no. </joey>
<garnt> There is absolutely nothing about me that is English. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm British and Welsh, but not English. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot of people always like, </garnt>
<joey> well, that's English, right? </joey>
<joey> No, no, no, no, I despise. </joey>
<joey> But I despise it in a very fun way. </joey>
<joey> It's very much like. </joey>
<garnt> - Tongue in cheek. </garnt>
<joey> - There's a lot of fun stories. </joey>
<joey> - It's a bit of banter, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, have you watched "Archer", the TV show? </connor>
<joey> - A little bits of it, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a really weird thing </connor>
<connor> that just completely caught me off guard. </connor>
<connor> So they did an episode </connor>
<joey> about a very famous Welsh event that happened. </joey>
<joey> And it was very weird that "Archer", </joey>
<joey> an American comedy TV show did this. </joey>
<joey> So, there's a thing called a Tryweryn in Wales. </joey>
<joey> And it's a small town that no longer exists </joey>
<joey> because Liverpool, which is a city in England, </joey>
<joey> wanted a reservoir. </joey>
<joey> So their solution to getting a reservoir </joey>
<garnt> was to just flood this town so they could get water. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit. </garnt>
<joey> - I shit you not. </joey>
<joey> So they had to evacuate, </joey>
<joey> they literally just made people just move. </joey>
<joey> - Wow, okay. </joey>
<joey> - And Welsh people weren't allowed to vote </joey>
<joey> on whether this was. </joey>
<joey> - So they had no say. </joey>
<joey> - They had no say. </joey>
<joey> So they just flooded this town, </joey>
<joey> called Tryweryn and turned it into a reservoir. </joey>
<garnt> Turned out, they didn't even need it in the end. </garnt>
<garnt> And they killed four people as well </garnt>
<garnt> because some people refuse to leave. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they flooded it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's legit, you can go there. </garnt>
<joey> It's depressing as fuck because they're just like buildings </joey>
<joey> underneath this reservoir. </joey>
<joey> And there's a bunch, around the area is a ton of like, </joey>
<joey> remember Tryweryn and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And it's seen as one of the most like injustices </joey>
<joey> that were done to Wales. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, that's pretty shitty. </joey>
<garnt> - It was fairly recent as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - How recent we're talking? </garnt>
<garnt> - Think '60s, can you Google it? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like '60s, '80s, around that time, I think. </garnt>
<connor> Just Tryweryn, T-R-Y-W-E-N </connor>
<garnt> - I pretty sure that's just the plot to Higarashi, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Didn't Higarashi get to build a dam </garnt>
<joey> and then there were protests to stop the people </joey>
<joey> from getting out? - It just acts as a reservoir </joey>
<joey> so English people could drink water </joey>
<joey> and then they didn't even use it. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> And then also "Archer" just did an episode about it. </joey>
<joey> And they did a whole thing of, they were like. </joey>
<connor> - [Navi] About Tryweryn? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Navi] 1965. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah '65 - 1965. </joey>
<joey> - They did a whole joke about it 'cause they were like, </joey>
<joey> it's one of the most, and they were all like, </joey>
<joey> nah, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> It's your justice. </joey>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - That's something everyone needs to care about. </garnt>
<connor> - That is something. </connor>
<garnt> Now, you're all educated on Tryweryn. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the very basic story, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot more that other people can tell, </garnt>
<connor> more in depth story.. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like when you're from a small nation </connor>
<connor> that just doesn't get a lot of attention </connor>
<connor> from the world media in general, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's me </connor>
<connor> whenever like Thailand gets mentioned anywhere. </connor>
<connor> I'm just happy if Thailand is just brought up </connor>
<connor> in any kind of capacity, </connor>
<connor> I'm just everyone knows my country now! </connor>
<connor> - I love it though, they get insanely excited. </connor>
<joey> Like anything happens, like they're just insane, it's great. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when I went. </joey>
<connor> - I wish I had that passion about anything. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I went to a con in Singapore. </connor>
<connor> - Oh and they were shouting at you in public? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, yeah that one but like I remember </connor>
<connor> I did a panel there and I literally, </connor>
<joey> all I literally said was hello, Singapore. </joey>
<joey> And I've never heard a crowd of people </joey>
<joey> like crying and screaming. </joey>
<joey> - That's us! </joey>
<joey> - That's us! - Whoo! </joey>
<joey> It was as if fucking Elvis Presley came on stage </joey>
<connor> and like said their country's name. </connor>
<joey> It's like, he said the country name! </joey>
<connor> - Ladies and gentlemen, Singapore. </connor>
<garnt> - Whoo! </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, the Singapore convention was like crazy. </joey>
<joey> - That was insane. - Don't fucking rub it in. </joey>
<connor> I wasn't invited. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I wasn't invited, </connor>
<connor> I was just there for the ride. - He was just there. </connor>
<connor> - We weren't ties at this point. </connor>
<garnt> We knew each other, I wasn't like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And plus, I was on the other side of the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was already in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> - He was literally just next door. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he's like, I'm a pop down to Singapore. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, the guy literally texted me and was like, </joey>
<joey> oh, you're in Singapore? </joey>
<joey> Think I'll pop down for a quick second. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's so weird sometimes where we are, </garnt>
<garnt> as Southeast Asians, are proud of sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I swear to God, every time I meet </garnt>
<garnt> a fellow Southeast Asian from a different country, </garnt>
<garnt> we get competitive over like the weirdest things, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because the first thing we compare </garnt>
<garnt> is how shit it is to drive on our roads. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why we do that! </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, yeah, you're still alive, nice. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like, oh, this one time in Bangkok, </garnt>
<garnt> I was in traffic for one hour. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh you think one hour's bad? </garnt>
<garnt> When I was in Jakarta, it was a three-hour traffic jam once. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, thinking about this, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> why are we comparing? </joey>
<joey> This is like the weirdest dick size comparison </joey>
<joey> I can think of you. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you survived two car crashes? </joey>
<garnt> I survived four. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, that's not something to be proud of. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I was just like. </connor>
<connor> - I caused all of them. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause after living in two years, </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney just went around to other people being like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, Thailand is second on the most dangerous place </garnt>
<connor> to drive in the world and I lived there. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, Sydney, why are you boasting about that? </connor>
<connor> - Did she even drive there? </connor>
<joey> - She didn't even drive. </joey>
<joey> - Why are we boasting about that? </joey>
<joey> - She's saying all this in the passenger seat. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's like when I went to go to, </connor>
<garnt> my university town was number one </garnt>
<garnt> for heroin usage in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were like, yeah, number one, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, number one. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, most heroin addicts! </garnt>
<garnt> - Heroin, number one! </garnt>
<garnt> - Heroin, number one! </garnt>
<joey> - Wales, let's go! </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Where I grew up was number one </joey>
<joey> for teen pregnancy in the UK as well. </joey>
<joey> And that was just a fact. </joey>
<connor> They were like, good, be proud of it, be proud of it. </connor>
<joey> - Well, finally, number one in something. </joey>
<connor> - So, all of your parents here are still teenagers? </connor>
<connor> Congratulations. </connor>
<garnt> - That's kind of what it's like in a small town. </garnt>
<joey> I just realized that's exactly the same way </joey>
<joey> as where Sydney comes from. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the first thing she boasts about from Wisconsin, </joey>
<joey> it's just two things, we're like number one in cheese, </joey>
<joey> biz and serial killers. </joey>
<garnt> I don't think that's a good thing, Sydney. </garnt>
<connor> - Being number one in cheese in the U.S. </connor>
<connor> is not, that's like saying </connor>
<connor> you're number one landlocked country in some fucking, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, town, oh fuck it's a terrible comparison. </connor>
<joey> - I know what you mean. </joey>
<joey> It's not something to be like, oh wow, amazing. </joey>
<joey> I mean, what is amazing is the fact that </joey>
<joey> that state has the most serial killers. </joey>
<joey> Like that's pretty impressive, honestly. </joey>
<connor> - I liked the Midwest, it was pretty chill. </connor>
<joey> - Where have you been in the Midwest? </joey>
<connor> - I've been to Minnesota. </connor>
<joey> - Minnesota, really? </joey>
<joey> - It's probably my favorite state I've been to in the U.S.. </joey>
<connor> - I've got deported from there. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> Thanks Minnesota. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I don't know about you, </connor>
<joey> I had a very warm welcome in Minnesota. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I did not. - I was not deported. </garnt>
<connor> - They bring out the red carpet. </connor>
<garnt> They're like, yes, sir CdawgVA. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like, your passport? </garnt>
<connor> No, we don't need to check that, go right in. </connor>
<joey> - Oh Mr Anime Man, welcome to Minnesota, get the fuck out. </joey>
<connor> - You said they were really nice though, </connor>
<connor> when they weren't deporting you though. </connor>
<joey> - No the were nice because they were nice about it, </joey>
<joey> at least, they were like, "Hey, it's not your fault, man" </joey>
<joey> it happens all the time kinda thing. </joey>
<joey> But you also have to fly immediately to Amsterdam, </joey>
<connor> and then from Amsterdam back to Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> - Are you allowed to say why you got deported? </connor>
<connor> Is that like something you'd like to talk about? </connor>
<joey> - Ah, just Visa mix-ups basically. </joey>
<connor> I mean like. - You just got the wrong Visa? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, basically I had the wrong Visa. </connor>
<joey> Apparently I asked the immigration officer in Minnesota. </joey>
<joey> He was like, yeah, this happens all the fucking time. </joey>
<connor> So it's like, you are definitely not in the wrong </connor>
<connor> for not knowing this shit. </connor>
<connor> Like it is really confusing, </connor>
<joey> but he's like, just go home, </joey>
<joey> get this particular Visa and then you'll be good </joey>
<joey> for like the next 10 years, at least. </joey>
<garnt> - Sounds really cool saying you got deported. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Sounds like you. </joey>
<garnt> - Until you get deported! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But I'm sure getting deported wasn't cool? </garnt>
<joey> - No, getting deported wasn't cool. </joey>
<joey> But the fact that I literally flew </joey>
<garnt> around the world in 48 hours. </garnt>
<garnt> You just did a fucking speed run, right? </garnt>
<joey> I basically speed-ran around the world. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, what the fuck took them 80 days the first time? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Just get deported bro! </connor>
<garnt> - So I use the. - Around the world </garnt>
<joey> deportation hut. </joey>
<garnt> - I used the deported skip here. </garnt>
<joey> - The first time to the U.S., </joey>
<joey> I didn't know you needed a Visa. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> So what happened was. </garnt>
<garnt> We did need a Visa before. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, we did, we need the ESTA. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was introduced pretty recently. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, before the ESTA you didn't need it. </joey>
<garnt> - The first time I went to America, you didn't need an ESTA. </garnt>
<joey> - How long ago was this? </joey>
<joey> - ESTA was like 10, 15 years ago? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was within my lifetime that the legislation changed. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, 'cause you've been traveling through Europe, </connor>
<joey> all my life, and I just assumed you just turn out </joey>
<joey> where you want to go with a passport. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, well, yeah that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - So, I didn't know that. </joey>
<joey> And so, I booked my flight to the U.S., </joey>
<joey> this is when the ESTA was a thing. </joey>
<joey> Which is bullshit because America can come to the UK, </joey>
<joey> no documentation needed, just a passport. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When we have to go to America, </joey>
<joey> we have to get this ESTA nonsense, right? </joey>
<joey> So I'm getting all my stuff ready, </joey>
<joey> this is my first flight ever to America. </joey>
<joey> I'm on my own, I'm like oh my God, </joey>
<joey> it's midnight and my flight's at 9:00 AM. </joey>
<joey> My dad came to my room, he's like, did you get the Visa? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what? </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, you gotta get a Visa. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no one told me this! </joey>
<joey> How do I get a Visa? </joey>
<joey> I'm like 19 as well, I've never heard of this. </joey>
<joey> When do I have to get a Visa? </joey>
<garnt> Apparently your supposed to get it three days before? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you are. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like more than three days before. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but luckily it came in 15 minutes online, </garnt>
<joey> so I was very lucky. </joey>
<connor> I also did that in Japan as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Aki had to do that at the airport once. </joey>
<joey> because she realized her ESTA had run out. </joey>
<garnt> - You just have a really shit track record </garnt>
<joey> at getting into countries. </joey>
<joey> Like losing your passport before we go to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, I remember that. </connor>
<connor> - I totally forgot 'cause it only lasts for two years. </connor>
<joey> When you go to the U.S. you have to get from most countries. </joey>
<joey> And also Canada, if you get one too? </joey>
<joey> You just apply for a thing called NASTA, </joey>
<joey> costs $15, you do it online. </joey>
<joey> If your passport is like normal, </joey>
<joey> you have no criminal record or anything, </joey>
<joey> you should get it in like 15 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like immediately. </joey>
<joey> - But do it three days just in case, </joey>
<joey> that's what they suggest, and it lasts two years. </joey>
<joey> And when I moved to Japan, </joey>
<joey> I was gonna go to San Francisco and I totally forgot </joey>
<joey> it expired until I was on the way to the airport </joey>
<joey> when I realized it had expired. </joey>
<joey> So I was applying for it on my phone on the way. </joey>
<joey> And luckily, right before I was going out to check in, </joey>
<joey> I just got it. </joey>
<connor> - Ah, nice. - I was like, nice. </connor>
<joey> - That's gold split right there. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I told my company, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> hey, I forgot to get the ESTA. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, what? </connor>
<joey> And I was like, yeah, so I applied for it, </joey>
<joey> it should be fine, we'll see. </joey>
<joey> - We'll see. </joey>
<joey> - We'll see. </joey>
<connor> Luckily it all worked out. </connor>
<joey> - At least you weren't on the plane when you realized that. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird though, 'cause they don't ask me for it </connor>
<connor> and they don't ask me for the, </connor>
<connor> they don't ask you for the ESTA at any point. </connor>
<connor> So I wonder, is it just on a system? </connor>
<joey> They only ask you for it when you're immigrating </joey>
<garnt> into the country that you just landed in. </garnt>
<joey> - What airline did you fly with? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, British Airways? </connor>
<connor> They've never asked me for it. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Because I normally get asked </connor>
<connor> when I'm queuing up to check in if I have a Visa. </connor>
<connor> - They never ask me that. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh really? I've never been asked that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'm just so charming they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> no, no, no, go in, go in. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course this charming man doesn't have the. </connor>
<connor> - They see the brown man and they're just like, oh. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Excuse me, sir. </joey>
<connor> - Or the family guy skin color thing. </connor>
<connor> - Excuse me, sir, do you have a Visa </connor>
<connor> to get into our country? </connor>
<connor> - Shit. </connor>
<joey> This is me sharing my privilege right now, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - No, but like especially coming </joey>
<joey> from having dual citizenship in UK and Thailand, </joey>
<joey> it just makes me realize, man, we are very privileged </joey>
<garnt> to have certain passports because it is literally just </garnt>
<garnt> some passports are completely useless. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah, Japan is like the most OP passport. </connor>
<joey> - It's the most powerful passport in the world. </joey>
<joey> - But only 20% of people have them here. </joey>
<joey> Can you believe that? </joey>
<connor> The fucking audacity. </connor>
<joey> - And also, yeah, there's so many weird other rules </joey>
<connor> that come with it. </connor>
<joey> And again, it's like you were saying, </joey>
<joey> it's the most powerful possible in the world and yet, </joey>
<joey> barely any Japanese people fly out of Japan </joey>
<joey> because the tourism industry here is just so powerful. </joey>
<joey> - Go on, sorry, I interrupted you. </joey>
<garnt> - I completely forgot, I was just gonna say </garnt>
<connor> that some passports are pretty OP </connor>
<connor> and that makes me jealous of your Japanese passport </connor>
<joey> because you can get in like, </joey>
<garnt> what can Japan get in without a Visa that the UK can't? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure there's some other countries, </joey>
<joey> put it on the screen. </joey>
<joey> Obviously we not be bothered to look. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think about this, but I think in the UK, </joey>
<joey> it's something like 70 to 80% of people have a passport. </joey>
<connor> In America it's like 40 or 50? - Yeah, it was so weird for me </connor>
<garnt> going to a country and just meeting people </garnt>
<connor> without a passport. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, everyone just has one in the UK, </garnt>
<joey> everyone I know has one. </joey>
<joey> - In Australia as well, almost everyone has one. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess it's just like a difference in culture. </joey>
<connor> But I couldn't imagine not having a passport. </connor>
<connor> - What are you gonna go and do in the UK? </connor>
<connor> Just go to like a field and be like, sick, </connor>
<connor> this is great vacation. </connor>
<joey> - Or I could get a passport, </joey>
<garnt> go to another country and go to that field. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly, but you know, there's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you seen our beaches? </garnt>
<joey> It's amazing. </joey>
<joey> As someone who's brought up in Brighton, </joey>
<connor> don't we have amazing beaches? </connor>
<connor> You want sand beaches? </connor>
<connor> No, we got stone beaches! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Stone beaches. </connor>
<garnt> - Can't even walk on it. </garnt>
<connor> - UK tourism is the most depressing thing on Earth. </connor>
<connor> It's just shit, it's so shit. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what would you recommend? </joey>
<joey> To someone who's never been to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - When people come to the UK- - Don't. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, go go to London. </joey>
<joey> But that's the thing, is that the reason why I think </joey>
<joey> the UK works as a tourist destination </joey>
<joey> is 'cause you don't know anything about it. </joey>
<joey> When you know about the UK, it's a terrible place. </joey>
<joey> - I think most people's imaginations of the UK </joey>
<joey> is the queen, Harry Potter and... </joey>
<connor> - Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - If you go to London, </connor>
<joey> you get a very sanitized view of the UK </joey>
<joey> and you can have a great time because you only see London, </joey>
<joey> and London is very well kept. </joey>
<joey> - The charming part. </joey>
<connor> - All the fucking money's in London. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say some of the countrysides are pretty good as well. </garnt>
<connor> - But that's why I really appreciate it </connor>
<connor> when I meet people who love castles </connor>
<garnt> and love going around Wales and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Navi] Oxford is fine. </garnt>
<connor> - Oxford's nice, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And honestly, if you wanna go to the countryside though, </garnt>
<joey> I'd say Ireland is better. </joey>
<joey> Ireland's fucking beautiful. </joey>
<joey> I've been to the countryside in Ireland </joey>
<joey> and it's so fucking nice. </joey>
<joey> - Wales is good. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Patriotism showing there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I first found out </connor>
<garnt> that people just didn't live near castles, </garnt>
<joey> I thought that was weird when I first found that out. </joey>
<joey> I live near three castles growing up and I was like. </joey>
<joey> - See out of context, that sounds so fucking privileged. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Why, what are you gonna do with it? </connor>
<connor> What it's not my castle. </connor>
<connor> - Well, no, but that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> If you said that to a Japanese person, they'd be like, </connor>
<joey> what are you, the prince of Wales? </joey>
<connor> - No, it's 'cause there's so many castles in the UK. </connor>
<connor> One of them was very dangerous and rundown </connor>
<connor> and climbing is just a safety hazard. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how it's still allowed, </connor>
<connor> you're allowed to go and do... </connor>
<connor> But there's one really cool castle near me, </connor>
<connor> it's called Conwy Castle. </connor>
<joey> - I feel Wales to castles is very much Japan to temples. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think if you said to someone </joey>
<joey> who has like no idea of like Asian culture </joey>
<joey> or anything like that and said, </joey>
<joey> oh yeah, there's three temples around my house. </joey>
<joey> They'd be like, whoa, you fucking bougie motherfucker. </joey>
<connor> - Well, Japan did have a lot of castles, </connor>
<joey> they were just burnt down. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, most of them are gone. </joey>
<joey> - There is one and there's a really big one in what Kochi, </joey>
<connor> there's a massive one. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - It's really fucking cool. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of them, though, are recreation's. </connor>
<connor> That were built much, much later. </connor>
<connor> I think there's only like a handful of castles </connor>
<joey> from that time that are still standing to this day. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of the ones in the UK are run down as well. </connor>
<joey> Out of the three near me, one of them is well kept </joey>
<joey> and that's mainly for tourist reasons. </joey>
<joey> The other two are completely run down and just like, </joey>
<connor> but it's cool that it's a bunch of rubble, </connor>
<joey> you're like, sick. </joey>
<joey> - But you can buy that, right? </joey>
<connor> You can purchase that as property? </connor>
<connor> - Some of them. - Some of them. </connor>
<garnt> - Normally the big ones you can't, </garnt>
<garnt> they're normally heritage sites. </garnt>
<garnt> So, you can't buy them, yhey're like public. </garnt>
<connor> - And at that point, </connor>
<connor> people who buy it just buy it for a flex. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause who actually lives in a castle nowadays? </garnt>
<connor> - I believe I read something about France or something </connor>
<connor> has the most abandoned castles </connor>
<connor> and the most castles for sale out of any country. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - Apparently you can just buy chateaus </connor>
<connor> and castles and all nonsense. </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty bougie. </connor>
<garnt> - All right, you say UK is good for travel. </garnt>
<connor> - No I didn't, I never said that. </connor>
<connor> - Well, what did you say? </connor>
<joey> You say, come to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - You say just go to London. </joey>
<connor> - Go to London? - Go to London, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, okay, genuine question. </connor>
<connor> Someone's coming to travel to the UK, </connor>
<garnt> you wanna show them British culture, </garnt>
<connor> where'd you take them to? </connor>
<connor> - First of all, the one question you have to ask someone </connor>
<garnt> who comes to the UK, is do you drink alcohol? </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you drink? </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if you don't, you're gonna have a bad time. </garnt>
<joey> - If you love a beer, you love drinking with people. </joey>
<joey> You can have a two week trip and you'll have a great time. </joey>
<connor> If you don't drink alcohol, here's a three day criteria. </connor>
<joey> - If you don't drink alcohol, I hope you like castles. </joey>
<connor> - You know, I genuinely think, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can do nearly everything in London </connor>
<garnt> that's worth seeing in one day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, one or two days. </garnt>
<garnt> - Three days if you don't wanna rush. </garnt>
<connor> But all the major things </connor>
<connor> are within walking distance of each other. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you take them to like the tourist sites </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, very fast, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> here's Buckingham Palace, have a look. </connor>
<joey> All right, here's the Big Ben have a look, </joey>
<joey> it's shit, don't pay it, it's like $90 to go on it. </joey>
<joey> It's a rip off, don't do it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, when we went it was in fucking scaffolding. </joey>
<joey> So I didn't even get to see it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh and London Eye, sorry London Eye's shit. </joey>
<joey> Big Ben looks pretty cool actually, I like that. </joey>
<joey> But you know, normally it's like, you wanna see Big Ben? </joey>
<joey> We can go and drink in the park in front of Big Ben, </joey>
<joey> you wanna do that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's cool. </joey>
<joey> - There's the arcade that's now closing. </joey>
<connor> - It's closed now, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Is that the one with Shrek at the front? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [All] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's an arcade. </joey>
<joey> - It was a Namco Funscape, there was a shit arcade, </joey>
<joey> it was all right, but it's closing. </joey>
<joey> But it was the only arcade. </joey>
<joey> What else can you do in London? </joey>
<joey> - Dunno. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe take them on the boat. </joey>
<joey> - On the boat? </joey>
<joey> - So you know how there's public transport, </joey>
<joey> there's the tube? </joey>
<joey> Part of the network is a boat. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like a ferry system? </joey>
<joey> - That you can just cross the, yeah, it goes from, </joey>
<garnt> I think, Greenwich to Westminster or something? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Greenwich, I really like taking people to Greenwich. </garnt>
<connor> Greenwich is a really nice area. </connor>
<connor> You can go and I can be like, </connor>
<connor> look, here's where time star is. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's all I know about Greenwich. </joey>
<connor> - It's a very nice area actually, it's really well done. </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] There's a warship in Belfast, in front of the. </connor>
<connor> - Belfast's like six hours away, </connor>
<garnt> you can't go to the Belfast. </garnt>
<connor> - [Navi] The warship. </connor>
<garnt> - The Cutty Sark. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Navi] It's right in front of the, not palace, </garnt>
<joey> right next to the bridge. </joey>
<joey> - Greenwich? </joey>
<connor> - [Navi] It's not Greenwich. </connor>
<garnt> - You're talking about the HMS Belfast? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. - Don't know that one either. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you go to Greenwich as well, </garnt>
<joey> there's a massive boat that's been restored on land, </joey>
<joey> a pirate ship, it's fucking massive. </joey>
<joey> - Damn. </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] Apparently they actually collabed with Azur Lane. </joey>
<joey> - The UK government should just hire me, I'll make right. </joey>
<joey> - What would you add? </joey>
<connor> - Spoons, go to Wetherspoons. </connor>
<garnt> - Tesco meal deal? - Tesco. </garnt>
<connor> - Tesco meal deal. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I would take them to Spoons as well. </connor>
<joey> - Spoons is great. </joey>
<joey> - You did take us to Spoons. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I did! </connor>
<garnt> I should just ask you Joey, where did we take you again? </garnt>
<connor> - No, we did shit with Joey, it was terrible. </connor>
<joey> - We went to the Shrek arcade and Spoons. </joey>
<garnt> - We went to the fucking gaming bar as well. </garnt>
<joey> - The gaming bar. </joey>
<garnt> - The gaming bar. - It was terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was literally just a pub with a Wi in it. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - You can game in that bar. </connor>
<connor> - British culture, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's sick. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like pubs in London </garnt>
<garnt> are where all the best food are as well. </garnt>
<joey> It's all the best food. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, fair, that pub did have some good food. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause the way I see it, right, because the way I see it, </garnt>
<garnt> when I go travel to a place, </garnt>
<connor> I very rarely want to go to the big tourist spots. </connor>
<connor> - I Just wanna eat. </connor>
<connor> - I want cool places to see, but just like not the, </connor>
<connor> here's just a landmark </connor>
<connor> that everyone takes a fucking picture around. </connor>
<garnt> I just want cool local places. </garnt>
<garnt> And as someone who lived in London for close to three years, </garnt>
<garnt> if it doesn't revolve around alcohol, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know the cool places to take people. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, there's Afternoon Tea? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh Afternoon Tea, actually that. </garnt>
<connor> - The home of Afternoon Tea. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course, of course, </connor>
<joey> I completely forgot about Afternoon Tea. </joey>
<joey> That's pretty much the only part of like British food </joey>
<garnt> that I'm just like, yep, Afternoon Tea fucking slaps. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair, I feel Australia would be the exact same thing </joey>
<joey> if it wasn't for the fact that we have </joey>
<connor> some of the best beaches in the world. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause at least we can take you to the beach. </connor>
<connor> - You got it easy, man. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but if you don't like beaches, </joey>
<joey> then I hope you like drinking. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we're going to be doing a lot of that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It's kinda hard, I've had friends, </connor>
<connor> normally Americans, who are like, no, I don't drink, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, I honestly don't know what to do. </joey>
<joey> I can show you Big Ben. </joey>
<joey> - I have the same thing when friends come to Australia </joey>
<connor> and I have to take them around </connor>
<connor> like a couple of times I'm like, </connor>
<connor> do you wanna see Sydney Opera House? </connor>
<connor> - I swear, I'm not an alcoholic, but it's just the culture. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, it is. - I don't know what to do. </garnt>
<connor> - That's kinda why I wanted to move out of England </connor>
<connor> because it just felt like if you didn't drink, </connor>
<connor> then there was nothing else to do to have fun </connor>
<garnt> or just like chill out, that's a big thing. </garnt>
<joey> - No one does anything on weekdays in the UK. </joey>
<joey> Like weekdays is strictly for working </joey>
<joey> and then going home and being depressed. </joey>
<joey> That's all you do. </joey>
<joey> - Now, I feel that's just. </joey>
<connor> - No one goes out in the UK, it's always the weekend. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really, like even after work? </joey>
<connor> - No, no one really goes out. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I agree with that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's normally older people, </connor>
<connor> they normally will go off to the pub after work </connor>
<connor> when they're like 40s, 'cause of their lot. </connor>
<connor> - I would have you know, </connor>
<garnt> some people will go to the pub after work. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I know, if I worked in office, I would love to go. </connor>
<joey> But as a YouTuber, no one wanted to go out in the weekday. </joey>
<joey> So it was an absolute uphill battle trying to get people </joey>
<joey> to do anything in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - So you have to wait till the weekend. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, so I never did anything during the week. </joey>
<joey> I just worked on videos, I think, and played video games. </joey>
<joey> I don't really know what I did. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't know what I did in London. </joey>
<joey> - What did I do? </joey>
<joey> - What did I do in London? </joey>
<joey> I don't know, went to coffee? </joey>
<joey> We have a lot of good cafes. </joey>
<connor> - Do we? </connor>
<connor> - Compared to Europe? </connor>
<joey> - We are, we were in Europe. </joey>
<joey> - You guys are European. </joey>
<joey> - We were in Europe. </joey>
<joey> - Well, we're not in Europe anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause it's easy to get stuff </garnt>
<garnt> from like Italy and whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's true, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the one thing I miss about, that sucks about Japan </garnt>
<joey> is that importing anything from Europe </joey>
<joey> is like 20 times the price. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a block of cheese </joey>
<joey> that I would pay 10 pounds for in the UK </joey>
<connor> imported from France, </connor>
<connor> which is seen as like a luxury, expensive item. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, fucking first time I was in Australia, </joey>
<connor> it's like, literally, off the side of the planet. </connor>
<connor> - It's depressing, I bought a wine bottle and I looked at it </connor>
<joey> and it was like 30 pounds in the UK. </joey>
<joey> And it was like 90 pounds here in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, fuck. - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Which is such a flip to whenever, </joey>
<joey> well, when someone's gonna come visit us in Japan. </joey>
<joey> Because like when a friend comes to visit in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> you're just like, what kind of experience do you want? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like you can do anything. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you wanna see nature or do you wanna see the city? </joey>
<joey> Do you wanna see culture? </joey>
<connor> - But do you ever get sick ushering people around Japan? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you were always the go-to guy </joey>
<connor> who had to take people around Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I was, but after a while, it depends who I'm with. </joey>
<joey> If I'm with a person who I'm not super buddy-buddy with, </joey>
<connor> and obviously I want them to have a good time </connor>
<connor> and have a good impression. </connor>
<connor> But if I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> it's just like a fucking mate from school or whatever, </connor>
<connor> then I used to do this thing </connor>
<connor> where I would take them to all these places, </connor>
<joey> but then pretend I couldn't speak a word of Japanese </joey>
<joey> just to piss them off. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna be the translator this week, so you know what? </joey>
<joey> Let's see how you like it. </joey>
<joey> So, we would go to a restaurant </joey>
<joey> and I would be reading the menu </joey>
<joey> and I'll be like (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> So, you just fucking pretend that I was foreign. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause if I don't speak Japanese, </connor>
<connor> they'll never fucking know. </connor>
<connor> So that was just like, come on Joey, just fucking help us. </connor>
<connor> Help me translate this fucking thing. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, (speaks in foreign language), I'm sorry. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Japan is just like local guide, easy mode. </garnt>
<garnt> You go to a fucking family mart and they blow their minds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<joey> I just take 'em like, Ikebukuro and it's done for the day. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know right. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so easy. </joey>
<garnt> - One place in Tokyo, and that's their entire itinerary </garnt>
<connor> done for the day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, honestly. </connor>
<joey> - Take them to a ramen place, though, oh my gosh ramen. </joey>
<joey> - Well that's the thing, if you take them to like, Shibuya, </joey>
<garnt> you're easily like, two days you can spend there. </garnt>
<garnt> If you take them to Akihabara, that's a whole day again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Akihabara is several days. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - If you go there for one day and they're like, </joey>
<garnt> "Can we go back to Akihabara please?" </garnt>
<connor> - I miss when I thought Akihabara </connor>
<connor> was like super fun and amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't think so anymore? - I miss that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it's just 'cause all the figures, </garnt>
<connor> you know that the price is always cheaper elsewhere. </connor>
<joey> - I've just found that the more times </joey>
<joey> I've gone to Akihabara, the more I realized </joey>
<connor> that there was just so much cool, hidden shit there. </connor>
<connor> That really, if you're not there with someone </connor>
<connor> who knows the area really well, </connor>
<joey> it really just does seem like </joey>
<joey> here's the place to buy anime figurines. </joey>
<garnt> Here's the place to buy weird shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I just don't have the time to explre it anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Also, nearly all the restaurants I've been to in Akihabara </connor>
<garnt> are severely disappointing. - Fucking awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean awful, awful. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I said awes, awful. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had pretty the worst meals in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> consistently, in Akihabara. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know why, I think 'cause it's just on the front </garnt>
<connor> and then everyone's like, come in our store. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's the thing, no one really thinks to themselves, </joey>
<joey> oh, I want a really nice meal, let's go to Akihabara. </joey>
<joey> - Also, I hate the maids who are like, </joey>
<joey> come in our store, please, please! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that is really annoying. </joey>
<connor> - And they're like, (speaks in Japanese). </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, fuck off! </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - If it's (speaks in Japanese), they'd give this, </joey>
<joey> fuck off! </joey>
<garnt> - I'm British, I say to my head, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, please leave me alone. </connor>
<garnt> - Human interaction, get outta here, get outta here. </garnt>
<joey> - Be gone (). </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - One time we walked past and there was a maid </connor>
<connor> that was like, Joey? </connor>
<connor> Do you remember that? - No. </connor>
<connor> - What do you say, you were there, she started screaming, </connor>
<connor> like one of the maids. </connor>
<joey> - Oh the maid who recognized me? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I don't remember. </joey>
<joey> How do you remember this? </joey>
<joey> - Wait, no actually what happened was, I was with you, </joey>
<joey> we were walking and I saw the girl looking at you </joey>
<joey> and we kept on walking </joey>
<joey> and then I just heard her go, "Joey?". </joey>
<joey> - Oh yes, I do remember! </joey>
<connor> - And I feel like you didn't pay any attention, </connor>
<connor> you were like, whatever and just kept walking. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And then I was like, (speaks in Japanese) </connor>
<joey> - I do remember that actually because it's like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I heard her say my name, but I thought like, </joey>
<joey> I didn't hear it as my name until I walked past her. </joey>
<connor> And then I processed, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I think she was calling my name. </connor>
<connor> But then at that point it was too late to turn around </connor>
<connor> and be like, me? </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna be that guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm famous, yes. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, I'll just be the cool guy and keep walking. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel so unguarded whenever I get recognized in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I'm just like what, what? </joey>
<joey> - It really catches me of guard. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it really is scary. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I know like, one, it's surprising </joey>
<joey> to hear someone speak English as well here </joey>
<joey> or just on the streets, and two, someone who speaks English </joey>
<joey> and also recognizes you. </joey>
<joey> And it's, especially I think, </joey>
<joey> since Trash Taste has started as well. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know how I'm gonna handle </joey>
<garnt> going to my next anime convention and there's just gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> like, 70 million people calling me Grant, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not gonna be able to tell the difference. </garnt>
<connor> Like if they're just meming </connor>
<garnt> or if they actually think my name is Grant. </garnt>
<connor> - I hope at the airport, </connor>
<garnt> they're like welcome Garnt, Grant, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Welcome, Grant. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause people already fuck up my username. </joey>
<joey> They're like, yo, you're the anime guy, right? </joey>
<joey> Or it's like, your the animae dude. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I can't wait to just be called </joey>
<joey> all these fucking nicknames. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, do you actually know I am, </joey>
<joey> or are you just like taking the piss? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause sometimes I don't even know. </connor>
<joey> Like when a person comes up to me and goes, </joey>
<connor> are you the anime guy? </connor>
<joey> I don't know if I'm supposed to go, I'm the Anime Man, </joey>
<connor> or if I'm supposed to go nah. </connor>
<joey> - Who's that, who's that? </joey>
<connor> - I'm not that guy. </connor>
<joey> - Who is that? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know who that is. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know who that guy is. </garnt>
<joey> - Why hello there, it is I, Anime Zone. </joey>
<joey> And while Connor's not here, </joey>
<garnt> I'm going to hijack this podcast to talk about anime. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause you know what? </joey>

<garnt> Thank you to Crunchyroll for sponsoring us today, </garnt>
<joey> back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, have you guys ever been recognized </joey>
<joey> in your home country? </joey>
<joey> - Have we spoke about this on Trash Taste before? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like it's gonna be even more insane now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tell us Garnt, tell us, tell us, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Tell me when you've been recognized in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you actually been? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've been recognized once, I feel, </garnt>
<connor> I think in an Argos in Brighton. </connor>
<connor> - Argos? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Holy fuck. - What's an Argos? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh God, it's a terrible store. </garnt>
<connor> So it's, the whole gimmick of this store </connor>
<connor> is that you don't actually get to look at the products </connor>
<connor> due to the warehouse, </connor>
<connor> but you get to look at the massive 10 page, </connor>
<connor> no not 10 page, 400 page book, and you get to pick. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, is this the place where you were talking </joey>
<garnt> about like a Christmas gift or whatever? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's fucking terrible. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, basically just imagine Amazon. </joey>
<joey> - IRL. - Except, you have to go there </joey>
<garnt> and you don't have a computer screen to browse everything. </garnt>
<garnt> You just have a massive book. </garnt>
<connor> - Lord knows how they're still in business with that model. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds very outdated. </joey>
<garnt> - It's kinda like the Blockbuster now. </garnt>
<connor> - So, you got recognized in Argos? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's really weird, </connor>
<joey> just one of the cashiers recognize me, it's not </joey>
<joey> a very exciting story. - Give you discount? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? - They give you a discount? </joey>
<joey> - No. - Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever gotten that before? </joey>
<connor> Where someone working at an establishment recognize you </connor>
<joey> and you got a thing out of it? </joey>
<connor> - No, but if they do, I'm very open to that. </connor>
<garnt> - I've heard stories about, now, about some of, </garnt>
<garnt> well, Sydney just went back to America </garnt>
<garnt> and apparently she was just in a bar and she got recognized. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh sick. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit, but that's not good, that's not good, </garnt>
<garnt> it's Sydney's content. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. Well, no, she got recognized </garnt>
<connor> because she was obviously my fiance </connor>
<garnt> and she was just, and all the guy said was just, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, are you Sydney?", and she's like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> "Oh, where's Garnt?". </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> She's like, "Oh, he didn't come here". </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "Oh, say hi to Garnt for me". </joey>
<joey> - Ah, no! - Ah, no! </joey>
<joey> - Don't do that! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate it when people would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> say hi to Joey and Garnt for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, and what? </garnt>
<joey> What am I gonna say? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, by the way, a random dude I just met says hi. </connor>
<connor> It's like, what do we say to that? </connor>
<garnt> Look, we appreciate you guys coming up to us and saying, hi. </garnt>
<garnt> That's cool and all. </garnt>
<garnt> But don't make us be the messenger for another person, </garnt>
<joey> no one appreciates that. </joey>
<connor> - You know, the 800th century, I'm not a messenger. </connor>
<joey> I'm not like here to convey messages for you. </joey>
<joey> I got recognized one time at midnight on a bus, </joey>
<joey> which is terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> - I was going to the gym. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, the bus went right outside my house to the gym, </joey>
<joey> it was perfect, it was 24 hours as well so it was good. </joey>
<joey> And I was on my way back from the gym. </joey>
<joey> I was extremely sweaty </joey>
<joey> and there's only two people on this bus, me and him. </joey>
<joey> And he was right at the back </joey>
<joey> wearing a hoodie in the back, just like. </joey>
<joey> - Ah, shit. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, what the fuck. </joey>
<joey> Then I'm sitting close to the front on the second level </joey>
<joey> and I'm just listening to music. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, mmhmm. </joey>
<joey> And then I feel like on my back, </joey>
<joey> like a tapping. - Well, that's scary. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like (startles). </joey>
<joey> I'm like what, what? </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Are you Cdawg?". </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm Cdawg, what's up?". </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Love your videos". </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Thanks, man". </joey>
<joey> And he just walked off. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I was like, I was like, what? </joey>
<joey> - That's so scary. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, what? </joey>
<joey> He was like still hoodie and everything on </joey>
<joey> when he came up to me. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Are you Cdawg?". </joey>
<joey> - Just brick shithouse. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he was massive. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, "Ah, thanks man nice." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, this is my house. </joey>
<joey> - I got recognized in Akihabara. </joey>
<connor> Used to get recognized a lot, obviously. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, every time we used to go with you there. </connor>
<garnt> - I always, that's when my people are. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like Akihabara's like a cheat code. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's like saying you got recognized </joey>
<connor> at an anime convention. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because it's also, Akihabara's surprisingly </connor>
<connor> has the most foreigners. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it does. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it's one of the most sensationalized, </garnt>
<garnt> wacky to look at places in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was recognized, I get recognized </garnt>
<garnt> pretty much every time I go to Akihabara. </garnt>
<garnt> But the one time I went to, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, running a little short on my hentai. </garnt>
<connor> Might pop into a Melonbooks, </connor>
<connor> which is a store where you can buy hentai </connor>
<connor> and peruse the goods. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, are you The Anime Man? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and as I was perusing through some stuff, </connor>
<joey> I got a tap on the shoulder and he's like, "Are you Joey?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like. </joey>
<connor> - I thought you were gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> the lowest section's over there. </connor>
<joey> - Wrong place man. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Well, I'm like, yeah, I am, hi. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh no, of all... </joey>
<joey> And I was like holding a doujin I was about to buy as well. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, worst timing and he had like a bag as well. </joey>
<connor> So he obviously just like finished at the cash register. </connor>
<connor> And the guy was like, "What are you doing here?". </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What the fuck do you think I'm doing here?" </connor>
<connor> - I jack off, we all jack off. </connor>
<connor> - Like really, are you sure you're a fan of me? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if you are, </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't know exactly what I am doing here. </connor>
<garnt> I am holding the thing I am about to buy, you can see that. </garnt>
<garnt> So all I said was just, just buying some hentai? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "Ah, sick dude, all right bey!". </garnt>
<joey> And he just walked out. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like, what kind of interaction </garnt>
<joey> can you have in that place? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I have exactly the same experience, </joey>
<joey> 'cause the place I can recognized the most is that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, is that Melonbooks, right? </joey>
<garnt> - It's that store! </garnt>
<joey> - I'd be recognized like three times in a Melonbooks. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, why? </joey>
<connor> Is it just known? </connor>
<connor> - Is that just a doujin store? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Melonbooks is like a huge. </joey>
<joey> - It's a complete doujin store. </joey>
<joey> Basically when Sydney's just running out of ideas </joey>
<connor> for content, she just goes there </connor>
<connor> and she's like, oh, this shit. </connor>
<connor> - And then the cashier's like, is Garnt with you? </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Melonbooks and Toranoana </connor>
<joey> are the two big, big hentai stores in Akihabara. </joey>
<connor> - I always get recognized, </connor>
<connor> and I haven't been recognized often but when I do, </connor>
<joey> it's always when I look like shit. </joey>
<joey> It's never when I've made an effort to look good, </joey>
<joey> it's never in the JoJo suit. </joey>
<joey> It's never when I've got my drip game on. </joey>
<joey> It's when I'm in fucking sweatpants. </joey>
<garnt> - But like how often. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, how often are you in (). </connor>
<garnt> - How often is that though Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I, every single day I leave the house. </connor>
<joey> I remember one time I went to a Sainsbury's near me, </joey>
<garnt> which is just a normal supermarket. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was wearing sweatpants, flip flops, you know, </joey>
<joey> the shit which I actually don't even normally do that. </joey>
<joey> I would normally put the effort in to wear jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, no, I lie. </joey>
<joey> This is back when I thought that wearing jeans was a luxury. </joey>
<garnt> If I was working. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is it a luxury? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause those are work pants. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually I'm gonna, I'm just gonna go on a detour, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was a story anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> But I basically got recognized in sweat pants, not funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this why you refuse to wear washed jeans? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it's a luxury? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, that's a different shit take. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, that's not a shit take, let's go right there. </garnt>
<joey> So I had this thing for a very long time where </joey>
<joey> this isn't a meeting, this is a general thing. </joey>
<joey> I used to just only wear like sweatpants when I was at home. </joey>
<joey> If I wasn't leaving the house, I wouldn't wear jeans, </joey>
<joey> I would just wear sweat pants. </joey>
<joey> - I still do that. </joey>
<connor> - But now I changed my mind. </connor>
<connor> And now I only wear jeans in the house. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> How do you bring yourself to do that? </joey>
<connor> - I do that. - What? </connor>
<joey> - Because what happened. - I always wear jeans. </joey>
<joey> - What happened, is that I started just feeling like shit, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like not working. </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, maybe if I like dress like I'm not slob, </joey>
<connor> I might work a little better. </connor>
<garnt> - You laugh but it's a real fucking thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it actually worked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I wear jeans not because I want to, </garnt>
<joey> but because it's the only way I'm gonna look good. </joey>
<connor> - But when you're wearing a pair of jeans nicely, </connor>
<connor> they feel better than anything. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like my day hasn't started until I put on my jeans. </garnt>
<connor> Sometimes I try to work. </connor>
<garnt> - Like an American fighting for freedom. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just haven't started my day </garnt>
<connor> until I put on my denim jeans. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, sometimes I try to work </garnt>
<joey> and I'm in like sweat pants </joey>
<joey> or sometimes just in my fucking boxes </joey>
<joey> 'cause I sleep in my boxes </joey>
<joey> and I just don't get anything done. </joey>
<joey> As soon as I put on my jeans, the day has started. </joey>
<garnt> - Amen. - I am ready to work. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I just wake up and go, time to work, </joey>
<joey> and then I just start working. </joey>
<joey> - If you go to jeans. - Mind over matter man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but if you go to jeans. </joey>
<joey> - You just work harder. </joey>
<joey> - And like one time I even went so far </joey>
<joey> as to start wearing nice shirts. </joey>
<joey> - Like a suit shirt. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but the suit shirts when I was making videos. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was convinced that this is the next step </joey>
<joey> to increasing my productivity. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, turns out it didn't work, I just hated it. </joey>
<joey> But I found the happy medium at jeans and a shirt. </joey>
<connor> I felt like if I can dress enough. </connor>
<joey> - Are we talking like a t-shirt or a college shirts? </joey>
<connor> - No like this. </connor>
<joey> - Oh , yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I think the sweatpants were the big player, </connor>
<connor> because I basically got to the mindset of, </connor>
<garnt> I wanna wear outfits that I could just go out </garnt>
<joey> to any social gathering or I can wear this to anywhere. </joey>
<joey> And so, I felt like it helped my productivity. </joey>
<joey> So if you work at home a lot </joey>
<garnt> and you've gotten into the habit </garnt>
<connor> of sweatpants-ing all the time, maybe give a try. </connor>
<connor> - Just try wearing what you would wear to work. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, but what would you do during the summer then? </joey>
<connor> - I still wear jeans. </connor>
<connor> - You still wear full on jeans? </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna wear jorts. - Are you gonna wear jorts? </connor>
<joey> - Fuck no. </joey>
<garnt> Jeans, AC blasting. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I wear whatever I would wear </garnt>
<joey> to the Trash Tatse office. </joey>
<joey> That's basically my dress code at home. </joey>
<joey> But I would never wear anything too comfy, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - Comfort is the enemy of productivity. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, 'cause if I'm wearing sweatpants, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I should be in my bedroom </garnt>
<joey> or on the couch. - Yeah, no I get that. </joey>
<garnt> - Watching TV just chilling out. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing I do do in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> to get me into the work mode if I'm at home all day </garnt>
<connor> is that I don't wear like my pajama shirt. </connor>
<connor> I like change to a different shirt. </connor>
<connor> - What's a pajama shirt? </connor>
<connor> You have a pajama shirt? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just like old shirts that I don't wear. </connor>
<connor> - You wear shirts to bed? </connor>
<garnt> Why don't you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I wear shirts to bed. </garnt>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't wanna. - Why do people do this? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't wanna be naked. </connor>
<connor> - Because it just feels. </connor>
<connor> - I wear boxers, just boxes. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, It just doesn't feel comfortable. </joey>
<joey> It feels like, unless I'm in a sleeping bag, </joey>
<garnt> I don't have enough cover over me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel really bare. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And unprotected. </garnt>
<joey> - Like boxers? Boxers I'm fine with. </joey>
<joey> - I love using the body parts as temperature control. </joey>
<connor> So I put some out, put some in, </connor>
<connor> depending on how cold or hot I need to be. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, but do you, do you wear boxers to bed? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, sometimes naked, sometimes boxers. </connor>
<garnt> - See, I need wear boxers to bed. </garnt>
<garnt> Sleeping completely naked just feels weird. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a getting used to thing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the nut sack is a very delicate thing </connor>
<joey> to kind of like. </joey>
<joey> (laugh) </joey>
<joey> You laugh, but that's the main problem. </joey>
<joey> Your nuts go everywhere and sometimes </joey>
<connor> they're more elastic than other times. </connor>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes you just don't want your nut sack </garnt>
<garnt> rubbing against your leg. </garnt>
<garnt> You know like, I dunno, for me. </garnt>
<joey> - Are your nuts so huge </joey>
<joey> that they're like a fucking sack of potatoes, </joey>
<joey> like oh fuck it's gone away. </joey>
<connor> - I've got to forklift them out of the way. </connor>
<connor> - When I'm not wearing a shirt to sleep, </connor>
<garnt> it just feels weird to feel my own skin on my skin. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I get that. </joey>
<garnt> Like you know, it's exactly the same thing. </garnt>
<connor> - But the only time I will. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck, you've been brainwashed. </connor>
<connor> - The only time where I will go to bed without a shirt on </connor>
<joey> is if it's excruciatingly hot, </joey>
<joey> to the point where even the AC on blast </joey>
<joey> isn't gonna do it for me. - What? </joey>
<garnt> - To me, I need some fabric on me </garnt>
<joey> to stop myself from touching myself. </joey>
<garnt> - Use the bedsheets. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it's an embrace. </garnt>
<garnt> You're lightly embraced by the shirt. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, go to sleep. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like an extra layer of skin that you're not, </garnt>
<connor> that sounded really like. </connor>
<connor> - Epidermis 2.0 right here. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like you're just giving me a very shit reason </connor>
<connor> as to why you wear a shirt to bed. </connor>
<joey> - It's comfortable, end of story. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand why you would feel uncomfortable </connor>
<garnt> without a shirt on. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then another thing, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes if I'm not wearing a shirt, </garnt>
<garnt> my body gets even hotter. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you have like a natural body temperature </garnt>
<garnt> and if it's like skin on skin, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes it's like a loop system </garnt>
<garnt> where it warms itself up a bit more. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if that's just me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's bullshit, </garnt>
<connor> I think you've got insulation with more shirt. </connor>
<joey> - It's like an eddy current up here. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Surely the shirt keeps in the heat more, no? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I mean like insulation works both ways, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you put, if you put a jacket on a snowman, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It insulates the heat in, it insulates the cold in. </garnt>
<joey> - They actually say to preserve body heat, </joey>
<joey> like in super cold temperatures when you sleep, </joey>
<joey> it's actually better to sleep naked than to wear something. </joey>
<connor> - I just, why wouldn't you wanna. </connor>
<garnt> I just think that you're meant to sleep naked. </garnt>
<garnt> I juts thought that's what you're supposed to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where'd you get this idea from? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] The fucking cavemen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't that how God intended? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, God sleeps naked. </joey>
<garnt> - Why wear clothes then? </garnt>
<joey> - It just seems like a lot more effort </joey>
<joey> to be wearing clothes to bed, why are you complicating it? </joey>
<joey> - Effort? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just go naked. </joey>
<joey> - How hard is it to put a shirt on for you? </joey>
<connor> - I just think why are you adding shirts into an equation </connor>
<connor> that doesn't need it? You know. </connor>
<connor> - Why do you use blankets then? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, question then. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, why need blankets? </connor>
<connor> - All right, here's a question then. </connor>
<connor> - Why not just sleep on a slab of rock? </connor>
<joey> - No, I have a serious question. </joey>
<joey> - So then when you start doing the business, </joey>
<joey> don't you just throw the shirt off? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, that just seems like a lot of work. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm always ready. </connor>
<garnt> - It's two seconds, it's just whoop, you're done. </garnt>
<connor> - When you jack off, do you wear a shirt? </connor>
<joey> - Depends where I am. </joey>
<garnt> - It's never really part of the equation of jacking off. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, do I have my shirt on? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I'm like the Michellin man </connor>
<joey> when I'm jacking off wearing a shirt, </joey>
<joey> I feel like I'm constricted. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, fucking hell, get this shirt off me. </connor>
<joey> - Do you fucking bulk up when you. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you never done the business with a shirt on? </garnt>
<connor> - I have, I don't like it. </connor>
<connor> It feels like I'm in some kind of like constriction. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like it at all. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't like it? </joey>
<joey> - No, it feels dreadful. </joey>
<connor> - I don't mind it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes you need to, something it's nice. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a reason why, in porn, they take the short off. </connor>
<connor> It's 'cause you want to get like. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's because they're on fucking camera mate. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but also. - Are you on camera? </connor>
<joey> - I might be. </joey>
<joey> Don't know what I'm into. </joey>
<joey> - Gotta know I'm fucking. </joey>
<joey> - Next sponsor. </joey>
<joey> But it's also like when you're pooping sometimes, </joey>
<joey> you have to take your shirt off. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's more of just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - The same kind of energy. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, that's the thing, if it gets intense </joey>
<garnt> I'll take the shirt off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not every poop, you need to take your shirt off. </garnt>
<connor> - I would prefer if possible. </connor>
<garnt> - Speak for yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - When you wake up, right, and you have the first poop, </joey>
<connor> do you take the shirt off when you do it? </connor>
<garnt> Or do you just like to. - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I keep it on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the shirt-taking-off-poops </garnt>
<joey> are for the poops that fight back. </joey>
<connor> It's when you need to like, </connor>
<garnt> you need that extra push and that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Those are the poops that are like, no, I'm staying here. </garnt>
<connor> The ones in the morning are kind of just like, </connor>
<joey> all right, it was a good night. </joey>
<joey> - I generally prefer to just take it off when I poop anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Not during the day, if I'm out in a public restroom. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, time to undress. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Connor goes for a poop and just </joey>
<connor> and he takes off the JoJo suit, puts it over, </connor>
<garnt> takes off the tie, takes off the shirt. </garnt>
<connor> - And I'd still poop faster than Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, it's just a placebo, right? </joey>
<joey> I just feel more comfortable wearing a shirt to bed. </joey>
<joey> I dunno what it is. </joey>
<connor> - I think you've nerfed yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - In what way have we nerfed ourselves? </garnt>
<garnt> - How? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like you've nerfed yourself. </garnt>
<connor> - No, 'cause I can poop without any requirements. </connor>
<joey> - You know what it also is as well? </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't sound like that. </connor>
<connor> Because it sounds like the requirement is </connor>
<connor> that you need to take a shirt off. </connor>
<connor> You need to have nothing on. </connor>
<connor> - I just prefer it. </connor>
<connor> - That's literally a requirement. </connor>
<garnt> I can sleep naked, I just prefer to have a shirt on.. </garnt>
<connor> - What of you're stranded without a shirt. </connor>
<garnt> - Then I'll sleep with my shirt off. </garnt>
<connor> He's the reason. </connor>
<connor> - But you'll be complaining the whole time. </connor>
<garnt> - He's the reason as well though, </garnt>
<garnt> because I've actually experienced this </garnt>
<garnt> where in the middle of the night, we're in Japan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Earthquakes, right? </garnt>
<garnt> They happened all the fucking time, right? </garnt>
<connor> If there's a massive earthquake in the middle of the night, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna be that weirdo running out of my house, </connor>
<connor> butt fucking naked. </connor>
<connor> - You have time to grab your clothes. </connor>
<joey> - Well the why don't you just wear the shirt </joey>
<joey> at that point, then, if you have the time </joey>
<joey> to wear a shirt escaping from an earthquake, </joey>
<connor> why not just sleep with it. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not Jason Bourne, </joey>
<connor> I don't need to be ready for combat situations </connor>
<joey> every fucking night. </joey>
<joey> I haven't got a drawer full of passports ready to go </joey>
<joey> in case I need to be deported. </joey>
<connor> This t-shirt is on the floor, </connor>
<connor> this one extra second of putting on the t-shirt, </connor>
<connor> which I can do on the way to the elevator or some shit. </connor>
<connor> I don't need to. </connor>
<joey> - On the way to an elevator in an earthquake. </joey>
<connor> - Nothing is, I'm not walking downstairs. </connor>
<garnt> - I just have this mental image of just like, </garnt>
<garnt> if an earthquake happens when Connor is either sleeping </garnt>
<garnt> or on the toilet, it's just gonna be </garnt>
<joey> that scene from Borat out all over again. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Connor just emerges butt naked. </joey>
<joey> - Completely butt naked. </joey>
<joey> - If I'm shitting in the middle of an earthquake, </joey>
<joey> I'm taking my chances, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna carry on doing what I'm doing. </joey>
<joey> I'm not, why would I run out? </joey>
<joey> I feel like running out is just a stupid idea. </joey>
<joey> Just stay in your house. </joey>
<connor> Maybe, yeah, if you die, you die. </connor>
<joey> - No, it is a very specific situation. </joey>
<garnt> - No, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - When we evacuated in LA, </joey>
<joey> I felt like we did not need to evacuate. </joey>
<connor> I felt like we should've just stayed in our room. </connor>
<connor> I dunno what they what the recommended guideline is, </connor>
<connor> but I'm pretty sure running down to the bottom floor </connor>
<connor> is not the right idea. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] Nor is the elevator. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can't use the elevator. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I ran all the way down. </joey>
<garnt> - Navi ran 51 stories. </garnt>
<joey> - I would say not using the elevator during an earthquake </joey>
<garnt> is probably at the top of things not to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just had shit to do after it, </garnt>
<joey> so I really wanted to get down fast. </joey>
<joey> - Those Chick-fil-A nuggets weren't gonna eat themselves. </joey>
<connor> - That as well. </connor>
<connor> And also, the moment that I was immediately put off </connor>
<connor> going down the stairs, was when we ran past </connor>
<connor> the American family and that guy was acting </connor>
<joey> like we were in a Hollywood movie. </joey>
<joey> And he had like three kids and he was like, </joey>
<joey> kids stay with me, stay with your daddy! </joey>
<joey> We're gonna go down together, as a team, hold hands! </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I'm not being in this guy's movie. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna do my own thing. </joey>
<connor> I don't want to be part of this. </connor>
<connor> That's when I decided that I was not doing the stairs. </connor>
<connor> - It was a pretty tense situation. </connor>
<connor> But the moment I heard that dad say that. </connor>
<joey> I was just like, pfft. </joey>
<connor> - The earthquake had ended, it was like, whatever. </connor>
<joey> I was not really scared anymore. </joey>
<joey> The building was still shaking, </joey>
<joey> but I was like, whatever, it's not a big deal. </joey>
<joey> - The building's built for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the building's built different to withstand it. </joey>
<joey> - To withstand those, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I was pretty confident that we were gonna be fine. </joey>
<connor> So I was like, whatever. </connor>
<connor> I think I'll take the elevator. </connor>
<connor> I realized that. </connor>
<joey> - Don't take emergency advice from Connor. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not recommending it, I just, I'm lazy. </connor>
<joey> - He just does it anyway. </joey>
<joey> - I was just, you know, I felt confident enough </joey>
<joey> that I was gonna be fine. </joey>
<joey> And if I died, you know, sure, </joey>
<joey> I can have my Darwin award in peace, 'cause I'm dead. </joey>
<joey> - I can kind of relate to that in like a tangential sense </joey>
<connor> where you just willingly put your life in danger, </connor>
<connor> just for a bit of convenience. </connor>
<connor> - I don't feel like he was endanger, I didn't feel that way. </connor>
<connor> - Because living in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> this is going on a complete tangent. </connor>
<joey> - Every time you get in the car. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Take your shirt off. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, that's not risking your life, okay? </joey>
<joey> Bangkok is the only place I've lived in </joey>
<connor> where people willingly risked their lives on the daily </connor>
<joey> by taking a motorcycle taxi daily </joey>
<joey> in some of the most dangerous roads in the world </joey>
<joey> just to save yourself 30 minutes of traffic. </joey>
<joey> And we do that on a daily and I do that on a daily. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, that's weird when you think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't really describe </garnt>
<connor> why I just wanted to take the elevator. </connor>
<connor> But I think I just realized, </connor>
<connor> I could either walk down 70 floors of stairs </connor>
<connor> or I could just risk it and take the elevator. </connor>
<connor> And I think at that point in time, to me, </connor>
<connor> taking 70 flights of stairs was not worth my life. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I can't argue against that </joey>
<joey> 'cause I also went in the elevator. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I think it was one of those things where it was like, </connor>
<joey> Connor's going in the elevator. </joey>
<joey> All right if he's stupid enough to risk his life, </joey>
<joey> I guess I feel confident enough where I'll go in with it. </joey>
<garnt> I can blame Connor if I die. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I know that I shouldn't do it, but I did. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we ended up not going down anyway. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so what ended up happening was cosmic justice, </connor>
<connor> is that the elevator to get down, </connor>
<connor> you had to go up to the 70th floor, to the lobby, </connor>
<connor> to then get down and when we got to the 70th floor, </connor>
<connor> they stopped all the elevators. </connor>
<joey> - So basically, we went down about 35 stairs for nothing. </joey>
<garnt> So basically just instant karma. </garnt>
<joey> - Instant karma compilation. </joey>
<joey> - And then we waited 10 minutes </joey>
<joey> and the elevator started working. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then there was no problems. </joey>
<connor> - And I was very delighted by it. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] I literally looked back and was like, </joey>
<joey> where the fuck are they? </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile, Navi was like, went down 70 flights of stairs, </joey>
<joey> turned around, was like. </joey>
<connor> - But you know, when stuff like that happens, </connor>
<connor> I feel like I don't wanna be that guy who's panicking </connor>
<joey> and running around like all these people. </joey>
<joey> - No that's the worst thing to do. </joey>
<joey> I just feel like this is. - Dopey sheep. </joey>
<joey> - Wake up sheeple. </joey>
<joey> - This is how you're inviting a shitty situation to happen. </joey>
<garnt> You know, I also don't wanna try my chances on the road. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause when you leave the hotel, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just facing the road. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to try my chance with stuff falling </garnt>
<joey> or people driving on the road in an earthquake. </joey>
<joey> I was pretty content that my room was fine. </joey>
<connor> I was like, oh whatever. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's the thing, in some situations </joey>
<joey> it's actually more dangerous to go out on the road </joey>
<joey> because in the case with Japan, </joey>
<garnt> we have so much like electrical wiring from the roads </garnt>
<garnt> that if those fall and snap, they can easily electrocute you </garnt>
<joey> fucking traffic signs can come down, hurt you. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like the safest place is just to probably be </garnt>
<connor> on the ground floor. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. - Of a building. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno but you get way more like earthquake vibrations </connor>
<joey> on the first floor. - Do you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the higher up the building, the less you get. </joey>
<joey> You just get swaying if you're up top. </joey>
<joey> And when you're down below </joey>
<connor> you get the fucking violent shaking. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the best thing to do is to just go out </joey>
<joey> into like a really, really open field. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like this is a point in my life </garnt>
<connor> where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I should listen to this advice. </connor>
<connor> - Well, 'cause the really tall buildings </connor>
<joey> are built on like rolling mechanics. </joey>
<joey> So when the building, you fucking experienced it. </joey>
<garnt> - What'd you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - The hotel we stayed in? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's built on rollers so that when the earthquake happens, </connor>
<connor> it starts rolling. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but on the ground floor. </garnt>
<connor> Sometimes you literally don't even feel the earthquake. </connor>
<garnt> Because there's no swaying or anything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - No, 'cause you're getting like </connor>
<connor> the actual fucking earth shaking. </connor>
<garnt> - That's not what it feels like on the ground floor. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it does! </connor>
<connor> - You've had an earthquake on the ground floor, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It feels very violently shaking. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's kind of the same as being on the building. </joey>
<connor> - When I experienced both in Japan, </connor>
<connor> I definitely prefer in LA </connor>
<connor> when the building was just swaying. </connor>
<garnt> I liked that a lot more. </garnt>
<connor> - I was literally on the street </connor>
<garnt> and sometimes I didn't even notice </garnt>
<joey> that there was an earthquake when people will. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there's nothing to like, how can I put this? </joey>
<joey> There's nothing to put your perspective </joey>
<joey> in that you're in an earthquake. </joey>
<garnt> You just feel a bit wobbly. - The floor is moving. </garnt>
<garnt> - The floor doesn't move, it shakes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Does it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It shakes but a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> you can't actually see it moving </garnt>
<garnt> until you look at something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's nothing to ground your perspective. </garnt>
<joey> - Whereas, if you're in a building, </joey>
<joey> you can see other buildings doing this. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't really mind though. </joey>
<garnt> Most of the times, I don't even realize I'm in an earthquake </garnt>
<garnt> until I have something to like ground that perspective. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometime like living in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I just get up, get a head rush, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, ooh, was that an earthquake? </garnt>
<connor> - Like do you ever get that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but because there's so many light earthquakes. </joey>
<joey> But you know when you're getting an earthquake, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it used to be like, just fucking. </connor>
<joey> - My mom has this story of when she was in school, </joey>
<joey> she was like running along the tracks at school. </joey>
<connor> And you know when you're running, </connor>
<connor> your entire world is doing this. </connor>
<connor> So she was running and she was looking </connor>
<connor> at the school building and then she stopped </connor>
<connor> and the building just kept doing this </connor>
<connor> and she realized she was in an earthquake. </connor>
<connor> And she didn't realize until she stopped </connor>
<connor> because to her perspective, it's already going up and down. </connor>
<joey> But then, I think again, it's that like perspective </joey>
<joey> of being, that's not moving the way it's intended to. </joey>
<connor> - But also, the swaying and all that stuff, </connor>
<joey> I don't really give a shit, </joey>
<joey> as long as the building isn't falling down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I just don't want my stuff to break. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, that's the biggest thing </joey>
<joey> is just shit falling down, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why if I ever knew there was an earthquake, </joey>
<joey> I would just rush to my like camera gear. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like hold my shirt and coat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Protect, protect. </garnt>
<garnt> - JoJo figures, please. </garnt>
<garnt> - Me and my anime figures. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no! </garnt>
<garnt> - Those are the real casualties in earthquakes. </garnt>
<connor> - I had those 400, $500 Jojo figures </connor>
<joey> that were like very finely balanced. </joey>
<joey> That were balanced, the weight was like this. </joey>
<joey> So that the center of gravity was very worrying. </joey>
<joey> And during earthquakes, </joey>
<joey> I immediately had to just like go to them if I was there. </joey>
<joey> And during, we had one pretty big earthquake </joey>
<joey> and I was surprised 'cause my figures just stayed up. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean same with the studio as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yours didn't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's weird 'cause the figures that had fallen </joey>
<joey> looked like pretty normal figures </joey>
<joey> but the one that I really expect to break, </joey>
<connor> didn't move at all. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, it's the same here as well. </joey>
<garnt> Like at the old track station. </garnt>
<garnt> - I expected Rohan to just be over. </garnt>
<joey> - All of these knockedover, but the only casualty we had </joey>
<connor> was fucking Mike. </connor>
<joey> - Fucking Mike. </joey>
<joey> - Every time I'm not at my house </joey>
<joey> and there's an earthquake in Japan, </joey>
<joey> I just assume my house is gonna be demolished </joey>
<connor> when I'm back. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, everything's fucked, </connor>
<connor> I have to rebuild my whole life, it's all ruined. </connor>
<joey> - Do you guys have like the anti-earthquake proof stuff </joey>
<joey> in your cabinets? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - You probably should do that. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - It really does make a difference. </joey>
<joey> - Does it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - What is it? </joey>
<joey> - So basically like, </joey>
<joey> or, I mean there's lots of different variations of it. </joey>
<connor> - Do you need it for most stuff though? </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's for very specific things. </connor>
<joey> - We put it on most stuff. </joey>
<joey> Like most of the big stuff will sound like, </joey>
<joey> if you have figuring cabinets or like bookshelves, </joey>
<connor> this is like little, kind of like, </connor>
<connor> they look like little rubber doorstoppers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know what they are, I know what they are. </connor>
<connor> - And you put them underneath and it completely stops </connor>
<joey> the shaking from happening. </joey>
<connor> - I wanted to get the figures to stop shaking. </connor>
<joey> - Yes I have them under like all of my bookshelves </joey>
<joey> and figuring cabinets and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And you know, I've seen the move in an earthquake. </joey>
<joey> That shit doesn't budge. </joey>
<joey> So that's really good. </joey>
<connor> And also like there's also these little sticky pads </connor>
<connor> kind of thing that you can put on some figurines </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that stops them from falling over. </connor>
<joey> - It's just weird that you have to live in a country </joey>
<joey> and you can just worry about like instant death </joey>
<joey> just happening. </joey>
<garnt> In the UK nothing kills you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Instant death, I mean it;snot exactly instant death </garnt>
<joey> - I was just worried, well, I mean, it might be. </joey>
<joey> - If you're in the wrong situation. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I suppose we've been lucky enough </connor>
<garnt> to had never have been in a bad earthquake. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I feel like we've never. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt says this, don't fucking say it. </garnt>
<garnt> Well they've been predicting the mega-quake </garnt>
<garnt> for a few years now in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> Where there's bound to be some kind of </garnt>
<garnt> magnitude eight or nine fucking earthquake in Tokyo </garnt>
<joey> and I hope to God it happens in the next three weeks </joey>
<joey> so I'm not here. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - I bet you'll wish you were </garnt>
<connor> on the ground floor then, Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I felt like the shaking was very violent. </connor>
<connor> I used to live on the 4 to 5th floor </connor>
<connor> and it used to shake really weirdly, I didn't like it. </connor>
<garnt> I felt like it was just high enough up </garnt>
<connor> where I got really violent shakes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I got, I was on the 8th floor, </garnt>
<connor> and I think with the biggest earthcake we were in, </connor>
<connor> which was the one where, - Earthcake. </connor>
<joey> - Earthcake, earthquake, (laughs) earthcake. </joey>
<joey> The biggest earthquake we were in, </joey>
<joey> which was the one where my figures fell over, </joey>
<joey> I was in the toilet at the time, but. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the safest room to be in. </garnt>
<connor> - I was in the bath one time as well. </connor>
<garnt> - But that earthquake just lasted for so fucking long. </garnt>
<connor> It felt like it lasted like two minutes </connor>
<joey> or something like that. - At least, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, go on. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause it just started and like at which point, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you have to make this mental judgment of, </connor>
<connor> at which point do I start giving a shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, because most of the time it's a little shake. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it happens so often. </connor>
<connor> - It happens so often, so I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> uh, is this the one I should start caring. </connor>
<connor> It's not stopping, should I start caring now? </connor>
<connor> - But also, what are you gonna do if you give a shit? </connor>
<connor> Like, what am I gonna do? </connor>
<connor> Just be like, oh shit, I'm worried. </connor>
<joey> - Well, you have to like evacuate </joey>
<joey> to your nearest evacuation point, </joey>
<garnt> which everyone should know when you move. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know where is it? </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck no. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - You gotta get under the doorframe, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Doorframe, but also like if it gets really bad, </joey>
<joey> then there's like in your local town, </joey>
<joey> there's usually like evacuation points </joey>
<joey> that you have to go to. </joey>
<connor> - That's normally if your water and shit turns off </connor>
<joey> and all that, is right? </joey>
<joey> - No, in a lot of situations it's like earthquakes </joey>
<connor> and floods and stuff like that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But why would you leave your house in an earthquake </connor>
<garnt> if it's like, that's surely if it's unstable, no? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, what if. </joey>
<garnt> - The building's unstable. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's usually in the case of like, </garnt>
<garnt> if the earthquake is really powerful that your water stops </garnt>
<connor> or your electricity stops, your gas stops. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I thought, right, to get supplies and shelter. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause if the winter, if it's really fucking cold </joey>
<garnt> and your electricity turns off. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, then you're kind of screwed it. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm kind of fucked because I am not stocked up </garnt>
<garnt> on any kind of emergency or disaster. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, we recently restocked our shit. </joey>
<connor> So it's all in the front. - I need to. </connor>
<joey> I've been meaning to, it's been two years. </joey>
<joey> - Been meaning to. - Two years now </joey>
<joey> I've been meaning to do that. </joey>
<garnt> I'll get around to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll get around to it. </garnt>
<joey> - Not to wait. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember for "Journey Across Japan", </garnt>
<connor> we went to like, Sakurajima, </connor>
<connor> which is that island volcano in Kagoshima. </connor>
<connor> And I remember two weeks after we left there, </connor>
<joey> it fucking erupted. And it's like. </joey>
<joey> - But high though? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's pretty big as well. </joey>
<joey> And it made me realize, I was like, </joey>
<joey> oh yeah, earthquakes are like the least of my worries </joey>
<joey> 'cause Japan is like fucking volcanic area. </joey>
<joey> There's like so many active volcanoes, </joey>
<garnt> like Mount Fuji's a fucking active volcano. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is, it's an active volcano and it last erupted, </garnt>
<garnt> I think, about 250 years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're expecting it to- </garnt>
<garnt> - 250 years ago? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, in the edo period, it last erupted. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh! </garnt>
<joey> - And they're expecting it to erupt soon. </joey>
<connor> - Sick. </connor>
<connor> - So, I'm like, sick. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] They actually did a simulation </joey>
<joey> if it erupts completely, </joey>
<joey> it actually reaches all the way to Hachioji. </joey>
<connor> - Oh shit. </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] It's still that fucked. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - It's kinda like Yellowstone, right, in America? </joey>
<joey> Where that's like one of the biggest active, </joey>
<joey> super volcanoes in the world. </joey>
<joey> And if that erupts then it's just, </joey>
<garnt> kind of like the end of civilization for a lot of people. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Makes a lot of the waters at Yellowstone boiling hot, </connor>
<garnt> like the lakes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Some horrifying stories of people jumping in the water, </joey>
<joey> thinking that they can swim in it, and it's boiling. </joey>
<joey> - They just get boiled away. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty grim. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty grim. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't know when it's so bad, </garnt>
<garnt> when do I leave my house? </garnt>
<connor> I don't know that. </connor>
<connor> Is there a hard guide on when to leave your house? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm pretty sure you'll know when you'll know. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - Like when it gets to the point where it's like, </garnt>
<connor> oh, I can't be here for a multitude of reasons, </connor>
<joey> then it's time to go. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the ones that I don't really get scared </joey>
<joey> of the earthquakes in Japan, </joey>
<joey> but the ones that do kind of make me uncomfortable </joey>
<joey> is when it starts small and it just keeps getting bigger. </joey>
<joey> And then you're like, when will it stop? </joey>
<joey> Will it keep escalating? </joey>
<joey> Because when it starts off big and it doesn't get any worse, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, okay cool. </connor>
<joey> - It's the long ones for me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, where it starts, it shakes, shakes, shakes! </connor>
<garnt> And you're like, please, okay please, please stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like when is this gonna peak? </garnt>
<connor> Where's the peak, this is the peak? </connor>
<connor> No, it's not peaking yet. </connor>
<connor> I just feel like it's the British in me, </connor>
<connor> where you just don't take </connor>
<connor> any kind of like natural disaster seriously. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, come on, pack it in. </connor>
<connor> All right, stop this now, come on. </connor>
<connor> I've had enough of this, I'm finished, come on. </connor>
<connor> - It's a natural disaster. </connor>
<garnt> Come on, there's no natural disasters in the world. </garnt>
<joey> - So you guys don't have any natural disaster? </joey>
<connor> - No. - No. </connor>
<connor> - There's some flooding, but very light. </connor>
<connor> It's not really. - Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - We have flooding here. </joey>
<garnt> - I hear of like a weather warning in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, what the fuck's a weather warning? </garnt>
<garnt> - How can weather kill you? </garnt>
<garnt> - My phone has been on permanent weather warnings </garnt>
<joey> since I've moved here, I'm pretty sure. </joey>
<joey> I'd love to imagine the first time a British person </joey>
<joey> like went abroad, in 1600s and there's an earthquake, </joey>
<joey> like what the fuck was that? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck was that? </joey>
<joey> And they're like, yeah, that happens all the time. </joey>
<joey> What do you mean that happens all the time? </joey>
<joey> The Earth just moves? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah the Earth just moves. </joey>
<joey> - And you're all okay with this? </joey>
<joey> You haven't asked management what's going on? </joey>
<joey> - It's a living. </joey>
<joey> - And they're like, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> and sometimes the mountain explodes. </joey>
<joey> The mountain explodes? </joey>
<joey> And fire? </joey>
<connor> - The mountain explodes, </connor>
<joey> we get these things called typhoons. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like, what do you mean lava? </connor>
<joey> That's hell, that's hell coming out. </joey>
<joey> We've only seen that in the books, this doesn't happen? </joey>
<joey> This is nonsense. </joey>
<joey> - It's 20,000 leagues under the sea. </joey>
<garnt> - And you accept this? </garnt>
<garnt> Is this okay with you? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, what is a typhoon? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a bit of wind aint it? </garnt>
<garnt> Bit of wind's never hurt anyone. </garnt>
<joey> It's just a bit of rain, we get that all the time. </joey>
<connor> - It's a bit of rain and wind. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean nature destroyed your house, </connor>
<connor> and did you get a refund? </connor>
<connor> What is all this? </connor>
<joey> - What is a Tsunami, it's just waves, aint it? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, when we think about it, </joey>
<joey> Japan really is world number one when it comes to </joey>
<joey> the variety of fucking things that can kill you in nature. </joey>
<joey> We really do have everything. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember before I moved out of England, </garnt>
<joey> you'd hear about these disasters that happened </joey>
<joey> all the way on the other side of the world. </joey>
<joey> Like the Japan tsunami, </joey>
<joey> which was an awful tragedy that happens. </joey>
<connor> And you just didn't, it never quite sank in. </connor>
<connor> - It never felt real. </connor>
<connor> - Like how bad it was. </connor>
<connor> Like I remember just before we moved to Japan </connor>
<connor> where you guys are having like super bad typhoons </connor>
<joey> and like the videos that came out just look super bad </joey>
<joey> and I was just like. </joey>
<joey> It still doesn't sink into me </joey>
<joey> that it's just this bad here in Japan, as a British person, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've just never experienced it IRL, in real life. </joey>
<garnt> It's never just happened right in front of me. </garnt>
<joey> - It really is completely different, </joey>
<joey> you can watch like, hundreds of videos on it </joey>
<joey> and the one that you've actually experienced in real life </joey>
<joey> is unlike anything you would ever imagine. </joey>
<joey> It's like those typhoons look bad, </joey>
<joey> it's a hundred times worse in real life. </joey>
<connor> - Watching earthquakes from the 2011 earthquake </connor>
<joey> is like, really fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking terrifying, dude. </joey>
<connor> - Just seeing people just everything's shaking super badly, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, oh gosh. </joey>
<joey> - And just like the water level rising and shit </joey>
<garnt> is like terrifying. </garnt>
<garnt> That happened 10 years ago, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah time flies. - Yeah, 2011. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit, I was still in university. </garnt>
<connor> - I would gladly take volcanoes if we can get onsens. </connor>
<connor> Stick a volcano somewhere in Wales, I will have an onsen. </connor>
<joey> - Would onsen culture work in the UK? </joey>
<connor> - If we had volcanoes, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You sure? - Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I wouldn't. - I agree. </connor>
<joey> They'd serve alcohol. </joey>
<joey> - You just want it to work. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll make it work, we'll serve beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not if people have to get naked in front of each other. </garnt>
<connor> - I think you underestimate how. </connor>
<joey> - I think that culture just wouldn't work in the UK. </joey>
<connor> - It wouldn't work. - I think it could work. </connor>
<joey> - If you teach them from a young age. </joey>
<joey> Listen, get naked. </joey>
<connor> Getting naked is normal with your homies. </connor>
<joey> - You can teach a group of people cannibalism </joey>
<joey> from a young age and they'll think it's all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we're not talking about, </garnt>
<connor> like if the entire history of the UK had changed </connor>
<joey> to introduce this culture from the beginning, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause then they'd just be fucking Japan, wouldn't they? </garnt>
<connor> - If you gave them a free beer at the end of it, </connor>
<connor> you go in naked with your boys, you get a free beer, </connor>
<joey> they'd do it. </joey>
<connor> - You sure? - 100% </connor>
<connor> - I doubt. </connor>
<joey> If I went up to a guy from the UK, </joey>
<joey> like born and bred, never left the country and I said, </joey>
<joey> I'll give you a beer if you get in this bath </joey>
<joey> with this other dude naked. </joey>
<connor> - When you say it like that, </connor>
<joey> that sounds way worse 'cause that's. </joey>
<joey> - So that's what an onsen is. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause they're probably imagining </joey>
<joey> some tight traditional bath where their dicks are touching </joey>
<joey> and they're like, oh God, oh, I'm so scared of penises. </joey>
<joey> - I mean there are onsens like that though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but not really public ones though. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, well, I mean, we've been in one. </joey>
<connor> - Have we? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, remember. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - We've been pretty close together in an onsen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah at the end of the cycling tour. </garnt>
<joey> We went in that really, really tight onsen. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like me, you, Joey and Chris </garnt>
<joey> and our legs were definitely touching. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I don't remember this. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That just shows how used to it you've gotten, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just like nothing to you. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure someone who's not used to that type of culture </joey>
<joey> would find that traumatizing. </joey>
<garnt> - Especially a lot of Brits, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine being scared of a penis though. </connor>
<connor> I just couldn't imagine it. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you'd be surprised. </garnt>
<garnt> Like not even being scared of penises, </garnt>
<joey> but just the social boundary of seeing your mate's penis </joey>
<joey> or seeing someone close to you </joey>
<joey> and just knowing what they look like naked. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm totally fine with it now, </joey>
<joey> but that's because I've done it </joey>
<joey> since I was with you boys right. </joey>
<joey> - It's that one thing of just getting to that point </joey>
<connor> and once you're over it, then you're over it. </connor>
<connor> But I think for a lot of people, </connor>
<joey> it stops at getting to that point. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe in the UK, if it was in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I would think it's weird. </connor>
<joey> - Which is why for me, it's such a shame </joey>
<joey> because when people from overseas </joey>
<joey> come to Japan for the first time and they're like, </joey>
<joey> I wanna know everything about the culture, you know? </joey>
<joey> What are some really unique Japanese things. </joey>
<joey> And of course the first thing I think all of his onsens. </joey>
<joey> But immediately I always hesitate, being like, </joey>
<joey> I get this, you're about to see my dick, </joey>
<joey> but in like a cool way. </joey>
<joey> - I said cyber punk music, when you said that. </joey>
<joey> - In a nice relaxing way. </joey>
<connor> We're in a bath together and yes, we're naked, </connor>
<connor> but it's not weird, it's not weird, trust me. </connor>
<joey> And we're with other random people as well, </joey>
<joey> but it's not weird, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - The first thing I tell people now, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna come to Japan? </garnt>
<connor> You want me to take you around? </connor>
<connor> We'll go into an onsen right? </connor>
<garnt> Just get that out of the way. </garnt>
<connor> - I think if someone's willing to go to the onsen with you. </connor>
<garnt> - They probably will be up for anything, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah everything Japanese culture. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like if you can't put your own cultural differences </joey>
<joey> aside to participate in another culture, </joey>
<joey> then I don't think you're. </joey>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<joey> - And yeah, again, that's what I kind of use </joey>
<joey> as a gauge of like cultural understanding for that person. </joey>
<joey> It's like, if they can get over this, </joey>
<joey> then you'll be fine in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I'm very open to some things, </connor>
<connor> but there are some things where I've seen in like, </connor>
<joey> you know when they had, what was it? </joey>
<joey> Was it a TV show called "Tribe" in the UK. </joey>
<joey> It's dude who went around tribes in the Amazon or something. </joey>
<joey> And there was one thing that he did that I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I don't think I'd that," </joey>
<joey> and it was like a penis inverting ceremony or something. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh that! - Oh that one! </garnt>
<joey> - Did you see the video where the guy faints </joey>
<joey> when they do it to him? </joey>
<joey> I was like, yeah, you know what, </joey>
<connor> I thought I was up for a lot </connor>
<connor> but I think that's where I'm good. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you seen the one where they have to wear that glove </garnt>
<joey> of just like bullet ants? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, oh my God. - Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, why would anyone wanna do this? </garnt>
<connor> - If I was, you gave me enough beers, </connor>
<garnt> maybe I do the ants thing but. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's go! </garnt>
<joey> - But it's the video of that guy, </joey>
<joey> the tribal chief does it to him </joey>
<joey> and he just faints immediately. </joey>
<connor> Oh God, it sounded terrible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think there are many penises going, </joey>
<connor> ah, just listening to you, right? </connor>
<joey> Just like, aah! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm pretty much up for anything </joey>
<joey> that doesn't involve destroying my body </joey>
<joey> or pain or stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> I'm pretty much down for anything. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm usually down for anything when it comes to like, </joey>
<connor> especially when it comes to things like food and drinks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, which is why I hate it when people lie to me </joey>
<joey> about their, they make a joke that like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, our culture, we do this and then they just lie to me. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have to put my penis out in public. </joey>
<garnt> I'm kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> But this is why I trust my friends when I go somewhere new </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, this is what we do here. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I trust you, that sounds weird, </garnt>
<garnt> but I trust you, please don't fuck me. </garnt>
<joey> Like Garnt could be like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, so in Thailand we get our dicks out in restaurants </joey>
<joey> and swing them around and be like, </joey>
<joey> all right, well, okay. </joey>
<joey> - This is the culture. </joey>
<joey> - When in Rome, do as the Romans. </joey>
<joey> I would trust Garnt if Garnt told something like that. </joey>
<joey> Garnt was like, yeah, you have to spit on the food </joey>
<garnt> before you eat it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just waiting for the perfect opportunity </garnt>
<connor> to abuse that power. </connor>
<garnt> - He's gonna do it, he's gonna fucking do it, </garnt>
<connor> I know he is as well, that's the worst part. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just waiting for the perfect opportunity </garnt>
<connor> to abuse that power. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm gonna do it. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I've only got one chance to do it </connor>
<garnt> before I completely lose that trust. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like Joey in Australia, he'll be like, </connor>
<joey> yeah, you have to snort all your alcohol </joey>
<connor> and I'll be like, oh okay. </connor>
<garnt> - You have to drink alcohol through your eye. </garnt>
<connor> - I think a few Australians do do that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we do do that. </connor>
<connor> - It's called a suicide shot I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair we used to have a lot of shows in the UK </connor>
<garnt> that would cover binge drinking and clubbing. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why we had TV shows about this. </garnt>
<joey> And there'd be this one show </joey>
<joey> and this is where I first discovered </joey>
<joey> that people did vodka shots through their eyeball. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And it was weird and they would do it and they'd ask them, </joey>
<joey> the interviewer would ask them, why did you do it? </joey>
<joey> He's like, 'cause I just get drunk so fast. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, is drinking not fast enough? </joey>
<joey> It's pretty fast, it's pretty damn instant. </joey>
<joey> It's pretty fucking fast. </joey>
<joey> And then it just immediately cut to a doctor who was like, </joey>
<joey> yeah well actually, you know, </joey>
<joey> inserting any kind of alcohol in your eye </joey>
<joey> is extremely dangerous and can remove the lipid layer </joey>
<joey> of an eye and can permanently damage and possibly blind you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. - And I was like, oh. </joey>
<joey> - I don't need a professional doctor telling me that. </joey>
<joey> Like it should be common sense. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's like a splinter in your butt. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I didn't need a doctor to tell me </connor>
<connor> that that didn't need to go there. </connor>
<connor> It's weird, man. </connor>
<connor> It's so strange 'cause I feel like in the UK </connor>
<joey> with partying and all that, </joey>
<joey> there's so many stuff that you just do it </joey>
<garnt> 'cause everyone else tells you to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would just always sat there thinking like </garnt>
<connor> what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's definitely, especially in a university where- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just the idea of doing a dirty shot now </garnt>
<garnt> just makes me feel sick. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is a dirty shot? </garnt>
<joey> Explain to the viewers Garnt, and me, 'cause I forgot. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know what it is either. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or I dirty pint. </garnt>
<garnt> You just, you play probably most of the time </garnt>
<joey> it's fucking ring of fire, which is the university game. </joey>
<connor> And then you have this pint glass in the middle where, </connor>
<connor> whenever you draw certain cards, </connor>
<connor> you have to fill up with whatever alcohol. </connor>
<connor> - I feel sick hearing that. </connor>
<connor> - Whatever alcohol that person is drinking. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And sometimes if you're in like an ultra hardcore party, </connor>
<joey> then you fill up with like other shit </joey>
<joey> that you would never put in a fucking drink. </joey>
<joey> Shit like washing up liquid or stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they would do it. - Or Tabasco sauce. </connor>
<connor> Or Nandos sauce. </connor>
<connor> - We had a rule in ours where whoever lost, </connor>
<garnt> they had to leave the room for 30 seconds. </garnt>
<connor> And anything in the kitchen could be put in the drink. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - People would put like pepper grains, washing up liquid </connor>
<joey> and they would drink it. </joey>
<joey> - I understand pepper grains and Tabasco, </joey>
<garnt> but washing up liquid? </garnt>
<garnt> - You'd immediately throw it up, there's no way you could </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I've actually done it before, when I was 17. </garnt>
<connor> - You fucking idiot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah you're a fucking ass. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm lucky, for some reason during my whole time </connor>
<joey> at university when I played this game, I never got it. </joey>
<joey> But I would've refused. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, we played that game, </connor>
<joey> but we made it stuff that you could actually drink. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's really disgusting. </joey>
<connor> - That's the civilized thing to do. </connor>
<connor> - I had food poisoning yesterday and I feel dreadful </connor>
<connor> and hearing this makes you feel even more dreadful. </connor>
<joey> - Why did you get food poisoning Conor? </joey>
<connor> - I ate a bad sausage. </connor>
<joey> - You had a bad sausage. </joey>
<connor> - I ordered two sausages, I cut one up </connor>
<joey> and it was very, very pink on the inside. </joey>
<joey> - That's a bad sign. </joey>
<joey> - And I thought no, I'm not eating that one. </joey>
<garnt> But I cut up the other one and it looked okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you ate it, </garnt>
<connor> and it was not. - What kinda sausage was it? </connor>
<joey> - Was it Italian sausage? - A fucking terrible sausage. </joey>
<garnt> - Narrator, and it was not okay. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel sick describing it. </connor>
<garnt> - You have Connoren food poisoning. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you are so susceptible to it. </joey>
<joey> I think since you've been in Japan, </joey>
<connor> you've had food poisoning at least three or four times </connor>
<joey> from my memory. - Three times. </joey>
<connor> - What's the worst food poisoning you've ever had? </connor>
<joey> - The () one? </joey>
<connor> - () one? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that was the worst one. </joey>
<joey> - You had food poisoning for a week. </joey>
<connor> - I was shitting and vomiting for a week straight </connor>
<connor> It was terrible. </connor>
<joey> God it was so bad. - I think I've only had </joey>
<joey> food poisoning once. </joey>
<connor> - In Japan, 'cause they should have so much raw shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like you know, they serve raw chicken here, you know? </connor>
<joey> And they say like, ah, there's no salmonella. </joey>
<joey> There is salmonella, there's just way less of it right? </joey>
<joey> - You're just less likely to get it. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't mean you can't get it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not being funny, but you should not eat raw chicken. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't care if Japan is like, yeah, it's safe. </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<joey> - I've had it before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's not. </joey>
<joey> - It's not even that good. </joey>
<connor> - It's not that good and you all rolling a dice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can eat it, but you are rolling a dice. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I had raw chicken at an Izakaya </joey>
<joey> that specialized in raw chicken. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there's a lot of Izakayas </joey>
<joey> that just like give it to you. </joey>
<garnt> - I still wouldn't. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a cultural thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Where people would just like, this is safe, this is safe. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, is it though, is it? </joey>
<connor> Is it safe? </connor>
<joey> - It's like you are eating it and there is a risk, </joey>
<joey> there is still a risk. </joey>
<joey> - Of course there's a risk. </joey>
<joey> - But you are unlikely to get food poisoning </joey>
<joey> from eating the raw chicken, </joey>
<joey> but there was still a chance you can get it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can still get it, </joey>
<joey> especially if your stomach's </joey>
<connor> not used to it. - Way more than other foods. </connor>
<connor> - But, I mean, a lot of things, </connor>
<garnt> especially I feel like in Asia, which just has a lot of, </garnt>
<joey> a lot less standards when it comes to say </joey>
<joey> the health and safety of the food you serve. </joey>
<joey> I feel like even like Japan compared to the rest of Asia </joey>
<joey> has really, really good food standards, </joey>
<joey> compared to fucking Southeast Asia. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - But Japan compared to the UK </joey>
<joey> is like Japan doesn't bat an eye if it's like pinkish </joey>
<connor> and I'm like, oof, my chicken's pink in the middle. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh God, don't know if I can eat that. </connor>
<joey> - I mean yeah, the only time I got food poisoning </joey>
<joey> was when I went to the Philippines for the first time. </joey>
<joey> And of all things I could have got food poisoning from, </joey>
<joey> it wasn't the duck fetus, it wasn't even the water, </joey>
<joey> it was a fucking mango shake. </joey>
<joey> I ate a fucking mango </joey>
<joey> straight off the fucking street vendor, </joey>
<garnt> and that's what gave me food poisoning. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like cool, amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a fantastic shake, but man, I was shitting, </garnt>
<joey> I was pissing out my ass for about two days. </joey>
<garnt> It was horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the worst food poisoning I've ever got </garnt>
<garnt> was from China actually when I was still living there. </garnt>
<joey> And you know, when you live in China like, </joey>
<joey> the food there is fucking great, especially the street food, </joey>
<joey> but it's just trying to pinpoint </joey>
<joey> where you got food poisoning there is like. </joey>
<connor> - A needle in a haystack. </connor>
<connor> - It's kinda like a needle in a haystack. </connor>
<connor> You're just like, where did, which one of these food stands </connor>
<joey> did I get food poisoning from, it could be any one of them. </joey>
<joey> - Could be like a culmination of all of them too, </joey>
<joey> just come together as one. </joey>
<joey> - I remember it was so bad </joey>
<joey> that I almost had to go to the hospital </joey>
<joey> because I remember it was new year's Eve </joey>
<joey> for one of the years, I can't remember which year, </joey>
<garnt> exact year it was. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember I was sitting on the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> and I needed to throw up </garnt>
<garnt> at the same time that I was shitting. </garnt>
<joey> (laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Those are the worst. </joey>
<connor> - You laugh but it was a traumatic experience for me. </connor>
<connor> - What were you just alternating? </connor>
<connor> - I was trying. </connor>
<joey> - Or did you have to like. </joey>
<joey> - I was trying to keep it in, but that one time, </joey>
<connor> one time I literally could not like hold either one. </connor>
<connor> So I literally didn't like needed to like, </connor>
<connor> I was sitting on the toilet </connor>
<connor> and I needed to like try to like aim. </connor>
<connor> - I can't listen to this. </connor>
<connor> - It's awful, I don't wanna get too graphic. </connor>
<connor> - I've done that before. </connor>
<connor> - But it was the most awful food poisoning experience </connor>
<connor> I've ever had. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like a scene out of "South Park" where. </connor>
<connor> - I know which one you're. </connor>
<joey> - Where he literally shits and then pukes up </joey>
<joey> and then has a nose bleed at the same time. </joey>
<connor> That was my experience. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, say what you will about fast food chains. </connor>
<connor> I've never gotten food poisoning from a fast food chain. </connor>
<joey> - I've never gotten food poisoning, </joey>
<joey> you mean like junk food and stuff like that? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah like McDonald's whatever. </connor>
<connor> I've never gotten. - I've never gotten </connor>
<connor> food poisoning from it personally, </connor>
<joey> but I have gotten very sick. </joey>
<connor> - I felt bad, but I've never had to throw up </connor>
<joey> after eating like KFC or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know about America, </joey>
<joey> I've seen some really ghastly ones in America. </joey>
<joey> But in the UK and Japan </joey>
<connor> I've had nothing but good experiences. </connor>
<joey> - No, Japan is really good with fast food. </joey>
<joey> I think like the few times </joey>
<connor> that I've had McDonald's in America, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I really wanna throw up. </connor>
<connor> - I feel so rough. </connor>
<joey> - I really wanna throw this up, yeah, it's horrible. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how they make burgers tastes so bad </connor>
<joey> at McDonald's in America. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what they do. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno, man. </joey>
<joey> - It's 'cause McDonald's just makes enough money worldwide </joey>
<joey> and in America there's just so much better burgers right, </joey>
<joey> that it doesn't matter. </joey>
<joey> - There's more higher-end burgers in America. </joey>
<connor> - There's way more competition in America, I feel. </connor>
<connor> I feel like in America, </connor>
<joey> McDonald's lives off the reputation of how would. </joey>
<joey> - It's the American burger. </joey>
<connor> - The rest of the world, right? </connor>

<garnt> back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Speaking of traveling and stuff, </garnt>
<joey> this is the last podcast before we head back to the UK, </joey>
<joey> me and you, so you're not going to see a break, </joey>
<connor> but we're going to have about like a six, seven week? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like a month and a half break, basically. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, a six week break. </joey>
<joey> - Which is the longest break </joey>
<garnt> we've ever taken from Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna see people who are like bingeing Trash Taste. </joey>
<connor> Like watching this episode and then going to the next </connor>
<connor> and being like, what the fuck happened? </connor>
<joey> - I wonder if there's any difference? </joey>
<connor> Like what if I just get a scar, </connor>
<connor> like a really cool scar? </connor>
<joey> - You just come back and you're just like completely bald. </joey>
<joey> Just got an eye patch on or something like that. </joey>
<joey> Woohaa! </joey>
<joey> - It's been really with me for the past few weeks </joey>
<joey> because I've been living alone, I guess, </joey>
<joey> for like the past two, three weeks? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, 'cause Sydney went back to America? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Sydney, she's back in America. </joey>
<joey> I think this is like the longest we've been apart. </joey>
<joey> - First time, huh? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - And it's so weird not having a partner home. </connor>
<connor> And it's just one, the home feels so empty. </connor>
<connor> Like my God, like if it wasn't for Corona lockdown, </connor>
<joey> I would want to meet so many people 'cause I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I need to do something to remind me. </joey>
<joey> - You need someone to talk to. </joey>
<joey> - I need someone to talk to </joey>
<joey> and I need someone to fill in the gap </joey>
<joey> of having no one in your house. </joey>
<connor> I've forgotten what that felt like, right? </connor>
<connor> - I feel that, I feel that. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just 'cause you're used to it right? </garnt>
<connor> To me, it's like, I don't feel that way. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I now see why you try to meet up </garnt>
<garnt> with as many people as you can. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if I was in your shoes I would do the same </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's lonely without having someone </garnt>
<garnt> just there to talk to whenever you want to. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also just really like being alone sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> I really value being able to just like do whatever I want. </connor>
<joey> - No, I like my alone time too. </joey>
<connor> - No, but like. </connor>
<garnt> - But only to a certain extent. </garnt>
<joey> - I like it a lot, a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I like my alone time as well </joey>
<connor> and I feel like any healthy relationship, </connor>
<joey> you have space to have your alone time. </joey>
<joey> But if you're feeling lonely, there's just someone there. </joey>
<joey> Also, not a thing is that the chores are now, </joey>
<joey> like I'm in charge of all the chores, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, what is this? </joey>
<joey> Like, this is gonna sound a bit misogynistic. </joey>
<joey> But like in my household, I'm in charge of the washing up, </joey>
<joey> and Sydney is in charge of the laundry, right? </joey>
<joey> And so I was just used to only do the washing up </joey>
<joey> and having the woman doing the laundry, right? </joey>
<joey> - Why did you have to say it like that? </joey>
<joey> - I just wanted it to sound as misogynist as I can. </joey>
<joey> because now I am, there's no one to do the laundry </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, woman, where is my laundry done! </garnt>
<garnt> And I just realized, I have to do it myself now. </garnt>
<joey> - I just like to imagine I just slowly enter Garnt's house, </joey>
<joey> and from across the house, I just hear, </joey>
<joey> "Woman, I need a fresh pair of underwear!" </joey>
<connor> - You really got done dirty </connor>
<connor> 'cause laundry is like the easiest of the household tasks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm the one that does the laundry in our house. </joey>
<connor> - I think washing up the dishes is far more painful. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I hate washing up the dishes. </garnt>
<connor> - Why did you agree to that? </connor>
<connor> - Because I also hate doing the laundry as well. </connor>
<joey> - No I like the laundry. </joey>
<connor> - Why? - Laundry's nice bro. </connor>
<joey> Fresh sheets. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, now that we've bought a washing machine </joey>
<joey> with a built-in dryer. </joey>
<joey> All I have to do is just fucking take it out and fold it up. </joey>
<joey> But I liked the process of folding up washing, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I hate that. </joey>
<garnt> - It's meditative. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so unoptimized. </garnt>
<connor> Because the thing is, the thing about the laundry </connor>
<connor> is that at least with washing up, </connor>
<connor> it's just a one activity thing, you get it over </connor>
<connor> with laundry, you have to put it in </connor>
<connor> and then you have to remember that you put the laundry in </connor>
<joey> and sometimes I'm such a forgetful little shit, </joey>
<joey> that like you forget hours afterwards that you had laundry </joey>
<joey> in the laundry machine and then you take it out </joey>
<joey> and it fucking stinks </joey>
<joey> because you left it in there for so long. </joey>
<joey> So then you have to re-laundry your fucking laundry! </joey>
<joey> - Well that just sounds like a you problem. </joey>
<garnt> - That is a me problem, gonna hate laundry. </garnt>
<garnt> - The laundry machines often have this </garnt>
<connor> very loud thing called a beeping noise? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it goes, (beeps) when it's done. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but sometimes you just. </joey>
<joey> - You might have heard it on your microwave, </joey>
<joey> kinda same thing. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you're just doing shit, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you're just like, </joey>
<joey> oh, let me just finish up this piece of work </joey>
<garnt> and then I'll do the laundry </garnt>
<garnt> and then you just forget that you hear that. </garnt>
<joey> - It sounds like a you problem, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause if I'm doing work </garnt>
<connor> and then I hear from my laundry machine going (beeps), </connor>
<connor> I'm like, all right time to do the laundry. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how hard it is. - Really not that difficult. </connor>
<connor> Also, I don't have to worry about dishes anymore </connor>
<joey> because we have a dishwasher. </joey>
<garnt> - I wish, I wish, I wish that was me. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I'm like a cave man just evolving. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like discovering civilization for the first time. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean dishes I was used to doing, </joey>
<joey> but with laundry, is this how men felt in the '60s? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - We're gonna get canceled for this episode. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not saying shit bro. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt's gonna cancel this episode. </joey>
<connor> I disagree with all of Garnt's opinions here. </connor>
<connor> - Because in our house </connor>
<joey> I have to do the laundry and the dishes </joey>
<connor> because that's the one chore that Arki hates doing. </connor>
<connor> So she does like the vacuuming </connor>
<connor> and like the cleaning up and stuff like that </connor>
<joey> because I fucking hate vacuuming the house. </joey>
<connor> - I also hate vacuuming the house. </connor>
<joey> - Imagine doing all of it yourself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I had to do that when I was living on my own. </joey>
<joey> - That's crazy. </joey>
<joey> - But now I feel bad 'cause my two chores, </joey>
<joey> which is the laundry and the dishes, </joey>
<joey> I just let the machine do it. </joey>
<joey> So I literally just press a button, I'm like, done. </joey>
<garnt> And it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wish that was me. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to wash my dishes by hand </garnt>
<garnt> and my laundry doesn't have a dryer as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, I'm telling you, man, when you. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't really like the dryers in laundry machines, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like they ruin the clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't like the dryer either. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - But I also hate having to put out the laundry to dry. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I hate having to put up the laundry more. </joey>
<connor> - There's something good about an old-fashioned, </connor>
<connor> natural dryer that just kind of gets to me. </connor>
<garnt> - It does, it does. </garnt>
<garnt> But the problem with that, </garnt>
<garnt> is that you are at the mercy of the weather right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because what are you meant to do in the winter time. </joey>
<joey> - Hang it inside, right? </joey>
<garnt> - The best, the best. </garnt>
<joey> - Why, just hang it outside, what are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> - What, in the rain? </joey>
<connor> - It's not permanently raining in the winter. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but what if you have laundry that just finished </joey>
<joey> and it starts raining. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's unfortunate </connor>
<connor> but you can just hang it up somewhere else. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, inside. </joey>
<joey> So basically what I just fucking said! </joey>
<connor> - You can do it outside, it's not a big deal. </connor>
<joey> - No it is a big deal 'cause it's gonna get dirty again </joey>
<connor> from the rain. </connor>
<connor> - You wash it against, it's even more clean. </connor>
<connor> - See that's what someone living on their own would say. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I would've said the same thing if I was living alone </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like, oh, it's my clothes, fuck it, who cares? </garnt>
<joey> But I have to take care of another person's clothes </joey>
<joey> and she doesn't quite like that. </joey>
<connor> - Does Aki get like, no, you have to do it this way. </connor>
<joey> - Well, no, it's not so much Aki's preference, </joey>
<joey> it's more so just fucking common sense. </joey>
<joey> Don't try and dry washing in the rain. </joey>
<connor> - Don't you put it out when it's raining. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you put it out, then it starts raining, </connor>
<connor> you forget that it's raining, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you didn't notice right away, </connor>
<connor> and it's a little wet, fuck I have to do it again. </connor>
<garnt> - At that point that's just annoying right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause then you just take, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like leaving it out in the rain, I have to rewash it. </connor>
<garnt> Because that washes out the good stuff about the laundry. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm simply one man, I cannot conquer nature. </connor>
<connor> I've accepted that. </connor>
<joey> - Right, so that's why I bought a washing machine </joey>
<connor> that has a really good dryer attached to it. </connor>
<garnt> - You're trying to play God. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no, no, because here's the thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Here's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> Because if you dry your clothes in the dryer, </connor>
<connor> then you're gonna need to iron your shirts, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel if it's like naturally dried, </joey>
<joey> sometimes if you get it out just fresh out of the washing, </joey>
<joey> you like, what's? </joey>
<joey> - Whip it? - Whip it. </joey>
<joey> I was trying to think of the English word </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just knew the Thai word for it. </joey>
<joey> You fucking whip the clothes and it dries naturally, </joey>
<joey> you just get the creases out. </joey>
<joey> And it's like a nice. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the time, unless you're wearing </joey>
<joey> a really expensive shirt </joey>
<joey> or something that needs to be ironed. </joey>
<joey> Most of the time for like a natural t-shirt </joey>
<joey> you get the creases out. </joey>
<garnt> So that's why I've always hated actually </garnt>
<garnt> having to use the dryer. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I get that, but there's also like, </joey>
<joey> we use like these kind of drying sheets </joey>
<joey> that you throw into the washing machine after it's done, </joey>
<joey> that creates less creases in the clothes. </joey>
<connor> It's like a thing, apparently, I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> Aki found on Amazon and I was like. </connor>
<joey> - But pants are sort of bullshit like this, </joey>
<joey> that sometimes works, sometimes it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like yeah, put this in your fridge </joey>
<joey> and it'll make it smell like oranges. </joey>
<connor> And then it like smells like oranges. </connor>
<joey> - Like my last washing machine supposedly </joey>
<joey> had a dryer inside of it and I span it for like three hours </joey>
<connor> and I was like, oh cool, </connor>
<connor> it's just a little less damp than was before. </connor>
<connor> - Japan's the king at selling you shit </connor>
<connor> that you think you need, that you don't actually need </connor>
<connor> and it doesn't work. </connor>
<garnt> - I just remember, so do you guys have an issue </garnt>
<connor> of like, your fucking trash </connor>
<connor> really, really stinking in the summer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like no, I remember when I go to your house, </connor>
<connor> your trash, for some reason, always smells dreadful. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd don't know why. </garnt>
<connor> - My trash doesn't smell that bad. </connor>
<connor> - Like, the burner balls sometimes. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like we don't cook often right? </connor>
<connor> So sometimes it's just, we have like a little trash there, </connor>
<joey> but especially in the summer, </joey>
<joey> sometimes it's just fucking decomposes in the summer. </joey>
<garnt> - How fucking long are you leaving the this there for? </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you not throw it out every week? </garnt>
<garnt> - Uh, no. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, there's your problem. </connor>
<connor> - Why are you not throwing it out every week? </connor>
<garnt> - Because it doesn't get full every week. </garnt>
<joey> - It doesn't matter, you should throw it out. </joey>
<connor> - How do you, as a couple, not get it full every week. </connor>
<joey> I get it for every week on my own. </joey>
<garnt> - You're burnables? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, every week. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I get ours full every week, man. </joey>
<garnt> We sometimes have to go through two bags, </garnt>
<garnt> we have to go through two bags of burnables a week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I dunno, we finish our foods. </garnt>
<connor> - I finished my food too, what are you trying to say Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Then how are you filling, what are you, </garnt>
<garnt> what is it filled with? </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes Amazon comes in the box, it's burnable stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - But that's cardboard? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, like sometimes they give material, </garnt>
<connor> that's not the polystyrene and it's not bubble wrap. </connor>
<connor> It's like the shit that's burnable. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and then if you for example, </joey>
<connor> if you get Uber Eats, for example, right? </connor>
<connor> - I get a lot of Uber Eats. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah like the boxes and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> the food scraps, that's all burnable. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel very excited. </garnt>
<joey> - You wash the boxes? </joey>
<connor> - Do you not wash the boxes? </connor>
<connor> - Depends on the box, what type of material. </connor>
<garnt> - I do not wash the box. </garnt>
<garnt> I just throw it all in the burnables. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, wow Joey! </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, so why does yours stink then? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, why is your stinking worse? </joey>
<garnt> - Because I don't push the box in the burnables. </garnt>
<garnt> The burnables is purely just food waste. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, that's why it stinks. </joey>
<connor> - Well, of course! </connor>
<connor> - Where are you putting the other burnables? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, where are you putting the boxes. </connor>
<connor> - What other burnables are there? </connor>
<joey> - A lot of the food trays. - Like food scraps. </joey>
<joey> - And they'll say if you have like certain materials, </joey>
<connor> if it gets oily or if it gets stuff on it, it's, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait, so when you order a pizza, </joey>
<garnt> do you wash the pizza box when it's done? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, it goes on with the cardboard. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no! </joey>
<garnt> - Your supposed to put in the burnables dude. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, that's grease, there's grease in it. </connor>
<connor> - No because most of the time, </connor>
<connor> if it comes in like a plastic tray or plastic whatever, </connor>
<garnt> you can just wash it and then put it in the plastics. </garnt>
<joey> - Plastics yeah. </joey>
<joey> But a lot of the food trays aren't plastic. </joey>
<joey> - They're cardboard like, paper. </joey>
<garnt> - No? - Like styrofoam stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - Most of it is plastic. </joey>
<connor> Most of everything I get is plastic. </connor>
<connor> - Most of the stuff I get is styrofoam. </connor>
<connor> - So, what happens right is, unfortunately, </connor>
<joey> most of my burnables like pretty much 90% of my burnables </joey>
<joey> is pure food waste. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that just, we don't have a lot of food waste. </joey>
<joey> So it just ends up that a lot of food just accumulates. </joey>
<joey> Not a lot of food, a little bit of food accumulates there </joey>
<garnt> and because it's in the summer, </garnt>
<garnt> it just decomposes so quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's all the more reason </garnt>
<joey> to take it out every week, even if it's not full. </joey>
<connor> - I have a small bag that's attached to the kitchen counter </connor>
<joey> because I go through so much tea </joey>
<joey> and tea decomposes very fast. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's where all the tea and all the small bits of food </joey>
<garnt> that I don't eat goes. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's a tiny plastic bag </garnt>
<joey> that I can tie up and take out every week </joey>
<garnt> if I want to, and it doesn't smell. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's not actually just the food </connor>
<connor> it's just 'cause it's so humid as well that just like. </connor>
<connor> - You should definitely get the thing out of the house. </connor>
<connor> - Like the humidity condenses inside the bag </connor>
<garnt> so it ends up that you have like the garbage water </garnt>
<connor> at the bottom as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You can throw out tiny bags, you know, that's allowed. </joey>
<connor> It doesn't have to be big bags of trash. </connor>
<joey> You can throw out little. </joey>
<joey> - You can throw out little bit konbini bag levels of trash. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes you just forget. </garnt>
<connor> - Again, that sounds like a you problem, bro. </connor>
<connor> - This feels like consulting people on their recycling. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I mean, what I was going to say was, </garnt>
<connor> so obviously the trash ended up smelling at least like, </connor>
<connor> sometimes we throw it out every week in the summer, </connor>
<garnt> but it's sometimes still just smelled. </garnt>
<connor> - I really only get smelly trash when I open the trash. </connor>
<connor> - In my case, if I open up the trash </connor>
<garnt> and it really stinks like that decomposing smell, </garnt>
<connor> I just double bag it. </connor>
<connor> So I close up the first bag, </connor>
<garnt> and I get a second bag and I wrap that up again. </garnt>
<garnt> And then boom, there you go, the smell's gone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because what we did was we, </garnt>
<garnt> there was this device from a Daiso, right? </garnt>
<joey> I think it's Daiso, or like Amazon. </joey>
<joey> - Already red flags. </joey>
<joey> - There was this device from Daiso. </joey>
<joey> - Stink be gone. </joey>
<joey> - That was basically like, </joey>
<joey> you know that thing you put on the toilet </joey>
<joey> to make it smell nice whenever you flush. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like the equivalent of that, </joey>
<joey> but you put it on the bottom of the lid of the garbage can </joey>
<joey> and completely solved the issue. </joey>
<garnt> Our bins smelled great, it smelled fresh. </garnt>
<connor> - Japan is the only country on Earth that gives a shit </connor>
<connor> what the shit smells like. </connor>
<garnt> - It smelled fresh and I was like, great, </garnt>
<connor> this is a fucking amazing device. </connor>
<joey> Oh my God, this has just saved me, </joey>
<joey> this has made my kitchen actually pleasant to be in. </joey>
<joey> Until about a month in, </joey>
<joey> when we needed to take out the trash. </joey>
<joey> And we noticed that there were a lot of flies. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't know how the flies, where the flies came from. </joey>
<joey> - You never know where the flies come from. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't know where the flies came from. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah you had a lot of flies, I remember this. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, where are these flies coming from? </connor>
<connor> And why are they gathering all around the bin? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this never happened before, right? </connor>
<connor> And so Sydney opens the lid, and there's like a few, </connor>
<connor> we could see literally like a few fly eggs on the lid, </connor>
<connor> on the lid cover. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what the fuck, how did this get here? </connor>
<connor> And then, and then I had to wash it, right, obviously. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause Sydney was scared of it, so I had to wash it. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I gotta take off the nice smelling thing. </connor>
<connor> Take it off and, okay it's like a rectangle, </connor>
<connor> it's like a rectangle patch, </connor>
<connor> and I took off the rectangle patch </connor>
<joey> and the entire patch was filled with eggs. </joey>
<joey> I had like an entire patch of fly eggs </joey>
<joey> that were just covered because of this one patch. </joey>
<joey> So this nice-smelling patch had just attracted </joey>
<joey> all the fucking flies in the vicinity. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - I have no idea! </joey>
<joey> I have no fucking idea. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, you gotta do something about that shit bro. </joey>
<joey> - I had to quarantine the place, my God. </joey>
<connor> Like the thing, the thing was like. </connor>
<connor> - I would throw the trashcan out, just gone. </connor>
<connor> - The thing was like fucking Chernobyl. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I have to like quarantine the entire kitchen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hazmat on. </garnt>
<connor> - That is so disgusting. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I dunno what it is, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter if you have like </joey>
<joey> the cleanest kitchen in the world. </joey>
<joey> I don't know where the fuck these flies are coming from, </joey>
<joey> they're just like, it's like the kitchen is a respawn point </joey>
<joey> for some of these fucking flies. </joey>
<joey> Like they just appear out of thin air. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I am here now, time to terrorize. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, this is like, you know in like a Junji Ito Manga, </garnt>
<joey> where you turn the panel and you see like the monster? </joey>
<connor> That was there when I shredded off </connor>
<garnt> that fucking patch. - Ah, I feel shit, </garnt>
<connor> shut the fuck up, stop, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna make me throw up please. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a page-turn jump scare. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's like, ah! </joey>
<connor> - To talk about something more pleasant, though. </connor>
<connor> Going back to laundry. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I remember when I moved out. </connor>
<connor> - Opened up my laundry and there was flies? </connor>
<connor> - I remember moving out of my mom's place, </connor>
<connor> I was just like laundry. </connor>
<joey> All you need to put is a bit of detergent there, </joey>
<joey> and laundry is done. </joey>
<joey> My God, I didn't know how fucking OP fabric softener was </joey>
<joey> until I started doing my laundry. </joey>
<joey> Like not many people talk about it, </joey>
<garnt> but my God, fabric softener is one of the, </garnt>
<garnt> is a life hack that actually works. </garnt>
<connor> - I literally do like the two shots of vodka meme with my. </connor>
<joey> - Two shots of fabric softener. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I go through detergent so slowly. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like one cup of Vodka. </connor>
<connor> And it's like the whole fucking jug I put in. </connor>
<joey> I know it's bad for your clothes, </joey>
<garnt> but I don't give a shit, it's so comfy. </garnt>
<joey> - I put a tiny amount in and it works. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like with clothes, </garnt>
<joey> and especially with your bed covers, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how people sleep </joey>
<garnt> without not putting fabric softener on their bed covers </garnt>
<joey> and bed sheets and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure, I wanna be in that maximum comfort man. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn. - I wanna be embraced. </garnt>
<joey> - Embraced. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna be embraced. </garnt>
<joey> It's like a light hug from your mom. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't wanna sleep naked. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - You don't wanna sleep naked. </joey>
<connor> - I want my nut sack to feel the fabric softener. </connor>
<joey> - I want my nut sacks to be embraced. </joey>
<connor> - I want them to be cradled by my sheets. </connor>
<connor> Bathed in the God's liquid known as fabric softener. </connor>
<joey> I can't wait. </joey>
<connor> It's gonna be weird though, It's gonna be weird coming back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Are you guys excited? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> Not excited for all the quarantining we have to do. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, I mean, it's been what, </connor>
<connor> like a full almost two years now </connor>
<connor> since you guys were in the UK last? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I haven't seen anyone. </joey>
<joey> It's weird. </joey>
<joey> It's weird, I've never gone two years </joey>
<joey> without seeing my family. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, it is a massive pain in the ass to travel right now. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just seeing all the paperwork </joey>
<garnt> you guys have to do to get through. </garnt>
<joey> - Ah, fuck man, Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - Like getting gout the country </joey>
<garnt> seems pretty simple and easy. </garnt>
<garnt> It's getting back in the country that is, </garnt>
<connor> that sounds we're gonna save our experiences </connor>
<connor> for when we actually come back. </connor>
<connor> From third hand experiences, </connor>
<connor> it actually sounds like a prison camp. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm not joking. </connor>
<joey> Like my mate who went out, went back in, </joey>
<joey> like the experience he told me, it's not like a prison camp, </joey>
<joey> but then he sent me an article </joey>
<joey> of some of the Olympic athletes </joey>
<joey> that had to come in the country and had to quarantine. </joey>
<connor> And they literally also said that prison camps </connor>
<connor> will probably, they would probably would probably </connor>
<connor> be better treated in prison camps </connor>
<connor> than they were in like the quarantine hotels </connor>
<connor> that they were in. - Yikes. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I'm gonna read a lot of manga. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just stock up on all the manga man. </joey>
<joey> Like, dude, you can finally catch up with "One Piece". </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] While you're in quarantine. </connor>
<connor> Just read "One Piece", man. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, do it. </joey>
<joey> - Hope I don't gain too much weight. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause God knows, I'm just gonna eat and drink </connor>
<connor> all the time when I'm back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know. </connor>
<joey> - You should like weigh yourself before </joey>
<connor> just as an experiment. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna know. </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna know. - You should. </joey>
<joey> I wanna know. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - It's gonna be like Christmas holidays all over again. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Christmas holidays. </joey>
<connor> I don't know like, do you guys gain weight </connor>
<connor> during the Christmas holidays? </connor>
<connor> - Of course, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I gain weight generally. </connor>
<connor> I breathe near McDonald's and I gain weight. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but hopefully you guys make it back all right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm sure it'll be all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Hope so. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I hope so. </joey>
<joey> - The first thing I'm gonna do is go to a fucking Nando's. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even joking. </joey>
<joey> Like before I hug my mum, before I say hello, </joey>
<connor> before I see the family, get myself to a Nando's. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, mom, hold on, hold on for a second. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna go to Greg's and get a vegan sausage roll. </connor>
<garnt> - Vegan. - Vegan. </garnt>
<joey> - And a Tesco meal deal, perhaps two maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow, spoiling yourself. </joey>
<joey> - Because I can. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm an adult. </joey>
<joey> - Don't want a normal portion size? </joey>
<connor> No, don't think I will. </connor>
<connor> I think I'll get whatever the fuck I want. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I'll cry because I'll cry when I've realized </garnt>
<garnt> that there's no good food options where I live. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I'm gonna miss Japan a lot more </connor>
<connor> than I think I will. </connor>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Like you guys, yeah, I reckon you guys will obviously </joey>
<joey> you know, have that like great rush of, yeah, I'm back home, </joey>
<joey> I'm seeing my family, I'm seeing my mates. </joey>
<joey> But then you'll realize, </joey>
<joey> man, there's just so much shit to do </joey>
<joey> in Japan I can't do here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I am looking forward </joey>
<connor> to ordering a coffee in English, that's very exciting. </connor>
<connor> Very exciting times. </connor>
<garnt> - I am like looking forward to going to a Tesco's, </garnt>
<joey> which is our konbinis and also doing that in English </joey>
<garnt> and having the clerk respond to me. </garnt>
<joey> - Having an English conversation with another person. </joey>
<joey> - Like being asked if I want a plastic bag and not a fukuro. </joey>
<connor> That'd be nice. That'd be nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they'd be like, do you want a bag with that? </connor>
<joey> (speaks in Japanese) </joey>
<joey> Ah sorry, sorry fuck, nah, I'm good. </joey>
<joey> - (speaks in Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - I gotta realize I haven't paid with my card in so long. </joey>
<connor> In the UK you just tap it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm excited for that. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, that's a thing! </garnt>
<connor> - You just tap. - Tap and go. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I actually can't do that straight away </joey>
<joey> because all my cards have expired. </joey>
<connor> All my UK cards have expired, so yeah, </connor>
<connor> I'm lucky to have a bit of UK cash on me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've only got my Japanese card on me right now, </connor>
<connor> but it's not either Visa or MasterCard, </connor>
<connor> which is the two companies that everyone else uses. </connor>
<joey> It's like JCB or something like that, </joey>
<joey> which I've only ever heard in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's only in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - And I don't think </joey>
<joey> anywhere else except it. - Japan Credit Bureau. </joey>
<joey> - Is it? I thought it was Japan Central Bank? </joey>
<connor> - I thought it was Japan credit Bureau. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it's Japan something </connor>
<connor> so it doesn't work outside Japan. </connor>
<connor> - It's all nonsense. </connor>
<connor> - It's all nonsense. </connor>
<connor> Well, hopefully, I mean, luckily I guess the good thing </connor>
<connor> is that, yeah, since it will be six weeks </connor>
<joey> we're gonna have a lot to talk about next episode. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah! - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Hopefully, you'll know if things have gone smoothly </connor>
<joey> if Trash Taste is uninterrupted. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - If one of us get stuck or for some reason RIP Trash taste. </connor>
<connor> - How's it gonna feel for you Joey? </connor>
<garnt> Not being in, not having Trash Taste record every week? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, September is just gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> a very slow months for me. </garnt>
<joey> It's gonna be weird waking up on a Tuesday morning </joey>
<joey> being like, wait, I don't have to go to the office. </joey>
<joey> It's not a work day today, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but I think for me, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm not gonna go back to Australia </joey>
<connor> 'cause I don't wanna go through that whole process, </connor>
<connor> but I'm gonna go see my family in Japan, </connor>
<connor> who I haven't seen in two years. </connor>
<connor> So that's gonna be nice to finally catch up with them. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're all a vaccine now. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, yeah, it's gonna be nice to just </connor>
<joey> live how I used to live three years ago </joey>
<joey> when everything was a lot more simple. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm waiting for the day until </garnt>
<joey> they actually let tourists in here. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh dude. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I think that's why I wanna go back now, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I'm like I don't see it happening any time soon. </garnt>
<garnt> If I go now, I'm fine if it takes another two years. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - You think it's gonna take two years? </garnt>
<joey> - No, but if it does, it does. </joey>
<joey> - It could. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how long it's gonna take. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but uh, </joey>
<joey> - But anyway, I guess we'll wrap it up there. </joey>
<connor> - We'll wrap it up here. </connor>
