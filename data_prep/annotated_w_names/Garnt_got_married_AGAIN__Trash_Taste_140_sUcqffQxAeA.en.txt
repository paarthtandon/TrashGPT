<joey> another episode of the trash taste </joey>
<joey> podcast I'm bringing back the intros </joey>
<joey> baby I'm with Brethren number two and </joey>
<connor> three can we get to monetize for that </connor>
<connor> for the wood I'm pretty sure it's close </connor>
<joey> enough oh dude I'm quitting YouTube if </joey>
<garnt> that happens no no you're not no you're </garnt>
<connor> not dude have we really gotten so </connor>
<joey> Puritan to the point where we can't even </joey>
<garnt> say that anymore that's ridiculous on </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube yes I I've I've given up on </garnt>
<garnt> making money on YouTube via ad Revenue </garnt>
<joey> holy [ __ ] like my all like my last for </joey>
<joey> the last six months I think I have had </joey>
<joey> only one video that has not been </joey>
<connor> demonetized are you serious yeah on my </connor>
<connor> main Channel at least which is what if </connor>
<connor> you're wondering why I never upload </connor>
<connor> anymore unless I have a sponsor on it </connor>
<connor> that's why otherwise I would not make </connor>
<garnt> any money on it but you know sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta take the L's with the L's </garnt>
<joey> sometimes is it because do you think of </joey>
<joey> the anime content or do you think it's </joey>
<joey> just because like something else like </joey>
<garnt> it's wearing it's always something </garnt>
<joey> different there's like a million </joey>
<joey> different things </joey>
<joey> um sometimes it's some of the anime </joey>
<joey> content sometimes it's the language </joey>
<joey> sometimes it's the music but as long as </joey>
<joey> I have sponsorships I'm also very like </joey>
<joey> unwilling to compromise on the way I </joey>
<joey> want to make content yeah that's you </joey>
<joey> know as long as I have sponsors I'll </joey>
<garnt> keep making videos </garnt>
<joey> I didn't know it was still that bad </joey>
<connor> because like I definitely got the brunt </connor>
<connor> of that like you know when the first ad </connor>
<connor> Pockets thing happened but like yeah </connor>
<connor> I've been pretty good for the past year </connor>
<joey> or so I mean you never really got </joey>
<connor> affected that much right I know yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah I was it was really weird because I </joey>
<joey> you know when the whole apocalypse </joey>
<connor> happened everyone was like freaking out </connor>
<connor> yeah I was like man I'm pretty sure my </connor>
<connor> stuff should get demonetized </connor>
<joey> yeah that is true like I didn't get it </joey>
<garnt> and I I was kind of waiting and everyone </garnt>
<garnt> was freaking out I'm like yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> let's hope we can't get angry I'm like </connor>
<joey> my stuff's so green stuff meanwhile he's </joey>
<joey> like Scrooge mcducking through his money </joey>
<connor> I'm like oh here's another yowie video </connor>
<connor> please yeah but then you just figured </connor>
<connor> out that yowie was something that they </connor>
<connor> should demonetize and right then I I the </connor>
<garnt> videos just stopped getting views as </garnt>
<joey> well yeah yeah of course yeah my heart </joey>
<connor> being in the one percent I'm gonna tell </connor>
<garnt> you that right it's hard okay my safe </garnt>
<garnt> Works after my second Channel that's why </garnt>
<joey> I actually have to give it actually I'm </joey>
<joey> actually getting more videos demonetized </joey>
<connor> on my second Channel that I am on my </connor>
<garnt> Mains because you're making anime </garnt>
<garnt> see why do you think I stopped making </garnt>
<connor> anime content YouTube just doesn't like </connor>
<joey> anime </joey>
<connor> that's why everyone to stop and that's </connor>
<connor> why everyone stopped making anime </connor>
<connor> content about me basically horrible but </connor>
<joey> uh yeah you guys got to go to my home </joey>
<joey> country yeah we went to Thailand we just </joey>
<joey> came back from Thailand didn't really </joey>
<joey> post much about it </joey>
<joey> um just kind of went there I kind of </joey>
<joey> like invited you guys at very very last </joey>
<joey> minute to come yeah luckily you guys </joey>
<garnt> were free </garnt>
<connor> yesterday for like three days yeah I </connor>
<connor> think three days was the perfect amount </connor>
<joey> yeah really I wanted to be there a </joey>
<connor> little bit longer I mean I because we </connor>
<connor> because we only really got to explore </connor>
<joey> like kind of like I feel what is kind of </joey>
<joey> like a corner of Bangkok yeah with the </joey>
<connor> super touristy stuff we did yeah which </connor>
<joey> is fine because it's like that's how you </joey>
<garnt> get introduced to it of course it's </garnt>
<garnt> through the touristy stuff yeah yeah I </garnt>
<connor> don't know taking more than three days </connor>
<joey> off of work oh my God </joey>
<joey> yeah bro you literally cycle for eight </joey>
<connor> days what are you talking about yeah I </connor>
<joey> know but that was work though </joey>
<connor> if he's not if he's not filming it all </connor>
<joey> right well technically I filmed the Vlog </joey>
<garnt> so I did yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what your excuses yeah no </garnt>
<garnt> but it was great </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah I feel like no I I kind of agree </garnt>
<joey> like we did kind of go to all the </joey>
<joey> touristy places but I think that just </joey>
<joey> made me want to stay for a little bit </joey>
<joey> longer I think like next time before </joey>
<joey> where to go I definitely want to maybe I </joey>
<garnt> mean I don't know what's anything else </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of like took you to like let's </garnt>
<joey> say the more pristine clean areas uh </joey>
<joey> next time you're in Thailand we'd love </joey>
<joey> to say you to some of them all like </joey>
<joey> back-ends let's say like dirtier places </joey>
<joey> yeah because you can get a lot of </joey>
<garnt> interesting things there </garnt>
<joey> um do you guys have like a lot of like </joey>
<joey> islands and stuff like that oh yeah </joey>
<connor> there's a lot of the big tourist </connor>
<joey> destinations are they're like really </joey>
<joey> pretty Islands oh yeah that's I think </joey>
<joey> that's what I want to do now yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> sure yeah me too me too yeah I'll join </joey>
<joey> you on that one yeah hell yeah I I it </joey>
<joey> was an interesting experience from like </joey>
<joey> the moment we got off the plane it felt </joey>
<connor> very different this is the first time </connor>
<connor> I've gone to a country in a while where </connor>
<connor> uh I wasn't able to speak the language </connor>
<connor> the language remotely so yeah you know </connor>
<garnt> because we've been doing America and </garnt>
<connor> Japan which is like okay I know how to </connor>
<garnt> talk in Japan yeah yeah so it's kind of </garnt>
<connor> weird going to a place and being like </connor>
<connor> that guy again who couldn't he literally </connor>
<connor> was like please speak English I please I </connor>
<connor> felt bad but it was what it was but like </connor>
<connor> you get off the plane and immediately I </connor>
<connor> think American uh immigration has ruined </connor>
<connor> immigration for me which is I was </connor>
<connor> terrified right I was conditioned by </connor>
<connor> America to be terrified yeah and when we </connor>
<connor> get to the passport gate they literally </connor>
<connor> look at the passport for like one second </connor>
<connor> like get in yeah go go get inside with </connor>
<connor> you yeah in Thailand because like so </connor>
<connor> much of our economy is tourism I'm just </connor>
<connor> like that dude yeah I don't even like </connor>
<joey> did they even ask me </joey>
<connor> no question the dude didn't even talk to </connor>
<connor> me he </connor>
<joey> silently grabbed my passport looked at </joey>
<joey> it looked at my face stamped </joey>
<joey> I was like damn I should just say I'm </joey>
<joey> working let's see what happens </joey>
<connor> this [ __ ] felt too easy America I gotta </connor>
<garnt> ask questions just go to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> was the line long when you were when you </garnt>
<connor> got in no it was super it was super </connor>
<connor> quiet and uh then then I then the </connor>
<garnt> question was like oh [ __ ] it's not </garnt>
<garnt> America I can't like Uber or I can't do </garnt>
<garnt> anything right it's like [ __ ] I don't </garnt>
<garnt> have any money I don't have anything I </garnt>
<garnt> gotta take a taxi yeah yeah so we were </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] what do I do with the cabs and </connor>
<connor> I also don't have a SIM card I don't </connor>
<connor> have anything so I went over to the SIM </connor>
<connor> card right it was like three of them </connor>
<connor> they all look really sketchy I'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna lie yeah and uh I I'm like can I </connor>
<connor> have two SIM cards please it was like 10 </connor>
<connor> bucks each yeah and like yeah sure could </connor>
<connor> be your passport and then they would all </connor>
<connor> whip out their iPhones and start taking </connor>
<connor> pictures of my passport I'm like wait </connor>
<connor> what is what are you what is this </connor>
<connor> why are you ripping out iPhones what is </connor>
<connor> this I I was really confused I was like </connor>
<connor> what what's the were you guys taking </connor>
<connor> pictures for they're like oh we just </connor>
<joey> have to do this I'm like oh you're just </joey>
<joey> hot you know I don't know that's the </joey>
<connor> same boy and then I was like okay okay </connor>
<connor> and I was like can I pay by car they're </connor>
<connor> like cash only I'm like that's weird </connor>
<connor> um we're in an airport okay it's fine </connor>
<connor> it's fine I'll get some cash and then </connor>
<connor> come back give it to them yeah and then </connor>
<connor> I I'm like all right got my SIM cards go </connor>
<garnt> to get the taxi and I'm pretty sure I'm </garnt>
<garnt> getting ripped off right away yeah okay </garnt>
<garnt> because I I'm it's like they they want </garnt>
<garnt> to charge me uh something like 60 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> like USD right I know from from what </garnt>
<garnt> I've heard from Thailand that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> in Thailand that's extortional yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> is and I was like but will the taxi be </garnt>
<garnt> there right away and will will it be a </garnt>
<garnt> big taxi because there's like there's </garnt>
<garnt> like a group of us and they were like </garnt>
<garnt> yes I was like scam me take my money bro </garnt>
<connor> you paid 60 bucks for a taxi in Thailand </connor>
<connor> I think it was like 48 USD which is 100 </connor>
<connor> ripoff but dude we literally rocked out </connor>
<connor> right away and it was all ready together </connor>
<joey> yeah I think that's no question because </joey>
<connor> when I heard that from Connor right </connor>
<connor> again this is America corrupting my mind </connor>
<connor> I was like oh 60 bucks for like what is </connor>
<connor> it like a 40 minute like taxi ride I'm </connor>
<connor> like all right yeah that's fine it was a </connor>
<connor> big van it was like a big van that could </connor>
<garnt> you know obviously fit all of us yeah um </garnt>
<connor> but so you know in my head I was like </connor>
<garnt> okay yeah I mean that's not too bad but </garnt>
<connor> then the second time we got onto the </connor>
<connor> taxi and the guy </connor>
<joey> and I saw 30 Baht was the starting price </joey>
<connor> I'm like it's like 80 cents yeah it was </connor>
<connor> like a 30 minute cab ride was like 10 </connor>
<garnt> bucks I was like what the [ __ ] not even </garnt>
<joey> it was like it was insane yeah it sounds </joey>
<garnt> like Japan could never yeah I mean like </garnt>
<garnt> uh first rule when you come if you ever </garnt>
<joey> come to Thailand and pretty much every </joey>
<joey> Southeast Asian country </joey>
<connor> um if you get a taxi meter only like if </connor>
<joey> if you really really need to they will </joey>
<garnt> try to like get a fixed price yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> noticed this yeah I'm trying to do I get </garnt>
<garnt> it I look white as [ __ ] I got it you </garnt>
<connor> should scam me yeah like he would I was </connor>
<connor> like Hey I'm going here and he just said </connor>
<garnt> something I didn't get it I was like </garnt>
<joey> he's like three or something guys </joey>
<garnt> afterwards who's asking for like five </garnt>
<joey> times the price up front and then I </joey>
<garnt> think like at one point we split up into </garnt>
<garnt> two taxis Joey went and then I went yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we all went the same direction and I </garnt>
<garnt> told him I wanted I wanted the meter </garnt>
<connor> yeah he paid the 300. my thing came like </connor>
<joey> a hundred or something yeah so I paid </joey>
<joey> like a third of what Joey to be fair </joey>
<joey> that 300 Baht uh taxi ride I remember </joey>
<garnt> because we were heading to uh the big </garnt>
<garnt> markets I forgot what the name of it was </garnt>
<connor> uh yeah that one right um so we were </connor>
<connor> heading there </connor>
<connor> um and I told the guy that you know we </connor>
<connor> were heading there and this guy clearly </connor>
<garnt> was very excited right right that it was </garnt>
<connor> like oh he's taking a tourist right yeah </connor>
<garnt> so he was trying the entire 30-minute </garnt>
<connor> taxi ride this guy was trying so hard to </connor>
<connor> sell me on this Market that we were </connor>
<connor> heading but the only thing he could say </connor>
<connor> was 14 Market 14 market </connor>
<joey> and he would just repeat that for 30 </joey>
<joey> minutes and I'm like yeah I get a borrow </joey>
<joey> there's 14 of them I get it and then </joey>
<connor> every time I would respond he'd just </connor>
<connor> laugh and Go Thailand happy happy </connor>
<connor> and I was like I'm like yeah you see you </connor>
<connor> seem very happy about it yeah but uh </connor>
<connor> yeah no it was like I think that's like </connor>
<connor> one thing about like that I guess uh if </connor>
<connor> you can call it the Southeast Asian like </connor>
<connor> living experience right it's like </connor>
<connor> everyone's just so chill and it's just </connor>
<connor> like so happy that you're there they're </connor>
<connor> like because you know you very rarely </connor>
<connor> get anything like that in Japan right </connor>
<connor> like maybe in Okinawa right you would </connor>
<connor> get someone that talkative and that like </connor>
<connor> people are trying to express people </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah that's that's one of the big </connor>
<connor> reasons why I moved out of Thailand </connor>
<garnt> after living there for like three four </garnt>
<connor> years yeah nothing done </connor>
<joey> I noticed as well dude people just don't </joey>
<connor> indicate ever </connor>
<connor> yeah they seem like a pointless thing </connor>
<connor> like this dude we were like an hour ride </connor>
<connor> didn't touch his [ __ ] indicators once </connor>
<joey> they would either not touch the </joey>
<garnt> indicator or when say they wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> Signal going into the left lane yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they would flick the indicator on for </garnt>
<garnt> half a second yeah </garnt>
<joey> like no one saw that literally literally </joey>
<joey> the mood when you're driving into </joey>
<joey> Ireland it's just like who's gonna stop </joey>
<garnt> me who's gonna stop me because because </garnt>
<joey> literally you just have to like go yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah I swear it makes traffic slower </joey>
<connor> because everyone's being selfish yeah </connor>
<joey> and it's just slowing everything down </joey>
<joey> the moment the taxi just starts driving </joey>
<connor> off I can just see the objective survive </connor>
<connor> yeah it's so scary to be in the front </connor>
<connor> it's like you are getting tantalizingly </connor>
<garnt> close to these like especially the bikes </garnt>
<garnt> as well oh my God I mean like I knew </garnt>
<garnt> southeast Asia had a lot of bikes right </garnt>
<garnt> because you know I've been to the </garnt>
<connor> Philippines yeah but like Jesus Christ </connor>
<connor> these bikes are [ __ ] speed demoning </connor>
<garnt> through these like trucks and all these </garnt>
<joey> taxis you know avoiding the lanes and </joey>
<garnt> stuff like that I'm like how does how do </garnt>
<garnt> you how does anyone survive oh I mean </garnt>
<garnt> like it's just like it like I said in </garnt>
<garnt> Thailand and mostly Southeast Asian </garnt>
<garnt> countries you just need Ultra instincts </garnt>
<joey> yeah she's like to like survive right </joey>
<joey> because this like you are constantly </joey>
<joey> just checking every mirror possible </joey>
<connor> because it's not the cars you need to </connor>
<joey> worry about it's the motorcycle oh yeah </joey>
<connor> okay I don't you know what I don't in in </connor>
<connor> the in the uh environment of driving in </connor>
<connor> Thailand I don't care if a car doesn't </connor>
<connor> indicate that's just normal you know </connor>
<garnt> um but if you're changing a lane there </garnt>
<garnt> is you you always have this Instinct </garnt>
<garnt> that there is going to be a motorcycle </garnt>
<garnt> driving pass or a motorcycle doing </garnt>
<joey> something bro some of these taxi drivers </joey>
<connor> have like the periphery of a deer like </connor>
<garnt> they just like they can see behind </garnt>
<connor> without looking back it's like yeah I </connor>
<joey> can see I can sense two bicycles </joey>
<joey> concerning about the lack of indicating </joey>
<joey> is like holy [ __ ] if you're driving on a </joey>
<connor> motorbike my God you're just praying </connor>
<garnt> that people aren't being dicks yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly and honestly like it's </garnt>
<garnt> Thailand's one of those like Michael's </garnt>
<connor> one of those cities where you risk </connor>
<connor> people risk their lives daily going on </connor>
<connor> motorcycles me included uh because the </connor>
<connor> traffic's so bad yes right and uh </connor>
<connor> there's some sometimes there's just no </connor>
<connor> system in place right now bangkok's </connor>
<connor> still very much a developing City yeah </connor>
<connor> uh especially with this public transport </connor>
<connor> that sometimes uh you choose getting </connor>
<connor> stuck in a traffic jam for two hours or </connor>
<garnt> it's a 20 minute taxi ride which one are </garnt>
<garnt> you gonna take and you're like well I'm </garnt>
<garnt> risking my life life but that 20 minute </garnt>
<garnt> taxi right that 20 minute motorcycle </garnt>
<garnt> ride looks damn appealing right now man </garnt>
<garnt> ain't gonna lie </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah did you guys go on like the </garnt>
<connor> tuk-tuks as well yeah </connor>
<connor> that was interesting because again like </connor>
<connor> it was like a five minute ride and the </connor>
<connor> dude was like 300. I was like I was like </connor>
<connor> dude I'm like yeah this this looks like </connor>
<connor> it weighs 10 pounds there's no way the </connor>
<connor> guess the gas usage in a year is </connor>
<joey> probably not even 10 bucks what are you </joey>
<joey> talking about I saw I remember the first </joey>
<joey> time we wrote the talk talks at night </joey>
<garnt> like Connor did like a full one game </garnt>
<garnt> move and the guy was like 300 but </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you know we couldn't all fit </garnt>
<garnt> into one talk talk yeah I can only see </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like what three people at most </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so we had to get two talks and </garnt>
<joey> Conor did like a big movie where he's </joey>
<joey> like all right let's do a package deal </joey>
<connor> yeah 500 for two well originally I was </connor>
<garnt> like 200 and even then I know 200 is too </garnt>
<connor> much stuff yeah I'm like hey you can </connor>
<connor> scam me but just give me this I just </connor>
<connor> want to bother yeah I actually feel like </connor>
<joey> I belong here yeah yeah I bought it with </joey>
<connor> him yeah obviously I knew I was getting </connor>
<joey> ripped off yeah I was like 200 and he </joey>
<joey> was like no uh 250 and I was like 250 </joey>
<connor> for both and he's like all right sure </connor>
<connor> then he shout to the dude who had no </connor>
<connor> affiliation to him behind him being like </connor>
<joey> we're taking them both for 250 yeah I </joey>
<joey> didn't know what the guy said but I </joey>
<joey> could make it out pretty much he said </joey>
<connor> follow me and make 250. </connor>
<garnt> he didn't tell him where we were going </garnt>
<joey> to follow me and holy [ __ ] these things </joey>
<garnt> felt dangerous dude oh they are no seat </garnt>
<garnt> belts you're holding on for dear life </garnt>
<connor> the dude's going like 60 miles an hour </connor>
<connor> and you're like holy [ __ ] this is cool </connor>
<joey> but oh my God I'm gonna die I don't know </joey>
<joey> if you saw but like before we went on to </joey>
<connor> those two talks there was like a group </connor>
<connor> of about six people in front of us right </connor>
<connor> and I thought we had to wait a little </connor>
<connor> bit right because I saw like you know </connor>
<connor> while we were driving on the road these </connor>
<connor> talk to you know maybe fit two people on </connor>
<connor> average right maybe three if you </connor>
<connor> squeezed in but there was a group of </connor>
<connor> about six of them they all got into one </connor>
<connor> tuk-tuk and they're just like he </connor>
<connor> literally cramped in this tiny little </connor>
<connor> thing and they're like yeah a hotel </connor>
<garnt> please I'm like bro </garnt>
<garnt> turn into a clown car dude sometimes it </garnt>
<joey> is extremely tightly packed and I was </joey>
<garnt> like that I mean it's dangerous already </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and that felt like why not why </connor>
<garnt> not add more risk yeah because I've seen </garnt>
<joey> like entire families get on these like </joey>
<joey> motorcycles you know like yeah they put </joey>
<joey> like their two children at the front and </joey>
<joey> the the parents are sitting on and then </joey>
<garnt> uh on top of that they have their </garnt>
<garnt> shopping on their like motorcycles they </garnt>
<garnt> are packing these things up to the brim </garnt>
<joey> I I it's just it just I think what blew </joey>
<joey> my mind for one was just not only the </joey>
<joey> sheer amount of motorcycles that are on </joey>
<garnt> the road but also just like how casual </garnt>
<garnt> people are driving these things through </garnt>
<garnt> that environment like I remember I saw </garnt>
<garnt> you know usually when you're on the back </garnt>
<garnt> of a motorcycle right yeah the first </garnt>
<garnt> thing is like you know make sure you're </garnt>
<connor> sitting in front you know holding on to </connor>
<connor> the driver right yeah maybe wearing a </connor>
<joey> helmet if you want to be extra careful </joey>
<connor> yeah I remember </connor>
<connor> wearing a helmet no first of all no one </connor>
<joey> was wearing a helmet second of all I </joey>
<joey> remember I saw this woman who was </joey>
<connor> sitting to the side not holding on to </connor>
<connor> anything just looking at a phone what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] oh no meanwhile this </connor>
<joey> motorcycle's just it's just sitting </joey>
<connor> there like yeah all right tell me </connor>
<joey> like you know like Jason Bourne like </joey>

<joey> motorcycle yeah </joey>
<joey> that's a nice ride yeah that's that's a </joey>
<garnt> pretty cool motorcycles yourself yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's actually a pretty normal way for </joey>
<joey> women to sit on the motorcycles because </joey>
<joey> a lot of times if they're wearing skirts </joey>
<joey> right like uh you know they want to they </joey>
<garnt> want to sit kind of like that because it </garnt>
<garnt> looks a bit more elegant and they don't </garnt>
<joey> need to like but like at least you know </joey>
<joey> like if I if I had to sit like that I </joey>
<garnt> would at least like hold on to something </garnt>
<garnt> this one was just freehand one hand on a </garnt>
<garnt> phone she looks like she was waiting for </garnt>
<garnt> a doctor like you know it was just the </garnt>
<garnt> most casual like yep all right uh I know </garnt>
<joey> my life's in danger right now but I </joey>
<joey> really gotta check Twitter you know I </joey>
<garnt> just there's this bang it's weird I have </garnt>
<joey> to retweet this right now yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> like it's it's definitely like no matter </joey>
<connor> how much I have described it in the past </connor>
<connor> there's nothing that I can like </connor>
<connor> replicate the feeling of just the </connor>
<connor> insanity </connor>
<connor> Southeast Asian roads and just how the </connor>
<connor> rules work over there </connor>
<connor> um it's it's a free throw and it's </connor>
<connor> always been a free-forow and and kind of </connor>
<connor> like every taxi you go to especially </connor>
<connor> especially if you're gonna if you're a </connor>
<connor> foreigner they're gonna try to battle </connor>
<garnt> with you and they're trying you're gonna </garnt>
<connor> try and get the best price possible oh </connor>
<connor> yeah dude everyone you've got us that </connor>
<connor> taxi dude it was like at the moment they </connor>
<garnt> saw us wanting a cab like yeah 20 dude </garnt>
<garnt> spawned they were all shouting </garnt>
<garnt> was like I don't know who you were </garnt>
<garnt> talking to I think you were talking to </garnt>
<connor> the crowd and you were just like no no </connor>
<connor> no it was weird it was just like God was </connor>
<joey> like I want a taxi yeah yeah it wasn't </joey>
<joey> until a lot later maybe because I was </joey>
<joey> drunk but it wasn't until a lot later I </joey>
<garnt> realized that they were all taxi drivers </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I thought we were just getting </garnt>
<garnt> jumped by like 20 dudes I was like God </garnt>
<joey> you're okay and I was like oh they're </joey>
<garnt> all taxi drivers yeah because like what </garnt>
<garnt> happens is obviously uh I took the um I </garnt>
<joey> took them to a place called Asiatique </joey>
<joey> which is </joey>
<joey> which is like a really nice bougie place </joey>
<joey> right by the river uh in Bangkok uh but </joey>
<connor> they needed to go home uh to the hotel </connor>
<connor> and so I know how it works you go over </connor>
<connor> they see a group of tourists and like a </connor>
<connor> group like a group of NPCs basically </connor>
<connor> will just support you know and and uh </connor>
<connor> one of them comes up and goes like Oh </connor>
<connor> 300 Baht and I'm like </connor>
<connor> if you are willing to speak yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> like I am not a Taurus I I will not even </connor>
<connor> attempt to like take this number can </connor>
<joey> anyone say give me a better number and </joey>
<joey> as soon as I as soon as I just ignored </joey>
<connor> the guy two other dudes would be like </connor>
<connor> well we'll do it for half the price and </connor>
<connor> I remember I remember like uh turning </connor>
<connor> back to Conor and I'm and I'm like is </connor>
<connor> this price I gave for you and Connor's </connor>
<connor> like go go a bit lower go a bit and so </connor>
<garnt> I'm like I'm like okay I'm like </garnt>
<connor> bother them yeah I was like I want to </connor>
<garnt> see how good this bothering is right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and so uh Conor's like get it </garnt>
<garnt> lower and I was like actually I did not </garnt>
<connor> even she passed by the way no no no no </connor>
<garnt> no no you just don't want to be ripped </garnt>
<garnt> because the time I didn't want to have </garnt>
<garnt> to deal with change anyway I was like </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] just yeah okay so so this </garnt>
<connor> is what do they see how much he could </connor>
<connor> bother them I was I was curious for me </connor>
<connor> yeah sometimes you seem like I'm like no </connor>
<connor> I will not pay five bucks for taxes no </connor>
<garnt> because uh like the thing is no matter </garnt>
<garnt> what price if if you agree on a price </garnt>
<garnt> basically if you could agree on a fixed </garnt>
<garnt> price it's always going to be higher </garnt>
<garnt> than the metered price no matter what </garnt>
<connor> otherwise it or not like it was like a </connor>
<connor> 10 not even 10 like a seven minute </connor>
<garnt> Journey it would have been like 50 on </garnt>
<garnt> the meter yeah exactly so no matter what </garnt>
<garnt> you agree to so it's kind of like the </garnt>
<connor> price you agreed to to just have the </connor>
<connor> convenience of of of just being like I </connor>
<connor> can't be asked to deal with this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] let's just like agree for a </connor>
<joey> prize just yeah it's basically paid away </joey>
<joey> so yeah Conor Conor I I kind of did them </joey>
<connor> a bit dirty a little bit because I'm </connor>
<connor> like bro come on I'm tired man come on </connor>
<connor> dude do me a favor do me a favor man </connor>
<connor> like you know you can you can go a </connor>
<connor> little bit lower because uh in Thailand </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure most other Southeast Asian </connor>
<connor> countries if you're speaking that </connor>
<connor> language and if you're off their </connor>
<connor> nationality then they're gonna they're </connor>
<connor> gonna do it a little bit lower so I'm </connor>
<connor> like do for your bro man do you for a </connor>
<connor> brother and he's like all right two </connor>
<connor> taxis just for you for that price that </connor>
<connor> you want I'm like cool and I'm like all </connor>
<connor> right boys get in the taxis and I'm like </connor>
<connor> like pushing them to get in the taxis </connor>
<connor> and then everyone gets in the taxi me </connor>
<connor> and Sydney are staying in another place </connor>
<connor> because we're going back home and he's </connor>
<connor> like are you not getting in I'm like no </connor>
<connor> just take my friends </connor>
<connor> I'm like </connor>
<connor> yeah but that's that's yeah that's kind </connor>
<garnt> of like especially especially like the </garnt>
<connor> tourist culture in Thailand you know </connor>
<connor> there's there's no 50 as well there's no </connor>
<garnt> 50 note they have a 20 note oh there </garnt>
<garnt> there is there's a 52. </garnt>
<joey> yeah see this once really yeah I did not </joey>
<connor> have any these are mythical things I </connor>
<joey> never saw oh dude I I I've collected </joey>
<connor> those like Pokemon cards </connor>
<connor> every time the the ride was we agreed on </connor>
<joey> like 150 yeah I was like what I can't </joey>
<connor> ask him for 50 change after I just </connor>
<joey> bottomed him down I feel kind of cheeky </joey>
<connor> you know what I mean really so I would </connor>
<joey> just like just just keep the 200. it's </joey>
<joey> fine I don't know I was like </joey>
<connor> it's like I know you're already ripping </connor>
<connor> me off I think we bought uh at one point </connor>
<joey> as well that we bought the most </joey>
<joey> expensive Pad Thai oh really oh yeah we </joey>
<joey> got we got scammed 100 and I know if you </joey>
<garnt> if I told you I paid best month for a </garnt>
<connor> pad thai I think you'd kill me how much </connor>
<garnt> I don't think I paid for Pad Thai mind </garnt>
<joey> you mind you it was it was it was four </joey>
<joey> probably you know like maybe that big I </joey>
<joey> didn't know how big the past it was a </joey>
<connor> family size I didn't know how much the </connor>
<connor> pad thai was until after I bought it and </connor>
<connor> I was like excuse me </connor>
<connor> 150. </connor>
<connor> very cute guys I paid we paid 750 for a </connor>
<connor> pet shop </connor>
<connor> oh my God </connor>
<connor> I I knew when we paid it I the only </connor>
<connor> thing I felt bad about is like God's </connor>
<connor> gonna be so ashamed yeah I didn't mind </connor>
<connor> because I was like hey I don't mind </connor>
<joey> getting scammed a little bit yes the </joey>
<joey> food was good it was great it was good </joey>
<joey> Pad Thai to be fair I mean all of it was </joey>
<joey> good yeah I don't think I had a bad </joey>
<joey> maybe you'd thought it was bad pad thai </joey>
<garnt> too all right I mean Pad Thai is like </garnt>
<garnt> pretty hard to uh [ __ ] up because uh pad </garnt>
<garnt> thai is the like I guess it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> most kind of like uh common dish </garnt>
<joey> especially when tourist comes in that </joey>
<joey> they want to try uh when I was like </joey>
<joey> trying to show you right I was trying to </joey>
<joey> find a store and a store that actually </joey>
<joey> did some of the noodles that I liked but </joey>
<joey> every store was like no we only do Pad </joey>
<joey> Thai here and I'm like okay we're in a </joey>
<joey> touristy area uh I wanted to show you </joey>
<connor> guys some other like more spicier maybe </connor>
<connor> less no noodle dishes especially like </connor>
<connor> Drunken Noodles for some reason well </connor>
<connor> I'll try that yeah and unfortunately uh </connor>
<joey> Drunken Noodles are normally so uh sold </joey>
<joey> where there's a lot of like dirty bars </joey>

<joey> a three dollar trial set back to the </joey>
<garnt> episode but yeah the reason these two </garnt>
<garnt> boys came to Thailand to visit and </garnt>
<joey> everything was because uh I finally 100 </joey>
<joey> did my wedding guys my third one is done </joey>
<joey> it's all done now all of the family is </joey>
<garnt> appeased no one is complaining anymore </garnt>
<joey> with everyone has had a chance to go he </joey>
<joey> has all the Collectibles I have I </joey>
<garnt> literally have I collected them all now </garnt>
<joey> everything everything </joey>
<joey> um but it's it's funny because </joey>
<joey> this uh we decided to do like a </joey>
<joey> traditional like of like a traditional </joey>
<joey> Thai ceremony we could have just had </joey>
<joey> like the reception everything like that </joey>
<garnt> but my parents were like no </garnt>
<garnt> um we want to do the traditional Thai </garnt>
<garnt> ceremony just because you've never seen </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah so even though I'm like talking </garnt>
<garnt> like about the Thai ceremony and this is </garnt>
<garnt> your guys's first Thai ceremony it was </garnt>
<garnt> also my first Thai ceremony as well </garnt>
<joey> that's interesting yeah yeah it was cool </joey>
<joey> like it was I don't know it was a lot </joey>
<connor> more I guess not free-flowing it's not </connor>
<connor> the right word I guess more casual than </connor>
<connor> I thought it was going to be because </connor>
<connor> like I'm because you know I've been to </connor>
<garnt> like traditional Japanese weddings right </garnt>
<garnt> and that's like you know a 500 page </garnt>
<connor> script that you have to follow right </connor>
<garnt> yeah whereas like this one felt like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like as you said it was a wedding </garnt>
<garnt> of course but it was more like just a </garnt>
<garnt> celebration of like family getting </garnt>
<garnt> together and just like shooting the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which I think I really appreciated </garnt>
<connor> because like I was expecting it to be </connor>
<connor> like really super uptight and like very </connor>
<connor> formal and you know they were like </connor>
<connor> obviously very formal parts of it like </connor>
<connor> the the Buddhist monk thing was like </connor>
<connor> super freaking cool yeah um but then you </connor>
<joey> know I had to do like 10 push-ups for </joey>
<garnt> you as well which was weird yeah so to </garnt>
<garnt> to explain everything that kind of went </garnt>
<joey> down at this wedding so uh normally you </joey>
<joey> start off in the morning and normally </joey>
<joey> the morning is the part where you do the </joey>
<joey> serious kind of blessings that's right </joey>
<joey> uh we started off at about like like </joey>
<connor> before before anything actually these </connor>
<connor> two boys asked me what do I wear do I do </connor>
<connor> I wear a suit or something like that or </connor>
<garnt> Thai yeah and I was like no uh wear a </garnt>
<joey> Hawaiian shirt Hawaiian shirts shorts </joey>
<garnt> and thongs </garnt>
<joey> speaking my language exactly I mean it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's hard enough in Thailand man we </joey>
<connor> were like no nobody wears suits we're </connor>
<connor> going like all casual the only one who </connor>
<connor> really wore kind of a more traditional </connor>
<connor> Thai attire uh was me and Sydney so we </connor>
<connor> had gotten dressed early in the morning </connor>
<connor> and even then </connor>
<connor> what I wore in My Thai wedding compared </connor>
<connor> to what I wore in my you know other </connor>
<connor> wedding uh in England was a lot less </connor>
<connor> layers it was just one kind of like </connor>
<connor> traditional Thai suit yeah and like very </connor>
<connor> very airy and baggy pants is cool they </connor>
<connor> were actually really comfy yeah I kind </connor>
<connor> of like after I like they I had the </connor>
<joey> opportunity to get changed earlier in </joey>
<joey> the day but I was like I don't like this </joey>
<joey> I kind of like this ride now it looks </joey>
<joey> really cool yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> um but one thing I kind of like wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> prepared for actually was uh uh this was </garnt>
<garnt> like my the only time that I had got my </garnt>
<connor> makeup done yeah I noticed you're doing </connor>
<joey> makeup and I was like wow God looks like </joey>
<joey> he's been airbrushed yeah okay yeah is </joey>
<connor> wearing makeup like a traditional thing </connor>
<connor> or is that sound like your mom was like </connor>
<joey> hey I got you hooked up honest you look </joey>
<joey> like as [ __ ] bro let me fix it yeah I </joey>
<garnt> think I think uh for Thai weddings you </garnt>
<garnt> they most people wanted to look as good </garnt>
<garnt> as you can in photos and everything like </garnt>
<garnt> that but the difference is most people </garnt>
<connor> don't trust themselves some make </connor>
<connor> themselves look as good as they can </connor>
<connor> um so my mum hired like a makeup artist </connor>
<connor> and then the day before she was like Oh </connor>
<connor> no you're getting your makeup done as </connor>
<connor> well I'm like what what do you mean I'm </connor>
<joey> getting my wake up done and uh so yeah I </joey>
<joey> got my makeup done I think God damn it's </joey>
<joey> I gotta say he was eyebrows on fleek </joey>
<joey> girls </joey>
<garnt> respect to you girls man holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> makeup is uncomfortable oh that was </garnt>
<joey> awful wait so you got just like I think </joey>
<joey> you got like your cheeks done and like </joey>
<garnt> your eyes a little bit and the lip gloss </garnt>
<connor> as well the lip gloss was the thing that </connor>
<connor> like annoyed me the most oh yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you look like an ad </connor>
<garnt> yeah so I got I got ready and got my </garnt>
<connor> makeup done in the morning and then the </connor>
<connor> monks came at around 10 o'clock </connor>
<connor> um and their ceremony they're you know </connor>
<connor> praying blessing ceremony lasts for </connor>
<joey> about 30 minutes to 45 minutes and </joey>
<joey> basically they kind of just pray and </joey>
<joey> give Their Blessings and everything like </joey>
<connor> that I mean you boys it was very cool </connor>
<connor> yeah well they started uh singing that </connor>
<joey> was pretty hype yeah that was [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> cool it was so cool yeah because I I </garnt>
<garnt> remember we were having this like </garnt>
<connor> ceremony and obviously Sydney's parents </connor>
<connor> and family were there as well and uh my </connor>
<connor> dad was like oh the my my uh Sydney's </connor>
<connor> mum and dad was like oh that was such a </connor>
<connor> beautiful part to uh such a beautiful </connor>
<connor> ceremony to be a part of thank you for </connor>
<connor> inviting us and showing us part of your </connor>
<garnt> culture and everything and then Sydney's </garnt>
<garnt> uncle was also there and he just goes to </garnt>
<garnt> me man those monks got bars </garnt>
<garnt> I was like yeah yeah but it's it it </garnt>
<connor> makes sense it makes sense because </connor>
<connor> um I didn't realize this when I was </connor>
<connor> because you know I've been a monk and </connor>
<connor> everything like that I didn't realize </connor>
<joey> this but there's a certain Rhythm </joey>
<joey> rhythmic quality wow when they are </joey>
<connor> praying and everything uh because you </connor>
<connor> know there's how it works is there's is </connor>
<connor> only one head monk that starts off a </connor>
<connor> verse let's say and they they say a few </connor>
<connor> sentences they chant a few sentences of </connor>
<joey> this verse and then everyone else joins </joey>
<joey> us afterwards yeah and it's kind of it </joey>
<joey> the whole reason why Buddhist monks pray </joey>
<joey> is not because we're praying to a god or </joey>
<joey> anything like that because we don't have </joey>
<joey> a God in Buddhism but it's it's kind of </joey>
<joey> to get us in the rights mindsets to </joey>
<joey> meditate to be a monk and everything and </joey>
<joey> with I kind of realized after talking to </joey>
<joey> Sydney's mum and dad why </joey>
<joey> the prayer kind of has this effect </joey>
<joey> because when you're praying when you </joey>
<joey> have that kind of rhythmic prayer going </joey>
<joey> on for like an hour sometimes your mind </joey>
<joey> kind of goes into this hypnotic stance </joey>
<joey> State it's like a trance it's like a </joey>
<joey> trance yeah kind of and then that gives </joey>
<joey> you that gets you into the right mindset </joey>
<joey> to live the monk life and to meditate </joey>
<joey> afterwards as well </joey>
<connor> um and yeah I think it's I'm really glad </connor>
<connor> you've always got to experience it </connor>
<connor> because it can be like a very powerful </connor>
<connor> experience sometimes because that was we </connor>
<garnt> had 10 monks in just my house but in a </garnt>
<garnt> temple uh especially when I was among we </garnt>
<connor> had a we had a temple with a hundred </connor>
<connor> monks that sounds crazy yeah so you're </connor>
<garnt> in you're in the temple when this </garnt>
<garnt> massive hall and then yeah you hear the </garnt>
<garnt> you hear the head monks start praying </garnt>
<garnt> and in my mind in my temple we needed to </garnt>
<garnt> know all of the prayers by heart right </garnt>
<garnt> so I needed to memorize them so I need I </garnt>
<garnt> knew when when the head monk started </garnt>
<garnt> starting a line I would know when to </garnt>
<garnt> come in and I would know when to start </garnt>
<garnt> praying as well and you all join in and </garnt>
<garnt> the ambience and the sounds that just </garnt>
<garnt> vibrates throughout the entire Temple </garnt>
<garnt> it's something like some something I </garnt>
<garnt> can't really explain via words but it it </garnt>
<garnt> feels really really powerful oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> even even just with the 10 monks in in </joey>
<joey> your house like it was yeah I mean like </joey>
<joey> it just the fact that everyone was just </joey>
<joey> you know very silent and a lot of us </joey>
<joey> were like closing our eyes and you know </joey>
<joey> um just trying to like take it all in it </joey>
<joey> was like yeah I don't know it felt very </joey>
<connor> otherworldly you know it was uh because </connor>
<connor> you know because Japan has a similar </connor>
<connor> thing as well yeah and like funerals and </connor>
<connor> stuff like that uh but yeah every time I </connor>
<connor> hear I don't know what it is every time </connor>
<connor> I hear that sound it just puts me like I </connor>
<garnt> can just feel my body floating away if </garnt>
<connor> that makes sense you know it's just </connor>
<joey> something about it and you don't even </joey>
<joey> have to like know the words yeah at all </joey>
<garnt> either I mean they're not even speaking </garnt>
<joey> Thai oh really it's like it's uh I think </joey>
<joey> the language is like Sanskrit I don't </joey>
<joey> know what the English translation name </joey>
<joey> of it is but it's it's like an ancient </joey>
<connor> language so okay yeah they're not </connor>
<connor> actually they're not actually chanting </connor>
<joey> Thai it's uh it's a more older language </joey>
<connor> which is why you need to memorize it </connor>
<joey> right um which is why I need to memorize </joey>
<joey> it because I don't actually know what </joey>
<garnt> they're saying it's it's an basically I </garnt>
<garnt> I would say it's more equivalent to them </garnt>
<garnt> chanting Latin if we were in like </garnt>
<connor> European language right yeah I was </connor>
<connor> trying to figure out when when I was </connor>
<connor> supposed to pray I was like everyone's </connor>
<connor> face in their eyes okay okay yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so I want to be respectful guy was </connor>
<joey> just sitting there while I'm so like I'm </joey>
<connor> like all right well yeah yeah even </connor>
<connor> though I don't personally you know </connor>
<joey> believe in it yeah I still like to </joey>
<joey> respect in the culture especially if </joey>
<joey> they're inviting me yeah no it was yeah </joey>
<joey> I remember that actually it was so funny </joey>
<joey> because you know when they started </joey>
<joey> chanting and you know most people in the </joey>
<joey> room were you know signed to pray yeah </joey>
<joey> and and I joined in and I remember </joey>
<joey> halfway through I looked up and your mom </joey>
<joey> is just standing there with me phone </joey>
<joey> like this yeah </joey>
<connor> just seem like Unstoppable and like it's </connor>
<joey> like no matter what is happening they </joey>
<connor> will be doing what they want to do yeah </connor>
<garnt> it could be like the most important </garnt>
<garnt> thing ever and they'll be like guys get </garnt>
<connor> closer I'm taking a shot you know it's </connor>
<connor> like whoa there's like what oh wow </connor>
<connor> it's such a power move no I'll I'll </connor>
<connor> definitely get to that point because I </connor>
<connor> being that definitely reminded me of one </connor>
<connor> thing uh which I'll get back to but um </connor>
<connor> yeah one I at the moment at the </connor>
<connor> beginning I was trying to like tell </connor>
<connor> Sydney everything that she had to do </connor>
<connor> everything she could expect with the </connor>
<connor> monk thing and then when when the mouse </connor>
<connor> got there I'm just like just follow my </connor>
<connor> lead Sydney there's too much going on </connor>
<connor> because there's one thing I forgot to </connor>
<connor> tell her about which is at the end </connor>
<connor> um we light a candle uh for the Monk and </connor>
<connor> the monk like melts this wax onto like </connor>
<joey> um a bowl of water which they will then </joey>
<connor> kind of like spray onto US oh yeah right </connor>
<joey> um I knew this was going to happen </joey>
<joey> because there's uh what do I call it </joey>
<connor> like I not exactly spray but there's a </connor>
<connor> bunch of like sticks bundled up together </connor>
<connor> that will they were dipped into the </connor>
<joey> water they will pray bless the water </joey>
<connor> then can I flick it into like the onto </connor>
<connor> the crowd sprinkle yeah like sprinkle </connor>
<connor> sprinkle uh Sydney didn't know this uh I </connor>
<connor> I knew this was coming so I've done this </connor>
<connor> ever since I was kid and I and so I knew </connor>
<connor> when when the when you when the monk is </connor>
<connor> about to kind of uh spray everyone just </connor>
<connor> put your head down put your head down </connor>
<connor> Sydney Sydney didn't know this so she </connor>
<garnt> was she was just praying in like a very </garnt>
<garnt> nice kind of mindset gets a face full of </garnt>
<connor> water from the market she's like she's </connor>
<joey> like Madame too soon because like we </joey>
<joey> were we were kind of in the back of the </joey>
<connor> whole thing when it happened and of </connor>
<connor> course none of us knew that was coming </connor>
<connor> out here so I'm just like you know </connor>
<garnt> silently closing my eyes and praying and </garnt>
<connor> then I get the AOE splash down </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like is this test like is am I </garnt>
<connor> am I supposed to just like remain calm </connor>
<joey> and then everyone's just getting like </joey>
<connor> splashed you didn't get it at all right </connor>
<connor> no I didn't I heard like didus and you </connor>
<connor> kind of make a noise yeah cause I was </connor>
<connor> behind you so I didn't get anything like </connor>
<garnt> that yeah so you're you're in uh you're </garnt>
<joey> in the spouse </joey>
<connor> yeah that's a wide AOE dude oh my God </connor>
<connor> and then there was a there's a few other </connor>
<connor> ceremonies and stuff and uh there's one </connor>
<connor> thing with like your elders or something </connor>
<garnt> yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> um so after the monk thing </garnt>
<garnt> um there's this ceremony uh then we get </garnt>
<garnt> to the fun part there's a ceremony which </garnt>
<garnt> um is called uh Gun Mark which how can I </garnt>
<garnt> describe this ceremony the best way I </garnt>
<garnt> can describe it it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> replicating old ancient traditions where </garnt>
<joey> you present the groom to the household </joey>
<joey> of the brides right </joey>
<joey> um so what happens is uh you separate </joey>
<joey> the two households you separate the two </joey>
<joey> families which is what we did Sydney's </joey>
<joey> family was in my house and we had walked </joey>
<joey> to our neighbor's house yeah and if you </joey>
<joey> can call that a house if you can call </joey>
<joey> that a house yeah some some of our </joey>
<joey> neighbors got pretty wild with their </joey>
<joey> house more like a Disneyland looking </joey>
<connor> Place yeah it was kind of wild yeah I </connor>
<connor> was like what the hell yeah and so what </connor>
<connor> happens is </connor>
<connor> um you separate the two houses you have </connor>
<connor> the groom side and you have the bride </connor>
<connor> side and the whole concept is all the </connor>
<garnt> groom side has to come together to help </garnt>
<garnt> the groom kind of be able to prove to </garnt>
<garnt> the bride's family that they are worthy </garnt>
<joey> to marry the bride right </joey>
<joey> um it was basically an escort Mission it </joey>
<garnt> was an escort Mission thought like we </garnt>
<garnt> went my parents went full like force </garnt>
<garnt> were there where they </garnt>
<garnt> um they hired like traditional dancers </garnt>
<joey> and like traditional like musicians uh </joey>
<joey> so we separated the houses and then you </joey>
<joey> started off with like kind of like a </joey>
<joey> king kong Tarzan kind of chance yeah you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<connor> by the front day we had like some </connor>
<garnt> traditional Thai dancers it felt super </garnt>
<connor> weird yeah I'll I'll be honest crazy </connor>
<connor> you're so fun though they were just like </connor>
<joey> go here guy yeah I was like what am I </joey>
<joey> doing yeah I don't know what I don't </joey>
<connor> know what the [ __ ] is yeah economy </connor>
<connor> indictis were given like a Play-Doh like </connor>
<connor> desserts or something we're just like </connor>
<garnt> hold this and I'm like I don't know </garnt>
<joey> what's happening and then the drums </joey>
<garnt> stopped playing I'm like oh okay I guess </garnt>
<garnt> we're going yeah and so basically my </garnt>
<garnt> boys just escorted me to the the bride's </garnt>
<connor> house yeah and so you stop at the gate </connor>
<connor> um and I thought I was meant to talk uh </connor>
<garnt> but no my mother my mother was </garnt>
<connor> apparently doing the one this is your </connor>
<connor> this is your mom's honestly it's like </connor>
<connor> step aside Sunday </connor>
<joey> and she basically she has to kind of </joey>
<joey> like negotiate uh with the households to </joey>
<joey> kind of like to kind of like let us into </joey>
<joey> the house right and uh with this </joey>
<garnt> procession there are like there are </garnt>
<garnt> three gates and there are different </garnt>
<joey> trials that we need to do at each gate </joey>
<joey> and these trials are picked like kind of </joey>
<joey> not really at random but I guess peaked </joey>
<joey> by like the the whoever's house oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> the bride's house so there are different </garnt>
<garnt> like how it traditionally is </garnt>
<garnt> um because families are so big you'll </garnt>
<garnt> have different members of the bride's </garnt>
<garnt> house uh guarding each gate and they </garnt>
<joey> will ask the groom to do whatever they </joey>
<joey> desire and this there's not like there's </joey>
<joey> not anything on paper where you know </joey>
<joey> traditionally you need to do this it's </joey>
<connor> just whatever they feel like asking for </connor>
<joey> right it's kind of like yourself yeah </joey>
<connor> kind of like a little forfeit basically </connor>
<connor> yeah right and so at the first Gates </connor>
<garnt> um my family I was asked uh to shout you </garnt>
<garnt> know I love Sydney as uh loud as I can </garnt>
<connor> bear in mind there's like 100 people </connor>
<garnt> like crowding around yeah yeah this is </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of people yeah this is a lot </garnt>
<connor> of people you get escorts of the first </connor>
<garnt> gate </garnt>
<garnt> um you get asked I got asked the shout </garnt>
<garnt> out I love Sydney so she can hear uh she </garnt>
<garnt> she can hear me because Sydney right now </garnt>
<joey> she's not outside she's inside the house </joey>
<joey> right that's how that's how it's meant </joey>
<joey> to be it's kind of like kind of like </joey>
<joey> you're with your Bros and you're </joey>
<joey> invading a castle you know that's that's </joey>
<joey> kind of how it's meant to feel West Side </joey>
<joey> Story yeah </joey>
<joey> I remember saying it's like oh it kind </joey>
<connor> of feels like we're storming a castle </connor>
<connor> right now but there's a lot of people </connor>
<garnt> yeah there's a lot there's a lot of </garnt>
<connor> people uh I'm sure your neighbors just </connor>
<garnt> joined in yeah yeah I don't even know </garnt>
<garnt> who these people were yeah yeah yeah uh </garnt>
<garnt> that was pretty easy and then the second </garnt>
<garnt> one </garnt>
<garnt> um the second the second game was a bit </garnt>
<garnt> more tricky because uh my family member </garnt>
<garnt> was like you got you're not doing this </garnt>
<garnt> alone you got to get your Bros involved </garnt>
<connor> with this one I was like no I'm holding </connor>
<connor> the desserts how do you see that I'm a </connor>
<connor> dessert holding account and I do not </connor>
<garnt> want to involve myself in some frivolous </garnt>
<garnt> activity yeah and so she was like okay </garnt>
<garnt> you do 10 push-ups uh Jerry do 10 </garnt>
<garnt> push-ups and Connor dance why why do I </garnt>
<garnt> have to dance yeah I guess because at </garnt>
<garnt> first it was like gone through 10 </garnt>
<garnt> push-ups and we're all like yeah let's </garnt>
<garnt> go not knowing that we're about to be </garnt>
<connor> involved right yeah this is like another </connor>
<garnt> 10. and the guy's like I'm like because </garnt>
<joey> I didn't the boys didn't know anything </joey>
<joey> about me yeah I don't know nothing about </joey>
<joey> this I'm just like boys you got it you </joey>
<garnt> gotta do this for me boys please </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah so I did the 10 push-ups and </connor>
<garnt> then you know [ __ ] Conor and dice are </garnt>
<connor> like laughing at me right thinking that </connor>
<connor> they're gone scot-free and then one of </connor>
<connor> them was like now one of you dance </connor>
<connor> clown and so Connor it was the weirdest </connor>
<connor> thing I wish I had filmed this part </connor>
<connor> because it was it was so it was this </connor>
<connor> bizarre situation of us and a hundred </connor>
<connor> plus Thai people around us all watching </connor>
<connor> Connor fortnite dance </connor>
<garnt> it's like it's like a dream I can't </garnt>
<garnt> believe this has actually happened yeah </garnt>
<connor> because it was all it really did feel </connor>
<connor> like we were storming a castle except </connor>
<connor> kind of was just Fortnight dancing in </connor>
<joey> front of the gates because we there was </joey>
<connor> this one interrogating together there </connor>
<joey> was this one very small bridge between </joey>
<joey> like the outside and the inside of the </joey>
<joey> house that was over a pond right and so </joey>
<joey> Connor was just by himself on this </joey>
<joey> bridge it's in front of like a hundred </joey>
<garnt> of like my Thai family just like </garnt>
<connor> fortnite I'm like I'm so glad to do the </connor>
<joey> push-ups [ __ ] monks just left </joey>
<joey> watching me and I've got this </joey>
<connor> traditional Thai dancers dudes playing </connor>
<connor> these Thai instruments meanwhile she's a </connor>
<connor> white guy dancing wearing wearing jeans </connor>
<connor> yeah what a [ __ ] bridge in front of </connor>
<connor> 100 Thai people it was so funny it's a </connor>
<connor> weird experience yeah but thankfully my </connor>
<connor> bro's had my bag </connor>
<connor> yeah I got in the second gear and then </connor>
<connor> last gate was of course guarded by </connor>
<connor> Sydney's family uh and they asked me to </connor>
<connor> uh sing oh yeah uh sing the song that I </connor>
<connor> sang for my very first dance uh with </connor>
<connor> Sydney uh which I'm pretty sure I sung </connor>
<connor> really really badly that's fine but it </connor>
<connor> did I I forgot to mention even though </connor>
<connor> you had to do these trials it was it's </connor>
<connor> normally ended with a with a little bit </connor>
<connor> of a bribe that's uh oh really yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah I heard about that yeah did you </connor>
<garnt> know because did you notice like when </garnt>
<garnt> they were like okay you're worthy and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like okay thank you and I gave him </garnt>
<connor> like an envelope yeah yeah she bribed </connor>
<connor> yeah I was like yeah I like this culture </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> all I can say is you know Money Talks </garnt>
<joey> you can be the most worthy man in the </joey>
<garnt> world but you know a little bit of like </garnt>
<connor> embarrass yourself and give us more if </connor>
<connor> you had to like barter like best I can </connor>
<garnt> do is </garnt>
<garnt> that happens actually yeah that happens </garnt>
<garnt> 10 bucks it's like all right eight yeah </garnt>
<connor> I'll take it or leave it boys we're </connor>
<connor> packing it up yeah spot out we didn't do </connor>
<connor> this for our wedding but my mom was like </connor>
<connor> you know traditionally sometimes it </connor>
<connor> really depends on the feeling of </connor>
<connor> whoever's got in the gate sometimes if </connor>
<connor> they're feeling like oh this uh this </connor>
<connor> doesn't look like enough money </connor>
<connor> slip an extra like 100 200 bucks or </connor>
<joey> something like that that's so funny </joey>
<joey> that's awesome so yeah it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> it's not meant to be taken seriously </joey>
<joey> it's just like it was a lot of fun yeah </joey>
<joey> awful all for fun very casual </joey>
<connor> um and then after that uh is where you </connor>
<connor> had like the adult blessing ceremony </connor>
<connor> which is which is kind of what you see </connor>
<connor> with uh this yeah so what happens is you </connor>
<connor> uh you go into another room and the </connor>
<connor> immediate family all will take a seat </connor>
<connor> right and uh the basic the basic premise </connor>
<connor> is every one who is part of your </connor>
<connor> immediate family who is an elder to you </connor>
<connor> gets to bless your marriage which uh </connor>
<connor> every everyone takes one of these one of </connor>
<connor> these strings gives their blessings and </connor>
<connor> then literally like ties are not ties a </connor>
<connor> knot for both me and for Sydney right </connor>
<connor> um now </connor>
<connor> uh I didn't know how long this was going </connor>
<connor> to last because yeah because I was like </connor>
<connor> you got a lot of Elders at the beginning </connor>
<connor> I was like you know Joey Connor died as </connor>
<connor> you know Emily you know come in have a </connor>
<connor> look and they saw you know both of our </connor>
<connor> parents blessing us tying the knots yeah </connor>
<connor> um and then I forgot to tell them that </connor>
<connor> uh this my entire family who was sitting </connor>
<connor> down waiting their turn they're gonna </connor>
<connor> come up and bless me as well so that you </connor>
<connor> were there standing there for like what </connor>
<connor> 15 minutes or something yeah it was like </connor>
<connor> 15-20 minutes before I was like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> um you guys go away from now it's okay </joey>
<joey> because we're going to be here we're one </joey>
<joey> tenth of the way through right now yeah </joey>
<joey> so as as you can see </joey>
<joey> um I mean I I like I like the ceremony </joey>
<joey> and everything but I'm glad that mostly </joey>
<joey> it was just my family there yeah </joey>
<joey> um because uh obviously a lot of </joey>
<joey> Sydney's family is in America uh because </joey>
<joey> if Sydney's family was there we would </joey>
<connor> have been there for [ __ ] hours like </connor>
<joey> your whole album with my whole um yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah because uh Hey like everyone got </connor>
<connor> the chance to give that blessing and you </connor>
<connor> can always tell when you've been to like </connor>
<garnt> a Thai wedding because this is kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a just marriage uh sorry just </garnt>
<garnt> married kind of symbol because you can </garnt>
<garnt> tell Southeast Asian families their arm </garnt>
<connor> just gets filled up I was gonna say most </connor>
<connor> people when they go to Southeast Asia </connor>
<joey> and they come back they only have a </joey>
<joey> bunch of bands </joey>
<joey> right lots of bracelets that was like um </joey>
<joey> some other ceremony where I think it was </joey>
<joey> something to do with elders but it </joey>
<connor> wasn't your dad and then your dad was </connor>
<connor> talking to me right and everyone was </connor>
<connor> being really quiet and I was like is it </connor>
<connor> okay for you to talk this loudly to me </connor>
<connor> and then eventually your mom came up I </connor>
<connor> was like shut up </connor>
<connor> not to me to your dad yeah yeah because </connor>
<connor> it was like everyone was quiet in this </connor>
<connor> room watching uh I was one of your </connor>
<connor> family uh like blasting you or something </connor>
<connor> and then yeah Dad just turns around and </connor>
<joey> he goes are you enjoying Thailand so far </joey>
<connor> and I was like oh well you know like a </connor>
<joey> whisper </joey>
<joey> I'm getting the party started yeah and </joey>
<connor> then like in the meanwhile like there's </connor>
<connor> literally a line of my elders just </connor>
<connor> waiting waiting to do it and my dad's </connor>
<connor> just like we're gonna be here a while </connor>
<joey> oh my God and then there was the one </joey>
<joey> after where with the water pouring one </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah so after I got all my eldest </garnt>
<garnt> blessing then we have the chance for </garnt>
<garnt> everyone else who came to their wedding </garnt>
<connor> to give Their Blessings as well and so </connor>
<connor> uh what happens is me and Sydney sat </connor>
<connor> down </connor>
<connor> um and we had kind of like uh yeah we </connor>
<connor> had like a a vase with a flower in front </connor>
<connor> of us and what the concept is is that </connor>
<connor> people can pour water over our hands and </connor>
<connor> bless us for the start of a new marriage </connor>
<connor> yeah a lot of other things in Thailand a </connor>
<connor> lot of blessings every we are very </connor>
<connor> blessed yeah you blessed we blessed </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um and you know everyone lines up once </connor>
<connor> again and uh they take they take a kind </connor>
<garnt> of like a not a bucket of water but just </garnt>
<garnt> a little like vase of water and just </garnt>
<garnt> pour it over our hands and you can say </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> um I was there for me and Sydney were </garnt>
<joey> there for like 40 minutes yeah what what </joey>
<joey> the the part that I thought was kind of </joey>
<joey> funny was that like uh I think you it </joey>
<joey> was your mom or your aunt that said like </joey>
<joey> you know to all the English speakers who </joey>
<connor> are there like us was like okay uh so </connor>
<connor> you all have to line up in order from </connor>
<garnt> oldest to youngest and I'm like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know 90 of the people here how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> am I supposed to know who's older and </connor>
<garnt> younger than me so I'm just like I'll </garnt>
<garnt> just wait till the end </garnt>
<garnt> guys can all go ahead but like I </garnt>
<connor> remember I didn't know that we had to </connor>
<connor> like say something to you guys right </connor>
<connor> like as we were pouring the water so it </connor>
<connor> got to my tone and I'm just like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> I haven't thought about what to say to </connor>
<connor> you guys I don't remember what I said to </connor>
<connor> you but I said to Sydney I'm just like </connor>
<connor> thinking what they're saying and I think </connor>
<connor> I ended up just saying uh have a good </connor>
<connor> life and I'm like that sounds like a </connor>
<connor> threat enjoy the next 24 hours </connor>
<joey> it's like I didn't mean it to say it </joey>
<connor> like that I'm just like I didn't know </connor>
<garnt> what to say and I'm just like oh [ __ ] I </garnt>
<connor> should have said that sorry have a good </connor>
<joey> life I was like have a good life what </joey>
<garnt> the [ __ ] does that mean oh yeah no it's </garnt>
<garnt> good though yeah but like I'm a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> man I I remember during because we were </garnt>
<garnt> sitting there for so long just getting </garnt>
<garnt> it just getting blessed um I remember </garnt>
<garnt> turning to Sydney and I was like this is </garnt>
<connor> the weirdest signing ceremony I've ever </connor>
<connor> I've ever been to because it literally </connor>
<connor> felt like a signing session at a </connor>
<connor> convention except everyone was just </connor>
<connor> washing my hands so many people washed </connor>
<connor> my hands this one at this one ceremony </connor>
<joey> that my hands were wrinkly but oh yeah I </joey>
<joey> I got the prune yeah I had the prune </joey>
<joey> hands all the way </joey>
<garnt> yeah after that it was everything was </garnt>
<garnt> over and uh I guess that's when the </garnt>
<garnt> party started yeah I remember when we </garnt>
<garnt> were waiting to this water thing and uh </garnt>
<garnt> I was even cut like a little cousin or </garnt>
<garnt> something who yeah my little cousin this </garnt>
<garnt> kid there's 10 10 11 year old Thai kid </garnt>
<garnt> speaks to me in like a Flawless American </garnt>
<garnt> accent and he was talking to me and I </garnt>
<connor> was like how do you </connor>
<connor> how do you have an American accent he's </connor>
<connor> like oh what's a lot of South Park and </connor>
<connor> Family Guy and I was like ah how would </connor>
<joey> you say you were again he's like I'm 11 </joey>
<connor> I'm like all right well if you're </connor>
<garnt> learning American then I'm sure that's </garnt>
<garnt> good yeah you're so funny yeah it's so </garnt>
<garnt> cool God I'm like I this uh being at </garnt>
<garnt> this family gathering being at this </garnt>
<garnt> wedding kind of like opened my eyes a </garnt>
<garnt> lot because I talked I talked to a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of my younger family members uh one I </garnt>
<garnt> realized that a lot of my younger </garnt>
<garnt> cousins </garnt>
<garnt> um they all I was like they were like </garnt>
<garnt> initially they were like oh I watched a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of YouTube I was like oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> makes sense and then I talked to them a </garnt>
<garnt> bit more about who who they watch or who </garnt>
<garnt> their favorite content creators were and </garnt>
<garnt> 90 of my cousins were like oh I watch </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers </garnt>
<joey> I remember that because one of uh your </joey>
<garnt> cousins that was uh sitting with us for </garnt>
<connor> quite a while was really cool kid uh </connor>
<connor> overheard that conversation and he </connor>
<connor> turned to me and he went what's a v </connor>
<connor> trooper and I was like no no no no no </connor>
<connor> you are the last innocent mind your mind </connor>
<garnt> will not be don't do it don't do it do </garnt>
<joey> it to yourself it's like promise me you </joey>
<garnt> will not look it up after this wedding </garnt>
<garnt> oh there was this really awkward moment </garnt>
<garnt> where I was having a conversation with </garnt>
<garnt> my cousin and my uncle was standing next </garnt>
<garnt> for him as well yeah and uh my uh he was </garnt>
<garnt> telling me about how he uh watches </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube and something like that and then </garnt>
<connor> he says that he watches YouTubers and </connor>
<connor> then like a minute after that </connor>
<connor> conversation ends my uncle comes up to </connor>
<connor> me and he goes uh can you explain why </connor>
<connor> like his he's always spending this stuff </connor>
<connor> on his bank account I don't understand </connor>
<connor> like he's spending a lot on YouTube I </connor>
<connor> don't understand and I was just like oh </connor>
<connor> no no no no no no no no he's reading </connor>
<garnt> oh no I was like oh no Uncle I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know how to explain this to you so </garnt>
<connor> there's this goal right if I did it </connor>
<joey> wouldn't help there's this girl been </joey>
<joey> real but they're not real yeah oh my God </joey>
<garnt> but I also realized um I also had the </garnt>
<garnt> realization of why I am so adamant on </garnt>
<connor> not taking pictures wherever I go and I </connor>
<connor> realized this because it's it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> maybe like a kind of trauma I already </connor>
<connor> know what you're gonna say or maybe like </connor>
<connor> a kind of trauma that has stuck with me </connor>
<connor> and I this kind of like made me remember </connor>
<connor> why I hate taking photos it's because </connor>
<garnt> every family gathering everyone wants to </garnt>
<garnt> take a photo and there is never there is </garnt>
<garnt> never an opportunity to not take a photo </garnt>
<connor> yeah your aunt was going insane yeah her </connor>
<garnt> camera roll must go on for like years </garnt>
<garnt> terabytes yeah because uh because at </garnt>
<garnt> this wedding I was like you know taking </garnt>
<garnt> a few photos and every time ever every </garnt>
<garnt> single time I took a photo like three </garnt>
<garnt> more aunts or three more uncles I just </garnt>
<joey> like okay can we take a photo as well </joey>
<joey> can we can we take a photo and then so </joey>
<joey> me and Sydney were posing for a lot of </joey>
<joey> the state I mean meanwhile remember </joey>
<joey> we're in like a full like Thai </joey>
<joey> traditional suit and get up and </joey>
<joey> everything yeah Sydney was like sweating </joey>
<joey> her ass off uh so we were just standing </joey>
<joey> there taking photos and as soon as we </joey>
<joey> thought we had a moment to breathe we'd </joey>
<joey> walk Five Paces and then someone would </joey>
<joey> be like can we take a photo can we take </joey>
<connor> another photo and we'd be like yes okay </connor>
<joey> okay you must yeah if you must and I </joey>
<connor> remember this was just how it was </connor>
<connor> growing up for me I I've grown up with </connor>
<connor> the sense that no matter where I go with </connor>
<connor> people someone's gonna take a photo so I </connor>
<joey> don't need to take a photo so this is I </joey>
<joey> guess I remember I remember now why I </joey>
<joey> never take photos is because in my mind </joey>
<joey> I'm like someone's always there to take </joey>
<joey> a photo and there are going to be way </joey>
<joey> too many there's always an aunt or an </joey>
<joey> uncle around the corner ready to take a </joey>
<garnt> photo yeah exactly I get that yeah but </garnt>
<joey> I'm glad you guys got to see my house in </joey>
<garnt> Thailand </garnt>
<joey> because I remember </joey>
<joey> about that because I remember like you </joey>
<connor> were like all right so uh you know meet </connor>
<connor> up at the venue at x amount of time and </connor>
<connor> so you know we we told the taxi driver </connor>
<connor> to like take us to this venue and </connor>
<connor> they're taking us through these like </connor>
<connor> Backstreets and I'm like yeah yeah where </connor>
<connor> is this venue yeah and then I realized </connor>
<connor> your Venue is just your house and I'm </connor>
<connor> like why did you say venue you could </connor>
<connor> have just said house and I would have </connor>
<garnt> been less confused because along this </garnt>
<garnt> road it was the weirdest Road right </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like I guess we entered </garnt>
<connor> like kind of the the nicer back streets </connor>
<connor> where like there's like tons of like </connor>
<connor> huge mansions with like extraordinarily </connor>
<connor> like large ponds and lands and stuff </connor>
<joey> like that yeah and I don't know if </joey>
<joey> nothing in Thailand but there were so </joey>
<joey> many statues of Pop Culture figures on </joey>
<connor> the streets that was there was a like </connor>
<joey> that was like a six foot bust of Captain </joey>
<joey> America yeah in front of someone's house </joey>
<joey> I had to double take so many times </joey>
<connor> Captain America's just his like from his </connor>
<joey> abs to his head yeah six foot statues </joey>
<joey> and then there was like this like like </joey>
<joey> maybe three or four foot tall like Mario </joey>
<garnt> like porcelain statue yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um I I think it is just maybe not </garnt>
<connor> traditionally part of Thai culture but </connor>
<connor> just yeah all right yeah we're just </connor>
<connor> sometimes you know Thai people </connor>
<connor> especially you know people around me </connor>
<garnt> sometimes if you can just grab a cool </garnt>
<garnt> little like ornament or like artifact or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that no matter how out of </garnt>
<joey> place it is you just put it there yeah </joey>
<joey> because I I remember I get a six foot </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> I'm like did you make that yeah because </joey>
<garnt> I remember I I told that story to one of </garnt>
<garnt> your cousins and I told him about the </garnt>
<garnt> Mario one and he was like oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> he's a doctor yeah and I'm like didn't </garnt>
<connor> even get Dr Mario </connor>
<joey> you [ __ ] up like it doesn't explain </joey>
<connor> why he has a Mario in the front of his </connor>
<garnt> Mansion yeah I think I think he just put </garnt>
<garnt> it like one of my other neighbors has a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Jurassic Park theme yeah gate or </garnt>
<joey> something like that yeah Titus and I </joey>
<joey> went walking in your neighborhood right </joey>
<joey> and we just walked past this gate and it </joey>
<joey> was I'm like I'm not tripping that's the </joey>
<joey> Jurassic Park logo on the gate and then </joey>
<joey> I look over at the wall and it clearly </joey>
<joey> says Jurassic Park and I'm like where am </joey>
<joey> I </joey>
<joey> what is Thailand </joey>
<connor> yeah sometimes uh at least from you know </connor>
<connor> my family and people I know sometimes </connor>
<connor> Thai people especially when they're </connor>
<connor> trying to like build a house or put some </connor>
<connor> cool things or kind of try to get away </connor>
<connor> to stand out they would just take a </connor>
<garnt> random thing from America or British </garnt>
<garnt> films or whatever and just put it in the </garnt>
<garnt> house doesn't match the aesthetic </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't match the vibe at all sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> you're just walking past the house and </garnt>
<garnt> you see a random Mario statue doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> make any sense at all but that's just </garnt>
<garnt> that's just the way things are just like </garnt>
<joey> like your neighbor's house that we </joey>
<connor> started that uh the the ceremony in like </connor>
<garnt> looked like every country put into one </garnt>
<connor> place like it was it was there was like </connor>
<connor> a there was like an Amsterdam inspired </connor>
<connor> windmill next to a river and then </connor>
<connor> there's like a very traditional like </connor>
<connor> Southeast Asian house and then there was </connor>
<connor> just straight up like a concrete block </connor>
<connor> that looked like something out of like </connor>
<connor> like Eastern Europe and I'm like what is </connor>
<connor> this place like what's the theming it's </connor>
<connor> very unusual like how did the guy tell </connor>
<connor> the architect being like I want this I </connor>
<connor> want this I want this and the guy's like </connor>
<joey> you want it all in the same property </joey>
<garnt> right like yeah it kind of feels like a </garnt>
<garnt> theme park you know because they're just </garnt>
<garnt> like oh just so just have a have a </garnt>
<joey> little bit of everything why not I </joey>
<joey> thought it was a theme park and then </joey>
<joey> your cousin was like oh no this is the </joey>
<joey> neighbor's house I'm like what does your </joey>
<joey> neighbor do </joey>
<connor> it was insane it was very impressive so </connor>
<joey> weird yeah thankfully none of my family </joey>
<garnt> served you boys uh bearing with ice </garnt>
<connor> cubes in it yeah I was expecting it </connor>
<connor> I thought was unacceptable I was like </connor>
<garnt> could I have a beer please and so he </garnt>
<garnt> gives me a beer it gives me a straw </garnt>
<garnt> a straw for a canned beer I was like I </garnt>
<garnt> was like no thank you what what is this </garnt>
<connor> why do they drink beer out of a straw </connor>
<garnt> what is that can you explain </garnt>
<garnt> um some people some people just do that </garnt>
<joey> that's [ __ ] up I don't know why what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] beer out of a straw I think </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] up as well uh yeah </joey>
<joey> I don't know I don't know I I yeah no </joey>
<joey> don't Zone my guys </joey>
<connor> that's not my meds I don't think there </connor>
<connor> was a moment where I like in the 72 </connor>
<connor> hours where I was in Thailand where I </connor>
<connor> wasn't disgustingly full I think I was </connor>
<garnt> full constantly I think every moment I </garnt>
<garnt> was with these boys because I only got </garnt>
<garnt> to take care of these boys one at my </garnt>
<garnt> wedding and one another day when I could </garnt>
<connor> show them around </connor>
<connor> um I think every hour I was with these </connor>
<connor> boys we were eating something because </connor>
<connor> everything's so good yeah nothing missed </connor>
<connor> I remember at the wedding uh I think </connor>
<garnt> your your aunt brought out these like uh </garnt>
<garnt> like sautes uh like chickens on a skewer </garnt>
<garnt> the chicken satay skewers and they're a </garnt>
<connor> bomb dude I swear I saw Connor eat like </connor>
<connor> 50 of those like not not even not even </connor>
<joey> over exaggerating I think he actually </joey>
<joey> ate like four full plates of that [ __ ] I </joey>
<garnt> had a lot and they just kept bringing </garnt>
<joey> them over when I was finished and I was </joey>
<garnt> like oh [ __ ] I can't let them get away </garnt>
<garnt> see I thought Connor wasn't eating much </garnt>
<garnt> uh because I was like talking to my </garnt>
<connor> family and everything and every time I'd </connor>
<connor> come to cut like your table Connor had a </connor>
<connor> false uh place </connor>
<garnt> with Satay every time so I just assumed </garnt>
<joey> oh it's the same plate no he was just </joey>
<garnt> eating it so fast but you didn't see it </garnt>
<connor> yeah and even though I was full they </connor>
<connor> started making other food and I was like </connor>
<joey> well I have to try it yeah the moment </joey>
<connor> you came back with the guitar </connor>
<connor> I was just I was so full and I still ate </connor>
<connor> a whole kapow </connor>
<connor> I the question I got the most in </connor>
<connor> Thailand every every single [ __ ] time </connor>
<connor> I got any food they were like are you </connor>
<connor> sure it's spicy they asked me this every </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] every food I ordered they were </connor>
<connor> like are you sure this is spicy yes I'm </connor>
<connor> sure give it to me on the airline or any </connor>
<connor> any [ __ ] stall yeah a pad thai that </connor>
<connor> wasn't even spicy they're like are you </connor>
<garnt> sure it's spicy I was like no it's fine </garnt>
<connor> I can eat it I wouldn't have ordered it </connor>
<garnt> if I couldn't yeah but because like Thai </garnt>
<connor> Thailand you just assume everything is </connor>
<connor> spicy I remember I took these boys it's </connor>
<connor> like kind of like a casual place where </connor>
<connor> they serve like barbecue pork and some </connor>
<connor> chicken and stuff like that came with </connor>
<connor> three sauces </connor>
<connor> um and I remember Joey and uh diet is </connor>
<connor> asking me oh this is this like different </connor>
<connor> splice levels and I'd been in and I had </connor>
<connor> been abroad for so long so I assumed it </connor>
<connor> was just different spice levels and then </connor>
<connor> we were all like progressively trying </connor>
<connor> like the three different sources trying </connor>
<connor> to figure out which one was the spiciest </connor>
<connor> one right and then Joey was like oh I </connor>
<connor> think the middle one's the spiciest one </connor>
<connor> that is like I think the left one's the </connor>
<connor> spiciest one and then I tried it and I'm </connor>
<connor> like wait I think they were all the same </connor>
<connor> amount of spice I think it's the </connor>
<connor> difference is the sweetness of them </connor>
<connor> actually which just goes in Thailand </connor>
<garnt> there's only one level of spice it's </garnt>
<connor> just spicy it's just spicy Dom was </connor>
<garnt> sweating non-stop yeah bro he was just </garnt>
<connor> wet the the squid uh like dish that you </connor>
<connor> guys had at your wedding oh yeah the </connor>
<connor> spices yeah that was that was probably </connor>
<connor> the spiciest one I mean you know like </connor>
<garnt> had a kick though but you know I I was </garnt>
<garnt> fine Connor was fine I guess didus </garnt>
<garnt> really likes squid yeah and uh and he he </garnt>
<connor> put maybe half of his plate full of that </connor>
<garnt> squid not knowing that it was the </garnt>
<garnt> spiciest thing dog author he finished it </garnt>
<connor> he looked like he just came out of a </connor>
<garnt> sauna </garnt>
<connor> physically dripping he's so funny I'm </connor>
<joey> like are you okay did you just like run </joey>
<joey> a half marathon </joey>
<connor> yeah I mean because I was telling this </connor>
<joey> to Joey earlier because I was I was </joey>
<joey> surprised I think Joey's got you've gone </joey>
<connor> on like a lot better handling yourself </connor>
<joey> compared to I surprised myself yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> because you handled a lot of the Thai </connor>
<connor> food pretty well I remember I remember </connor>
<connor> saying I think with Thai food there's </connor>
<connor> like a perfect amount of spice with </connor>
<connor> certain dishes people will just make </connor>
<connor> dishes with the amount of splice it has </connor>
<garnt> that it has and you can last for it to </garnt>
<garnt> be less spicy but I think by asking it </garnt>
<garnt> to be less spicy or removing some of the </garnt>
<joey> flavor out of it for sure you're also </joey>
<joey> asking it to be less tasty yeah you're </joey>
<garnt> asking for it to be less tasty they can </garnt>
<garnt> make it less spicy but the reason </garnt>
<garnt> there's always going to be a little bit </garnt>
<connor> of spice in it even if you ask for Thai </connor>
<connor> food to be less spicy </connor>
<connor> um it's because I think there is just a </connor>
<connor> perfect amount of splice level for this </connor>
<connor> food that makes it the optimal taste and </connor>
<garnt> that unfortunately is it's too spicy for </garnt>
<connor> a lot of people um so good though yeah </connor>
<connor> but it's so good yeah oh man I was just </connor>
<connor> full the whole time yeah </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> uh after about three days three days in </connor>
<connor> Thailand by the way there wasn't a </connor>
<connor> single day in Thailand well I did not </connor>
<connor> have uh the most horrendously spicy food </connor>
<garnt> when when the moment me and Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> stepped off the plane we were just like </garnt>
<garnt> just go to town just just go to town let </garnt>
<garnt> give us all of the spicy food that we </garnt>
<garnt> can't get in Japan </garnt>
<connor> um and so by day three my [ __ ] was no </connor>
<connor> crying dude I I was struggling yeah I </connor>
<connor> needed I had like I would [ __ ] like 10 </connor>
<connor> times a day every time yeah yeah my ass </connor>
<connor> was like Mount Saint Helen yeah yeah it </connor>
<garnt> was insane it was so sore and so and so </garnt>
<garnt> here are um at my house sitting on my </garnt>
<connor> toilet and I I was having I was having </connor>
<connor> one of those shits where it was like the </connor>
<joey> sweats that came with it you know that </joey>
<connor> take your shirt off yeah </connor>
<joey> and I remember just sitting down I and I </joey>
<joey> reached over for the bidet and it wasn't </joey>
<garnt> there and I was just like if there's one </garnt>
<garnt> country that needs a bidet it's Thailand </garnt>
<connor> why is it not here right now the spice </connor>
<garnt> they use I'm shocked in their butthole </garnt>
<connor> yeah people just getting used to it is </connor>
<connor> that is that that poops normal or is it </connor>
<joey> is everyone pooping like that or maybe </joey>
<joey> in Thailand the general consensus is </joey>
<joey> yeah poops are painful right yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> the default I don't know I mean I don't </garnt>
<connor> think I ever got used to it I just fight </connor>
<connor> for my life yeah you just get used to </connor>
<connor> like fine for your life we do have a </connor>
<connor> like a sort of like bidet kind of thing </connor>
<joey> in Thailand but that that didn't do it </joey>
<joey> yeah it literally literally </joey>
<garnt> I needed </garnt>
<garnt> I need it you shouldn't sniper right to </garnt>
<connor> where the I'm trying to like fully </connor>
<joey> shower my ass cheeks </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly that was not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> work yeah we they they are they had like </garnt>
<garnt> a hose you could shotgun your ass I </garnt>
<connor> needed a Precision sniper right where </connor>
<connor> the area that was on [ __ ] fire and it </connor>
<connor> just wasn't there so the first thing I </connor>
<connor> did was I'm like Mom can I buy a bidet </connor>
<connor> for this house please </connor>
<connor> I need it okay in Thailand </connor>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> where else did you guys go like what </garnt>
<joey> what areas did you guys so the day after </joey>
<connor> the wedding the day you didn't join us </connor>
<connor> we we obviously went to the the big </connor>
<connor> Marketplace which is which is super cool </connor>
<connor> I mean like we I don't think we even </connor>
<joey> explored like 10 of that place because </joey>
<connor> it's right so massive yeah um but yes we </connor>
<connor> paid uh 25 for a pad yeah yeah yeah oh </connor>
<joey> okay okay so we paid that and we were </joey>
<garnt> like all right well let's get out of </garnt>
<garnt> here before we get scanned more so we </garnt>
<garnt> went to um this uh the seon Paragon I </garnt>
<garnt> think yeah the same Paragon which is </garnt>
<garnt> like a kind of a mall nearby </garnt>
<joey> um did a bit of shopping there and then </joey>
<joey> yeah I guess just for the rest of the </joey>
<connor> night we were just there we went back to </connor>
<connor> that uh uh bar in The Hangover yeah oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah because when I when I heard that </garnt>
<garnt> you guys were staying in labua I was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh you you guys are staying in it's </garnt>
<garnt> one of the most famous hotels in Bangkok </garnt>
<garnt> specifically because that's the hotel </garnt>
<connor> where they filmed the hangover too that </connor>
<connor> scene at the end where the helicopter </connor>
<connor> comes on the rooftop that's the bar that </connor>
<connor> it's filmed at </connor>
<connor> um and I know this uh because I assume </connor>
<connor> everything there was horrendously </connor>
<connor> overpriced </connor>
<garnt> specifically because this is where The </garnt>
<connor> Hangover 2 took place dude we're looking </connor>
<connor> at the menu and Emily's like I think I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna get this streak I'm like Emily </connor>
<connor> that's a hundred dollar drink she was </connor>
<connor> like I'm not gonna get that drink </connor>
<connor> the cheapest drinks they had were 40 USD </connor>
<joey> right yeah we paid 40 bucks for a gin </joey>
<connor> and tonic and if you wanted to see the </connor>
<joey> view we're like one drink we'll check </joey>
<joey> out the view we'll bounce because you're </joey>
<joey> on the like 65th floor overlooking the </joey>
<connor> whole series The View was amazing but </connor>
<connor> you're definitely paying for the viewers </connor>
<connor> I mean at least it I mean it was one of </connor>
<connor> the strongest gin and tonics I had so I </connor>
<connor> guess you know it wasn't worth it they </connor>
<connor> were trying to level it out but I'm like </connor>
<connor> it's still 40 and I'm like yeah yeah uh </connor>
<joey> you know I'll just take a couple of </joey>
<garnt> pictures up here and then yeah yeah but </garnt>
<joey> was was it what was the hotel worth it </joey>
<connor> no I didn't like it their room was buggy </connor>
<connor> as hell I don't know dude like our hotel </connor>
<connor> room it was like if you want to take a </connor>
<connor> shower yeah it was just like every five </connor>
<joey> seconds was a quick Time Event because </joey>
<joey> you just change the temperature because </joey>
<joey> it would just scold you randomly you </joey>
<joey> need to keep changing it I was like what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] yeah I didn't have that problem </joey>
<joey> at all the Wi-Fi was like ass which all </joey>
<joey> right you know is whatever but uh there </joey>
<joey> was like TVs missing uh what else uh </joey>
<connor> they like lost our bags at one point </connor>
<garnt> dude it was like it was a nightmare good </garnt>
<garnt> to know and it was so expensive yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because I I've never stayed at that </garnt>
<garnt> hotel before because it is one of the </garnt>
<garnt> most expensive hotels in Bangkok because </garnt>
<garnt> like like I said because simply because </garnt>
<garnt> of The Hangover too simply because of </garnt>
<garnt> the marketing they got for that it's </garnt>
<connor> like that prices rocketed it is a high </connor>
<joey> price for Thailand it's like 200 bucks a </joey>
<connor> night yeah which is you know I mean in </connor>
<garnt> the UK they get you nothing yeah that </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't even get you an airbag okay so I </garnt>
<garnt> was like oh okay I'll spend 200 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> again like a really nice room yeah I </garnt>
<connor> think it was going to be like goaded and </connor>
<connor> it was it was not very good okay okay </connor>
<garnt> they're they're probably a lot better </garnt>
<garnt> hotels that you can get for a lot </garnt>
<connor> cheaper honestly the first time yeah we </connor>
<connor> stayed in this other hotel that was </connor>
<joey> close to God's house for the wedding and </joey>
<joey> that was like I think 40 or 50 a night </joey>
<joey> it was so good it was so much better and </joey>
<joey> like the bed was amazing the service was </joey>
<connor> super good and then we ordered room </connor>
<joey> service and the room service was so </joey>
<connor> cheap it was like it was like five bucks </connor>
<connor> for like all the means what the [ __ ] we </connor>
<connor> thought I am I suck so we ordered it it </connor>
<connor> was so good yeah it was really cool I </connor>
<connor> ordered green curry that cost like 180 </connor>
<connor> bar yeah and I was like what how does </connor>
<garnt> that make any sense how are they making </garnt>
<connor> money okay that's okay that's good to </connor>
<connor> know because the hotel's really good </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> um just just because yeah um I have </connor>
<connor> never stayed in the Burr I've always </connor>
<connor> like I've always been curious because </connor>
<connor> it's the most expensive one but the </connor>
<connor> breakfast was good though yeah that's </connor>
<joey> about it yeah that's about it yeah I I </joey>
<joey> don't really think it's worth it to be </joey>
<garnt> honest okay yeah next time you go we </garnt>
<joey> like we go we'll get a different we'll </joey>
<joey> stay at that first hotel honestly that </joey>
<garnt> that place </garnt>
<garnt> like I know some like pretty good hotels </garnt>
<garnt> um that are a bit less than liberal but </garnt>
<garnt> like even better than the other Hotel </garnt>
<garnt> okay I recommended for you yeah I think </garnt>
<connor> I think three days is a pretty good </connor>
<connor> amount though I felt like I kind of had </connor>
<connor> especially the food yeah I think my </connor>
<connor> stomach was like begging me to stop yeah </connor>
<connor> so I think three days was perfect how </connor>
<connor> does anyone stay in shape in Thailand </connor>
<joey> like I would I would be fat as [ __ ] if I </joey>
<joey> lived in Thailand for like more than a </joey>
<connor> month dude it's all like you get all the </connor>
<connor> manga go smoothies yeah and goes </connor>
<garnt> everywhere there's coconuts coconut </garnt>
<garnt> coconuts everywhere I hate so much </garnt>
<connor> coconut ice cream dude yeah so good the </connor>
<garnt> fresh coconut ice cream is so good it's </garnt>
<connor> so good that diet is like Dom didn't </connor>
<connor> even know that it was like coconut ice </connor>
<connor> cream yeah </connor>
<connor> the first time he was like I was like I </connor>
<connor> didn't know what it was like you know </connor>
<connor> because it's just white ice cream right </connor>
<connor> and I'm like oh what flavor is that and </connor>
<connor> he's like I think it's vanilla yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> like what do you mean you think it's </connor>
<connor> vanilla I had a scoop and I'm like this </connor>
<connor> is clearly coconut and he's like he </connor>
<garnt> hates coconut and he hates coconut he </garnt>
<connor> hates coconut with a passion I was like </connor>
<connor> Don this is coconut and he's like yeah I </connor>
<connor> didn't really like it I'm like you ate </connor>
<connor> the whole thing though you're such a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] liar how does your brain off </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm glad you enjoyed the Thai </joey>
<garnt> sausage though that was so good as the </garnt>
<connor> biggest sausage connoisseur [ __ ] love </connor>
<connor> sausages yeah JoJo fan yeah and I mean </connor>
<connor> obviously if you ever had Thai sausage </connor>
<garnt> um it doesn't taste like a normal </garnt>
<garnt> sausage it's very spicy see very </garnt>
<garnt> flavorful as it is yeah I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> like I feel like it wasn't oh man that's </garnt>
<connor> the word it doesn't have that like super </connor>
<garnt> nice bite to it that some sausages have </garnt>
<connor> yeah but the flavors of the spices in it </connor>
<garnt> were insane yeah it kind of made me like </garnt>
<garnt> like seeing seeing you I was gonna say </garnt>
<garnt> seeing you seeing you enjoy that sausage </garnt>
<garnt> uh yes and kind of like being back in </garnt>
<garnt> time I kind of made me realize why Thai </garnt>
<joey> Cuisine is the way it is just because </joey>
<joey> compared to you know more developed </joey>
<joey> countries the meat quality isn't the </joey>
<joey> best yeah right but we kind of like make </joey>
<connor> up for that by just making the flavors </connor>
<joey> so strong for sure uh that's it's kind </joey>
<connor> of almost the opposite of Japanese </connor>
<connor> Cuisine Japanese Cuisine is all about </connor>
<joey> letting the letting the meat quality </joey>
<joey> letting the quality of the ingredients </joey>
<connor> kind of like </connor>
<joey> do that one yeah letting natural flavors </joey>
<connor> take over time sure Thai is more like </connor>
<joey> this how many [ __ ] spices can we put </joey>
<garnt> in this get it give it give me more </garnt>
<garnt> spices </garnt>
<garnt> oh so good yeah I heard uh online before </garnt>
<connor> you go to Talent you weren't supposed to </connor>
<connor> drink the tap water or avoid ice yeah it </connor>
<connor> was impossible to avoid ice ice was in </connor>
<garnt> everything they put ice in everything so </garnt>
<joey> it's this is more of like in the river </joey>
<joey> areas okay uh it's also on the food </joey>
<garnt> stalls in in the food stores if you if </garnt>
<garnt> you buy stuff in the food and they have </garnt>
<garnt> a bucket full of ice or something that's </garnt>
<garnt> probably from tap water but if you're in </garnt>
<garnt> a mall or in the hotel or you know the </garnt>
<garnt> icicle at my wedding that's that's ice </garnt>
<garnt> that we've specifically bought that's </garnt>
<joey> been like purified I mean I thought I </joey>
<joey> was gonna get hit for sure with the </joey>
<garnt> amount of mango and watermelon smoothies </garnt>
<joey> I was drinking but I was good this time </joey>
<garnt> I pulled the good RNG yeah </garnt>
<garnt> every time we'd go to a food food store </garnt>

<garnt> shoot in uh in gunma and uh dude man it </garnt>
<garnt> was oh boy it was like cursed from the </garnt>
<garnt> start so I've I you know I rent cars in </garnt>
<joey> Japan fairly often I've rented a car in </joey>
<joey> Japan from this one location at least 10 </joey>
<joey> plus times I've been there so many </joey>
<joey> goddamn times and I you know I just know </joey>
<joey> who you are now I've been there so many </joey>
<garnt> times right so when you book a car in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan if it's winter season you probably </garnt>
<garnt> want to just get snow tires just in case </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't you don't know where </garnt>
<connor> you're going right and I always I always </connor>
<connor> get snow ties always and psychos no ties </connor>
<connor> a rock up to the rental car place and </connor>
<connor> it's 8 A.M and we're gonna get going </connor>
<connor> because like our video we're like a </connor>
<connor> tight schedule we gotta get to the next </connor>
<connor> place it's about two hour driveway and </connor>
<connor> uh as we're in Japan one question </connor>
<joey> they'll ask you when you rent a car is </joey>
<joey> normally they'll ask you where are you </joey>
<joey> going and it's normally a chill thing </joey>
<joey> they normally kind of don't care it's </joey>
<joey> not like American tea yeah it's yeah </joey>
<joey> it's not they like sometimes they </joey>
<joey> they'll they'll be a bit persistent </joey>
<joey> about it but sometimes they'll be like </joey>
<joey> where you going you're like North about </joey>
<joey> cool </joey>
<joey> just carry on yeah and he's like where </joey>
<joey> you going uh I've got a good man he was </joey>
<joey> like wearing Goodman I was like all </joey>
<connor> right okay and so I showed him where I </connor>
<connor> was going and he was like and then he </connor>
<connor> started talking with the other staff I </connor>
<connor> was like what the [ __ ] was when I get a </connor>
<connor> gun </connor>
<connor> what's that </connor>
<connor> um and then he he pulls out the </connor>
<connor> Translating thing and he goes basically </connor>
<connor> just saying you can't take this car and </connor>
<connor> I was like what do you mean I can't take </connor>
<connor> the car he's like it doesn't have snow </connor>
<connor> tires on it you didn't ask for snow </connor>
<connor> tires I was like I [ __ ] what do you </connor>
<connor> mean I asked for snow I asked for snow </connor>
<connor> ties I got the receipt right here yeah </connor>
<connor> he's like no no there's no snow Ties on </connor>
<connor> it so uh and I just got like a normal </connor>
<connor> ass small car I thought okay [ __ ] well </connor>
<connor> with no snow tires well I I clicked snow </connor>
<connor> ties right so I was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> he said you can't take this car okay so </connor>
<connor> what we can do is if you come back in an </connor>
<connor> hour we'll get this car and he points at </connor>
<connor> this card I look down I'm like yeah this </connor>
<connor> is that's an eight-seater I don't need </connor>
<connor> it that's massive I do not want to take </connor>
<connor> this so we're going down like small </connor>
<connor> roads either and he's like oh I mean we </connor>
<connor> can't do anything we can't we can't let </connor>
<connor> you have the cars right what I was like </connor>
<connor> fine I'll take the eight seater then </connor>
<connor> what can I do right I've got to go and </connor>
<connor> it was double the price yeah and yeah </connor>
<connor> and I had to pay for it even though I </connor>
<connor> wasn't my [ __ ] fault so like we walk </connor>
<connor> out and as we're walking out the guy </connor>
<connor> starts running </connor>
<connor> all right what's up he's like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> there was no tires on the car </joey>
<connor> I was like what I just lied to you he </connor>
<garnt> thought he I think they [ __ ] up and </garnt>
<garnt> they just misread there was no ties on </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] car this whole time right </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like oh my God okay fine all </garnt>
<garnt> right so we go back in oh my good at </garnt>
<garnt> least I can get the car </garnt>
<joey> um and they do something they've never </joey>
<joey> done before they've they asked me for </joey>
<joey> like my passport and stuff which they </joey>
<connor> never asked me for okay because I I you </connor>
<joey> know you live in Japan and it's given </joey>
<connor> the zaidu card right yeah well so </connor>
<connor> normally even with that right if you </connor>
<garnt> have a Japanese driving license which I </garnt>
<garnt> do they normally don't need anything </garnt>
<garnt> else yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and if you're a resident in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> even if you go to hotels if I'm correct </garnt>
<garnt> you have to look at this I don't know to </garnt>
<joey> my knowledge if you are a resident in </joey>
<joey> Japan they shouldn't be asking you for </joey>
<joey> like passport or zaru card even when you </joey>
<joey> check into a hotel oh you always do yeah </joey>
<joey> because if you're a Japanese person I </joey>
<joey> never get asked yeah right right and </joey>
<joey> they're not supposed to ask you but they </joey>
<garnt> do good for you when you're a foreigner </garnt>
<joey> even if you live in Japan I don't know </joey>
<garnt> why </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of kind of annoying but it is </garnt>
<garnt> what it is and same with rental cars if </garnt>
<joey> if you have a Japanese driving license </joey>
<joey> they shouldn't require anything else </joey>
<joey> because if you live in Japan that's </joey>
<joey> probably your ID anyway yeah right so </joey>
<joey> the dude started asking me for my </joey>
<joey> passport and I was like bro what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I've literally rented cars I live </connor>
<connor> here like 10 times and you've never </connor>
<connor> asked me for this [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> he's like whoa is like yeah fine dude </connor>
<connor> come on what the [ __ ] yeah sorry I get </connor>
<connor> it it's whatever we're going </connor>
<connor> and then we're driving and there's no </connor>
<connor> snow anywhere in gunma there's no snow </connor>
<connor> at all I'm like well this is it was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] waste of time </garnt>
<garnt> and then we're staying in a ryokan for </garnt>
<garnt> the night and I see where the ryokan is </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like there's all these roads </garnt>
<garnt> around and there's this big black empty </garnt>
<connor> area and it's just a mountain and our </connor>
<connor> ryokan is right in the middle on top of </connor>
<connor> this mountain right I'm like well I mean </connor>
<connor> how bad can it be so we start we start </connor>
<connor> driving and as we start making our way </connor>
<connor> up this mountain it's 50 minutes from </connor>
<connor> the bottom of the mountain to the top of </connor>
<connor> the real castle geez wow and there's a </connor>
<connor> giant frozen lake at the top all right </connor>
<connor> and so we're driving and the snow starts </connor>
<connor> to get like bigger and bigger and bigger </connor>
<connor> and 10 minutes into driving this and </connor>
<garnt> it's it's literally like Initial D like </garnt>
<connor> the like the roads just like this yeah </connor>
<garnt> going up it's like if you if you're </garnt>
<garnt> drifting it'd be Heaven yeah you're just </garnt>
<garnt> drifting the whole thing right and as </garnt>
<garnt> we're 10 minutes into this drive there </garnt>
<garnt> is a car that is sideways in the road </garnt>
<garnt> that is skid out and spun out right and </garnt>
<connor> I'm like oh okay okay guys don't worry </connor>
<connor> I'm a good driver I'm good I'm </connor>
<joey> so we're going up and it's all kind of </joey>
<joey> it's a little dicey like you can feel </joey>
<joey> the car is kind of like skidding a tiny </joey>
<connor> bit here and there and you're like okay </connor>
<connor> come on come on Carl you got this we get </connor>
<connor> up and it's fine but I'm worried about </connor>
<connor> the next day so I'm like we're gonna go </connor>
<joey> video back down yeah and it's snowing </joey>
<connor> yeah overnight yeah so I was like oh </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and the car she's like can you can you </joey>
<joey> back the car up a little bit more in the </joey>
<joey> parking lot and I'm trying to back it up </joey>
<joey> and the car just can't move it's like </joey>
<joey> stuck yeah because there's just so much </joey>
<connor> snow and I'm like I'm like assume I said </connor>
<garnt> uh it won't it won't go it's not </garnt>
<garnt> happening she's like she's like yeah </garnt>
<connor> fine get out yeah so next day we do film </connor>
<connor> all the stuff and we're ready to go </connor>
<connor> and we go down and we start driving and </connor>
<connor> I noticed that like I'm like hey guys uh </connor>
<garnt> don't avoid you anything but uh we can't </garnt>
<garnt> stop the car the car cannot break so so </garnt>
<garnt> we literally have to just go down this </garnt>
<garnt> without fully coming trying to be </garnt>
<garnt> interesting </garnt>
<connor> there's a weekend break right because </connor>
<garnt> you know your brakes in the Cobblestone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it won't slow down Beyond like </garnt>
<garnt> 20 or 30 kilometers an hour yeah Jesus </garnt>
<connor> so you're pretty much stuck at that and </connor>
<joey> if you try to stop the Cobble skit app </joey>
<connor> right because it doesn't want to right </connor>
<joey> because the car doesn't want to do it so </joey>
<joey> I'm like well don't worry guys 30 is a </joey>
<joey> really reasonable speed and we'll be </joey>
<joey> fine and there's some turns where the </joey>
<joey> car you can feel it start to go like </joey>
<joey> this just sliding you're like no guys </joey>
<joey> don't other guys I've drifted before I </joey>
<connor> it does we'll be fine I know how to turn </connor>
<connor> into the drift this is fine I know what </connor>
<garnt> I'm doing I didn't really know what I </garnt>
<garnt> was doing but I was like yeah it's fine </garnt>
<garnt> it's fine we'll just we'll go slow and </garnt>
<garnt> you pump the brakes every now and then </garnt>
<garnt> just slow it down don't don't try and </garnt>
<garnt> harshly break and then we there was this </garnt>
<garnt> car in front of us at one point I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know how this car was there yeah and </garnt>
<joey> we're going down this pretty steep hill </joey>
<joey> and I noticed the car is just like </joey>
<joey> stopping and I'm like uh okay and so I'm </joey>
<joey> trying to slow down and I'm like how the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] has he stopped I can't stop like I </connor>
<joey> literally cannot stop the car right and </joey>
<connor> I'm just getting slowly closer to this </connor>
<connor> card I'm like well [ __ ] we're like 30 </connor>
<connor> meters away from this car and I I'm like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] do I do because I'm </connor>
<connor> thinking in my head I'm like man I can't </connor>
<connor> stop the car pretty sure if I slam the </connor>
<connor> handbrake that's going to make it worse </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um so I look if there's any other cars </connor>
<joey> coming and I I'm like all right well </joey>
<joey> let's go in the other side of the road </joey>
<joey> because I I know the choice I couldn't </joey>
<joey> stop and I want to hit this guy yeah so </joey>
<joey> I turned on the other side of the road </joey>
<joey> the car is like uh I don't like that but </joey>
<joey> we managed to keep it safe we'd steer in </joey>
<joey> and we'd steer back in it was all </joey>
<joey> chilled </joey>
<joey> this dude just stopped in the middle of </joey>
<joey> the road I don't know why </joey>
<connor> unfortunate and another car came at the </connor>
<connor> same time it's like oh I have to hit </connor>
<garnt> something yeah like what do I what do I </garnt>
<connor> hit like so you're driving in winter is </connor>
<connor> scary be very careful Jesus but luckily </connor>
<joey> we made it down no problem a little </joey>
<connor> scary was totally chill good stuff </connor>
<joey> that's pretty why they wanted my ID I </joey>
<connor> think I think they were like this this </connor>
<connor> motherfucker's gonna crash this car </connor>
<garnt> where is this where is this guy going </garnt>
<connor> yeah why isn't he snow tires she's a </connor>
<connor> surprise it was kind of crazy that's </connor>
<connor> terrifying yeah but luckily it all </connor>
<connor> turned out okay uh I think we're pretty </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty good Under Pressure I think </connor>
<garnt> I'd have a freak out so I'm pretty good </garnt>
<garnt> at trying to manage the situation but it </garnt>
<garnt> was it was scary still especially when </garnt>
<garnt> there's other people in the car like if </garnt>
<garnt> I question it's me I'm like this [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> is fully all insured as long as I'm good </connor>
<connor> we were going like 10 miles an hour I'm </connor>
<connor> like we'll be fine yeah if I should all </connor>
<connor> scare them and Scar them I gotta drive </connor>
<joey> again he's just like I can drift guys </joey>
<connor> and they're all just like we're gonna </connor>
<connor> die </connor>
<connor> like other than that Carl was like </connor>
<connor> you're driving fantastic car like thank </connor>
<garnt> you can we just don't talk about the eye </garnt>
<connor> section </connor>
<garnt> what the snow areas yeah so be careful </garnt>
<garnt> if you drive in Japan really make sure </garnt>
<joey> you look where you're going because no </joey>
<garnt> ties are good but they can't do </garnt>
<joey> everything yeah I genuinely think that </joey>
<connor> that road was just like you needed </connor>
<joey> chains to like oh yeah I was gonna say </joey>
<joey> like did they not give you change no </joey>
<connor> that you can't you couldn't rent them oh </connor>
<joey> and I wouldn't even know how to put them </joey>
<joey> on I've never put chains on my car oh </joey>
<connor> you can render but you have to tell them </connor>
<joey> like a month you film a month in advance </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's the snow season oh my </joey>
<garnt> God these these [ __ ] didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even know you needed snow tires when you </garnt>
<garnt> come in so you know what makes you think </garnt>
<joey> they're gonna have changed yeah I I it </joey>
<connor> was it was luckily the snow was light </connor>
<joey> enough where the snow tires were fine </joey>
<connor> but if it had snowed anymore I think it </connor>
<joey> would have just it would just have to be </joey>
<joey> like sorry we can't go up there yeah </joey>
<connor> it's just too it's too bad geez you </connor>
<joey> couldn't stop it's scary it's pretty </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah because I mean like I I </joey>
<connor> went up to go see my grandma </connor>
<connor> um you know up in Sendai to steep </connor>
<connor> they're very steep yeah and like the the </connor>
<connor> town where like I kind of grew up I went </connor>
<garnt> there and uh I'd never seen that much </garnt>
<connor> snow in my life </connor>
<connor> yes </connor>
<connor> but like I mean Sendai can get some </connor>
<connor> snowfall but like the the zole like </connor>
<connor> mountain range stops a lot in the snow </connor>
<connor> right yeah like it's a lot though so </connor>
<connor> like so when I saw that there was like a </connor>
<connor> good 30 40 centimeters on the road I was </connor>
<connor> like this is unprecedented like it must </connor>
<joey> be like this winter has been absolutely </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] for Japan right now amazing for </joey>
<connor> the ski Fields but I'm not going to the </connor>
<connor> ski Fields this season because it's just </connor>
<connor> full of Australians yeah it's also no </connor>
<connor> offense Australia </connor>
<joey> it's also crazy how you you're going so </joey>
<joey> careful on this road and then of course </joey>
<joey> the public bus driver will be like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] multi-track drifting going down </joey>
<joey> like it like it is sleeping I'm like </joey>
<joey> this is [ __ ] up how does he drive a </joey>
<garnt> bus and he's taking this like it's easy </garnt>
<joey> he's like he's like one hamburger like </joey>
<joey> doing gastro players when I like full-on </joey>
<connor> steering man it's [ __ ] up I I was </connor>
<connor> terrified for my life and this bus came </connor>
<joey> downhill look dude didn't look phased </joey>
<connor> yeah he was like he's like yeah whatever </connor>
<connor> eyes closed dog I've been doing this my </connor>
<garnt> whole life yeah because I know I did </garnt>
<garnt> notice that like the week before we had </garnt>
<connor> like a cold front or something yeah </connor>
<connor> dropped like 10 degrees Yeah Yeah like </connor>
<connor> we uh we had a trip planned to Sapporo </connor>
<connor> when Sydney's family was in the country </connor>
<connor> and we had to cancel that yeah </connor>
<connor> um which you know it turned out to be a </connor>
<connor> blessing in disguise because they really </connor>
<connor> we went ended up going to yamanashi </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> a little bit like yeah much much warmer </connor>
<connor> uh no snow there still very very cold </connor>
<connor> but just no snow or anything like that </connor>
<connor> yeah um ended up having a fantastic time </connor>
<connor> as well yeah another thing I noticed uh </connor>
<connor> taking Sydney's family around the </connor>
<joey> countryside </joey>
<joey> um for some reason okay for some reason </joey>
<joey> obviously yamanashi I don't think it's a </joey>
<joey> lot of like foreign tourists compared to </joey>
<joey> Tokyo Osaka maybe yeah maybe Mount Fuji </joey>
<joey> but we weren't we weren't near anywhere </joey>
<joey> like too close to Mount Fuji </joey>
<joey> um so we went we showed them to a lot of </joey>
<joey> our you know favorite wineries where me </joey>
<joey> and Sydney would go </joey>
<joey> um since you know that's kind of the </joey>
<joey> area we know best </joey>
<joey> um and as soon as a lot of these local </joey>
<joey> Japanese people saw that there were </joey>
<joey> foreign tourists of course they'd be </joey>
<connor> scared at first but as soon as they </connor>
<connor> could tell me the city started speaking </connor>
<connor> Japanese like for some reason the </connor>
<connor> combination of foreign tourists and a </connor>
<connor> few of them that could speak Japanese </connor>
<connor> they went from Super scared to inviting </connor>
<connor> us to see like some of the most intimate </connor>
<connor> parts of their like establishments and </connor>
<connor> houses I don't know what this switch was </connor>
<connor> but I remember we went to one with this </connor>
<connor> one Winery and uh we were trying trying </connor>
<connor> a bunch of wines and everything like </connor>
<connor> that and at first they were like oh </connor>
<connor> sorry uh we don't know if you can try </connor>
<connor> all the wines you want and something </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> um and then uh we were waiting you know </connor>
<connor> we were we were outside just trying the </connor>
<connor> wine and the owner uh comes up to uh </connor>
<connor> comes up to me and Sydney </connor>
<joey> um and you know starts asking us oh why </joey>
<joey> are you guys here and I was like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> we live in Japan we're just showing our </joey>
<joey> parents rounds uh since this is their </joey>
<joey> first time to Japan and he as soon as as </joey>
<joey> soon as he saw that as as soon as he </joey>
<joey> heard that and as soon as he started </joey>
<joey> hearing that you know we live in Japan </joey>
<joey> he was like I gotta show you something </joey>
<connor> and I was like what uh what is going on </connor>
<connor> what are you buying what are you selling </connor>
<connor> and then he takes he takes us around he </connor>
<connor> takes us around behind the winery to </connor>
<joey> this like little back little shed and </joey>
<joey> he's just like oh oh this is the end </joey>
<joey> yeah so so none of this uh none of this </joey>
<connor> is for sale this is all my hobby and </connor>
<connor> it's and he opens the door and it's a </connor>
<connor> full-on like home brew Distillery </connor>
<connor> he's got this little shed and he's like </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to make gin this is a wine by </connor>
<garnt> the way uh so he's mad scientists so </garnt>
<garnt> literally he was like </garnt>

<garnt> good actually it was pretty it was </garnt>
<connor> pretty damn decent actually </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> made in Japan </joey>
<connor> it's probably the safest country in the </connor>
<joey> world to go into someone's shed and </joey>
<connor> drink their alcohol yeah still I don't </connor>
<joey> know I mean I would get it if it was </joey>
<joey> like you know a gin Distillery right but </joey>
<garnt> like I mean I mean like it's like to </garnt>
<connor> give credit to the uh I'm just Clowning </connor>
<garnt> on the whole shed part but yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> it was a shed but that's just because </garnt>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> um he does he has had he has built a </joey>
<connor> pretty big Winery for himself right um </connor>
<joey> and it's one of the most famous wineries </joey>
<connor> in that area I think he just wanted to </connor>
<connor> do something as like a personal project </connor>
<joey> no why not um and just start making gin </joey>
<garnt> and I was just like why are you in it's </garnt>
<garnt> beta why are you inviting us into your </garnt>
<joey> house it's so weird that they they </joey>
<garnt> literally go from like I just </garnt>
<joey> encountered an alien to being like Oh </joey>
<garnt> yes you are family for a generation yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah people are really chill especially </garnt>
<garnt> in the countryside we </garnt>
<garnt> um we also found like a brewery in the </garnt>
<garnt> middle of like middle of the yamanashi </garnt>
<garnt> as well that's just run by an </garnt>
<garnt> um American dude it's super super </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] random shout out to abina </garnt>
<garnt> brewery I think that's the name um they </garnt>
<garnt> just have like a craft beer Place yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah right yeah oh is that the crappie </joey>
<joey> that uh Sydney's dad gave yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's right that's right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was in this Brewery we </garnt>
<connor> found out you had to drive up a mountain </connor>
<connor> up a really really steep Mountain same </connor>
<connor> kind of mountain roads and he is just </connor>
<connor> this sounds like he's living his best </connor>
<connor> life yeah there's just this random dude </connor>
<connor> that was that just had a bunch of loud </connor>
<connor> he built his house </connor>
<connor> um on this land kind of like raised the </connor>
<connor> family there uh and uh one day like his </connor>
<garnt> mates were gassing him up that there </garnt>
<garnt> were no good craft beer places in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like kind of gassing him </garnt>
<joey> up to be like you could do it you could </joey>
<joey> do it so he just went [ __ ] it I'll do it </joey>
<garnt> myself and he just literally went [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> it I'll do it myself built his own brew </joey>
<joey> house right right on this mountain </joey>
<joey> bruises on a chair and I was talking to </joey>
<joey> him and he [ __ ] incredible story </joey>
<joey> where he was just like yeah I just I </joey>
<joey> just built uh built this brew house all </joey>
<joey> by myself uh designed it myself and uh </joey>
<joey> everything what an absolute shot great </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] beers hell yeah yeah so you can </joey>
<connor> you can find the most random things </connor>
<connor> sometimes just in the middle of the </connor>
<connor> countryside yeah talking around like </connor>
<joey> finding like run artifacts these exist I </joey>
<joey> feel like the most in Japan if anything </joey>
<joey> oh yeah where you just you go to like </joey>
<garnt> the most remote places and there'll just </garnt>
<garnt> be this really weird random sight there </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know I mean you know we </joey>
<joey> experienced that on the the road trip </joey>
<connor> special right like that [ __ ] Maui uh </connor>
<connor> sorry the uh the Easter Island heads in </connor>
<connor> the middle of that like that was </connor>
<garnt> literally in like it was kind of hard to </garnt>
<garnt> show in the video but that was truly in </garnt>
<connor> the middle of fall it was out there </connor>
<garnt> there was nothing else around us it was </garnt>
<connor> just there yeah and there's so many like </connor>
<connor> maybe not to that scale but yeah as God </connor>
<connor> was saying like there's so many like </connor>
<connor> either tiny restaurants or like bars or </connor>
<connor> like where I'm like how the [ __ ] are you </connor>
<connor> making any money out here yeah it's odd </connor>
<connor> like you maybe encounter like one person </connor>
<joey> every two weeks yeah it's like you run a </joey>
<garnt> business out here like okay yeah I'm </garnt>
<garnt> sure low cost of living kind of offsets </garnt>
<joey> that a little bit but I'm like that's </joey>
<joey> this uh still a big pleasure running </joey>
<joey> right yeah now cheap it is to run </joey>
<garnt> businesses out here yeah it must be for </garnt>
<garnt> my word of mouth or something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because otherwise some of these places </garnt>
<joey> is just be like you would never be able </joey>
<garnt> to find it otherwise yeah glad to say </garnt>
<garnt> though that </garnt>
<garnt> um despite not not despite but </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<joey> or after the first day Sydney's parents </joey>
<joey> very very much enjoyed Japan and uh they </joey>
<joey> after the weirdness of the after the </joey>
<joey> weirdness of the first day the girls </joey>
<joey> buying everything I kind of like I kind </joey>
<joey> of think it was a trial by fire because </joey>
<joey> we had a pretty normal trip afterwards </joey>
<joey> but after the trial by fire they just </joey>
<joey> enjoyed every aspect of Japanese culture </joey>
<connor> that's good kind of a simulated I don't </connor>
<connor> know if assimilated was is the right </connor>
<garnt> word but kind of got used to it very </garnt>
<garnt> very quickly so hopefully your parents </garnt>
<connor> have a similar experience yeah they're </connor>
<connor> coming on April so it'd be interesting </connor>
<joey> to see do you have anywhere you're going </joey>
<joey> to take them like you've already feed it </joey>
<connor> out or no I haven't I don't know where </connor>
<joey> to take them what are they I don't want </joey>
<connor> to go Kyoto but I know they want to go </connor>
<joey> kyotube maybe I can just send them off </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<joey> in April it's gonna be so </joey>
<joey> soft oh yeah because that's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> haunted me yeah I was like </joey>
<joey> have a few days where you take them to </joey>
<joey> the tourist spots because that's what we </joey>
<joey> did with his family but you're like you </joey>
<garnt> uh contrast that with just somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> outside in the country maybe yeah </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> April's a good time to drive around </garnt>
<joey> Japan yeah the roads are nice it's </joey>
<joey> really easy why this perfect so I'm </joey>
<connor> definitely gonna drive them around </connor>
<joey> somewhere I haven't decided where </joey>
<joey> um if you want something close by maybe </joey>
<connor> like hakone like around there would be </connor>
<connor> nice yeah I mean I mean you could drive </connor>
<connor> to yeah you could drive to Kyoto or that </connor>
<garnt> kind of area it's kind of fun drive yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's long yeah when uh winter Onsen with </garnt>
<connor> my father and uncle in law now did they </connor>
<connor> like it they've they absolutely loved it </connor>
<connor> they didn't mind getting naked I had to </connor>
<connor> do a little bit of convincing honestly </connor>
<connor> like the hardest part it's always the </connor>
<connor> bit before okay so here's here's the </connor>
<connor> thing when we're in Tokyo </connor>
<connor> um and we had to cancel a supper or a </connor>
<connor> trip yeah they were like just book us a </connor>
<connor> normal hotel and so they left the </connor>
<connor> booking to me they wanted just a normal </connor>
<connor> Hotel I tried to sell them the idea of </connor>
<connor> the Onsen beforehand and they were just </connor>
<connor> like it's fun you do have to peer </connor>
<garnt> pressure yeah yeah you feel like it's a </garnt>
<connor> really bad producer Get Naked Now show </connor>
<garnt> me your teeth trust me it's good so I I </garnt>
<garnt> did uh did a little bit of a white lie I </garnt>
<connor> was like there's only uh one place </connor>
<connor> that's open right now </connor>
<connor> turned out to be a nonsense there were </connor>
<connor> actually other hotels in the area that </connor>
<connor> were more traditional without nonsense </connor>
<connor> but it was all like kind of the same </connor>
<connor> price I was like I'm gonna go for the </connor>
<connor> Onsen and uh see where it takes us so I </connor>
<connor> booked the Onsen and we were there they </connor>
<connor> really really loved the more traditional </connor>
<connor> Japanese place I think you know I think </connor>
<connor> if they if they hadn't experienced that </connor>
<connor> they wouldn't have known what they were </connor>
<connor> missing kind of and so when I saw them </connor>
<connor> really enjoying like the more </connor>
<connor> traditional Vibes and everything I'm </connor>
<connor> like I think I can get them so I </connor>
<connor> remember going to this Brewery with them </connor>
<connor> and we I gotta got a bit toasted and on </connor>
<connor> the journey back I'm like </connor>
<connor> don't you guys feel like a nice warm </connor>
<connor> bath right now I'm just saying </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying hear me out I'm gonna go </connor>
<joey> right now it's gonna be one of the most </joey>
<joey> relaxing balls I've taken of my lives </joey>
<joey> you guys can join me no pressure at all </joey>
<joey> again now exactly and you know what </joey>
<joey> after uh after a long walk and a few </joey>
<connor> good beers that sounds like a really </connor>
<joey> really nice idea so just all it needed </joey>
<joey> was a little bit of a little bit of </joey>
<joey> convincing and then why do you do like a </joey>
<joey> tickle on them </joey>
<joey> that's how it is let me stick with the </joey>
<connor> balls just a little bit but uh yeah no </connor>
<connor> awkwardness at all no yeah even though </connor>
<connor> it was like you know technically like </connor>
<garnt> family members now no awkwardness at all </garnt>
<garnt> everyone enjoyed the Onsen </garnt>
<garnt> um and </garnt>
<joey> you know it really does change the </joey>
<joey> moment you step foot in the water yeah </joey>
<connor> honestly oh this was worse have you had </connor>
<connor> this conversation with people like can I </connor>
<garnt> wear can I wear like swim shorts yeah </garnt>
<connor> you cannot wear swim shorts </connor>
<joey> no you you can't wear swim shorts you're </joey>
<joey> not allowed do you always lose shorts in </joey>
<joey> your bath that's like more offensive </joey>
<joey> don't wear just don't do it like you </joey>
<connor> can't go in with swim shorts I'm like </connor>
<connor> why I'm like I I don't know how to </connor>
<connor> explain it to you it's a it's the </connor>
<joey> culture I don't know just get your [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> out and shut up just put your balls on </joey>
<joey> the back trust me it'll make sense when </joey>
<garnt> you're in all right like don't don't be </garnt>
<garnt> coming in with swimsuit yeah an old </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese lady will come in and kill you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like why like because it's because </garnt>
<connor> the view it is like you've got to be </connor>
<connor> clean you kind of foreign objects going </connor>
<connor> it's like dirty yeah no it's not dirty </connor>
<connor> and you probably washed them but it's </connor>
<connor> not how it works like you can't you're </connor>
<connor> not allowed okay yeah I don't I don't </connor>
<joey> come into your house making up rules </joey>
<connor> about who can go and walk back yeah </connor>
<joey> follow their rules like I get it you're </joey>
<joey> not comfortable </joey>
<joey> I just really </joey>
<garnt> like I do it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know it definitely I don't know </garnt>
<connor> if it is like a mental thing but it </connor>
<connor> definitely feels a lot cleaner being </connor>
<connor> naked because I remember when I when I </connor>
<connor> went back to England I went to your bath </connor>
<connor> and we went to like one of the Spas </connor>
<connor> there uh and they have like they have </connor>
<connor> like very kind of like similar Spas </connor>
<connor> where it's kind of not just a pool but </connor>
<connor> like I call it a hot tub yeah because </connor>
<connor> you're still in there with shorts and </connor>
<connor> there's just something about being there </connor>
<connor> in shorts and seeing other people in </connor>
<connor> shorts that it just maybe it's a mental </connor>
<garnt> thing but it definitely doesn't feel as </garnt>
<connor> refreshing or as clean yeah you know </connor>
<garnt> it's especially when everyone has to </garnt>
<joey> bathe before they can enter as well yeah </joey>
<garnt> I think that's that's also important </garnt>
<joey> right yeah I'm gonna try and get my </joey>
<garnt> parents to go one we'll see what they </garnt>
<connor> say yeah I'm doubtful I feel like my I </connor>
<connor> explained the idea of my mum she seemed </connor>
<connor> really against it she seemed like no I </connor>
<connor> can't do that yeah no no my dad I think </connor>
<connor> my dad is probably he I think he wanted </connor>
<connor> to seem chill but I feel like he won't </connor>
<connor> like it either </connor>
<joey> yeah if I tell them it's the culture </joey>
<joey> they'll be like I guess yeah there's </joey>
<joey> like there is nothing you can do about </joey>
<connor> it it is the culture just stuff that </connor>
<connor> like I have to eat this yeah </connor>
<joey> you will you literally get stabbed by </joey>
<garnt> the sushi chef if you don't finish this </garnt>
<garnt> just just put them in a situation when </garnt>
<connor> it onto and just feels really enticing </connor>
<connor> because as soon as you get them in the </connor>
<joey> mindset to be like just gas them up a </joey>
<connor> little bit yeah I'll just be like the </connor>
<connor> beer afterwards is going to be the most </connor>
<connor> refreshing beer of your life which it is </connor>
<connor> I gotta think of new names for fish to </connor>
<joey> lie to them so they don't know what the </joey>
<joey> actual fish is because if I tell them </joey>
<joey> what it is they won't eat it I think </joey>
<joey> I went to a sushi restaurant yesterday </joey>
<connor> and they served eel yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> really really good it didn't it tastes </connor>
<connor> so meaty yeah and I know that if you </connor>
<joey> tell someone it's ill they'll be like no </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but it looks like and the </joey>
<joey> concept honestly I don't know how he did </joey>
<connor> this but this eel looked like a piece of </connor>
<connor> mackerel yeah on top and I was like huh </connor>
<connor> just tell them it's mackerel </connor>
<garnt> everything's mackerel just be like we </garnt>
<garnt> don't have an English name it's just </garnt>
<joey> called unagi let's just see this yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like but what does that translate </joey>
<connor> some of them I know they're probably not </connor>
<joey> gonna like I'll be surprised if they </joey>
<connor> like sea urchin because I don't like sea </connor>
<joey> urchin that [ __ ] well yeah yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> like with things like with things like </joey>
<joey> sea urchin and even like salmon Roe for </joey>
<connor> a lot of people it's like it's a lot for </connor>
<joey> people yeah we'll see we'll see I'll see </joey>
<connor> yeah they probably want to go Kyoto </connor>
<connor> there and I'm again I'm dreading that I </connor>
<connor> don't I really don't wanna I'm thinking </connor>
<connor> I might try and be like you've been in </connor>
<connor> Japan a week now you're ready </connor>
<connor> I just I Kyoto is a really cool place </connor>
<joey> but I've only been with them when </joey>
<joey> there's no tourists and even then it </joey>
<joey> felt like a lot I don't know why kid is </joey>
<joey> cool but I'm I just don't think it's </joey>
<connor> like my kind of place almost like it's </connor>
<joey> way more my speed yeah </joey>
<connor> what a weird Leaf feels like a theme </connor>
<connor> park in a lot of ways yeah where it's </connor>
<connor> like it's like it doesn't feel like it's </connor>
<joey> very authentic Japanese experience even </joey>
<connor> though it's the most authentic thing it </connor>
<connor> feels super stiff super I mean it is old </connor>
<joey> school but like it has that Vibe and </joey>
<connor> like me personally I like the just the </connor>
<connor> the laid backness of other areas of </connor>
<garnt> Japan a lot more yeah oh no I totally </garnt>
<garnt> get that feel because uh actually when </garnt>
<garnt> you guys came to Thailand and I was </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about where I could take you </garnt>
<garnt> guys I already wanted to take you </garnt>
<connor> there's a lot of like temples in Bangkok </connor>
<connor> right but there's just something about </connor>
<connor> the vibe where you take you take you </connor>
<connor> know people were visiting to a temple </connor>
<connor> and you know the architecture [ __ ] we </connor>
<connor> saw some of them yeah beautiful </connor>
<joey> beautiful all gold and everything but </joey>
<joey> it's just so many tourists so many </joey>
<joey> people just taking pictures it's just </joey>
<joey> you kind of like lose a little bit of a </joey>
<joey> sense of what made this what makes this </joey>
<joey> place so amazing in the first place in </joey>
<joey> my opinion and I get that same kind of </joey>
<joey> feeling with Kyoto as well where it was </joey>
<joey> super cool to see when the streets were </joey>
<joey> empty and there was like no one there </joey>
<joey> obviously bad for the city bad for </joey>
<joey> business there </joey>
<garnt> um but honestly I I've like I I've </garnt>
<garnt> enjoyed just going to some other temples </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan where it's a bit more isolated </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah and Kyoto prices are nuts yeah </connor>
<connor> the uh ryokans and hotels and Kyoto are </connor>
<joey> so expensive oh yeah yeah so far like </joey>
<joey> that that whole area though like NADA </joey>
<joey> and Osaka as well is like they all </joey>
<connor> Uprising for that I've never been to </connor>
<connor> Nara and I I don't care about feeding </connor>
<joey> these deer why do people care so much </joey>
<joey> about this to be fair not uh I think out </joey>
<joey> of all the prefixes I've been to Nada </joey>
<connor> was probably the most underwhelming </connor>
<connor> because like you could feed elsewhere </connor>
<connor> okay look like you know as someone who </connor>
<connor> loves animals feeding the deer it's </connor>
<connor> pretty hype it's pretty fun especially </connor>
<connor> if you go with a bunch of people who are </connor>
<connor> like you know not that good with animals </connor>
<connor> and seeing them [ __ ] their pants is </connor>
<connor> really fun but other than that and the </connor>
<connor> giant uh the massive uh bronze Buddha </connor>
<connor> statue that they have there there isn't </connor>
<garnt> really a whole lot to do in Nara if I'm </garnt>
<garnt> being honest like it's it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> underwhelming that like there's maybe a </garnt>
<garnt> couple of like dishes that you can only </garnt>
<garnt> get in Nara but it's not anything like </garnt>
<connor> yeah I'm blowing if you ask me like most </connor>
<connor> if you want the good food you just go to </connor>
<connor> Osaka and if you want the culture you go </connor>
<connor> to Kyoto it's like nara's kind of in the </connor>
<connor> middle of that and it's not really yeah </connor>
<connor> I mean I I think we've been living here </connor>
<connor> long enough where I just enjoy just </connor>
<connor> driving around small areas yeah just </connor>
<connor> seeing all the weird stuff they have and </connor>
<garnt> just kind of checking that out it's way </garnt>
<joey> way more fun I agree it's a touristy </joey>
<joey> places especially because we've lived </joey>
<joey> here and obviously if you come here the </joey>
<joey> first time you should go and do the </joey>
<joey> touristy stuff because it's cool it is </joey>
<connor> cool if you're going for the first time </connor>
<connor> go to kodo go to nargo's awesome yeah </connor>
<joey> they're awesome but yeah after a while </joey>
<garnt> you just be like I think I'm good yeah </garnt>
<connor> just yeah just driving around is my </connor>
<connor> favorite part as well yeah yeah you'll </connor>
<connor> drive more gone I'm looking for more </connor>
<connor> opportunities I'm glad I'm glad I got </connor>
<connor> one you know with this but you know yeah </connor>
<connor> next time as well next time next time </connor>
<garnt> can't relate yeah so uh I was the movie </garnt>
<connor> the other day that I think YouTube I </connor>
<garnt> like the way you said that like it was </garnt>
<garnt> an impressive thing because you know I </garnt>
<connor> watched a movie yesterday </connor>
<garnt> um I think it'd be a movie you guys will </garnt>
<connor> like uh it's called the Northman okay </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<connor> um I had never heard of it until Aki </connor>
<connor> told me about it because Aki's been on </connor>
<garnt> this really weird binge of watching </garnt>
<garnt> Viking films I don't know why okay uh </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's the fact that she loves </garnt>
<garnt> Assassin's Creed uh but like she but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so she recommended me this film </garnt>
<connor> that came out like not that long ago </connor>
<connor> like maybe a couple of months ago </connor>
<connor> um like didn't do any numbers at the box </connor>
<connor> office or anything but I was interested </connor>
<connor> to watch it because it's a Robert Eggers </connor>
<connor> film and he's the same guy who made the </connor>
<connor> lighthouse yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> um and I was like okay well I like this </connor>
<connor> actor and like the people and it was </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] star-studded like you know </connor>
<connor> cast like there was um uh Alex scars God </connor>
<garnt> uh who's the guy who played uh Pennywise </garnt>
<connor> and Bjork was in the film which I </connor>
<garnt> thought was interesting I was like okay </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even know you could act uh and </connor>
<connor> like Willem Dafoe and like you know all </connor>
<connor> these like I like the lighthouse live </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so I watched it and uh it was </connor>
<connor> the most [ __ ] over-the-top Epic film </connor>
<connor> I've ever seen in my it was like if you </connor>
<connor> took the concept of a Viking Revenge </connor>
<connor> story and put it in a dark souls world </connor>
<connor> like the the fights were just so like </connor>
<connor> I've been meaning to watch it yeah like </connor>
<connor> you know how like you know how like </connor>
<connor> Eggers uh type of like directing is like </connor>
<garnt> very like art Housey yeah it's very hot </garnt>
<garnt> it's very you know it's very </garnt>
<garnt> non-conventional right </garnt>
<garnt> um which is probably why it flopped at </garnt>
<garnt> the box office but yeah apparently it </garnt>
<garnt> was a flop yeah unfortunately which is </garnt>
<garnt> like crazy because it was such a good </garnt>
<garnt> one but like the the fights what I liked </garnt>
<connor> about this film was that like I guess </connor>
<connor> the guy who wrote the original </connor>
<connor> screenplay of it is like a poet so all </connor>
<connor> of the dialogue is kind of written in </connor>
<connor> this like poetry of sorts so it's not so </connor>
<connor> it's not so much like uh you know I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna go you know avenge my my uncle who </connor>
<connor> killed my father and you know know they </connor>
<connor> will reap for their sins in the gates of </connor>
<connor> hell it was more like you know it was </connor>
<connor> like I will find the blade in the moon </connor>
<garnt> of the knights and like Shakespearean </garnt>
<connor> yeah it was it was so like it was like </connor>
<connor> watching a stage play yeah but with </connor>
<connor> these Vikings and it and like the some </connor>
<connor> of the fight scenes were just like the </connor>
<connor> most 300 us like fight scenes where it's </connor>
<garnt> just like so over the top so epic like </garnt>
<garnt> there's one point where they're like two </garnt>
<garnt> Vikings completely butt naked a fighting </garnt>
<garnt> on like the top of a volcano and the </garnt>
<garnt> volcano is like erupting in the </garnt>
<garnt> background they just like slicing each </garnt>
<garnt> other this is this is too insane this is </garnt>
<garnt> too epic that and and it made me realize </garnt>
<garnt> I was like why has no one heard of this </garnt>
<garnt> film why is like no one watched this </garnt>
<garnt> film because it's like it literally did </garnt>
<joey> feel like like Dark Souls right like if </joey>
<garnt> they made Dark Souls into a movie and </garnt>
<garnt> they put something like animals that you </garnt>
<connor> watched it no no no it was uh it was </connor>
<connor> online I saw it online </connor>
<connor> it came out last year actually oh oh </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> meaning either so I watched it and I was </connor>
<connor> just like God damn like because I still </connor>
<garnt> haven't seen the lighthouse right </garnt>
<connor> um but I've seen like little bits on the </connor>
<garnt> White House yeah and I was like okay if </garnt>
<garnt> this is the same guy made the lighthouse </garnt>
<joey> I'm interested now yeah </joey>
<joey> um but yeah it was it just made me </joey>
<joey> realize I was like Vikings are [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> cool </joey>
<joey> like I knew they were cool like watch </joey>
<connor> finland's songs yeah yeah but that's </connor>
<connor> what I was saying yeah I was like </connor>
<connor> halfway through this filming and I I </connor>
<joey> looked over at you I'm like you should </joey>
<joey> probably watch Vineland Saga because </joey>
<joey> this this the plot is basically Finland </joey>
<connor> Saga right yeah it's actually not much </connor>
<joey> no she's never seen it I don't know and </joey>
<joey> I'm like you're on the Viking like thing </joey>
<garnt> like go go watch the households like we </garnt>
<garnt> do not watch anime </garnt>
<joey> don't let me tap it do not watch </joey>
<joey> anything it has been zero days since </joey>
<connor> anime was washed </connor>
<connor> yeah so um I just wanted to recommend </connor>
<connor> that film because uh I've literally </connor>
<connor> heard no one talking about it </connor>
<connor> yeah it's so I watched a few new films </connor>
<connor> on the flyby from Thailand as well okay </connor>
<connor> oh yeah because I I I was just so tired </connor>
<connor> uh I forgot to download yeah </connor>
<connor> sorry um got to download any uh anime or </connor>
<connor> anything like that so I'm like okay okay </connor>
<connor> God forbid I gotta now go through the </connor>
<connor> library or films on this live action </connor>
<connor> films live action films and for some </connor>
<joey> reason Thai Airways had like the entire </joey>
<joey> let's say Trilogy of Godzilla films oh </joey>
<joey> no like the new ones yeah the new ones </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] and I was like </joey>
<joey> it's kind of anime right </joey>
<joey> just because it's Japanese </joey>
<garnt> but you know so I just wanted to see uh </garnt>
<garnt> out of everything because I'd watched </garnt>
<joey> most of the films that were on the </joey>
<joey> library so wait so it's Shin Godzilla no </joey>
<garnt> no it's it's the uh it's Godzilla yeah </garnt>

<joey> monsters and Godzilla versus King Kong </joey>
<connor> oh no it's just like let's let's </connor>
<joey> see what this let's see what this </joey>
<joey> Trilogy is all about honestly not that </joey>
<joey> bad I had a great time </joey>
<connor> um I didn't know because I I have not </connor>
<connor> paid attention to the Godzilla films I </connor>
<connor> did not know that they had made a </connor>
<connor> Cinematic Universe for the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> Monster films yeah did you know this </joey>
<joey> yeah I had no idea yeah I just I [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> love Godzilla I haven't watched it but I </connor>
<connor> knew that right because other people </connor>
<joey> talk about it yeah because like </joey>
<joey> especially like king of monsters was </joey>
<garnt> like fan fiction for like or like </garnt>
<garnt> fanservice fully Godzilla fans because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like like you had like Ghidorah </garnt>
<garnt> come out like my girl Mothra was there I </garnt>
<garnt> was like let's go you're moving here </garnt>
<connor> because I was like damn they're bringing </connor>
<connor> out all the [ __ ] messes what's going </connor>
<connor> on </connor>
<connor> just being just one film yeah just </connor>
<connor> having </connor>
<connor> um and just you know having that one </connor>
<connor> film especially in like the western </connor>
<connor> films uh and there's that be it I didn't </connor>
<connor> realize that they had made a kind of </connor>
<connor> like a ongoing storyline with all of </connor>
<connor> these monsters and then adding like King </connor>
<garnt> Kong into the mix and adding the King </garnt>
<garnt> Kong movies uh honestly out of I had a </garnt>
<garnt> much better time than I thought I would </garnt>
<garnt> had considering I'm not that big of a </garnt>
<garnt> fan of like Godzilla which one was your </garnt>
<garnt> favorite </garnt>
<garnt> probably king of monsters yeah right uh </garnt>
<joey> like I don't know why that movie got so </joey>
<garnt> much [ __ ] because I'm like dude how </garnt>
<garnt> could you hate a bunches get [ __ ] get </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] on I heard king of monsters wasn't </connor>
<connor> as well received in like the Godzilla </connor>
<connor> fan base right or whatever or like just </connor>
<connor> the general movie going thing and I'm </connor>
<joey> like how could you hate a bunch of </joey>
<garnt> monsters beating the [ __ ] out of each </garnt>
<garnt> other yeah it may be I think it just </garnt>
<garnt> like lit a certain part of my brains </garnt>
<garnt> that I just like oh giant things are fun </garnt>
<joey> yeah giant giant monsters that's cool it </joey>
<joey> was like Smash Bros with Kaiju it was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] honestly right because the whole </joey>
<joey> gang is here I don't think anything's </joey>
<joey> tickled that part of my brain since like </joey>
<garnt> the the original Pacific Rim oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> I consider they always all kind of like </connor>
<garnt> bash your head together films yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> it was literally just ungo Bunga films </connor>
<connor> but in like entire cities yeah I gotta I </connor>
<connor> gotta say the MVPs uh whoever the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] construction workers are to </connor>
<connor> rebuild these cities every time a </connor>
<connor> monster battle happens because oh my God </connor>
<garnt> in king of monsters every [ __ ] City </garnt>
<garnt> gets destroyed my God is there a city </garnt>
<garnt> left on Earth that hasn't been decimated </garnt>
<garnt> by these monsters oh yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> another film art which Were King Kong </garnt>

<joey> King Kong film whatever that remake was </joey>
<joey> oh the one with Jack Black in it I just </joey>
<connor> had a Jack Black yeah that one sucked </connor>
<connor> yeah oh yeah everyone that came out </connor>
<garnt> though everyone hyped that up to Dad </garnt>
<garnt> yeah as a kid I remember yeah why is </garnt>
<garnt> everyone talking about it okay I I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if I would call it it's ironic but </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I would can call the </garnt>
<garnt> original King Kong Kaiju that's a </garnt>
<joey> never-ending argument okay maybe maybe </joey>
<joey> so many writer threads I've seen being </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> I thought it was because they always had </connor>
<connor> like King Kong versus Godzilla and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um I feel like Clifford the bid ranked </connor>
<connor> Donna okay okay </connor>
<joey> like I don't think the original King </joey>
<joey> Kong films </joey>
<joey> yeah like their appeal to me is totally </joey>
<connor> different because when you know when I </connor>
<connor> watch a King Kong film it's like </connor>
<connor> something different right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> actually really good analogy it's it's </connor>
<connor> more like seeing Sonic and smash and </connor>
<connor> it's like he's like the American dude </connor>
<connor> it's like King Kong he just got roped in </connor>
<joey> like I I know I like if you ask me and </joey>
<connor> you put a gun on my head if I I just </connor>
<connor> said it you know it's like the closest </connor>
<joey> kind of thing yeah I know I think King </joey>
<connor> Kong became a Kaiju after he was kind of </connor>
<connor> roped into the Godzilla like franchise </connor>
<garnt> yeah I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah to me like Pacific Rim is still one </garnt>
<connor> of my favorite turn your head off uh </connor>
<joey> sorry turn your brain off and just enjoy </joey>
<garnt> visual cocaine because oh my God that </garnt>
<joey> film gets you so hot I I always wondered </joey>
<connor> uh on planes I was like I wonder if the </connor>
<connor> the airflow crew they like judge what </connor>
<connor> you're watching if they see what you're </connor>
<connor> watching they're like that's [ __ ] dog </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] because I was watching like a Spyro </connor>
<connor> of the dragon video and someone comes </connor>
<connor> over to me she's like do you want </connor>
<connor> champagne </connor>
<garnt> I'm like I will </garnt>
<connor> Spyro watching Spyro the Dragon videos </connor>
<joey> I'm like they must think I am a weird </joey>
<joey> ass but I'm sitting in this business </joey>
<garnt> seat next to all these serious </garnt>
<garnt> businessmen watching Spyro the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> Dragon reviews like they were thinking </garnt>
<garnt> like who is this guy why is he what is </garnt>
<garnt> he watching so I was also I was also </garnt>
<garnt> judging the person in front of me for </garnt>
<garnt> what they were watching right we got on </garnt>
<garnt> the six hour flight and I shoot you not </garnt>
<garnt> this person was watching minions and </garnt>
<garnt> Minions movies the whole yeah and I was </garnt>
<connor> always that guy and I was like who is </connor>
<connor> this guy because I was wondering what </connor>
<connor> kind of person would watch minions yeah </connor>
<joey> business class I thought because because </joey>
<joey> we had a couple of like uh like kids in </joey>
<joey> the the business cabin that we were in </joey>
<garnt> right so I remember yeah it was the guy </garnt>
<garnt> sitting right in front of me yeah I was </garnt>
<garnt> like every time I looked over I </garnt>
<garnt> just to check you know maybe it's like a </garnt>
<connor> 15 year old kid or whatever I look it's </connor>
<connor> like a 50 year old woman yeah </connor>
<connor> dead serious face just watching minions </connor>
<joey> and minions too and I'm like yeah hey </joey>
<connor> man </connor>
