<garnt> - Hey guys, do you like charity. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Gamers, we have a big announcement. </garnt>
<garnt> We are going to be doing a 24 hour charity stream. </garnt>
<joey> You heard that, right. </joey>
<joey> - So the world situation kind of messed up right now </joey>
<joey> for all sorts of different reasons. </joey>
<joey> So we thought we would come together </joey>
<joey> stream for 24 hours to support Doctors without borders </joey>
<joey> on our channel twitch channel. </joey>
<joey> twitch.tv/trashtastepodcast. </joey>
<joey> What are we gonna be doing on that stream though? </joey>
<joey> Is the question, you're probably asking. </joey>
<connor> - Games. </connor>
<connor> We have a bunch of different things planned, </connor>
<connor> including guests, games and humiliation, </connor>
<joey> and Joey will eat a ghost pepper, maybe who knows. If we- </joey>
<joey> - Maybe. - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - So make sure to open up that wallet, </joey>
<connor> to make sure that Joey can suffer. </connor>
<joey> - That's the reason we're doing this. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I'm not here for the charity. </connor>
<connor> I'm here to make Joey suffer. </connor>
<joey> - So the event will be starting 11:00 am, </joey>
<joey> Japan time on the 19th of March. </joey>
<joey> If you live anywhere else in the world, </joey>
<connor> here are some just basic time zones </connor>
<connor> that hopefully mood on is putting on screen right now. </connor>
<connor> If not look it up yourself on time converter. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it'll be going on 24 hours </connor>
<joey> and we'll hopefully change the world for the better, </joey>
<joey> even for a little bit. </joey>
<garnt> - And on with the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, you're not gonna, you're gonna solve it, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna solve it, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - No, because I fucking got my yellow down here somehow. </joey>
<joey> - We can't start recordings </joey>
<joey> until Joey solves his rubics cube that's- </joey>
<joey> - It's fine's. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I've got like, I need a chip, </connor>
<connor> but like, it'll just- </connor>
<connor> (video fast-forwarding) (light upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - I completely forgot about that we talked about it. </connor>
<connor> - All right there we go. </connor>
<connor> (upbeat light music) </connor>
<joey> - Welcome poop enthusiast </joey>
<joey> to another episode of Trash Taste Podcast. </joey>
<joey> I'm poop enthusiast one with poop enthusiast- </joey>
<connor> - I'm not a poop enthusiast. I'm a bidet enthusiast. </connor>
<joey> It's a difference. </joey>
<connor> - You literally just said. </connor>
<connor> God, I need to shit. </connor>
<connor> - No I don't. I need to. </connor>
<connor> - I hope that's the first, second of this episode. </connor>
<connor> - The same way you need to- </connor>
<connor> I'm not getting into this guys. </connor>
<connor> I don't even wanna humor this clown. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> What you've been up to Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - Pooping, pooping, doing a lot of pooping. </garnt>
<joey> - Not playing Final Fantasy XIV like an idiot. </joey>
<joey> - For fuck sake Joey, for fuck sake Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I called you out right from the Get Go. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> Like I remember, so we record the episode </joey>
<garnt> where Joey's like, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt don't play Final Fantasy XIV. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I think it was like four weeks ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah and I'm like, okay Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> you're a good mate, I will trust you. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then what happens? </garnt>
<garnt> I get a condition in which I need to stay in the house, </garnt>
<garnt> every day for about two weeks straight. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I have nothing to do </garnt>
<connor> because I'm not well enough to work. </connor>
<connor> So what I do first, I complete 13 Sentinels, which is- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you finished it? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I finished it. And then it was- </connor>
<connor> - Was it good? - It was as fucking insane, </connor>
<connor> as you said it was. - Good. </connor>
<connor> - And then I sit there, twiddling my thumbs, going, </connor>
<connor> what now, what do I do now? </connor>
<connor> And then I look at the date and I look at Twitter </connor>
<connor> and Final Fantasy XIV, comes back on sale to the public. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, either this is a sign from God </connor>
<joey> or the devil, either one. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely the devil. </joey>
<garnt> - Either one it's a sign. </garnt>
<connor> - The only way to get you guys to do anything is be like, </connor>
<connor> don't do this, don't, don't, don't, don't watch this. </connor>
<joey> Don't play this game. You won't like it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, was that the problem. </joey>
<joey> I was being too negative, I had to do the opposite. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't watcha this week. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Just saying that's it. </joey>
<connor> That's it, that's it. That's all I've to say. </connor>
<joey> - That's so funny, I didn't either. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's crazy. - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - Shit couldn't be me. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah, I mean talking about addiction Joey, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, you recently going to new Gotcha game as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> We mentioned it very briefly in the last episode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just like the week where we just, </connor>
<joey> what am I gonna start heroine this week as well. </joey>
<joey> Like, well. </joey>
<garnt> - Addicts anonymous. </garnt>
<connor> - Everything just goes wrong this week. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you've recently just been addicted </garnt>
<garnt> to torturing yourself. - I'm not addicted to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna be done with it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm tryna finish. </garnt>
<joey> - You're definitely addicted to it. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, </garnt>
<connor> I don't like hurting myself. </connor>
<garnt> - You're like a fucking mas- </garnt>
<garnt> well, you don't like hurting yourself, </garnt>
<joey> you say after like your 10th Jump King stream. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] It's like, you know what I'll do it again? </connor>
<joey> - And then getting over it </joey>
<connor> and then the Pogo stick or- - [Joey] I call it Pogo Stuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Pogo Stuck, that's it. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, first of all, I wanna clarify. </connor>
<connor> I don't enjoy hurting myself. </connor>
<connor> But, I enjoy challenge. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes challenges. </joey>
<joey> - Is that not just mentally hurting yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Challenges require us to go through some uncomfortable </joey>
<joey> feelings and challenges. </joey>
<joey> - I get that, you know but I think- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> No, I get that sentiment. </connor>
<connor> But I think what makes a challenge, you know, </connor>
<joey> satisfying is when you do it every now and then. </joey>
<joey> You know, not every stream. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Well you know what, I had this like revelation. </connor>
<connor> While I was sitting there and I was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> nobody bets an nine, </connor>
<connor> if you spend 1000 hours playing a FPS, </connor>
<connor> the moment you put 10 hours into a shitty jumping game, </connor>
<connor> everyone's like, you've got a problem. </connor>
<connor> You know, what's up with that? </connor>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - I still think putting a thousand hours </joey>
<connor> into an FBS is a problem. </connor>
<joey> - That's not a problem. </joey>
<garnt> You don't know, you're not a gamer. </garnt>
<connor> A thousand hours into an FPSs is not. </connor>
<connor> - Well over how long? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, like a month. </connor>
<connor> - A month! </connor>
<joey> - Okay, no that is a problem. </joey>
<joey> That is a problem. </joey>
<joey> - Hold on, is there even a thousand hours in a month? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It would be just under I think. </connor>
<joey> - Because that would be a slight, </joey>
<connor> that would be a different problem entirely if there wasn't. </connor>
<joey> - No, there is not. No. </joey>
<connor> No, there is. What am I saying? </connor>
<joey> - How many hours in a month? </joey>
<connor> - [Staff] 720 hours. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So this man is like in the hyperbolic time chain. </connor>
<garnt> - You can watch YouTube at 1.5 times speed, </garnt>
<garnt> I FPS in 1.5 times. (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like FPS, I can get it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause at least there's a bit more variety </garnt>
<garnt> than literally pressing a button </garnt>
<garnt> and pointing in a direction </garnt>
<garnt> and doing that for 10 hours straight. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never had like my wrists hurt before from gaming, </connor>
<connor> but doing the space bar games, that hurts my wrist actually. </connor>
<connor> I dunno why that hurts. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. That is carpal tunnel speed run. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's cause it's like the same action </garnt>
<connor> over and over and over, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But it's good content though, isn't it? </connor>
<joey> Not right now, it's terrible. </joey>
<joey> - It's good content. </joey>
<joey> No, no, watch. </joey>
<joey> - It's terrible right now. </joey>
<joey> It's like dementia stream. </joey>
<joey> I'm just going around </joey>
<joey> and doing the same thing over and over again. </joey>
<joey> Not making any progress. </joey>
<joey> And but when I do beat it... </joey>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying it's good content to watch, </joey>
<joey> not to do. </joey>
<joey> - Well it's a great YouTube highlight. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause then it's done. </joey>
<joey> But when you're in the middle of it, </joey>
<joey> you're like, I don't know if I can do this. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna have a mental breakdown. </joey>
<garnt> Don't know if like this can be done. </garnt>
<connor> Mark did like seven YouTube parts and just gave up. </connor>
<connor> - Like soul crushing, that is. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like it's good content in the same way </garnt>
<connor> that, you know Mr. Beast saying PewDiePie a million times. </connor>
<connor> Whatever is good content, you know, </connor>
<joey> but you know, it's not exactly what I'd call fun </joey>
<joey> and it's it's definitely suffering. </joey>
<joey> - That's not a J I can, you know, bring back. </joey>
<connor> - So you know, I'd be all the Jump King DLC, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty gonna do the other one at some point. </connor>
<connor> I might have done it by the time this comes out who knows. </connor>
<connor> But I finished playing it </connor>
<connor> and I was like, oh my God, thank God, </connor>
<connor> the challenge is over, I can finally rest. </connor>
<connor> And I played Pokemon Arceus. </connor>
<connor> And like, it was kind of difficult, </connor>
<joey> but at no point did I ever think, I can't do this, </joey>
<joey> like this is too much. - [Joey] Well yeah of course, </joey>
<joey> it's a Pokemon game. </joey>
<joey> - And I missed that. </joey>
<joey> I missed that moment where I was like, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if I can do this, like this is so difficult. </connor>
<connor> I need this. </connor>
<connor> - That's why you are a gamer and I'm not. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the moment I see a part of a game where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> I can't do this, I'm like, guess I'll die. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I just don't do it. </connor>
<connor> - When I know someone else has done something, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, well I can do it then. </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't you play Sifu then? </garnt>
<connor> - What's that? - [Staff] Oh Sifu. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah Sifu, it's like a new game that just came out, </garnt>
<connor> which is kind of like based on, you know, </connor>
<connor> old school martial arts films. </connor>
<connor> And I've heard, it's like pretty damn hard </connor>
<connor> and it's pretty challenging. </connor>
<connor> It's like got, I mean I haven't played it yet, </connor>
<connor> but I've seen other streamers and other people </connor>
<garnt> talk about it and I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to use like the Dark Soul analogy </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone uses the fucking Dark Soul analogy. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, difficulty didn't exist before Dark Souls. </garnt>
<garnt> But I have heard that it is a challenging game </garnt>
<garnt> to get through that has... </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] What I don't understand is- </joey>
<joey> - But I think like Dark Souls like nothing </joey>
<connor> compared to these rage games. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but what I don't understand is, </joey>
<connor> okay, you say you wanna go for a challenge, right? </connor>
<connor> You don't wanna learn how to speed run. </connor>
<connor> - So speed run is a different thing for me entirely. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think so. I think- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I think it's exactly the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think speed running is closer to the shit </garnt>
<connor> you're doing with Jump King and Pogo Stuck </connor>
<connor> than it is to do with like challenging, </connor>
<garnt> you know, like just mechanically challenging games. </garnt>
<connor> - See, here's this is where I think speed running for me </connor>
<connor> is like something that, I mean, I've enjoyed it, </connor>
<connor> I've done it in the past, </connor>
<connor> speed run like Cuphead back when they had </connor>
<connor> an exploit in the game that they removed </connor>
<connor> and then it's like not really fun to do, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it takes a lot longer now. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So I used to enjoy doing it, </connor>
<connor> but I found that the point was is like, </connor>
<connor> okay, let's say you get to a certain point </connor>
<connor> and you get to a really good time </connor>
<connor> and you start shaving off like microseconds, right. </connor>
<connor> If you're a streamer and you know, you wanna stream content, </connor>
<garnt> it becomes really difficult to keep saying </garnt>
<garnt> like, this is content over and over again. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm not a speed runner. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm tryna make content, right. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so if I'm tryna make like a YouTube channel, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm tryna make highlights, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't be like Jump King speed run highlights part 17. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, it just doesn't work like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And also with like saying my Pogo Stuck or Jump King, right. </garnt>
<connor> When, if I'm not speed running, </connor>
<connor> I tried speed running Jump King, </connor>
<connor> I got pretty good time, but in 12 minutes. </connor>
<connor> I think I can do better, </connor>
<connor> but again, I'd have to grind it a bunch </connor>
<connor> and it's not that entertaining. </connor>
<connor> But having a hard goal that is like, </connor>
<connor> you have done it, at this point you're done, you can stop. </connor>
<connor> That's way more satisfying, I think as a viewer to watch. </connor>
<connor> But also as a content creator, </connor>
<connor> it's a lot better for like a narrative in a video </connor>
<garnt> to have like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's pretty simple to turn speed running </garnt>
<connor> into content. You just- - Well, you can, </connor>
<connor> - You just set yourself a hard target, </connor>
<garnt> a hard and you get on it. </garnt>
<joey> - Like when I say you should be doing speed running content, </joey>
<joey> I don't mean like you should be going </joey>
<joey> for a fucking world record or anything. </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, like maybe setting your goal to be like, </joey>
<joey> all right, if the world record </joey>
<joey> is like 10 minutes in this game. </joey>
<joey> Then, you know, my goal is to get a PB of 15 minutes. </joey>
<connor> - Well then that sense then yeah. </connor>
<joey> You could do that. </joey>
<connor> I mean like Ladvick did it with like </connor>
<connor> some of the games that, he did like, </connor>
<connor> "Can you beat all Jump King in an hour? </connor>
<connor> For all three maps, you know that that's interesting. </connor>
<connor> That's way more appealing to me, </connor>
<connor> than Trish tryna grinding at the best time. </connor>
<connor> Very impressive with the people who can do it. </connor>
<connor> I'm just not consistent enough. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's fucking hard. This like these. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> You've been pretty consistent </joey>
<garnt> with all these like hard ass games. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. I mean, you- </garnt>
<joey> - I think you're like one step away. </joey>
<joey> - You seem to have found a niche of just, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I will just do this one repetitive thing </joey>
<joey> that is this one mechanic in the game </joey>
<joey> and do it for 10 hours. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like- </joey>
<joey> - That sounds exactly like what a speed runner will do. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you know, it's one of those things. </connor>
<garnt> I keep saying that when I wanna buy time, </garnt>
<garnt> like one of those things. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of those things, one more thing. </garnt>
<connor> - You basically can- </connor>
<connor> You need perseverance to like an extreme level </connor>
<connor> for a lot of these games. </connor>
<connor> And I feel that most people will just think this is stupid, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, I can see like the micro improvements. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that like tiny, tiny improvements every time. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like this is pure opium right now. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's not. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay. - It's not. </connor>
<connor> You get better. - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like I get that for like say, </connor>
<connor> a mechanically intensive game, like Sifu, </connor>
<joey> you know like Dark Souls. </joey>
<joey> You would not be feeling this satisfied </joey>
<joey> if you weren't streaming this game. </joey>
<joey> - No, I would never do it alone. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, right. </joey>
<joey> Because it isn't as satisfied. </joey>
<joey> Like you are finding like the micro, </joey>
<joey> like the micro thing that you find fun </joey>
<garnt> about this game to try and cope with how much of a like. </garnt>
<joey> - How much of a shit time you're having. </joey>
<joey> - How much of a shit time you're having while doing it. </joey>
<joey> But at least people are watching you do it. </joey>
<joey> You know, I'm not. </joey>
<joey> - The chat is the silver lining in this whole thing. </joey>
<joey> - But like, okay. </joey>
<connor> So like Jump King initially I thought that it was dumb, </connor>
<connor> I thought it was stupid. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was unfair. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - After playing it, I think it's like amazing. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's like, I'm not kidding. </connor>
<connor> It's an amazing game. </connor>
<connor> - Would you have said that though if you hadn't beaten it? </connor>
<connor> - No, absolutely not. </connor>
<joey> I understand if you play it and you think it's unfair, </joey>
<joey> I understand that. </joey>
<joey> But when you play those games more and especially like, </joey>
<connor> okay, Pogo Stuck is no, it's awful, awful game, not- </connor>
<garnt> - You said that for Jump King like literally </garnt>
<connor> two, three weeks ago, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I said Jump King was good. </garnt>
<connor> - This is gonna be Polish things when he beats Pogo Stuck. </connor>
<connor> And he's like best game ever made amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Jump King has the bang of visuals, </connor>
<garnt> absolutely amazing sound. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do agree. </garnt>
<connor> I do like the aesthetics of Jump King. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a it's a package, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Well, I will hold my- </connor>
<connor> I will reserve my opinions </connor>
<connor> because by the time this episode comes out, </connor>
<connor> me and Joey will probably have already done </connor>
<connor> our Jump King race. </connor>
<connor> - You try and beat it. </connor>
<garnt> You gonna go for it. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, if we can. </joey>
<garnt> Sure, but I think. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean probably not on that race, but personally. </joey>
<joey> If I start something, I'm going to finish it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. I like if like- </joey>
<joey> I think this race is gonna be </joey>
<joey> the reason why I came up with the race ideas </joey>
<garnt> because, you know, I like myself enough </garnt>
<garnt> to not torture myself on stream for entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like- </garnt>
<joey> - So he dragged me. He dragged me. </joey>
<joey> He dragged me. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I need someone else to feel the pain with me. </joey>
<joey> - It was literally on camera. </joey>
<joey> You could, rewind by that. </joey>
<joey> He was like, Jump King sounds fun, </joey>
<joey> Garnt, do you wanna do Jump King? </joey>
<garnt> - You wanna do too? You haven't played, </garnt>
<joey> oh, what a coincidence. </joey>
<joey> Me neither. </joey>
<connor> But I think like, I mean, </connor>
<connor> we've probably already done it by the time </connor>
<connor> this episodes coming out. </connor>
<connor> But like as of right now, </connor>
<connor> I think it's like we're giving ourselves like maybe </connor>
<joey> four hours just because Garnt </joey>
<joey> and I are incapable of streaming </joey>
<joey> for more than four hours in any game. </joey>
<connor> - I think 10 to 15 hours is a good range </connor>
<joey> of how long it might take you. </joey>
<connor> - All right. So that race, we probably won't beat it. </connor>
<joey> But I think afterwards, once we get the idea, </joey>
<joey> then we'll probably like individually do it </joey>
<connor> and then try and beat it. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, 'cause like games like that, </connor>
<connor> they like trick you into thinking </connor>
<connor> that the only progress that matters </connor>
<connor> is how far you've gotten. </connor>
<connor> Where it's like in games like jump king and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna have to restart so many times </connor>
<connor> where it's not about how far you can get, </connor>
<connor> it's how many times can you do all of the jumps to the point </connor>
<connor> where you felt perfect. </connor>
<connor> Like, can you do that more consistent? </connor>
<joey> - It kinda sounds like speed running. </joey>
<connor> - Kind of. Yeah, yeah. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I mean it is. </joey>
<connor> - But at least with Jump King, you get a mental break, </connor>
<connor> you know, you can stop for a moment </connor>
<connor> and you can kind of like, okay, right. </connor>
<connor> Poker Stuck doesn't stop. </connor>
<garnt> The Pogo doesn't stop moving. It's just awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like speed running. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean the more I think about it, the more I'm just like. </garnt>
<joey> - The more I think about Pogo Stuck is just a speed running. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah it's a speed running simulator. </garnt>
<connor> - Try it, try it. </connor>
<connor> It's one of those games that looks a lot easier </connor>
<connor> than it is for sure. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I've done like Bener 40's getting over. </joey>
<connor> - That's easy, that's nothing. </connor>
<connor> - And like coop and stuff like that. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, even then I was just like. </joey>
<connor> - I thought Getting Over It was hard, </connor>
<connor> after playing these games, Getting Over It is like medium, </connor>
<connor> not even like hard. </connor>
<connor> I mean I beat Getting Over It in three hours. </connor>
<connor> My first time, so. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like you started with Jump King and then you </garnt>
<garnt> like, I guess you downgraded to Getting Over It. </garnt>
<connor> - You get the mindset. </connor>
<connor> It's not about how good you are at the games. </connor>
<connor> But getting the mindset to improve at the games. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I could. </connor>
<garnt> I'll just go into like Zen mode, zero ranging from me. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't beat a game like that while fucking being like. </joey>
<connor> - I did most of the time. </connor>
<garnt> I was furious. It's so hyper man. </garnt>
<connor> If you ever get to the top, the castles, </connor>
<connor> the soundtracks are like very hype. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine it. </connor>
<connor> But like I see you guys have been playing Pokemon </connor>
<connor> a lot as well. </connor>
<connor> I mean you've been playing in a bunch of. </connor>
<connor> You finished it? </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't. </garnt>
<connor> - He's finished like the main story. </connor>
<connor> - You finish it on stream or finish it by yourself. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't get RCS, that's all I have to do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So there's like a lot of post post game. </joey>
<garnt> - So I've heard like mixed things about RCS, </garnt>
<garnt> which is stop me from getting it right now, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like, I've heard like it's a really fun game, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just a really empty world. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's the best Pokemon game </connor>
<connor> we've had in like five, </connor>
<joey> I don't fucking know a very long time. </joey>
<joey> - A very long time. I agree. </joey>
<joey> - That's like saying like, this is the best Big Mac </joey>
<joey> I've ever had. It's like, it's not that much. </joey>
<joey> - It's way better than the Big Mac down the road. </joey>
<joey> - This isn't like saying that like our queen of time </joey>
<joey> came before in like the Zelda, right? </joey>
<joey> This is, that we haven't had a fresh Pokemon game </joey>
<connor> in a long time. </connor>
<connor> I know this is old news by the time this has come out. </connor>
<joey> But I think it's still good to retro. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'm still playing it. </joey>
<joey> I'm playing all the post game and I'm doing </joey>
<connor> all the side quest and everything </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just that kind of gamer. </connor>
<connor> - It's a hard Pokemon game. - It gets very hard. </connor>
<connor> Some of the battles are hard as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's kind of annoying. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it feels like they revolutionized </connor>
<connor> what they needed to. </connor>
<connor> And somehow just completely like, </connor>
<connor> did stupid choices for certain things. </connor>
<connor> They just like make battles for like the first, </connor>
<joey> like two thirds of the game, just like, </joey>
<joey> way too easy. - [Joey] Way too easy. </joey>
<joey> - Right and then randomly they're like, </joey>
<joey> how about we just fuck you. </joey>
<connor> And they just start making them really fucking hard. </connor>
<joey> - But the thing that I notice is that </joey>
<joey> it's not just the fact that there's just this immediate jump </joey>
<joey> in the levels of the Pokemon. </joey>
<connor> But like I feel out of all the Pokemon games, </connor>
<connor> the AI in this game is so fucking gearing. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh yeah. It's smart. </connor>
<connor> - They're very, very smart. </connor>
<connor> So it's like they do some moves where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> that's like competitive level Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just getting, 'cause like I'm so used to, </connor>
<joey> you know, fighting like really dumb end PCs </joey>
<connor> in Pokemon games, right. </connor>
<joey> Like in all the main light Pokemon games. </joey>
<joey> And this time around, it's like, </joey>
<joey> we're playing 5D chess now. </joey>
<joey> And then it just gets fucked. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I felt like in previous Pokemon games, </connor>
<joey> just knowing the typings of the Pokemon was enough </joey>
<joey> to like easily comfortably get you. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas the points in this game, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I know all the typings, I just can't beat this one guy. </joey>
<joey> Like there's this one fight in the game, </joey>
<connor> it's very difficult. </connor>
<connor> And it took me like 10 attempts to do. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Very frustrating. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you can't just like autopilot your way </garnt>
<garnt> through the game anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - You do have to, after a certain point in the game, </connor>
<connor> if you wanna beat a certain fight, you do have to like </connor>
<connor> think and grind and actually I doubt </connor>
<connor> you'll do it first time, it's very difficult. </connor>
<joey> - I managed to do it first time, </joey>
<connor> but only because my chat was like, </connor>
<connor> there's a hard as fuck fight coming up. </connor>
<connor> So you better at least like prepare </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, guys come on, fucking easy whatever. </connor>
<connor> And then I do it, I almost fucking died, </connor>
<joey> I was like, oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> I should probably go grind a little. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> But like, look I completely get </joey>
<joey> why people don't wanna touch the game </joey>
<joey> because when I first booted up the game, </joey>
<joey> I was like, God this looks like a PS two game. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] It doesn't look great and it doesn't run great. </connor>
<joey> - Graphically, it doesn't look great. </joey>
<connor> It runs like shit a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> especially if you're like playing it through a capture card, </connor>
<connor> like it's a little bit better, </connor>
<connor> I play it a little bit on stream, like on the switch </connor>
<connor> and it plays okay. </connor>
<connor> It's still not amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like it's still nowhere near as like, you know, </connor>
<connor> fucking Mario Odyssey levels of like frame rate </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> But I think you get over it very quickly </connor>
<connor> because the gameplay just so refreshing and fun </connor>
<joey> and like, yeah, I get the world is like </joey>
<joey> empty or whatever, but- </joey>
<connor> - People said it was empty, but there's like, </connor>
<joey> I mean the Pokemon are the thing that you give. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - You know, I hated having to collect </joey>
<connor> these fucking berries in the trees all the time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I kept running outta poker balls. </joey>
<connor> It was really annoying. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you know, you could like go on a mount, </connor>
<connor> but you couldn't collect stuff on a mount, </connor>
<joey> so you had to get off it to collect the stuff </joey>
<joey> and then immediately get back on it. </joey>
<joey> - You can collect stuff on a mount. </joey>
<connor> - No you can't. Oh no, no you can't. </connor>
<connor> No you can't. - You can. </connor>
<connor> - No you have to get off the mount. </connor>
<connor> - Well, oh, like throwing it outta tree. </connor>
<joey> Oh, I thought you meant just like stuff on the ground. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, stuff on the ground. Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Okay sorry my bad. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, what, what. (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> But like the best part of the game is just catching Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> They actually like recaptured that joy of being tan again. </connor>
<connor> - The moment when you can just like be hiding </connor>
<joey> in a little shrub and you just fucking yeet a poker ball </joey>
<joey> just across the field and you catch that Pokemon </joey>
<joey> without anyone noticing you, </joey>
<joey> is like the best feeling every time. </joey>
<connor> - And also like, you can, like, let's say your level 30, </connor>
<connor> you can catch a level 70 Pokemon with enough persistence. </connor>
<connor> If you just get very, very lucky. </connor>
<connor> Which is really fun. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, really like, </connor>
<connor> oh my God, this is so exciting. </connor>
<joey> - It's a hype moment when you like catch level 70 </joey>
<connor> at level 30. - But you can't control it. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, it's still like really cool, </connor>
<joey> so you can have these really strong Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> I felt like they had a good range of Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> They didn't just choose the normal ones you expect. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I think people were a bit too harsh </joey>
<joey> on it I think. - I agree. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, I think people were a little bit too. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, because I mean, I get the whole argument of like, </connor>
<connor> oh, it's Nintendo it's game freak. </connor>
<joey> You know, they should have a billion gazillion dollars </joey>
<joey> to put into, you know, making a smooth game </joey>
<joey> and giving it the best graphics. </joey>
<joey> But it's like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I personally think that like the graphical choice, </joey>
<joey> I guess, that they went for like fit the story. </joey>
<connor> - I don't really care about graphics that much. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Me neither, honestly. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, like- </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno either, but they were noticeably lacking </connor>
<joey> I'd say. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't that they weren't good, it's that they were like, </joey>
<connor> oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - There were definitely some moments where I'm like, </joey>
<connor> oh, that tree in the distance is freaking out for no reason. </connor>
<joey> Let's just ignore that. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I thought those good quality of life changes. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, it's Pokemon, right. </connor>
<connor> So when they take one step forward </connor>
<connor> and then they just tear their leg off. </connor>
<connor> That's what they do. </connor>
<connor> Like they, the moment they have something good, </connor>
<connor> they start just fucking it up. </connor>
<connor> And I bet, I hope that we get more games like this. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause they basically made it so that </joey>
<joey> you don't need to battle. </joey>
<joey> But also the battling is way smoother, </joey>
<joey> there's not this animation bullshit, </joey>
<connor> it's like that it happens, you know, you can run around, </connor>
<joey> you can, it's good. </joey>
<joey> But I know it's Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> So they're gonna be like, all right, </joey>
<joey> now let's just get rid of that, </joey>
<joey> let's not do that anymore. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, why what's wrong with you? </connor>
<joey> I really hope that I'm wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Enough fans need to make it fucking operol </joey>
<joey> for them to like bring back a certain thing. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel like Pokemon fans are loud as fuck. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's just Pokemon company doing their own thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's usually. </joey>
<joey> Like it it's just the Pokemon company being like, </joey>
<joey> we can make whatever fuck we want. </joey>
<joey> We know you'll buy it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean they will. </garnt>
<joey> I mean Pokemon's like the most profitable, </joey>
<garnt> like franchise of all time for like a reason, right. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a fun game though. </connor>
<connor> I'd say, I think I'd said it was six or seven out of 10. </connor>
<connor> - Six or seven. </connor>
<connor> - I'd give it like, yeah, seven or eight. I'd say it. </connor>
<joey> It's a really refreshing. </joey>
<connor> - Considering I bought the pearl and diamond remake </connor>
<connor> and I have barely had the motivation </connor>
<garnt> to even put it in my switch. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that says a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - I know it's weird for me right </connor>
<garnt> because as someone who doesn't really have to time </garnt>
<garnt> to play games, I like, </garnt>
<garnt> if something's not like a nine or a 10, </garnt>
<garnt> I very rarely go out and play it, </garnt>
<garnt> unless I'm streaming it or making content </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<joey> - But how would you know if it's a nine or a 10, </joey>
<garnt> if you don't play it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally I just watch reviews </garnt>
<joey> and listen to recommendations. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if you've heard of a thing called IGN. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Hopefully I'm gonna think order medic critic obviously, </joey>
<garnt> obviously the most trustable source. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically the only game Garnt has ever played </joey>
<joey> is Awkward Enough Time. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It is a light novel though, as well. </connor>
<joey> So that might get you into it. </joey>
<connor> And you never shut the fuck up. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] There's a lot of dialogue. </joey>
<joey> - It's really weird, 'cause it's like, </joey>
<joey> it takes me a lot to get into a game sometimes, </joey>
<joey> it's like, I've tried to really like narrowed down </joey>
<joey> what my taste in video games is </joey>
<joey> and the more I think about it, the more I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I have no idea. 'Cause like, okay, </joey>
<joey> so like we've Final Fantasy XIV for example. </joey>
<joey> Like, so I was playing that like </joey>
<garnt> a little here and there during when I was ill, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember literally yesterday, literally yesterday </garnt>
<garnt> we were in the lift and I turned to Terry. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, Joey, gotta be honest with you </garnt>
<garnt> start Final Fantasy XIV, right. </garnt>
<joey> But you don't need to worry Joey. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like it's not addicting at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm like, I played it, I've stopped myself. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm good. I'm good. </garnt>
<joey> - I shook his hand and everything to him. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he shook my hand and then I went home </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, I don't really have anything to do, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I'll just like, 'cause the thing is, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a nice comfort game for me to like zone out </garnt>
<garnt> and just, you know, tap buttons. </garnt>
<garnt> And then so I boot it up and then I get into like my first </garnt>
<garnt> like big boss battle, like big raid. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember finishing the raid. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh no, that was really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> That was really fucking fun. </garnt>
<joey> - I need you to, </joey>
<garnt> I wanna take back that handshake I gave you that night. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I thought we had like established something, </joey>
<joey> you know, there was a trust that was formed there </joey>
<garnt> and he just ripped it away. </garnt>
<joey> - I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, I really, really wanna continue playing now, </garnt>
<garnt> I look at the clock, I'm like, it's midnight </garnt>
<garnt> we gotta Trash Taste recording in the morning. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'd go for another two hours. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And again another hour or two. </joey>
<joey> I can squeeze, how much sleep do I need? </joey>
<joey> And like, 'cause here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> I've never really gone to MMOs, right. </joey>
<joey> I never went through a phase where I got addicted </joey>
<joey> to RuneScape. </joey>
<joey> I was gonna say Runecraft, then RuneScape </joey>
<joey> or WoW whatever like that. </joey>
<joey> So this is like my first proper MMO. </joey>
<joey> And like, I wasn't really into it </joey>
<joey> because I thought like I didn't really enjoy the gameplay </joey>
<joey> because like the battle system for Final Fantasy, </joey>
<joey> especially at the beginning was like really fucking basic. </joey>
<joey> It's like just point at something and tap a button </joey>
<joey> and do like a basic three hit combo and then that's it. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, you know, I'm here for the story. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna stick here for the story. </joey>
<joey> But then I experienced the first raid, I was like, </joey>
<joey> you know, that was pretty damn fun. </joey>
<joey> And I'm scared for myself now. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's been a while since I've had the experience </joey>
<joey> of just having a moment in a game and just having like this, </joey>
<garnt> like I guess like it felt like an ember had been lit, </garnt>
<garnt> just like, I wanna experience that again. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying man, like MMOs are a lot like, </joey>
<connor> like quick sand. </connor>
<connor> Where it's like, the more you try to quit, </connor>
<joey> the more you just get sucked in. </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad I got it out of me when I was like 14, 15. </joey>
<connor> I don't really have an urge to play MMOs at all. </connor>
<garnt> - Me neither. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like what did you guys find addicting about </garnt>
<garnt> MMOs when you got into it? </garnt>
<joey> - I think the number one thing that got me addicted, </joey>
<joey> which I'm glad you haven't experienced yet personally </joey>
<connor> is when you have like a large group of friends </connor>
<connor> that you see often who also play it. </connor>
<connor> Where like, it's just like I have like a group of like </connor>
<connor> three or four mates, like during the RuneScape era </connor>
<connor> or like the Maple Story era that I could just like </connor>
<connor> ring up on Skype and just be like, all right </connor>
<joey> SO, Sesh for like seven hours and like, yeah, let's do it. </joey>
<joey> And then you just play it while you're in a conversation </joey>
<joey> and it's the best way to kill time. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, </joey>
<joey> it's like you finish that seven hour session </joey>
<joey> and you're like, what have I just done? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it's a game where like the goals </connor>
<connor> or for me at least felt like they were, </connor>
<connor> there's never ending supply of goals. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas like a game, like, I don't know if I do this, </joey>
<connor> the campaign in a card or something, </connor>
<connor> it's say I'm done in then hours. </connor>
<connor> But RuneScape, it's just like never ending. </connor>
<connor> And every time I hit a milestone </connor>
<connor> and I got more cool quests I could do </connor>
<connor> and I thought, wow, that's so sick. </connor>
<connor> Oh, I got this really badass item. Okay. </connor>
<connor> And so like, every time you are grinding towards something. </connor>
<connor> You always just kind of unlock these cool things </connor>
<connor> that were just enough serotonin boost </connor>
<connor> to keep you being like invested a lot. </connor>
<joey> - And then even when you finish through </joey>
<joey> like all those side quests, for example. </joey>
<connor> You see one player that just walks past your plan, </connor>
<connor> you go, I want what he has. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How do I get that? </connor>
<connor> And then now your quest is to be that guy. </connor>
<joey> It just never ends. </joey>
<joey> - And then also like, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if you can do this in Final Fantasy, </connor>
<connor> but in RuneScape you could lose like all your stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you could just lose all your game. </connor>
<connor> - By dying. - Yeah by getting killed. </connor>
<connor> - By dying, okay. </connor>
<connor> I've died fucked of on it and lost nothing. So thanks a lot. </connor>
<connor> - See, there you go. </connor>
<connor> That's like Pussy MMO. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Hold in your hand. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I wouldn't be able to get into </connor>
<connor> like RuneScape or WoW then </connor>
<connor> because like one of the big factors I feel look </connor>
<connor> into video games is like, I need a reason to keep playing. </connor>
<connor> And most of that reason is storyline. </connor>
<connor> Like gameplay loop a lot of the time, </connor>
<connor> that's not enough of a reason to keep me invested in </connor>
<connor> me invested in the game for like long term. </connor>
<connor> Having said that your thing about the Maze thing, </connor>
<connor> like when I was doing this boss battle, </connor>
<connor> I was like, </connor>
<joey> I wonder how fun this would be with friends to do it </joey>
<joey> at the same time.(laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna be that guy who're like, </joey>
<joey> Garnt can't join us today cause he has a raid or something. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) - Yeah. He has an event raid. </joey>
<garnt> That's only available during these hours. </garnt>
<connor> - But yeah. I mean, this is I guess the start </connor>
<garnt> of I don't know what, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> it just, maybe I might stream it who knows. </garnt>
<joey> - You know how before you were saying that like </joey>
<joey> viewers of Trash Taste could tell </joey>
<joey> when we record these episodes based on my hair. </joey>
<joey> Then now they're gonna be able to tell </joey>
<joey> based on the size of his eye bags </joey>
<joey> that are gonna be falling from endless nights </joey>
<joey> of Final Fantasy XIV. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh man they're like this far down now, </joey>
<joey> he is like, you finish three raids Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - I think I also stay away from them </connor>
<connor> 'cause my little brother was like </connor>
<joey> addicted to World of Warcraft. </joey>
<joey> And I could like, </joey>
<connor> just see how much he would play it </connor>
<joey> and it onto like no avail. - [Joey] Yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - At the end of it, he was just like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it wasn't that fun. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> After like years of playing. </connor>
<connor> - Well of course it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> every fucking league player </connor>
<connor> or like Overwatch player that invests way too much time </connor>
<connor> into this one game. </connor>
<garnt> And of course what'd you have to show for it well, </garnt>
<garnt> I reach diamond, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Usually what you have to show for it </joey>
<joey> can be summed up in one sentence. </joey>
<joey> It's like, yeah, it was, fun. </joey>
<connor> - Why is it that playing like a hundred games for 10 hours </connor>
<connor> is like seen as okay. </connor>
<connor> But playing one game for a thousand hours is like no. </connor>
<joey> - Double standards right? </joey>
<joey> - What society. - We live in a society. </joey>
<connor> - That's fucked up, we live in a society that ain't right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I just feel like there are just so many games nowadays </connor>
<garnt> that are available even if like you have nothing to, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you feel like you have nothing to play </garnt>
<garnt> or no big releases have come out, </garnt>
<garnt> you just go through your fucking steam library, right. </garnt>
<garnt> My steam library is like, my- </garnt>
<joey> - God, I have not touched my steam library. </joey>
<joey> That's what I think to myself. </joey>
<joey> Right, I'm like, okay, so I just finished this game. </joey>
<joey> Go when I finished 13 sentls, for example. </joey>
<joey> I was like, all right, cool. I finished that game. </joey>
<joey> Fuck now what do I wanna play? </joey>
<joey> Normally people be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I have a, fuck like 300 games of my steam </joey>
<joey> that I haven't even like installed at all. </joey>
<joey> Nope, instead I go to the PlayStation store. </joey>
<joey> I download Sona three knock turn. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yeah let's play this. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And now I'm just playing that. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my gosh. </joey>
<garnt> - See, I would rather have one game that I'm really into </garnt>
<joey> than a hundred games that I mildly enjoyed. </joey>
<joey> You know, like to me, like Pokemon RCS for example, </joey>
<joey> seems like kind of fun, but it doesn't seem like a game </joey>
<connor> that I could like properly, like throw myself into, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's weird for me cause I'd rather be like </connor>
<garnt> fully invested in just like emotionally invested </garnt>
<garnt> in one like a few things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why Final Fantasy? </garnt>
<connor> Why did that get you emotionally. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I heard from every person </garnt>
<garnt> who fucking talks about Final Fantasy, </garnt>
<garnt> that has a good story and I- </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] To be fair as much as I- </joey>
<joey> - But I heard about like NFTs are great. </joey>
<joey> If you just listen NFT reviews. </joey>
<joey> That's, you know, if you're asking addicts </joey>
<connor> why something's great, it's probably not a good, </connor>
<connor> like did you talk to people who played it </connor>
<connor> and didn't like it. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That there's the catch. </joey>
<joey> Everyone who's played it has said it's a good game. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, for example like, </joey>
<joey> when I played the Trial, when it first came out, </joey>
<joey> I'll admit it's a great fucking game. </joey>
<joey> But I like used a hundred percent of my brain power </joey>
<joey> to be like, you know what, I know it's a fun game brain, </joey>
<joey> but you are not going to play it. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like if you are only talking to people </connor>
<connor> who are into it, oh they seem to all like it. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, 'cause they're into it. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But that's the thing, </joey>
<joey> everyone at least around me that I know </joey>
<joey> that has, or is playing 14 has said nothing </joey>
<joey> but good things about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like there are some people who are like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe, you know, people who are- </garnt>
<garnt> for example, addicted to League or addicted to Overwatch </garnt>
<garnt> where they're like, no just don't get into it. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have fun with this game. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah but that's cause you're in you know, </connor>
<connor> every game has its life graph, right. </connor>
<connor> Final fantasy is just in it's like its infancy </connor>
<connor> compared to League. </connor>
<connor> We have like 15 years or no, 10 plus years of League </connor>
<connor> of don't do it, don't do it. </connor>
<connor> We know time has proven us, history has taught us. </connor>
<joey> - Well 14 at this rate might also gets to that point. </joey>
<garnt> - Look I dunno if this will be a purely age thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm in for the story and once I do the story, </garnt>
<garnt> I won't really have any other reason to continue playing it. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're always coming out with another expansion. </garnt>
<joey> It doesn't end. </joey>
<garnt> - (chuckling) Well, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Is that micro transactions in it. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it? </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't seen any. </joey>
<joey> - Is it micro transactions or expansion. </joey>
<garnt> - [Staff] (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, okay. Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a Japanese game of course there's </joey>
<joey> migration transaction. </joey>
<garnt> - Well like you, from what I understand, </garnt>
<garnt> you pay for like any new expansion </garnt>
<garnt> which is basically like another part of the storyline. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, WoW was the same as well right? </joey>
<joey> You had to pay for expansions? </joey>
<garnt> - WoW's a subscription service, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it was a monthly plus you had to pay for expansions, </joey>
<garnt> right, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Staff] And now you have to pay for coins </garnt>
<garnt> or something like. - Yeah. I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know too much about the MMO world. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I play Gotcha, </joey>
<joey> where I can choose to put money in. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's not a requirement. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the cancer cell </joey>
<garnt> fighting the aids cell at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> You know it's better than MMOs, Gotcha games. </garnt>
<joey> - Everyone's into that Lostark aren't they? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Everyone's into Lostark. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what it is. I'm too scared to ask this. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen a lot of my friends play it on stream </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, okay, that looks fun. </joey>
<joey> But right now I'm into Heaven Burns Red. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just playing that. I mean for the story. </joey>
<connor> - This episode is sponsored by Express VPN. </connor>
<garnt> - When you use bathroom </garnt>
<garnt> you always close the door behind you right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course. - Right Connor right. </joey>
<joey> - I don't, I don't. - Of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - So why would you let people look in on you </joey>
<joey> when you go online. </joey>
<garnt> Using the internet without Express VPN, </garnt>
<garnt> is like going to the bathroom and not closing the door. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Did you know that your internet service provider </connor>
<connor> knows every single website you visit? </connor>
<connor> - And what's worse is that they can sell this information </connor>
<connor> to ad companies and tech giants who will use your data </connor>
<connor> to target you. (Joey exclaiming) </connor>

<connor> - That's Expressvpnn.com/trashtaste back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what non-toxic game I introduced </garnt>
<garnt> these gamers to today. </garnt>
<garnt> Wordle. (laughing) - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I finally, oh my God, dude. </joey>
<connor> It was like a weight lifted off my shoulders </connor>
<connor> because for months now, every time I go onto Twitter, </connor>
<connor> like five people on my timeline are just like </connor>
<joey> tweeting out these like fucking squares. </joey>
<joey> It's like these yellow and green squares. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, is this like higher glitch or something </garnt>
<joey> like what's going on? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, is this like an invitation to a cult </joey>
<garnt> or something like. </garnt>
<garnt> Do I have to decipher this </garnt>
<joey> and then I joined like the fucking, (laughing) </joey>
<joey> the stone smiths or whatever the fuck it's called. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Stone Mason. - Stone Mason that's it. </joey>
<connor> - I was almost more confused </connor>
<connor> once Garnt had actually explained it to me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, why are people tweeting this out? </connor>
<joey> It didn't make any sense. </joey>
<joey> - Admittedly it's good. </joey>
<joey> It's like a good, like little time waster </joey>
<joey> because there's only one word a day. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's like the marketing strap. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if feels like on purpose, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was like fucking five head right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because everyone gets the same word every day </garnt>
<garnt> and you only get one word a day right. </garnt>
<garnt> And when you tweet it out, it's kind of like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like tweeting out like a gold star or something </garnt>
<garnt> or like an achievement in a video game right. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, what is the equivalent of being like, </joey>
<joey> yeah so yesterday I beat level 127 of Candy Crush </joey>
<joey> in like two minutes, get on my level. </joey>
<joey> - I don't tweet it out. </joey>
<joey> I just do it just to prove to all the tweets </joey>
<garnt> that I see that I can do it every day. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I sat there and I was like, </connor>
<connor> but why would anyone tweet this out? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I guessed a five letter word correctly. </joey>
<joey> I just couldn't understand it. I am I missing something? </joey>
<connor> Like, is it- - No. </connor>
<garnt> - What about it is an achievement? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not attacking anyone who has tweeted out </garnt>
<garnt> you can do whatever fuck you want on Twitter. </garnt>
<connor> There's some people who were like, they were like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, pretty like big accounts. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why the you tweeting about Wordle? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I had like two or three people I followed </joey>
<joey> that I think were like actively </joey>
<joey> at one point were like, what the fuck is this Wordle shit. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> And then like a week later they're like, </joey>
<joey> got in two tries baby. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh no. </joey>
<joey> Is this Final Fantasy XIV all over again? </joey>
<garnt> - No, because like, the thing I don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> about how this trend started is like, </garnt>
<garnt> what made people want to tweet at the first place. </garnt>
<connor> - Who sits and it's like, y'all gotta (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - You know, when you're like have an app open </garnt>
<joey> and you get like that notification, which is like, </joey>
<joey> would you like to review this app? </joey>
<joey> And then post on your timeline. </joey>
<joey> - Share your results. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, share your results. </joey>
<joey> Who's ever shared the results before Wordle existed </joey>
<garnt> and what was the black magic that Wordle put on their users </garnt>
<garnt> to make people want to share the results. </garnt>
<connor> - Like when I get like a high school on temple run, </connor>
<joey> I'm not sharing that, 'cause it's a fucking mobile game. </joey>
<joey> - Share it to your Facebook friends is like, </joey>
<joey> no I don't think I will. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone, who's like, yo Facebook sucks, </joey>
<joey> like yeah, no Twitter is slowly becoming Facebook. </joey>
<connor> This is what boomers do, this is what they do. </connor>
<connor> They're like, look what I got in Farmville. </connor>
<connor> It's like what? We're no better than them. </connor>
<garnt> - But like what are the, it's like the equivalent </garnt>
<joey> of like having a newspaper with like the crossword </joey>
<joey> and like your grandpa comes and shows you, </joey>
<connor> oh, look at this completed crossword. </connor>
<connor> - Crosswords are too hard. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Crossword way harder. </joey>
<joey> - It went from crosswords to like newspaper Sudoku puzzles, </joey>
<joey> and then it's now Wordle. </joey>
<connor> Cause what I was surprised the most about Wordle </connor>
<connor> was that I thought it was like an app. </connor>
<connor> Like all those other ones right. </connor>
<connor> But then I realized it's the fucking New York times. </connor>
<garnt> It's just the thing that New York Times had. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like, I remember Joey's searching </garnt>
<joey> for like the app stores. </joey>
<joey> Like no you just type it in the brand. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, why is there like Russian apps coming up </joey>
<joey> on my thing? Like is this- - Wordle. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Wordle. (imitating Russian accent) </joey>
<joey> - [Staff] That's why New York times bought it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah they bought it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Big brain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I remember I tweeted ages ago. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I don't know what Wordle is </joey>
<connor> and it's been so long ago I was too afraid to ask. </connor>
<connor> - At least, well, I mean you weren't afraid to ask </connor>
<connor> 'cause you tweeted it out. </connor>
<garnt> I was actually afraid to ask, I don't even wanna, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm keeping this in the draft bro, </garnt>
<joey> I'm not fucking tweeting that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like, I tried my longest like just not Google it. </garnt>
<connor> - I like refuse to give it the attention. </connor>
<connor> This is gonna die in a week. I'm not gonna look up. </connor>
<connor> - And then like, I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> it's something that's going to die in a week or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking know. I'll let Twitter burn itself out. </garnt>
<joey> - So I didn't even know what it was called. </joey>
<joey> So like I got this close to like going on to Google </joey>
<joey> and being like green and yellow squares </joey>
<connor> on my Twitter timeline. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Then I gave it a week. </connor>
<connor> Didn't die. Give it two weeks. </connor>
<connor> And people were still posting about it </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, okay, I'm just curious, just curious. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so how long have you been doing Wordle now? </joey>
<garnt> - For like, for like a good week or something. Just- </garnt>
<garnt> - Every day you just log on. </garnt>
<connor> - Whenever I remember to, </connor>
<garnt> normally when I see it pop up my timeline, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like fuck you. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] That's the reminder. - Fuck You. </joey>
<garnt> - [Staff] You look at this man right here. </garnt>
<garnt> (staff howling) (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Great now our fucking staff members are getting into it. </garnt>
<joey> - You got it in three tries? </joey>
<joey> - Yo David, how many tries did you get? Three, okay fuck. </joey>
<joey> - It took me four. Damn bigger brain. </joey>
<joey> - Take these guys for helping each other. </joey>
<connor> They got a single letter for free. </connor>
<connor> - He gave me A, that's hard. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah he gave me M. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I gave you M in the right spot. Come on Joey. </joey>
<joey> Acting like didn't help. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like these boys are cheating. </garnt>
<garnt> This is an individual game, </garnt>
<garnt> you know you're not supposed to help each other. </garnt>
<connor> - Should play a Babble Royale though. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen that game? - What's that? </connor>
<connor> - Scrabble Battle Royale. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. I've heard of it. </joey>
<joey> - That was fun. </joey>
<joey> - I just really miss playing Scrabble. </joey>
<connor> Is that boomer of me to say. </connor>
<connor> - I never played a game of Scrabble. </connor>
<joey> - You've never played Scrabble? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] No. - Dude, </joey>
<joey> like people keep saying like, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> UNO is a friendshipender, Monopoli, no, </joey>
<joey> Scrabble is the real friendshipender. </joey>
<joey> You know, your friendship is fucked, </joey>
<joey> when you're fighting with a dictionary in your hand. </joey>
<connor> Like that's when you know </connor>
<connor> your friendship is in the dire straight, right. </connor>
<joey> That's like, oh, we got a problem here. </joey>
<connor> - There are a lot of like three and two letter words </connor>
<connor> that you're like, this is a word. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then when, like, you know and then the argument </joey>
<joey> always comes longer being like, </joey>
<joey> well, if it's like a commonly used word </joey>
<joey> that's not an a dictionary is it allowed? </joey>
<joey> Like, am I allowed to use the word Yeet. </joey>
<joey> Because you know why is like a lot of points, </joey>
<joey> it's not an a dictionary though. </joey>
<joey> And then when the friendships just crack, </joey>
<connor> we should do it on stream. </connor>
<connor> - I think VAX and anti-VAX is in the dictionary now. </connor>
<joey> There's a lot of double X, double X there. </joey>
<joey> It's a lot of points you can get on. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] V and an X? God damn. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone's gonna be like scrambling </connor>
<connor> for those V and X's now man. </connor>
<garnt> - Are we doing a dictionary one or a non dictionary one? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I thought dictionaries weren't allowed in Scrabble. </garnt>
<joey> - You say it like it's a speed runner. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a math thing. Calculator or no calculator. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Dictionary run. </joey>
<joey> - Scrabble dictionary run. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry I'm only a dictionary runner. </joey>
<joey> I dunno the stats for a non dictionary one. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> No, we should definitely do a Scrabble </joey>
<joey> game on after doc because that, honestly like </joey>
<joey> it's legitimately fun, I'm not just saying like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not being a boomer here, like it's legitimately fun. </joey>
<garnt> - You seem to like word games though. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember you would countdown with just like, </garnt>
<joey> yo, this game exists, </joey>
<garnt> yo, how have I never play this game before? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like countdown I had a lot of fun in </joey>
<joey> and you got me into Wordle. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's all word games, dude. </joey>
<joey> I dunno it's just something fun about, </joey>
<joey> but then again, like recently I have been getting </joey>
<joey> quite boomer. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I did see your video, </garnt>
<joey> which is like, am I getting too old? </joey>
<joey> And I remember seeing that </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, fuck you Joey, fuck you. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] What are you my comment section? </joey>
<connor> - He's 27, he's like I'm dying guys. Shut the fuck up Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - Like if you are old Joey, then what am I? </garnt>
<joey> - See, this is how you know, </joey>
<garnt> these boys didn't actually watch the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I did watch the video. I did watch the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because I recently got back into golf </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, my God, </garnt>
<joey> that is the most boomer thing I've ever done. </joey>
<garnt> - See, I don't think golf is a boomer thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a privilege thing, It's a difference. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a privilege boomer thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you are broke, you can't be playing golf. </joey>
<connor> That's just facts. </connor>
<garnt> - That is true. That is true. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just, golf isn't a boomer thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Golf is just a, </garnt>
<garnt> you have a lot of disposable income kind of thing. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's just, yeah, but that's the thing, right. </joey>
<joey> I think a lot of people mistake it as a boomer thing </joey>
<garnt> because it's played by a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> of the older generation. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's because they have the time and the money now. </garnt>
<garnt> And also, you know, relatively speaking </garnt>
<garnt> golf doesn't really take as much of a physical, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, tax on you as like say, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a rugby or a cricket, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - No golf is fun as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I was like actually properly into golf when I was younger. </connor>
<connor> Like to the point where I start getting </connor>
<garnt> like proper golf lessons and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I went to golf camp a couple times. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] You went to golf camp? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I was like 10 years old, </joey>
<joey> like during like summer holidays. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] What's golf camp. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally just like, think of you go </joey>
<connor> and like, you stay over in like a golf club </connor>
<connor> for like a couple of weeks. </connor>
<connor> And every day you just get up </connor>
<connor> and you just learn to play golf. </connor>
<connor> - What? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I was, I think like 10 years old and it's like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You like, forget how to do it. </connor>
<joey> - No, surprisingly, I kind of remembered it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] 'Cause you went to, you went to a driving range. </joey>
<joey> - I went to a driving range with Mark and Marline. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause there was one like kind of nearby my house. </connor>
<connor> And it was a really fucking fancy. </connor>
<connor> Like I knew this wasn't like the, you know, </connor>
<joey> the downtown alley, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> fucking we're gonna build this driving range here </joey>
<joey> because there's nothing else around kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> Because it's like, you literally got like a buggy service </joey>
<joey> from the car park to the building, if you were far away. </joey>
<garnt> - See, I feel like there's always like levels </garnt>
<joey> of like how into are you into who like golf, right. </joey>
<joey> Because like I've never, </joey>
<joey> obviously I didn't come the most privileged family. </joey>
<joey> Like the only golf clubs I've ever owned </joey>
<joey> were like a pair of like a set of golf clubs </joey>
<joey> that I bought in a car boot sale, </joey>
<joey> like 50 bucks or something like that. </joey>
<joey> You know, so I always went to like, </joey>
<joey> or you know, the really cheap driving rangers </joey>
<garnt> and they're really cheaper golf courses </garnt>
<garnt> but those were still fun as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - The ones I went into back in Australia were like, </joey>
<connor> still like obviously made in like, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like seventies and like eighties. </connor>
<connor> So it's still very old, like you get like a, </connor>
<connor> there's just like this machine that you just like, </connor>
<connor> press a button and you put a basket under it. </connor>
<connor> And it just like shits out a hundred golf balls </connor>
<connor> into a basket. </connor>
<connor> And then you kind of, you know, </connor>
<connor> one at a time you put it on the tee </connor>
<connor> and you like, whack it off. </connor>
<connor> This one we went to though, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if Japanese driving ranges like this, </joey>
<joey> 'cause this is the first time I went. </joey>
<joey> But like you walk in, </joey>
<joey> I'd never seen like this many polo shirt in one building </joey>
<connor> and well like everyone was like slicked hair, </connor>
<connor> like really like pristine pants and everything. </connor>
<connor> Like clearly, like I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, okay we're in like a nicer driving range. </connor>
<connor> And they like made us like make these like </connor>
<connor> membership cards that you didn't even have to pay for </connor>
<connor> you just like, they were like, okay, the moment you're here, </connor>
<connor> you have to make a membership card. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay. </connor>
<connor> So then you, and then you fill this thing up, </connor>
<connor> like a credit card. </connor>
<connor> You put cash into it and then you'd pay for the golf balls </connor>
<connor> using your membership card. </connor>
<connor> Because I was so used to the, you know, </connor>
<connor> the pressing the button, </connor>
<connor> then the balls sitting out into basket thing. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, I was looking for that machine, right. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay, where is it? </connor>
<connor> It wasn't there. </connor>
<connor> It was literally just like, </connor>
<connor> it looked like a ATM and you'd put the card in </connor>
<connor> and you were like, how many balls would you like? </connor>
<connor> And I was like a hundred and it's like, </connor>
<connor> okay, go to this, you know, go to this field. </connor>
<connor> It's like, where are the balls? </connor>
<connor> I was like, looking around, I was like, </connor>
<connor> where the fuck are the balls? </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay, whatever. I'll just go to it. </connor>
<garnt> There's a fucking, you get to it, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no tee on the green. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, there's no tee, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no machine that shits out the balls. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, okay, what do I do. </garnt>
<connor> And there's just like a little like, you know, </connor>
<connor> and like golfing, not golfing, bowling alleys, right. </connor>
<connor> You know, there's like the little tablet </connor>
<connor> that you have that shows the scores. </connor>
<connor> There was just like that, but like a tiny one. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, and there's just one button </connor>
<connor> that just says start. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, okay, I press start, </connor>
<joey> the fucking tee with the ball on top of it comes out </joey>
<joey> from under the green. - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It just goes (mimicking machine) </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, oh. </joey>
<garnt> And I whack it immediately the moment I whack it, </garnt>
<garnt> the tee goes down another ball appears in its place. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Holy Fuck, I've been playing- </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, this is the most fivehead, </garnt>
<joey> why the fuck was I wasting my time? </joey>
<joey> - That sound amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - I was playing golf like a peasant this entire time. </garnt>
<joey> - I was being an idiot looking around, </joey>
<joey> like where's the golf ball shitting machine. </joey>
<connor> - That makes golf sound hella fun. </connor>
<joey> - It was so good. </joey>
<joey> And then you have like a counter </joey>
<joey> that shows how many balls you have left. </joey>
<connor> And if you say, for example, like, </connor>
<connor> you know, you pay for a hundred balls, </connor>
<connor> but you know, after a while, after you swing a golf club </connor>
<connor> a hundred times, your arms and shoulders </connor>
<connor> start to get a little bit sore, right? </connor>
<connor> So you're like, oh, you know, </connor>
<connor> maybe I just wanna like call it a day </connor>
<connor> after 80 balls or whatever. </connor>
<connor> So you just press a stop, </connor>
<connor> the money comes back into your membership card </connor>
<connor> and then you can just leave. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking now that-. - How much is it like to do? </connor>
<garnt> - It was 2000 Yens so about $20 for 120 balls. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds fun as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is, honestly not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I remember playing golf as a kid </garnt>
<joey> and it was like, it has the image of being an odd man sport, </joey>
<joey> but it's like, I still think golf is boring as fuck </joey>
<joey> to watch, right? </joey>
<joey> It's one of those sports where like- </joey>
<joey> - Just made people cry right. (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's one of those sports where I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> I like golf. I get golf. </garnt>
<joey> I don't understand anyone here enjoying watching it. </joey>
<joey> - The only time I'll ever sit down willingly </joey>
<joey> to watch golf is when I find a YouTube video </joey>
<joey> on my recommend, which is like top 10 miracles </joey>
<joey> during golf tournaments. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think playing golf is boomer. </garnt>
<garnt> I think watching golf is boomer. Okay. </garnt>
<connor> I'm going to draw the line there. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to draw the line there. Okay. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's fair. That's fair. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah, I mean like, I remember I was actually like </joey>
<joey> super, super into golf. </joey>
<joey> I found it like super fun </joey>
<joey> because I wasn't really the most athletic kid as a kid. </joey>
<joey> I mean, like, I was like in the basketball team, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like I got put into the basketball team </joey>
<joey> just because I was tall and that was like the prerequisite, </joey>
<joey> but I didn't really enjoy so much playing </joey>
<joey> like really high intensity sports. </joey>
<joey> But then I just really enjoyed golf </joey>
<joey> cause it was more of like just a relaxing, </joey>
<connor> you just hone one skill </connor>
<connor> and then there was nothing more satisfying </connor>
<connor> than that moment where you just hit the ball perfectly. </connor>
<connor> Right and you can tell you hit the ball perfectly </connor>
<connor> because like sometimes you hit, </connor>
<connor> you hit the ball and it slices or you know, </connor>
<connor> sometimes veers to the right and then you could just, </connor>
<joey> you feel it in your hands, </joey>
<joey> cause there's like a vibration in your hand </joey>
<joey> when you hit it a bit wrong. </joey>
<joey> But when you hit it and you feel like it's like hitting air, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? - It's like I'm hitting </joey>
<joey> nothing at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like you hitting nothing at all. </garnt>
<joey> - I've never played golf. </joey>
<joey> - You've never? - Only mini golf. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, mini golf. I feel mini golf has its own. </joey>
<garnt> - We need to go play golf. </garnt>
<garnt> We need to go play golf. </garnt>
<garnt> - We should go to the driving arrange near my house. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like that place was actually like, I wanna go back. </joey>
<joey> I dead ass after that session, </joey>
<joey> I looked at Marky dead in the eyes </joey>
<joey> and I was like, where do I go to buy a golf set? </joey>
<garnt> I was legit this close to just buying a golf set. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I remember the one moment </garnt>
<joey> that sold me on golf as a kid, </joey>
<joey> because I went to the driving range. </joey>
<joey> Driving range was just fun </joey>
<joey> because you just fucking hit a ball </joey>
<joey> and it doesn't matter, </joey>
<joey> it's just really satisfying hitting a ball. </joey>
<joey> - I always wanted to. - Yeah, but like </joey>
<joey> on like on like the actual golf course </joey>
<joey> is where you you have to like, </joey>
<joey> actually think about what you're doing. </joey>
<joey> You can't just like blindly hit a ball. </joey>
<joey> And I remember like I had an instructor at the time. </joey>
<joey> And so like on the driving range and in golf in general, </joey>
<joey> so if you don't know golf, there's like a set of golf clubs </joey>
<joey> and that is numbered, right. </joey>
<joey> So the lower the number, the less- </joey>
<joey> - Less sharper the incline is of the club, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, it's less incline. - Oh less incline. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So for example, like a two iron goes almost straight, right? </joey>
<joey> So it's a lot harder to get the ball up </joey>
<joey> and give it like air time, right. </joey>
<joey> So for me, like my comfort, </joey>
<joey> my comfort zone was like a nice seven nine. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I was about to say. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's the seven nine. - [Joey] It's the seven nine. </joey>
<joey> - The seven nine is like the comfort. </joey>
<joey> Because like on the driving range, </joey>
<joey> if you wanna feel like you can play golf, </joey>
<garnt> you gotta have the seven nine, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you can get a decent amount of air </garnt>
<garnt> with a seven, nine, like almost guaranteed. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a perfect 45 degrees. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but also like a decent amount of distance as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So you could like, yeah, I can whack a fucking ball. </garnt>
<garnt> I can whack a fucking ball. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember I was on this golf course </garnt>
<connor> with this instructor, right. </connor>
<connor> And so between me and the flag, </connor>
<connor> so basically the hole, there was like this this hill, right. </connor>
<connor> And on the hill was like a sand trap, right. </connor>
<garnt> So I needed to get enough air to get over the sand trap </garnt>
<garnt> and also onto like onto green, right. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I know where this is going. </connor>
<garnt> - And so in my mind, I'm like, this is two shots, </garnt>
<garnt> this is two shots, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I need to get over the sand trap </garnt>
<garnt> and then another shot to get to the green. </garnt>
<garnt> So what happens? </garnt>
<garnt> I pull out my trusty comfort seven nine, </garnt>
<garnt> my good old trustee, seven nine, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm about to hit it. </garnt>
<garnt> and my golf instructor goes, no, </garnt>
<garnt> you're not using that seven nine, </garnt>
<garnt> been using the seven nine for the entire golf course. </garnt>
<connor> And he picks out the three iron, right. </connor>
<connor> And he goes, use this. </connor>
<connor> And I go, I can't use that, I can't get enough air. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna hit the sand trap </connor>
<connor> and he goes, no, you can do it I believe in you. </connor>
<connor> And I just like, what? </connor>
<connor> No, no, I can't do this, this is three, </connor>
<connor> this isn't even a five iron, this is a three iron. </connor>
<connor> He goes, no, just do it, just trust me, just do it. </connor>
<connor> And I remember like it was like, </connor>
<connor> you know being like when Neo discovered that he was the one </connor>
<connor> in the Matrix fight, </connor>
<connor> because I remember hitting this ball </connor>
<connor> and I couldn't believe that it just like, </connor>
<connor> so this was the sand trap, the ball went here. </connor>
<connor> It went just perfectly enough over the sand trap. </connor>
<connor> And it perfectly landed on the green. </connor>
<garnt> And I was just like, what is this feeling? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, am I the chosen one? </garnt>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<garnt> I know, like I like remember that moment </garnt>
<garnt> for the rest of my life, </garnt>
<garnt> because like, that was the most satisfying shots </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever hit in golf. </garnt>
<garnt> And from that moment on, I was like, even as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I can see why people play golf now. </garnt>
<joey> - The only thing that would've topped that experience </joey>
<joey> is if your golf instructor in the we sports voice was like, </joey>
<joey> nice shot. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Nice approach. </garnt>
<joey> - So, I mean, it is a very rewarding sports. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, like all sports are. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because, so like when I was at the driving range, </joey>
<joey> cause it was fucking I don't know, five sixties, </joey>
<joey> at least minimum, since I last went to a driving range, </joey>
<joey> I think I was in like high school last time I went. </joey>
<joey> So obviously I was like, I knew, you know, </joey>
<joey> basically like how to swing and everything, </joey>
<connor> but I was fucking slicing that bitch like crazy </connor>
<connor> every single time and I'm like, man what, </connor>
<connor> why am I slicing it? </connor>
<connor> And just like, it got to the point </connor>
<connor> where I was like dead pan serious, </connor>
<connor> just like slowly, like just fucking doing </connor>
<joey> every single movement possible. </joey>
<joey> Being way too serious about this shit and I was like, </joey>
<joey> and at one point I remember I was like. </joey>
<joey> I got it. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I swung. - [Connor] Locked on. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I locked on, I was like, </joey>
<joey> this is the position right here. </joey>
<joey> I just have to nail this and the moment I got it, </joey>
<joey> I think I nodded like it was because again it's like, </joey>
<joey> as Garnt said, it's like, </joey>
<joey> when you hit that perfect straight perfectly angled shot, </joey>
<joey> you just hear the cleanest, like whack sound. </joey>
<joey> And nothing else. </joey>
<joey> But when you fuck up, you hear like a, </joey>
<joey> it's like a really like a fucked up sound. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the best way I can describe it, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, you know, when you play some FPS games </garnt>
<joey> and you get that headshot, right. </joey>
<joey> And like a lot of like FPSs games have this like </joey>
<joey> really satisfying sound when you get that head shot. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Ding sound. - Like golf just has that IRL, </joey>
<joey> when you get that satisfying, like perfectly, </joey>
<garnt> like perfect headshot on that golf ball. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like designed to have that satisfying sound. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna go. </garnt>
<joey> It's just, how do you get into golf? </joey>
<connor> It's not like a thing that. - Well, okay. </connor>
<joey> So I don't have a golf set or anything </joey>
<joey> Marky and Marilyn does, but a lot of those places, </joey>
<joey> like in driving range and stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> they give you like rentals. </joey>
<joey> So the only ones they gave me was a seven iron </joey>
<joey> cause of course. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Is that just universal. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, you've never played just this. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] We'll start you off with the seven iron. </garnt>
<joey> - So all they gave me was a driver and a seven iron. </joey>
<connor> - Like happy Gilmore's. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta do the runup. </joey>
<connor> - That's a good movie. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah and then you just like, </joey>
<joey> kind of just get a feel for it after a while. </joey>
<garnt> But it's, I think it's definitely best to go with someone </garnt>
<joey> who, you know, knows at least the bare minimum. </joey>
<connor> - Knows how to swing a golf club. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, my brother played a lot of golf. </garnt>
<connor> Can't remember he played like, </connor>
<connor> I think he did like tournaments and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But I never did. </connor>
<connor> I was always more into like stuff that was like </connor>
<connor> way more active. </connor>
<connor> Running or just head butting walls. </connor>
<garnt> - That was great, I mean golf is like Monkey mode, </garnt>
<garnt> but like it's controlled monkey mode. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you just, you just gotta whack- </garnt>
<garnt> - That doesn't sound very monkey mode. </garnt>
<garnt> Stop tryna describe golf in a way that I like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not how it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just whacking a ball. I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - That's not monkey mode. </connor>
<joey> - No, just think of no, no, instead of monkey mode. </joey>
<connor> - Just as monkey mode, you know you swing like in the wild. </connor>
<connor> - Just think of instead of it instead of an FPS </connor>
<connor> where you shoot someone in the head, </connor>
<connor> it's like an FBS, but like the bullet </connor>
<joey> is the end of the golf stick and the ball is the head. </joey>
<joey> - That's such a shit analysis. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That's all it is. </connor>
<connor> You get the perfect shot, boom satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - You don't even have to sound me on golf, I wanna try. </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Boksu. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you guys smell that? - Smell what Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh the smell of fresh spring air all around us. </connor>
<connor> - But God we're inside. </connor>
<connor> How can you smell the fresh spring air? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it's because I've got this </garnt>
<garnt> awesome Sakura season Boksu with me, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did I get that? </garnt>
<joey> It's almost spring and you know what that means, gentlemen. </joey>
<joey> It is the Sakura season here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And Boksu got you lovely sunsets petals </joey>
<joey> covered with Sakura themed sweets for this month. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you know what people in Japan do, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - What do they do? </garnt>
<garnt> - People in Japan celebrates Sakura season </garnt>
<garnt> by gathering under a tree for Hanami, </garnt>
<garnt> which is a flower viewing and enjoying picnics together. </garnt>
<connor> - And luckily gentlemen, with this Sakura theme box, </connor>
<connor> you can have your very own Hanami at home. </connor>
<connor> Tell us Joey, what are you holding? </connor>
<joey> - Well, I'm holding some Congoa sucker jelly. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Connor] Oh! </joey>
<joey> - How beautiful this thing looks. </joey>
<garnt> - So Garnt, what are you holding? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a Sakura sweet cookie. </garnt>
<joey> Look at this look. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] That's so cute. - [Connor] I know. </connor>
<connor> Did you know that Sakura season is Boksu's </connor>
<connor> most anticipated collection of the year </connor>
<connor> and if you've been waiting to try them out </connor>
<connor> now is the beast time. </connor>
<joey> As you can hear Garnt is having the time and his life. </joey>
<joey> So use our code Trashtaste15. </joey>
<joey> And the link in the description now below </joey>
<connor> to save $15 off your first order. </connor>
<joey> - Go get yourself a piece of Japan's freshest season </joey>
<joey> with the monthly Boksu. - I'll have what he's having. </joey>
<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you guys ever been to any of the bating cages before? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, I fucking love it. </joey>
<joey> - A lot harder than it looks. </joey>
<garnt> - It is a lot harder than it looks. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's also a lot scarier than it looks. </garnt>
<garnt> Because even when you put it on like </garnt>
<garnt> the slowest mode or I think a lot of machines </garnt>
<garnt> throw at like 80 kilometers an hour and that's slow. </garnt>
<connor> And you're like, oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't sound too fast or anything. </connor>
<connor> But then you remember, that's like the speed </connor>
<joey> that cars travel on some highways </joey>
<joey> and you're like, oh, that that's pretty fast. </joey>
<connor> - I can hit a car with a baseball bat. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I can't hit a ball. </joey>
<joey> - At what cost. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, my arms will pretty fall off. </joey>
<joey> Those things are fucking hard. </joey>
<joey> I remember trying to do the 120. </joey>
<joey> And I out of like 20 shots, I managed to hit one. </joey>
<connor> That wasn't very good. I was just guessing. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It's getting into the speed. </joey>
<joey> - It's got a lot harder learning curve </joey>
<joey> than when you play in every mini game </joey>
<joey> on like any LOPG right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like in like you play on like Persona five whatever </joey>
<joey> you miss the first two shots. </joey>
<joey> - Baseball in Persona. - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You can go to bating cage on Persona 5. </joey>
<joey> - Of course you can't. - Of course. </joey>
<joey> You can do homework in Persona. </joey>
<garnt> Why couldn't you like do like go to batting games. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how you up your charisma. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - How does it up your charisma? </connor>
<connor> - Because the more shots you get, </connor>
<connor> the more charismatic you're. </connor>
<connor> - You're so likable. </connor>
<connor> - It's like damn you got 19 outta 20, seesh. </connor>
<joey> That's more charismatic as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Weird way to define charisma. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I remember like you play on Persona </joey>
<connor> or any mini game or fucking probably Yakza or something. </connor>
<connor> Yeah and then you missed like the first two ball </connor>
<connor> and you're like, okay, I got a feel for this. </connor>
<connor> You start getting them. </connor>
<connor> In real life you miss like the first 10 </connor>
<garnt> and you're like, I can't even keep up with this. </garnt>
<joey> Like my eyes still. </joey>
<joey> - In real life it's not even like, </joey>
<joey> you can't even attempt to swing after the first few. </joey>
<connor> Like the first few is like seeing </connor>
<connor> how fast the ball actually goes </connor>
<connor> and by the time you realize it, it's behind you. </connor>
<connor> You're like, oh, okay I'm gonna be here for a while. </connor>
<connor> And then maybe around like swing seven or eight, </connor>
<connor> you're like, I think I have the courage to start swinging. </connor>
<joey> - I could just never swing faster enough. </joey>
<joey> My eyes were just were way faster than my arms. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's what I learned. </connor>
<connor> I'm British. So we don't play baseball. </connor>
<joey> It's not a thing. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I mean, you know, </connor>
<joey> Australia doesn't play baseball either. </joey>
<connor> - So like holding a baseball bat was just weird </connor>
<connor> and trying to hit a baseball. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but we played cricket. </joey>
<connor> - We, I didn't play cricket. </connor>
<connor> - Well the Welsh and the British. </connor>
<connor> - I did not play any. I've never played cricket. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't play cricket? </connor>
<joey> - I played in the infield one time, </joey>
<joey> I had to like catch it, I never got to bat. </joey>
<joey> - But like everyone bats though. </joey>
<joey> - No, but like, cause we were, </joey>
<joey> when we were in school </joey>
<garnt> we had like an hour, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So we never played it that often. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you never play in like PE or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah we did. But I was always in the infield. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - But like this team swap over. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know, but we never had time to, </joey>
<connor> we ran out of time. </connor>
<connor> So we never played it often because you know, </connor>
<connor> you have to do like every sport. </connor>
<connor> So we didn't cricket often. </connor>
<connor> I was never good at the team games. That's what I learned. </connor>
<garnt> I'm really bad at team games and we never did golf </garnt>
<connor> cause that's like, how are you gonna get kids to play golf? </connor>
<connor> It's not practical. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean golf wasn't like was never a PE thing. </garnt>
<garnt> It was more just like- </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Like a extracurricular thing. </connor>
<joey> - But we did like, I don't know, we did like everything. </joey>
<joey> - What was your favorite sport during PE? </joey>
<connor> - I always liked athletics when we did that. </connor>
<joey> - Like running, long jump, high jumps, stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, javelin. Javelin is really fun, shot put was fun. </joey>
<joey> That's cause I was like a fucking animal. </joey>
<connor> - You seemed like a shot put. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you seem like a shot put kinda guy. </garnt>
<garnt> Why that doesn't surprise me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why does that doesn't surprise me. </garnt>
<connor> - I as much as I've my God damn hardest, I can like, </connor>
<connor> I cannot run long distances. </connor>
<connor> No matter how much I practice. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's some God tear runner </connor>
<connor> in the comments being like, </connor>
<joey> you just gotta, you gotta past through man. </joey>
<joey> I gonna hit that wall, you gotta keep going. </joey>
<joey> Never stop get that pump up. </joey>
<connor> - You gotta breathe through your nose. </connor>
<connor> - You know like I am a sprinter. </connor>
<connor> That's what I always was. </connor>
<connor> And like, whenever I, no matter how many times I trained, </connor>
<connor> I just reject doing long distance. </connor>
<connor> But I wanted to sell God damn bad. </connor>
<connor> But yeah so I ended up just doing sprinting </connor>
<connor> and like to me it's like sprinting and like throwing </connor>
<connor> and long jump, it was all kind of explosive energy. </connor>
<joey> - For me, high jump and long jump </joey>
<joey> was like the ones I excelled. </joey>
<garnt> - I sucked high jump. </garnt>
<garnt> - Long jump for me was the best one </garnt>
<garnt> that I was in athletics as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I was just really good at jumping. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know.(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct murmuring) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause my school was really small so this a bunch, </connor>
<connor> so like I was the only one who went to athletics </connor>
<connor> after school, like cause we had a local track </connor>
<connor> that had been funded by the lottery. </connor>
<connor> So right next to where I lived, </connor>
<connor> there was these amazing facilities. </connor>
<connor> Like amazing track, nothing like this anywhere else near me. </connor>
<connor> Like cause this is just like unheard of, </connor>
<connor> it was like an actual good track. </connor>
<connor> So I used to go there and I was the only person </connor>
<connor> in my like year who did this. </connor>
<connor> So I was the only one who knew how to throw like a javelin </connor>
<connor> knew to throw a shot put, knew how to do long jump, </connor>
<connor> like the correct way. </connor>
<joey> - Did you do discs and stuff like that? </joey>
<connor> - I didn't do discus, so we were doing it </connor>
<joey> and every year we had the sports day, right. </joey>
<joey> Did you have to do the track and field? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah </joey>
<connor> - And you had like houses, </connor>
<connor> like Griffindoer and shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like your own version. - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think I was in like the house called scissors in well. </connor>
<connor> - Scissors. </connor>
<connor> - Scissors that wasn't rock or paper. </connor>
<connor> So it was like scissor or something. </connor>
<connor> And how did you decide, who does the events, </connor>
<joey> how did you decide this? </joey>
<joey> - Basically it was just like picked. </joey>
<joey> It was like, would you like to go to this event? </joey>
<garnt> - If there was someone who was obviously the best at event, </garnt>
<garnt> they would be like, well you're. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no, for us, it was just like, </joey>
<joey> you just put your hand up </joey>
<joey> and it's like, who wants to do the hundred meter sprint? </joey>
<joey> And then everyone who wants to puts their hands up </joey>
<joey> and then if you didn't wanna do it, you didn't wanna. </joey>
<connor> - So if there was too many people, how did they decide? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, everyone did it. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, there was no limit. </connor>
<joey> Well, I mean, to be fair, my school as well </joey>
<connor> was also very, very small. </connor>
<joey> Like we only had like, you know, 500 people in our school. </joey>
<connor> - How many people were in your, your grade or year? </connor>
<connor> - Like 60. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so yeah it's about, same for me. </connor>
<connor> So there was like only two or three people were allowed </connor>
<connor> to do each event. </connor>
<connor> And for the first few years when I did it, </connor>
<connor> there was no limit on how many you could do. </connor>
<connor> And so I was just like, I'll just do like everything. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I loved sprinting, I loved racing as well. </connor>
<connor> So I would do like, yeah, I'll do the 100, </connor>
<connor> 200, 400 long jump, the triple jump, javelin, shot put. </connor>
<connor> It was fun, it was good. </connor>
<joey> Because there was some people in my, </joey>
<joey> cause we only had like groups of like 15 of us split </joey>
<joey> and there was like half of them that were like, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna do anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I was like, oh great. </joey>
<connor> - There always was. </connor>
<garnt> - For me, you had like a maximum of four, </garnt>
<garnt> but like everyone did like four or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - See, so then there was one year where like </connor>
<connor> I did the 100, 200 and I'd won all of the events but one. </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, oh, this is fun. </connor>
<connor> I won like six out of seven events. </connor>
<connor> And then the next year they were like, no, no, </connor>
<connor> you can only do three now. </connor>
<connor> And I was like. - [Joey] They snarfed you. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, why are snarfed me? Huh? </connor>
<connor> That's not fair. </connor>
<connor> But this is the thing, right. </connor>
<connor> Is that I'm sure if I went to any other school </connor>
<connor> where people like knew how to do like </connor>
<connor> throw a Javelin correctly, or like jump correctly. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause like this when like long jump, </joey>
<connor> everyone was still doing the jump where you like just jump, </connor>
<connor> not the one where you jump into a sit. </connor>
<joey> So it was really easy to like do better. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean same with like a high jump as well. </joey>
<joey> Everyone just like did like the, you know, </joey>
<joey> the standing scissor kick way. </joey>
<joey> But like I was doing the full like fucking arch back. </joey>
<connor> Like Torpedo John. </connor>
<joey> - Right and then you're like, oh my God, this guy's a God. </joey>
<joey> How the other kids can't compete. </joey>
<connor> You're like actually doing the like professional technique. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, I'm like, oh yeah </joey>
<joey> of course, you're only gonna be able to jump like a menial, </joey>
<connor> you're fucking doing this. </connor>
<joey> - The is kick. - Yeah, the is kick. </joey>
<joey> It's like yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't do that though. I was terrible. </joey>
<joey> I was really fun though. I really liked it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, when you're winning, of course you like it. </joey>
<connor> I thought that would make me popular, didn't they? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, well like during elementary </joey>
<joey> I was like dominating long jump in high. </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Turns up, yeah guys. I'm here. </connor>
<connor> - Definitely did not make me popular. </connor>
<connor> If anything, it just gave people more </connor>
<connor> cannon for right to be like, Ugh, </connor>
<connor> your name's Joey and you you're good jumping things. </connor>
<connor> Just like a baby kangaroo. </connor>
<joey> I never fucking heard the end of that. </joey>
<connor> Christ (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I just felt like I just saw your soul, </garnt>
<joey> just leave your eyes. </joey>
<garnt> Like years of like torment just came rushing back there. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - One time. </connor>
<connor> Very, very tense moment. </connor>
<connor> I just won the 100 meters and immediately after </connor>
<connor> they were like, let's do the 200 meters. </connor>
<connor> They didn't think let's space it out, right. </connor>
<connor> So I was actually naked. </connor>
<connor> And I was lining up for the 200 meters </connor>
<connor> and I really, really, really wanted the win. </connor>
<connor> I wanted this more than like any, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I was so ultra competitive, </connor>
<connor> this is like the Olympics for me. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I need this. </connor>
<connor> I was so God nervous that like, I was like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> I felt like a little drizzle go down my leg, right. </connor>
<connor> I was so nervous that like, for like a brief moment, </connor>
<connor> I peed myself. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like 0.1 seconds and I was like, stop. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a little beep. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like a little beep and I was like, </connor>
<connor> that's never happened before, what was that? </connor>
<connor> Fuck! Luckily I, </connor>
<connor> but you know, I didn't give a that I peed myself. </connor>
<connor> My priority was like, no one else saw that, right. </connor>
<connor> No one else saw that drizzle. </connor>
<joey> But luckily I was so sweaty from the previous event, </joey>
<connor> still that nobody had thought that pissed myself. </connor>
<connor> - Just like shake it off. </connor>
<joey> Just shake your leg. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Let's get back to it boys. </connor>
<connor> I went to it, the yeah I won. </connor>
<connor> But I really needed to piss after it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) My bladder it was so, </connor>
<connor> have you ever been that nervous, </connor>
<joey> your bladder is completely opened. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I've had that before. - Is that happened? </joey>
<connor> - You trust me. - I've never been in that. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know that could happen, until it happened. </connor>
<connor> - I've done the little like before as well. </connor>
<connor> - I had that drink, I had that before, </connor>
<joey> like a really important like piano competition. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) - It happens. </joey>
<joey> - But at least, but like the problem was </joey>
<connor> I had it a lot worse than you. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You probably wear like nice pants. </connor>
<garnt> - I was wearing a suit. - Oh no. </garnt>
<joey> - I was wearing shorts, that shit just came out. </joey>
<joey> - And you were already sweaty right. </joey>
<joey> I was like in a well air conditioned room, </joey>
<joey> like long pants, like in a suit. </joey>
<connor> With like all these like really properly dressed, </connor>
<connor> like Asian kids next to me. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, Ha! Oh fuck. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Could you see it? Could you see the pants? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, luckily not, but my God, </connor>
<connor> it was hard to use the pedal </connor>
<joey> while my leg was also a little bit wet. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh God. </joey>
<connor> - How far did the stream get down? Did it go all the way? </connor>
<connor> - Like almost to my knee. - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - They missed this fucking scene in your line April, </connor>
<connor> so was that been a fucking waiting. </connor>
<joey> - I love the chapter with Connor said pisses himself. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - When you're a kid, you get anxious. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. - I also used to try. </joey>
<joey> - I felt really bad for the kid who had to follow after me. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like I didn't check, </joey>
<joey> but I was like, I'm sorry if the seat is a little wet. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] There's a wear patch. </joey>
<joey> - There wet patch on that seat right there. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking nailed the competition though. </joey>
<joey> So worth it in the end, but. </joey>
<connor> - So did you win the 200 meters? </connor>
<joey> - I did. I did. </joey>
<connor> And I was also so competitive </connor>
<connor> to the point where I dunno if I can do this now, </connor>
<connor> but when I was a kid, </connor>
<connor> when I was running and I thought like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I really need to stop. </connor>
<connor> I just wouldn't stop. </connor>
<connor> And I would always end up throwing up when I stopped. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) - You are that kid. </garnt>
<garnt> You are the kid who just threw up everywhere always. </garnt>
<connor> - Because right to me, it was like, </connor>
<connor> I was like, no, I need to win, like I have to win. </connor>
<connor> So like, if there was a, like I'm at the last stretch </connor>
<connor> and I still got a little left in me </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I can't stop now, I need to throw up. </connor>
<connor> So one year, this is again. </connor>
<connor> So I was doing like six events </connor>
<connor> and I've won the 100, I've won the 200 </connor>
<connor> and again, right after it, what comes after the 200? </connor>
<connor> It's the 400. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's kind of like the same thing. </connor>
<connor> You sprint at the end, you kind of run fast at the start. </connor>
<joey> - Well why would they not split it up? </joey>
<connor> - It was a school. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause in our school, they split it up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think they might have assumed </garnt>
<connor> that different people would be doing different events. </connor>
<garnt> - I think they assume people would do different things, </garnt>
<connor> so like, I would get max like two minutes break. </connor>
<connor> So I was doing the 400, right. </connor>
<connor> And I was already like, before I even started this race, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was like (heavy breathing) </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was already, still naked from the other one. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, how the am I gonna win this one? </connor>
<connor> And so I'm in this race, right. </connor>
<connor> I get to the 200 meter mark, right. </connor>
<connor> This is where you're like, the on switch has to come on. </connor>
<connor> You have to start sprinting. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like I'm like kind of like I'm in the middle, </connor>
<connor> I'm not really in, I got a lot of ground to make up </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was going a little too slow. </connor>
<connor> So I just start going crazy, man. </connor>
<connor> I get like to 50 meters and I'm like, oh no. (screaming) </connor>
<connor> On the side, on the side of the race track. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Right, luckily it's a grass race track, </joey>
<joey> so that shit's just extra compost. </joey>
<connor> And luckily I was not in the middle. </connor>
<connor> I was, I was in the first lane. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like 50 meters, into this sprint, </connor>
<connor> I'm going all out and I just have to, I just (screaming) </connor>
<connor> and it became a bit of laughing stock </connor>
<connor> for the rest of that day. </connor>
<joey> - That would've been amazing to see. </joey>
<joey> - I was literally just like powering through like a machine </joey>
<joey> then just like had to just start vomiting. </joey>
<joey> It was awful. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I just didn't know my limits as a kid. </joey>
<joey> I just didn't like, my willpower </joey>
<connor> was just beyond my body's ability apparently. </connor>
<connor> But it happened all the time during long distance as well, </connor>
<connor> I always threw up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like I sucked at long distance. </connor>
<connor> I think mostly because I have asthma. </connor>
<connor> So I could only do like 200 meters at most before </connor>
<garnt> like my asthma would like start to kick in. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was rough man. Long distances are horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it was really muddy and freezing. </garnt>
<connor> It was always during winter, did you do it in winter? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You gotta be a real masochist to enjoy long run, </garnt>
<connor> like long running. </connor>
<connor> Like it's like, why would you, </connor>
<connor> especially people who do it </connor>
<joey> for like club activities and stuff. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what do you do after school? </joey>
<joey> I run. Why? </joey>
<connor> - So they make all the kids do it when you did it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - No, no. </joey>
<connor> So like if kids, so basically kids could opt in and out </connor>
<connor> at our school. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh you could knocked out. </garnt>
<connor> - Every kid needed to do an activity. </connor>
<connor> You know, you didn't have to like a certain like, </connor>
<garnt> you know, certain amount, but you needed to do at least one. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, there were some years where I was just like, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna do anything today. </joey>
<connor> - What! Dude from my school, it was like, </connor>
<connor> on this day we're doing two kilometers. </connor>
<connor> You have do the two kilometers. </connor>
<connor> You have no choice. </connor>
<connor> - We had other events for that kind of stuff </connor>
<joey> where like kids had. </joey>
<garnt> - Are you talking about PE or sports day? </garnt>
<garnt> - PE. - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> No, if it's PE then yeah, if we were doing activity. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, Sorry. </joey>
<joey> - If it's PE everyone have to do it. </joey>
<garnt> - You have to do the extra. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause I remember that like, </garnt>
<connor> they would like get really angry at the kids </connor>
<connor> that were just like at walking </connor>
<joey> and they like shout at them and be like, the fuck you doing? </joey>
<garnt> - It's this like fucking army. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the SAS or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, so because like we had at our school, </joey>
<joey> we had like, I think like four different sports days </joey>
<joey> or like four different. </joey>
<joey> - What? We had one. - So we had the track. </joey>
<connor> - Winter Olympics in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - No, so we had like a track and field day. </connor>
<connor> And then we also had like a, </connor>
<connor> what we called the swimming carnival, </connor>
<garnt> which was we went to like our local swimming pool </garnt>
<garnt> and we would doing like swimming events. </garnt>
<joey> - We got one sports day in the year </joey>
<joey> and it was like, - Just track and field. </joey>
<joey> - Every kid looked forward to it </joey>
<garnt> because it was just basically a day off from school </garnt>
<garnt> where you just do fun stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - You could just sit on the grass. </connor>
<joey> - And then we had another sports day </joey>
<joey> where we did it on the beach. </joey>
<joey> So we did like, you know, like beach flags </joey>
<connor> and you know like races, like thousand meter races </connor>
<connor> on the beach and stuff like that and like surfing events </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And that was just like another day where like, </connor>
<connor> if kids didn't want to do it, </connor>
<connor> then kids didn't have to do it. </connor>
<connor> And then we had a fourth one during the winter </connor>
<connor> and this was the worst one. </connor>
<connor> It was called, they don't have it anymore, </connor>
<connor> but it was called the Walkathon. </connor>
<connor> - Walkathon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's think of like a marathon, right. </connor>
<connor> Which is like 42 point something kilometers. </connor>
<connor> It's that, but you can walk it if you want. </connor>
<connor> So it was basically we start from the school, </connor>
<connor> you'd walk 20 kilometers across like seven or eight beaches. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause that was like the area we lived in. </joey>
<joey> And then you'd turn around </joey>
<joey> and you'd walk all the way back to the school. </joey>
<joey> And you'd have to do that during the day. </joey>
<joey> And I think they got rid of it </joey>
<joey> because cause I think some of like the higher grade kids </joey>
<joey> were just like calling Ubers. (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I would. Fuck that. - Yeah, fuck that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Because like when you reach like the halfway point, </joey>
<joey> you'd get like a sticker, like put on your like wrist, </joey>
<connor> so like that's how you'd know </connor>
<connor> when you came back to the school </connor>
<connor> that you made it to the halfway point. </connor>
<joey> So it's like, that was their like foolproof way </joey>
<joey> of making sure you did the whole thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Speed runners be like, I found a clip. </garnt>
<joey> - So what the senior kids would do </joey>
<connor> is that like they'd walk away from, </connor>
<connor> you know, they'd do a, maybe like the first kilometer. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they'd like walk into a street, call an Uber, </connor>
<connor> get them to drive to like a kilometer away </connor>
<connor> from the halfway point </connor>
<connor> and they'd just like, come out, being like, </connor>
<connor> oh, hey, I made it. </connor>
<connor> And then they'd do it again. </connor>
<connor> But I think they got rid of it </connor>
<connor> because like kids were cheating, </connor>
<connor> but it was also like a charity event for the school. </connor>
<connor> So like you had to like, you know, you had to pay like, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like a dollar per student or whatever </connor>
<connor> for like this charity. - [Connor] Paid to walk 42 km. </connor>
<connor> - Pay to walk 42 kilometers. </connor>
<connor> I mean, for some kids it was like, </connor>
<joey> oh fuck yeah we just have to walk today, </joey>
<joey> don't have to do class. </joey>
<connor> Hell yeah, I'll take that. </connor>
<connor> - Did you ever forget toll off in school </connor>
<connor> for stuff you did outside of school? </connor>
<joey> - Like as in like in the school grounds </joey>
<connor> or outside school grounds? </connor>
<connor> - Outside of school. - Like what? </connor>
<connor> - So like the area where I went to school </connor>
<connor> was like really small. </connor>
<connor> And like I was like, I don't know how old I was. </connor>
<connor> Must have been like 13, 14. </connor>
<connor> There was like a bunch of like ruined castles </connor>
<connor> where I grew up. </connor>
<connor> And one time I was like climbing the wall of this castle </connor>
<connor> and a teacher happened to be walking in that park </connor>
<connor> during the day. </connor>
<connor> And she just saw me, she didn't say anything, </connor>
<connor> but I was just climbing it, I was having a great time. </connor>
<connor> Probably wasn't the safest thing. </connor>
<connor> It was quite high up. </connor>
<connor> And then I came into school the next Monday. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it was on like a weekend. </connor>
<connor> I got blocked by the fucking teachers. </connor>
<connor> They told me off and I was like, I was so confused, </connor>
<connor> I was like, this doesn't, is this allowed? </connor>
<connor> It was outside of school. What? </connor>
<connor> And they were telling me off for climbing this wall </connor>
<connor> outside of school, not even anywhere near school. </connor>
<joey> I was like teachers are snitch. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think we had anything like that </connor>
<connor> because like, the town on that I grew up in was like, </connor>
<garnt> it was small, but it was also quite wide. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I don't think I ever saw my teachers outside of school. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I was in like Hove and Brighton, </garnt>
<connor> so I mean, that's like a city. </connor>
<connor> So I don't think people cared about. </connor>
<connor> Did you guys have, like, </connor>
<garnt> did your schools have any rivalries with like other schools? </garnt>
<connor> - We were attached to another school. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah we had like a sister school as well. </joey>
<joey> So the school I went to was the boys school. </joey>
<joey> And then like at the bottom of the hill, </joey>
<joey> there was the girls school, the sister school. </joey>
<connor> - We were like, our schools were physically attached. </connor>
<garnt> - But they were different schools? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so you could walk to the other school </connor>
<connor> from our school. </connor>
<garnt> - That just sounds like a bad time. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like fights. </garnt>
<joey> - Whether a lot fights happened? </joey>
<joey> - It was like the corridor, </joey>
<connor> like where like the walls were like different colors, </connor>
<connor> like there was a weird line, right. </connor>
<connor> So that's where like, if shit went down, </connor>
<connor> it was always like, at this like, it was like the DMZ, </connor>
<joey> in like North Korea. (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like guard standing on the border. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) - It was like shit went down. </joey>
<joey> So the reason why this weird like, </joey>
<connor> it sounds really bizarre, right. </connor>
<connor> So we were a Welsh speaking school and we were really small. </connor>
<connor> And the one we were attached to </connor>
<connor> was a massive English speakings, </connor>
<connor> really fuck big English speaking school. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause our school was too small and like poor </connor>
<connor> to have our own like sports facilities. </connor>
<connor> So that school also had this massive sports </connor>
<connor> like kind of complex attached to it. </connor>
<connor> Swimming, pool, tennis, like massive sports halls, </connor>
<garnt> Astro turf, massive fields, </garnt>
<garnt> tennis courts, everything , right. </garnt>
<garnt> They had everything like rugby pitches, </garnt>
<garnt> literally everything. </garnt>
<connor> And so our school would basically share </connor>
<connor> the facilities with them. </connor>
<connor> So whenever we needed to go to use the pool </connor>
<joey> or anything, we always walked through this school </joey>
<connor> and went there. </connor>
<joey> So we could walk through their school, </joey>
<connor> but they couldn't walk through our school. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause our school was on the edge. </joey>
<connor> - Why would the, like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just imagining like the architect of that building, </garnt>
<garnt> just being like, this is gonna be hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - They just wanted to make a fight club between kids, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause of course kids are gonna fucking fight eachother. </garnt>
<connor> - And there was like that corridor </connor>
<connor> and there was two outside gates that also connected </connor>
<connor> that were pretty big. </connor>
<joey> So whenever it was like snow or anything as well, </joey>
<connor> that would turn into like the fighting zone. </connor>
<joey> - I just remember a story of like going back </joey>
<joey> to the teachers getting angry outside of the school grounds. </joey>
<connor> Did you guys ever used to do like PE activities </connor>
<connor> outside of school? - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> You'd go to other places. </connor>
<connor> - So like one of the ones that we did quite often </connor>
<connor> was cause our school was right next to a beach. </connor>
<connor> We did a lot of like ocean kayaking, </connor>
<connor> which was like really fun. </connor>
<connor> Like you just like two or three boys at a time, </connor>
<joey> get on a Kayak. - [Connor] That's dangerous. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was very dangerous, but. </joey>
<joey> - Damn kayak, he got kayaking. </joey>
<connor> - I used to go kayaking. </connor>
<connor> - You guys got to go kayaking? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and sailing. - What the fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> What sailing? - Yeah, we had sailing as well </garnt>
<connor> - I had learned how to sail. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm so jealous. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] I got good story for that. </garnt>
<joey> - There was one moment in kayaking, </joey>
<joey> it's such a bad story, but there was like, </joey>
<joey> cause we were on Manley beach </joey>
<connor> and one of the beaches, cause it's like a bay basically. </connor>
<connor> So surrounded by these cliffs </connor>
<connor> and there's a lot of like really like pristine </connor>
<connor> like penthouses that are like kind of overlooking the bay. </connor>
<connor> If you like kind of look up at the cliffs. </connor>
<connor> There was this one time, </connor>
<connor> we were just kayaking along the bay </connor>
<connor> and then one of the boys was like, oye, check it out! </connor>
<connor> I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> And we look up and there's just like a chick </connor>
<connor> standing like in a bikini, just like looking down at us. </connor>
<connor> And you know, she was a very attractive lady. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And we were, you know, we were in 11th grade, so we were 17, </connor>
<joey> 18 stuff like that, yeah, so basically- </joey>
<joey> - I'm about to commit misogyny. </joey>
<joey> - So one of the kids was like. </joey>
<connor> - Sorry, I know what he's gonna say. </connor>
<joey> - So one of the boys just starts going. </joey>
<joey> tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys, </joey>
<garnt> tits out for the boys and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like most Australian. </garnt>
<joey> - And then a couple and then couple of the other boys </joey>
<joey> start joining along. </joey>
<joey> Tits out for the boys. </joey>
<joey> And then before you know it's like, </joey>
<joey> there's like 15 Kayaks, like 30 boys in this bank. </joey>
<joey> Just going tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys. </joey>
<connor> - Thunder. </connor>
<joey> - It was like a scene at a Mad Max. </joey>
<joey> It was fucking crazy and then of course the girl flashes, </joey>
<joey> everyone goes, yeah! </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Did she? What! - [Garnt] Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - And then teacher and of course the teacher we had that day </joey>
<joey> was a female teacher. </joey>
<garnt> She was like, what the fuck are you boys doing? </garnt>
<garnt> And we just like bolt in our kayaks, </garnt>
<garnt> just like get away from the sea </garnt>
<garnt> and we got absolutely rinsed. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the most teenage Australian boys story ever. </garnt>
<joey> - This what happens when you study in boys only school. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, this is what happens in a boys only school. </connor>
<garnt> - Tits! - Tits! </garnt>
<connor> I just remember that. </connor>
<connor> - How Joey didn't turn into our slash nice guy. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) I dunno how that happened. </connor>
<connor> - I hate to admit I did join in the chant. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh my God. - Just from peer pressure. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] So he committed misogyny. </connor>
<garnt> - I committed misogyny, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - They didn't let you do anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I mean, like I wouldn't trust a kid out in the sea. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm surprised how other people did. </garnt>
<connor> - We got to go to areas in Wales </connor>
<connor> that were like kind of a like camps for like </connor>
<connor> three, four days. </connor>
<connor> And they were basically like, they would be like, </connor>
<connor> listen boys, we can do kayaking or you can do sailing. </connor>
<connor> The problem is you only got six sailboats </connor>
<connor> and we've got, everyone else can do kayaking, like 30 kids. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh shit, </connor>
<connor> even though I didn't really like sailing, </connor>
<joey> I didn't know anything about it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, well, that's the one that has less, </joey>
<joey> I wanna do that. </joey>
<joey> So I put my hand up to do it </joey>
<connor> and somehow I got chosen to do it. </connor>
<connor> I did sailing, I fucking loved it, it was amazing. </connor>
<connor> But they gave us those like, </connor>
<connor> you know, boat plastic, like really cheap boat plastic, </connor>
<connor> the one where you like knock it and it sounds hollow. </connor>
<connor> It's really coarse as well. </connor>
<connor> It basically like a boat that was a shell of plastic </connor>
<connor> with a, like what's it called, is it a hole? </connor>
<connor> What's the thing that goes to the bottom. </connor>
<connor> With the rudder. </connor>
<garnt> - Sail. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just in the bottom. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no idea. - I don't remember. </garnt>
<joey> - I forgot what it's called. </joey>
<joey> So you just have this slab of plastic </joey>
<joey> that you put in to allow you to sail basically. </joey>
<joey> And then when we learned how to sail and it was great </joey>
<joey> and yeah, it was really good, cause like- </joey>
<garnt> - [Staff] Talking about the mast. </garnt>
<garnt> - The mast. No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never sailed before in my life so. </garnt>
<garnt> - This mast was at the front </garnt>
<connor> and then it was one way you turn it </connor>
<connor> and then they in the bottom underneath the water, </connor>
<connor> you slide in a thing. </connor>
<connor> Not the rudder. - [Staff] Not the rudder. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] I dunno. - It's a sailboat. </connor>
<connor> So you didn't do the direction with the, </connor>
<joey> you did the direction with the sail, not the- </joey>
<joey> - Like you'd pull on the sail and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> - You pull on the sail, </joey>
<joey> you lean like, it was really cool. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like you been doing that badass shit, </joey>
<joey> like you'd be leaning half the boat would be out the water </joey>
<joey> onto the sail, it was so fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - Horizontal on waters. - Just drifting. </joey>
<joey> - [Staff] Is it the Keel? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Maybe I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Either way, so, and then you would like, </joey>
<joey> you would be taught like, </joey>
<connor> okay, let's say you flip your boat. </connor>
<connor> Here's how you jump out the boat, </connor>
<connor> jump on the piece of plastic outside the boat, </connor>
<connor> push it down, jump back in the boat and get it back in. </connor>
<connor> So fucking cool, I loved it so much, </connor>
<connor> I got really good at it. </connor>
<connor> And then the head guy was like, you know what, </connor>
<connor> every year or so the kid who gets really good at sailing </connor>
<connor> and I let him try the real boat </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh shit really? </connor>
<connor> And then, so he like out of this like </connor>
<connor> really gross looking shed in the water. </connor>
<connor> It was one of those sheds that was like </connor>
<connor> kinda there's no flow, </connor>
<connor> it's just for the boat. </connor>
<connor> He pulls out this massive Catamaran, massive. </connor>
<connor> I've been in this like one person boat </connor>
<connor> this thing could easily fit like four, </connor>
<connor> to six people on it, right. </connor>
<connor> He's like, go take it out for a spin. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like this looks fucking scary. </connor>
<joey> - What did he say it like the rich uncle, loans Ferrari. </joey>
<connor> Let's take it out for a spin boy. </connor>
<connor> - Felt like the sword in the stone test. </connor>
<connor> Let's see if you can handle this one. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I start taking this thing out. </connor>
<connor> It's going well, I'm managing it. </connor>
<connor> It's a lot harder, you have to run, </connor>
<connor> you have to like get across way more, </connor>
<joey> a lot more really full body. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you've gotta really like get underneath, </joey>
<joey> you really gotta like throw yourself around on this thing </joey>
<joey> to steer it, it's going well, it's going well. </joey>
<joey> Suddenly we get a big gust of wind </joey>
<connor> and I'm trying my God damn best to save this. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying my best. I get to the side. </connor>
<connor> I'm tryna unleash the mass so that we can get some like, </connor>
<connor> we can get the boat back down. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately the boat just keeps going. </connor>
<connor> It keeps going and then it doesn't, </connor>
<connor> it gets sideways completely. </connor>
<connor> From this point now this boat is too heavy. </connor>
<connor> Unlike the other boat where my body weight </connor>
<connor> could shift it back, like my body weight can't do shit. </connor>
<connor> And it is literally like the sinking boat, like Titanic. </connor>
<connor> It is just like I'm sitting on the top of the boat, </connor>
<connor> like at the top of the thing, just slowly going down. </connor>
<connor> Until it gets about the halfway point </connor>
<connor> where it won't sink anymore, luckily. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just sitting there </connor>
<connor> and then he comes over disappointingly </connor>
<connor> in like the speed boat and he's like, I see. </connor>
<connor> He's like- </connor>
<connor> - You aren't the chosen one. - You are not the one. </connor>
<connor> - He's like, I see. </connor>
<connor> He's like, well at least help me </connor>
<connor> tie the rope around this part and I took it back over </connor>
<connor> and then he got on the boat and he was like, </connor>
<joey> I'll show you how to drive it. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I let him down. I let him down. </connor>
<connor> He sailed it back and then I was like a disappointment </connor>
<connor> and I was never allowed to try it again. </connor>
<connor> There was a fucking, I felt like that was </connor>
<joey> a look in hindsight, I feel that was ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like that was a big step up. </garnt>
<joey> - It was alone as well with the catamaran </joey>
<joey> you can normally have like two people on it. </joey>
<joey> It's the big one with the big net, </joey>
<garnt> you know what it is right, it's ridiculous. </garnt>
<connor> It wasn't like a full sized massive one, </connor>
<connor> it was like a smaller version, but still, it was like- </connor>
<garnt> - I'm so jealous. I never got to do that in my school. </garnt>
<garnt> And we live in Brighton. - You live in Brighton. </garnt>
<joey> - Not even kayaking? </joey>
<joey> - It was in a lake and a river, so it's a lot easier. </joey>
<joey> It was a really big lake, but you wouldn't </joey>
<garnt> wanna do that in the ocean. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get swept fucking away. </garnt>
<connor> In this lake you were just happy for me ask about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I don't think there was any </garnt>
<garnt> like big lakes near us, </garnt>
<garnt> so we didn't really do any water sports. </garnt>
<connor> I think the most we did was just, </connor>
<connor> we had like a swimming pool, a local swimming pool. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean there's lakes everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I mean, we're not, </connor>
<garnt> like how far did you need to drive to get to this lake? </garnt>
<garnt> - Two, three hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - You drive two, three hours just for this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the entirety of Wales. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like a fucking school trip for us. </garnt>
<connor> - It was, it was. </connor>
<connor> It was like a three day weekend school trip. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you made it sound like it was one afternoon. </joey>
<garnt> - You made it sound like, oh yeah, </garnt>
<connor> for this one lesson in PE. </connor>
<connor> - No I said three or four days, three or four days. </connor>
<joey> - No, because like the kayaking thing for us </joey>
<connor> was just like down the road. - Oh no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> It's like, so there's like areas in the, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure it's funded by the Welsh government. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, basically every Welsh school </connor>
<joey> gets like a weekend there. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - [Joey] Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> - So everyone gets to have turns. </connor>
<joey> So these like, they're like really fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That makes more sense. </joey>
<joey> - So like, yeah, there's like a, you know, </joey>
<connor> it's kinda like a thing you go, it's like, </connor>
<connor> hey, try a bunch of different sports, try kayaking, </connor>
<connor> try canoeing, try sailing, wall climbing, like everything. </connor>
<connor> Just try to do everything, suite what you like. </connor>
<connor> And so it was really fun and I'm glad got to do it. </connor>
<connor> I wish I kept up with sailing. </connor>
<joey> But unfortunately sailing is a very luxury sport </joey>
<joey> to be able to do this. </joey>
<joey> So not like, oh yeah, you can just go sailing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Unfortunately, it sucks really. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like there's so many sports out there </connor>
<connor> that I could have fell in love with, </connor>
<joey> but the financial instability. </joey>
<joey> - The absolute economical stayed. </joey>
<connor> - That like every sport ever for everyone, right. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's was like me and skiing and snowboarding. </garnt>
<joey> That's why I never was able to get into it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause my family unfortunately could never afford </joey>
<garnt> to you going on a skiing or snowboarding trip. </garnt>
<joey> - It's either not enough money, not enough space or both. </joey>
<connor> - Yes. - Well I'd love to, </connor>
<connor> I've been skiing and snowboarding </connor>
<connor> like the majority of my life </connor>
<connor> and I would love to earn a snowboard or skis, </connor>
<joey> but it is an absolute nightmare </joey>
<joey> to deal with transporting it and taking it everywhere. </joey>
<joey> And I also, it's pretty expensive. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It is expensive. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I know that you can ship it from hotel to like- </connor>
<connor> - God you sound like you had such like fun school trips. </connor>
<joey> You went to like America for a school trip. </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking crazy to me. </joey>
<joey> - Well that was insane, </joey>
<joey> that was like the first year they did that. </joey>
<joey> And that was really expensive as well. </joey>
<connor> I remember I had to like beg my parents and they were like. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause our school wasn't that rich. </joey>
<joey> Like I think the richest thing that our school did </joey>
<connor> for the rugby team, </connor>
<connor> cause we like excelled in sports at our school </connor>
<connor> was like the senior rugby team was allowed </connor>
<connor> to go to like play rugby in Europe. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but like that was only like </connor>
<connor> the select like maybe like, </connor>
<joey> you know, top 20 people who were like good at rugby. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't even remember what we did for our school trips. </garnt>
<garnt> - The rest of the time </garnt>
<joey> we just went to like the local water silo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. Something boring. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno if this is just cause like </joey>
<joey> it's a really small place, </joey>
<connor> but I imagine that when you're in a city </connor>
<connor> it probably feels like less inclined </connor>
<connor> to get you out of the city. </connor>
<connor> Whereas when you're in the countryside, there's nothing. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like they had way more pressure </connor>
<connor> to try and get you to do something. </connor>
<connor> Especially cause you know, in at least sport in Wales, </connor>
<connor> like sports is like a massive deal. </connor>
<connor> It's a very important part of like the culture </connor>
<connor> and doing sports as seen as a very, very </connor>
<connor> like you have to do it. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't matter what you do just do sports, </connor>
<joey> like it seems do what you gotta do. </joey>
<joey> So, you know, there was a really big incentive </joey>
<joey> for them to make us go and do sports </joey>
<joey> and go on sports trips and do all this kind stuff. </joey>
<connor> - I think the farthest we ever went in a school trip </connor>
<connor> or anything was like during like school camps. </connor>
<connor> But that we did every year </connor>
<connor> and that was like maybe like, </connor>
<garnt> you know four, five hours away. </garnt>
<garnt> Which in the grand scheme of Australia is not far at all. </garnt>
<joey> But like, yeah, I don't remember </joey>
<joey> like going on like school excursions </joey>
<joey> going further than like an hour away. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, the furthest I ever went </garnt>
<garnt> for a school trip was like France. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause every school trip goes to France for like it's- </joey>
<joey> - Well you're in Brighton it's fucking easy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - At least you fucking Europeans </joey>
<joey> got to go to other countries </joey>
<joey> that was not in for us. </joey>
<connor> - Other countries are like, don't exist, Australia. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, oh what's the closest country, </joey>
<joey> Papa on Y Guinea. How far away is that? </joey>
<joey> Like a three hour plane ride, its like your cool. </joey>
<garnt> - Your own country is like far away from your own country. </garnt>
<joey> - We couldn't even, even get to go to the other states. </joey>
<joey> Like that's too far. </joey>
<connor> God forbid we're gonna be on a plane for an hour and a half. </connor>
<joey> No, of course not. </joey>
<connor> - You probably had better school facilities though, </connor>
<connor> than we had. </connor>
<connor> We get to go on a trip and they were like, </connor>
<connor> just forget about the fact that you have to share a chair. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> No, I mean, even then it was like, you know, </joey>
<joey> like school camp, for example, it was like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I guess, you know, </joey>
<joey> everyone got their own seat on the bus or whatever, </joey>
<joey> but like that was the most we got. </joey>
<joey> - Got your own scene on the bus.(laughing) </joey>
<joey> What privilege. </joey>
<connor> - Well, okay. </connor>
<connor> What were your, I didn't get school meals, </connor>
<connor> but like were your school meals good? </connor>
<joey> What did you get? </joey>
<joey> - We didn't get school meals. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] There was no cafeteria? </joey>
<joey> - There was a cafeteria. </joey>
<connor> - What did they serve at the cafeteria? </connor>
<joey> - Most like luxury thing ever was this was fucking, </joey>
<joey> it was two chicken tenders in a bread roll. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That shit cost $4.50. - What? </joey>
<joey> - To me you knew the kids who were eating goods </joey>
<joey> were who were the kids that could afford </joey>
<joey> a ham and cheese panini. </joey>
<connor> - Your school had ham and cheese panini? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You got fucking panini dude? </joey>
<joey> - Bro they gave you more than they just called it bread. </joey>
<connor> That was all we, everything was bread. </connor>
<joey> - For us it was literally just two fucking </joey>
<joey> microwave chicken tenders in a hotdog roll </joey>
<joey> and then if you wanted ketchup or mayonnaise, </joey>
<connor> it was available for you for like 20 cents. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - But even then it was like, </connor>
<connor> cause, so like I never bought anything </connor>
<connor> at our cafeteria just because I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not fucking paying 50 for Chicken tender roll. </connor>
<joey> Like that's ridiculous. </joey>
<connor> - This is where child Connor really learned inflation. </connor>
<connor> Like this is where it really came to hit me. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I remember I used to have, </joey>
<joey> I was always given the same amount of money </joey>
<garnt> from like the young age to spend at the cafeteria. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember like when I started high school, </garnt>
<garnt> I could get any of the meals. </garnt>
<garnt> They weren't amazing meals, </garnt>
<connor> by the end I literally couldn't buy any of the meals </connor>
<connor> unless I like had half a meal the day before </connor>
<connor> and then saved and then and then yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why did you not renegotiate with your parents, </connor>
<connor> like mom, dad. - Their mindset was like, </connor>
<joey> well your brother managed completely fine </joey>
<joey> throughout high school with this much. </joey>
<connor> So what's you're problem? </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, because I think in my household, </joey>
<connor> like I got allowance for doing chores like per month. </connor>
<connor> And you know, it was like maybe like, </connor>
<garnt> you know, 20 bucks max per month, right. </garnt>
<connor> Which, you know, to a 10 year old is a lot of money. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time when your school at age 10 </connor>
<connor> gave you fucking meat pies for like a dollar 50. </connor>
<connor> You know, there's like squeezy ketchup packets. </connor>
<connor> Those were 20 cents and I was like, </connor>
<garnt> dog, I'm not paying 20 cents. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not paying a literal 100th of my monthly allowance </joey>
<garnt> for a little fucking squirt of ketchup. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm not doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys didn't have packed lunches. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to have packed lunches for most of the days. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like most of my days for me as well </garnt>
<garnt> was like packed lunches, right. </garnt>
<joey> Because my mum was like, I'm not giving you fucking money. </joey>
<garnt> all that expensive. - Cause for me like, </garnt>
<garnt> my allowance would like last the entire week. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I'd treat myself to the ham and cheese panini. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like the Friday meal that was like. </garnt>
<joey> - See you did it the smart way. </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know what, </joey>
<joey> I could buy that chicken tender roll, </joey>
<joey> but I could also buy this Yugio booster pack. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, okay. (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say, here's what I did, right. </connor>
<connor> I would get, so I'd get two pounds a day, right. </connor>
<connor> Which was like, I could buy one meal </connor>
<garnt> if I waited like a day and like had something small. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, but I actually want video games instead. </garnt>
<connor> So I would go into the town, which is like a 20 minute walk. </connor>
<connor> I would go to the, it's called home bargains in the UK, </connor>
<connor> it's like a pound land or whatever. </connor>
<connor> I would buy a family bag of crisps, </connor>
<connor> like 12 pack for a pound. </connor>
<connor> And I would just eat that the whole week. </connor>
<connor> This is awful, this is pretty wild. </connor>
<garnt> - This the most British thing I've ever heard. </garnt>
<joey> - You were rationing on chips. </joey>
<garnt> - So you were just on a crisp diet as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) - Yeah, I was. </connor>
<connor> Because right, a video game back then was 30 pounds. </connor>
<joey> So if I did this for a whole month, I got a new game. </joey>
<joey> Sure my mom was wondering where the I got this game from, </joey>
<joey> but she didn't even know that I was getting, </joey>
<joey> I was eating Chris. </joey>
<connor> It was probably an awful thing to do in my body, </connor>
<connor> but I didn't care I was like 15. </connor>
<connor> I wanted the video game. </connor>
<joey> - You see, you had so much more of a stronger </joey>
<joey> willpower than me because like I could not save money </joey>
<connor> for that long. - I couldn't. </connor>
<connor> I had the object in mind. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I want the new halo game. </connor>
<connor> I'm not eating. </connor>
<joey> - No dude in my head I was like, </joey>
<joey> every time I went to like a electronic store </joey>
<joey> and I was like, oh, the new Mario Party is out. </joey>
<connor> How much does it cost? $80. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Oh! </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I could save up four months worth of allowance </connor>
<connor> to get it, but my birthday is also in seven months time. </connor>
<connor> So maybe I could just like hint at it now </connor>
<connor> and then just wait seven months for me </connor>
<joey> to actually get the game. Which is what I did. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah cause for me, like when I wanted to buy a video game, </garnt>
<garnt> like I grew up in like, when I was in school, </garnt>
<connor> it was like the N 64 SNES era. </connor>
<connor> And like games back then was like 60 pounds a game. </connor>
<garnt> For like a cartridge game. - Wait, was it really? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it was. - Was it like halved? </connor>
<garnt> - Huh? - It like halved. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I remember when like games start coming out </garnt>
<garnt> on discs, I'm just like, why is it so much cheaper now? </garnt>
<garnt> What the hell and the graphics are better, </garnt>
<garnt> this is what kind of hacks they put in. </garnt>
<connor> - PS2 was like me producing those things. </connor>
<connor> That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so like back in those days, </connor>
<garnt> like there was no fucking way I can afford </garnt>
<connor> like a cartridge game. </connor>
<garnt> Like the only times I was getting new games </garnt>
<garnt> was like Christmas and birthday. </garnt>
<garnt> Those were the two times of the year where I got games </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I was praying that I could, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was praying that my parents bought </garnt>
<garnt> like the right games every time man. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I was like, mother I have waited an entire year. </joey>
<joey> If I don't get at least three games, I am going to rage. </joey>
<joey> - When I turned like 16, they were like, </joey>
<joey> we want you to have a bit of an allowance </joey>
<connor> so that you can learn how to manage your money. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh thanks. </connor>
<connor> And I was just thinking like, </connor>
<joey> I've got a lot saved already though. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like, this is just adding to the wealth. </joey>
<connor> This is how I've become Jeff Bezos. </connor>
<connor> - I think my parents thought the same way, </connor>
<joey> but only after they found out that I got rejected </joey>
<joey> from my McDonald's job. </joey>
<joey> So they were like, there's no saving you, </joey>
<joey> we'll up your allowance. </joey>
<joey> so you don't end up being a bum. </joey>
<connor> - The more I think about it, the more I was like, </connor>
<connor> yeah I dunno if I was always gonna be </connor>
<connor> that kind of way with money. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, I wonder is it like I do. </connor>
<joey> I guess you have to teach your kids you how to learn, </joey>
<connor> how to manage money. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I see videos, people are like </connor>
<connor> nobody taught me how to manage money. </connor>
<connor> I just spent it all when I was like 20 and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - You do this. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - By the way very, very, very British thing. </connor>
<garnt> What Chrisp I was eating by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Walkers. No. - That's too expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> - Quavers. </garnt>
<garnt> - No think cheap. </garnt>
<joey> - Think cheap. </joey>
<joey> - Don't look at me, man. </joey>
<joey> - You don't know. </joey>
<joey> This is from very British audiences right now. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - I just gonna hit you like a wave, discos. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my fucking God! Okay, okay. </joey>
<garnt> I completely forgot that they even existed. </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't had discos since like my. </garnt>
<joey> - You like 12. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, did I reach double digits </garnt>
<garnt> for the last time I had disco? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I can't fucking remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the cheap shoot chips. </garnt>
<connor> - They were like weirdly good. </connor>
<joey> But there was probably so much like MSG and shit. </joey>
<joey> They were really tasty. </joey>
<joey> But they were weirdly like super cheap, </joey>
<joey> like compared to all other chips, </joey>
<connor> but they taste really fucking good. </connor>

<joey> - I've always had like, </joey>
<joey> because I don't know if it was just my school in Australia, </joey>
<connor> but like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when watch like American like high school movies. </connor>
<joey> And that had like the cafeteria, like the cafeteria. </joey>
<garnt> Where there was like the lunch lady </garnt>
<garnt> and there was like, this was like the serving of the day, </garnt>
<connor> you know, kind of shit like. </connor>
<connor> I dunno why, did you look at that and go like, </connor>
<joey> I wish I had that in my school. </joey>
<connor> - I think Americans wish they had that in their schools. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like, cause I remember like </garnt>
<joey> watching American high school movies, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm like damn I wish my high school was this cool. </garnt>
<connor> - Like every Simpsons episode I watched </connor>
<connor> and like Bart was in the cafeteria, </connor>
<connor> I was like, man that looks cool. </connor>
<joey> What, does every American school have that. </joey>
<joey> Behold I know not every American school has that. </joey>
<connor> - I was just shocked that everyone had cars. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) That's what blue meal. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there's like 15 year old kid and it's like, </joey>
<connor> it was like, yeah, I'll pick you up tonight. </connor>
<connor> I was like, do you mean your parents </connor>
<joey> are gonna pick you up tonight? Or. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno what was going on in the two thousands. </joey>
<connor> But like every single thing it wasn't about like, </connor>
<joey> if you had a car, it was like which car you had. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What, you all have cars? </joey>
<joey> - It's like yeah oh, sorry I'm gonna go pick you up. </joey>
<garnt> - When did you guys first like learn to drive then, </garnt>
<garnt> Did you learn how, how to drive like immediately </garnt>
<joey> when you could or did you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like when I. - Complicated story. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, for me it was like the moment you hit 16. </joey>
<connor> - What's complicated about it? </connor>
<joey> - How did this be complicated? </joey>
<joey> - So I started learning how to drive </joey>
<joey> when I was 17, which when you could do in the UK. </joey>
<connor> But what sucks is that because my birthday was in July, </connor>
<connor> which is the end of the school year. </connor>
<joey> People who started in September had already like </joey>
<joey> way past got their cars and were driving. </joey>
<joey> - Wait your school year ends in July. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh sorry ends in September. Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - September? - No starts in September. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry starts in September ends in like August. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - Really? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if we're talking about. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Wait, when does yours? </joey>
<garnt> - It's January. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your school year starts in January? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - What? </joey>
<joey> - It ends in December, starts in January. </joey>
<garnt> - Whoa. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So wait, how do summer holidays work for you then? </garnt>
<garnt> - Summer holidays is December. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then when do you get Christmas holidays? </garnt>
<connor> - Actually it technically starts in February. </connor>
<connor> So we end school middle of December. </connor>
<connor> And then you celebrate Christmas </connor>
<garnt> and holidays during holidays. </garnt>
<garnt> And then all of January is summer holidays. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you come back in February. </garnt>
<garnt> - So how long do you get off them? </garnt>
<garnt> - During summer holidays? - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like depends on the school, </joey>
<joey> but like usually like a month and a half. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, cause we get like nearly three months. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's pretty much the first half of August </connor>
<garnt> is when it ends, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, well we talking university </garnt>
<garnt> or were we talking like secondary school? </garnt>
<connor> - Secondary both are the same right-ish. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, for us it was all the same. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no in university, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember in university you get like </garnt>
<garnt> fucking three months off. </garnt>
<garnt> And those were like, that was like before that </garnt>
<joey> like school holidays for me were always, </joey>
<joey> the summer holiday was six weeks. </joey>
<joey> It was always six weeks. </joey>
<joey> Winter holidays was two weeks </joey>
<joey> and then we'd have like half terms </joey>
<joey> where you'd get like, where you'd get like one week off, </joey>
<joey> like halfway through the term. </joey>
<joey> - Spring and autumn holiday. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So all together we got like, </joey>
<joey> we must got like about two around two months of holiday </joey>
<joey> that was spread out. </joey>
<joey> And then like university here and I remember thinking, </joey>
<joey> yo, what the fuck, we get three months off for summer, </joey>
<garnt> why am I even going to education anymore man. </garnt>
<garnt> - The first time I experienced </garnt>
<garnt> the first like summer holidays in uni, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, well see you at university never again. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I remember when summer holidays started in university, </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, wow, I'm just not gonna go back to uni. </joey>
<joey> That's three months, right? </joey>
<joey> That's like, you know what you can't imagine </joey>
<joey> the end of summer holiday. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah so the point was that </connor>
<connor> basically kids who were born in September. </connor>
<connor> Sorry fuck am I saying. </connor>
<joey> Kids who had their birthday like in my year </joey>
<joey> who were like really close to the start of the year. </joey>
<connor> Basically got to have their license and already had it </connor>
<connor> and cool as shit. </connor>
<joey> - And you were right at the end. </joey>
<connor> - So they were in my year. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it didn't matter if you the year above. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you weren't friends, right. </connor>
<connor> Even if I was closer in age technically. </connor>
<joey> So like the people who got it first </joey>
<joey> were like the coolest ones. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause everyone was like, oh can we gimme a lift now? </joey>
<connor> Oh, I'll drive you there. It's like fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, so it's like for, in the UK, </joey>
<garnt> you guys have like different stages </garnt>
<garnt> in your driving license, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like you have like learner. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like provisional, - Provisional stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> So when you're on your first level, </joey>
<connor> like when you first start. - There's two levels. </connor>
<connor> You have, or you're learning. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so when you are learning, </joey>
<garnt> can you just like drive by yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] No. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - There needs to be someone who supervises you. </garnt>
<joey> - Supervises you and has, how many years of experience? </joey>
<joey> So X amount of years driving </joey>
<joey> and you can't go on like the highways. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like it's only until your provisionals </joey>
<joey> that you can drive by yourself, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but the problem is that normally </connor>
<joey> not that you can't find someone </joey>
<joey> it's that you can't get a car. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause you need to be insured. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was what the hard part was. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause insurance for like a 17 year old is ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You need to be insured. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you need to be insured. </connor>
<joey> - No, I could just use my mom's car. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] You might have had family insurance. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, maybe, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - But like, if you are under family insurance, </joey>
<connor> your price gets like tripled. </connor>
<connor> - If you have a 17 year old on your license. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. - It's insane. </garnt>
<connor> Like the reason why it was just like </connor>
<connor> no one owned a car except for a few people </connor>
<connor> was cause the insurance cost </connor>
<connor> was like triple of quadruple the car. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - The car was nothing. </connor>
<connor> Like my mate got a car for like a hundred quid of some guy, </connor>
<garnt> the insurance was like a thousand plus. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was like- - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was more cost for the insurance than the car itself. </garnt>
<connor> - But lessons were expensive as well. </connor>
<connor> I did lessons, my brother had already passed </connor>
<connor> and you know, so it was my turn. </connor>
<connor> I was doing it and it was going well. </connor>
<connor> And then every now and then the guy would just kind of </connor>
<connor> call me up, 'cause I was learning through a guy. </connor>
<connor> That was how you mainly learn in, </connor>
<connor> at least the countryside in the UK. </connor>
<connor> And he was kinda flaky. </connor>
<connor> He would kind of like, he wouldn't show up sometimes </connor>
<connor> and then sometimes he would just stop </connor>
<connor> and then I'm about, I wanna say two thirds away </connor>
<connor> from getting my test and he just calls up </connor>
<joey> and he is like, oh yeah, by the way I've quit, </joey>
<joey> I'm just not doing anymore. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing, I'm sorry that I don't wanna do </joey>
<joey> instructing people, cause the costs on the car </joey>
<connor> are too much and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> All right well, so I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh it can't be too hard to find another one. </connor>
<connor> My mom just could not find another instructor. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause they're all booked up. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause there's not many in my area. </connor>
<connor> - This is during your learning stage, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Normally like they get booked up pretty quickly </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's not that many, </connor>
<connor> cause it's not very profitable. </connor>
<connor> It's really like, doesn't make much money </connor>
<connor> and it's a lot of work </connor>
<connor> and it's a lot of upkeep on the car as well. </connor>
<connor> So he did that and then I couldn't find one for like, </connor>
<connor> I wanna say right up until like three months </connor>
<connor> before I was leaving for university. </connor>
<connor> So I had to get back into it. </connor>
<connor> It'd been like a six, seven months. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I couldn't find any one. </connor>
<connor> Started doing it again and I was kind of getting okay at it </connor>
<connor> and I was maybe like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I wanna say like 10 lessons off doing the test. </connor>
<joey> I'd go to university and then I just didn't do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah of course. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause like I was busy having fun. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like, and you don't need a car at university. </garnt>
<connor> - Definitely. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I didn't have my license </connor>
<connor> and then it became something that I was kind of like, </connor>
<connor> okay, don't really want to do this anymore, </connor>
<connor> cause it's kind of in the way, </connor>
<joey> it's really pain in the ass </joey>
<joey> and I have to start from zero again, </joey>
<connor> and if I did do it, I thought, oh I'll do one of those </connor>
<connor> like, cause you can do like weak intensive course. </connor>
<connor> Where you just drive for like eight hours a day. </connor>
<connor> And then you do your test and hopefully you pass. </connor>
<connor> Statistically they're like the worst drivers. </connor>
<joey> But you know- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you're basically speed running, driving. </joey>
<joey> - So, you know, I'd gone through all the uni, never did it. </joey>
<connor> And this point, like in the UK you have to two things, </connor>
<connor> a theory test and a practical test. </connor>
<connor> Theory's really easy but it only lasts two years </connor>
<connor> after you've done it. </connor>
<connor> So mine had expired. So I had to go and do it again. </connor>
<connor> So I was in London and I was like, oh fuck okay, </connor>
<connor> I'll go and get it, I'm gonna actually learn a drive. </connor>
<connor> And then I booked one of these courses </connor>
<connor> that was like really expensive. </connor>
<connor> For like five days. </connor>
<connor> And their like promise was you will guaranteed </connor>
<connor> get your license by day five. </connor>
<garnt> - And anyone who says guaranteed, </garnt>
<connor> guaranteed to get a license that's sus as fuck man. </connor>
<garnt> - So I started driving </garnt>
<garnt> and I had this guy and who's Welsh, </garnt>
<joey> well, I was like, oh great he's Welsh, </joey>
<joey> should be really nice. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I can bribe him. (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Well, he wasn't my, he wasn't testing me, </connor>
<connor> but I was using his car </connor>
<connor> and you're also allowed to use that person's car </connor>
<connor> for the test and stuff. </connor>
<connor> You know, it was really good. </connor>
<connor> He was nice, start you know, he was like, oh you Welsh, </connor>
<connor> good, good I like Welsh people. </connor>
<connor> We're both in London, so it was kind of like, oh nice, nice. </connor>
<connor> He was really weird. </connor>
<connor> He would also take any opportunity to insult women drivers. </connor>
<garnt> He was really weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm about to commit misogyny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every car just pass, tits out for the boys. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Anything would happen and he would be like, </joey>
<connor> fucking woman driving it, fucking woman driving. </connor>
<connor> I was like, it's a guy. </connor>
<connor> And he was like (mumbling) </connor>
<connor> I was like, well fine. </connor>
<connor> It's really uncomfortable at times you see things. </connor>
<connor> And also he would sometimes, you know, </connor>
<connor> cause you were in the car for like six hours, seven hours. </connor>
<connor> You know, you'd talk about life in and stuff. </connor>
<connor> He'd bring up some things and he'd bring up some of his, </connor>
<connor> his views on the world. </connor>
<connor> That you'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> (mumbling) Terrible situation can't stand it. </joey>
<connor> We're parking by the way. </connor>
<joey> How long, where are we going? </joey>
<joey> - My dad as well, kind of has like that weird like, </joey>
<connor> he creates this like stereotypes outta nowhere </connor>
<connor> when it comes to like driving. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird. </connor>
<joey> Now that I think about it, </joey>
<joey> I'm like every time I remember there were moments </joey>
<joey> where like my dad would be driving, </joey>
<joey> my dad will say he doesn't have road rage. </joey>
<joey> He absolutely have road rage. </joey>
<connor> I don't care what he says because every time I remember, </connor>
<connor> like every time he'd be on the road </connor>
<connor> and there'd just be like someone who's like taking him off </connor>
<joey> or whatever reason, he'd be like, oh fucking move </joey>
<joey> and then he'd, you know, get into the lane, </joey>
<joey> looking dead and like do the Luigi death stare. </joey>
<joey> And then he'd be like, oh, it's Volvo driver. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - All dads do. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think every Volvo driver is necessarily </connor>
<joey> a bad driver. </joey>
<connor> - Like BMW drivers, like a massive dickheads. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, well what is your personal vinderian </garnt>
<joey> against Volvo. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember like the, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest stereotypes was like, </garnt>
<joey> Asians are like bad drivers, right? </joey>
<joey> And like, I don't think necessarily Asians are bad drivers. </joey>
<connor> I think Asians just drive by the rules of their own country. </connor>
<joey> Which is just like a fucking free for all. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like I remember when I first learned how to drive, </joey>
<connor> I didn't actually first learn how to drive in the UK. </connor>
<connor> So I believe like. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, Garnt turns up in the UK like crazy taxi. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what happened is, so I was like turning 17 that year. </garnt>
<garnt> So I could learn how to drive in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> but I believe in Thailand, </garnt>
<joey> like you can like start learning from like 16. </joey>
<joey> I'm not sure if that's, </joey>
<joey> I'm not sure the exact age, </joey>
<joey> but I remember I could legally get lessons </joey>
<joey> to learn how to drive. </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, right, why don't I get head start </joey>
<joey> on learning how to drive </joey>
<joey> before I start to drive in the UK. </joey>
<joey> So I start learning to drive in Thailand in Bangkok. </joey>
<joey> Right. - God. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the Dark Souls of driving. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like the Dark Souls of driving. </joey>
<joey> So like I take a few lessons there and I get, you know, </joey>
<joey> get pretty confident in driving, in Bangkok </joey>
<joey> with Thailand rules, right. </joey>
<joey> So you know, I can competently handle the car </joey>
<joey> and definitely competently handle traffic </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> And so I remember I go back to UK </joey>
<joey> and I turn 17 and I sign up for my first lesson. </joey>
<joey> And then, so the instructor turns up </joey>
<joey> and you know, we just have a casual chat before, </joey>
<joey> before we start driving. </joey>
<joey> And then he asked me, have you had like any experiences </joey>
<joey> or did you like use your provision license or whatever? </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I've actually, like learned how to drive in Thailand. </joey>
<joey> Like I said this like with confidence, </joey>
<joey> like I know how to drive a car. </joey>
<connor> - You'd be breaking it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I know how to drive a car. </connor>
<connor> I've started to learn how to drive in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> You know, I've pretty confident on Bangkok roads. </connor>
<connor> - He's gonna be could you repeat that? </connor>
<connor> - And so, you know, so I'm pretty confident about it. </connor>
<connor> So he was like, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> So let's get this first lesson started then. </connor>
<joey> And so immediately I just drive off and he goes stop, </joey>
<joey> you've immediately failed, </joey>
<joey> because I didn't check my mirrors. </joey>
<connor> - I know they do this to be like, </connor>
<connor> they just want you to do it, I understand. </connor>
<connor> But like that the guy had right when I was doing this, </connor>
<connor> it's like, he couldn't just say you did something wrong. </connor>
<connor> He had to be this whole ordeal where he was like, </connor>
<connor> that was a really good turn, for a bitch. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) It was like, </connor>
<connor> nothing could be every single thing had to be </connor>
<connor> packaged with an insult. </connor>
<joey> It was like, that was really good on the roundabout </joey>
<joey> if you wanted to kill someone. - If you're a woman. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Oh, you didn't check your mirrors, like a woman. </joey>
<joey> He would do this all the time. </joey>
<joey> It was so infuriating. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was just trying to get good. </joey>
<joey> And every single time I'd be like, how was this? </joey>
<joey> He's like, yeah, that was great, </joey>
<joey> if you wanna kill someone Connor. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, just tell me how it was. </connor>
<joey> - At least for you, it was just like, </joey>
<connor> not checking your mirrors. </connor>
<joey> Like my uncle failed his first driving test </joey>
<joey> because he was like, all right get in the car, </joey>
<joey> check all the mirrors, all right, let's drive off. </joey>
<joey> It's like, stop you've immediately failed. </joey>
<connor> You drove out the exit. (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, oh all right. </connor>
<connor> So he literally got in the car, didn't even make it </connor>
<connor> out of the driveway and he was like, </connor>
<connor> you've instantly failed come back tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> - I mean you do it, don't they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah because like, </connor>
<connor> I remember when I learned how to drive in England, </connor>
<joey> I basically had to relearn driving </joey>
<joey> from like what I was taught in Thailand. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause in Thailand, they teach you like awareness </connor>
<connor> and control, like vehicle control. </connor>
<joey> But like in the UK, it's all about here's the procedure, </joey>
<joey> Check mirror A, check mirror B. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Check your blind spots. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. Check your blind spots. </connor>
<connor> I get it, but like in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> it's just like you must learn </connor>
<garnt> to become super sane ultra instincts. </garnt>
<connor> This is how you drive. </connor>
<joey> - It's the best way to take a hit from a car. </joey>
<joey> If someone hits you on the head, how you curl up. </joey>
<connor> - This how you take the least casually. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Inflict, maximum damage on my ass hole. </connor>
<connor> So, I did this five day thing right. </connor>
<joey> Where we were going through and I had this guy </joey>
<garnt> and he was kind of a slog and I remember, </garnt>
<garnt> I really didn't like doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the guy was like not, he was not fun. </garnt>
<connor> And also driving in London sucks. </connor>
<connor> It's like going slow simulator and stopping, waiting, </connor>
<garnt> giving way to people. </garnt>
<garnt> Like just, it's not like driving </garnt>
<garnt> outside of the London like at all. </garnt>
<garnt> It's completely different. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm doing this and- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not like driving ends well, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. We get to the fifth day. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like so ready to like book the test? </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, no. I was like, what you mean? </garnt>
<connor> He's like, you're not ready yet. </connor>
<connor> Not ready, I'm like, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> There's like five days guarantee. </connor>
<connor> He's like you're gonna fail right now if you do it </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh, well what do we do then? </connor>
<connor> He's like, well, sits back like he loves it. </connor>
<connor> He's like, yeah well you know, </connor>
<connor> you could pay me in cash </connor>
<connor> and I'll give you some private lessons, </connor>
<connor> you know and I was like, oh, </connor>
<connor> I was like is that okay? </connor>
<joey> He's like, yeah it's okay. </joey>
<joey> - According to me. (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - And he was like, conveniently like really expensive. </connor>
<connor> But I was like well shit, </connor>
<connor> I need him to say yes, so that I can </connor>
<connor> 'cause they won't do it without him saying yes. </connor>
<joey> - So you literally bribed him? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, he kind of blackmailed him. </joey>
<joey> - Like I've no choice. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I can't do the lesson without him agreeing. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, oh and I was like, well, when do we do it? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I kind of wanna get this over and done with, </connor>
<connor> I gotta go do America in like a week, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to like get this done. </connor>
<connor> He was like, oh, well are you free tomorrow? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, yeah, I'm free tomorrow. </connor>
<joey> And he was like, all right well meet me </joey>
<joey> in this car park tomorrow and we'll do like three hours </joey>
<connor> and then we'll see how you do it. </connor>
<connor> So I pay him in an extortion amount of money, </connor>
<connor> you know and then we do the three hours, </connor>
<joey> he's like all right now you're ready. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah I better have to. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] of course you're ready now. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, you probably just let me </joey>
<joey> drove around for the hours. </joey>
<joey> So isn't it legally a bribe or something. </joey>
<joey> So he finally does it and the way that this works </joey>
<joey> normally in the UK, if you wanna test, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how it's in Australia, </joey>
<joey> but you have to wait like a month. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I don't know how they do it, </joey>
<joey> but this company has like an in with the government </joey>
<connor> where basically like, if anyone cancels, </connor>
<connor> they get all those reservations. </connor>
<connor> So you basically have to just be ready. </connor>
<connor> And they'll be like, are you free tomorrow to do the test? </connor>
<connor> So that's what happened. </connor>
<connor> So I said, I'm ready to get the test. </connor>
<connor> And then like one day later they were like, </connor>
<connor> come to this place at this time, </connor>
<connor> the teacher will be there. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh shit this is fucking nerve wrecking. </connor>
<joey> - No, we have to go to like, for all of our tests, </joey>
<joey> you have to go to like a government certified </joey>
<joey> like road in Maritime, so this is- </joey>
<connor> - Oh no, we did, we did. </connor>
<joey> You have to do it as well, you have to do as well, </joey>
<joey> D well thing. </joey>
<joey> So I go to this building and it's like </joey>
<connor> the official government building is above like a salon. </connor>
<connor> Like it's in this really weird, like beat up room. </connor>
<connor> It's just one room. - What? </connor>
<connor> - And like, there's like seven other people in here. </connor>
<connor> And I just turn off and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck, it's weird. </connor>
<connor> It looks like some government building, </connor>
<joey> like doesn't look, it's just above like a salad </joey>
<joey> and chicken shop. </joey>
<joey> So I go in and they're like, did you park the car? </joey>
<joey> So there's no car park in this place either, </joey>
<joey> you park on the street. </joey>
<joey> Oh, so I'm parked on a hill upwards. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - And so I'm on like a brink before, like a- </connor>
<joey> - You're on manual, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah manual. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I'm parked on a hill right before roundabout </joey>
<joey> and it's a really busy jewel carriageway. </joey>
<garnt> This is awful, right? </garnt>
<connor> - That's like nightmare fuel. </connor>
<connor> - This is literally like the worst. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm bricking it, </garnt>
<garnt> and this guy can tell I'm freaking out. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause this is a horrible start. </connor>
<connor> If you let it roll back at all, </connor>
<joey> like you fall down the hill, you fail. </joey>
<joey> And normally like most driving, like things, </joey>
<joey> you might not even have to do this thing </joey>
<joey> when you start from a hill. </joey>
<connor> So I was like shit, because my instructor, </connor>
<connor> the decided to park here, </connor>
<connor> this is where I had to stop. </connor>
<connor> So I was like fuck. </connor>
<connor> So you know, I'm doing it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm nearly fucking, I let go of the break </connor>
<connor> and I'm just not moving, I'm lucky maintaining it. </connor>
<connor> And I slowly start to creep and then fucking lory </connor>
<connor> just go (screaming) and like goes past me, </connor>
<connor> I'm ah, like freaking out. </connor>
<connor> I'm like holding onto the clutch like not letting it go. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't wanna go and I don't wanna fall down. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like sweating and he's like, </connor>
<connor> mate, calm down mate, what you doing? </connor>
<connor> Don't worry about it and I'm like, he's like prop London. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, yeah thanks man I'm real calm now. </connor>
<connor> Luckily I get going, it's really easy, </connor>
<connor> you know and everything's going well, </connor>
<connor> and this guy looks like he's falling asleep. </connor>
<joey> He's literally like this on the window. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, what the fuck. </connor>
<connor> And I did a thing where I thought I failed </connor>
<connor> and I was freaking out, </connor>
<connor> cause I thought I failed halfway through </connor>
<connor> and I go through the end </connor>
<connor> and I passed, I did like one minor mistake. </connor>
<connor> That was all I had. </connor>
<connor> Don't know how. </connor>
<connor> Because on the way to the test, I ran a red light. </connor>
<connor> I did all things wrong and everything went terribly. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, weirdly at the end of it, </connor>
<connor> my instructor came with the guy who was like really weird. </connor>
<connor> He came over and he was like, thought you failed. </connor>
<connor> and I was like, why would you say that? </connor>
<connor> He's like you know how I knew, I thought you failed. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, how? </connor>
<connor> And he's like, you know, when the guy opens the door </connor>
<connor> before he gives the news, it's only a bad sign. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, why would that be a bad sign? </joey>
<joey> Why does that make any sense? </joey>
<joey> I don't understand, so he can run away. </joey>
<joey> - Why is he like tryna like psychoanalyze? </joey>
<garnt> - It sound like a dick head as a fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - He was such a dick bro. </joey>
<garnt> - I got a really nice instructor. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like a proud dad. </garnt>
<joey> He was like, I knew you'd pass. </joey>
<joey> But the thing is the thing- - My dad was my instructor. </joey>
<garnt> - Your dad was you instructor? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because in Australia, when you're on your learners, </garnt>
<connor> you don't have to go to lessons if you don't want. </connor>
<connor> - No, you don't have to in the UK either. </connor>
<connor> It's just like my parents. </connor>
<connor> - So my parents were like, no, that's fucking expensive. </connor>
<connor> You're not gonna lessons. </connor>
<connor> My dad's like, son I'll teach you. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, dad, you are literally </connor>
<joey> the most crazy fucking driver I've known. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because most people, when they drive, </connor>
<joey> they don't drive like how they, 100% should. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. - My parents won't teach me. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause they were like, </connor>
<connor> we're probably not doing something's right ourselves. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, dad, we're in an eighties zone </joey>
<joey> and I'm doing a hundred is this okay? </joey>
<joey> And he was like, and he was like, no, </joey>
<joey> it's like, no, everyone else is doing it. </joey>
<joey> They can't arrest all of us. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) - [Connor] That's true. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, that's fair enough. </joey>
<garnt> - Can I do this in the test? </garnt>
<joey> - No, don't do it in the test, but you'll be right now. </joey>
<connor> - Driving is way more fun when you've passed your test. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you're like, </garnt>
<connor> okay I can kind of like relax. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, oh, this is like, what is like </connor>
<connor> driving stress less. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I actually remember the first time </connor>
<connor> I was like in the seat of a car actually. </connor>
<connor> So in the driver's seat of a car was actually </connor>
<connor> when I was about like, I think like 12 or 13. </connor>
<connor> So like, I remember like there was one day </connor>
<connor> where I think there was like a friend of a cousin </connor>
<connor> who was just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> he was like very rich. </connor>
<connor> So he's they like, their family owned like a lot of land. </connor>
<connor> And so on some of this land that they owned, right. </connor>
<connor> They let their kid drive around a car. </connor>
<connor> It was like a beaten up car. </connor>
<connor> It was a beaten up car. </connor>
<connor> And I remember going to this place once </connor>
<connor> and he was like driving on his field. </connor>
<connor> I was like, dude, this is badass. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, you wanna go? </connor>
<connor> Wanna go? And I was like me, me? </connor>
<connor> 12 Years old driving a car. Am I allowed? </connor>
<joey> - Can you even see out the front? </joey>
<joey> - Am I allowed to do that? Am I allowed to do that? </joey>
<garnt> He was like, yeah, it's private land it's legal. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like- - 12 year old </connor>
<garnt> knew the concept of private land and legal. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, of course Article 1349. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's what his dad told him. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm like I go in the driver's seat </connor>
<connor> and I saw like fucking shitting myself. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm just like I'm in a fucking car. </connor>
<garnt> - Old choice, like a 12 year old driver. </garnt>
<joey> - As a 12 year old in the seat of a car, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter if you're like driving a Jeep </joey>
<joey> or a mini, it's like operating a goundou. </joey>
<joey> It's terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - It is terrifying. </joey>
<connor> So I remember the first fucking thing I did. </connor>
<garnt> And he was just like, oh, just tap the pedal a bit. </garnt>
<connor> As a 12 year old, I dunno what tapped means, right. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm just like, I go, what I think, is like, </connor>
<connor> I thought tapping, it was going 50% of the weight. </connor>
<connor> - You do, you do, you do. </connor>
<joey> - So I'm like, okay, I'm going to tap this. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna put it all the way, just half the way, </joey>
<joey> like immediately - Wheels start spinning. </joey>
<joey> - I put it half the weight </joey>
<connor> and I immediately crash into his gates, right.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Luckily it's like an old wooden gate </connor>
<joey> and it's like in the middle of fucked up nowhere, </joey>
<joey> immediately I smashed into this gate, right. </joey>
<garnt> And I start freaking out and he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> right get outta driver's seat. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Never again. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, I think that put me off driving, </garnt>
<joey> like for like, well obviously I was scared </joey>
<garnt> of the concept of driving from that one experience. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I remember that. </joey>
<joey> Like the first time I ever got into the car seat </joey>
<connor> was probably around that age as well, like 12, 13. </connor>
<connor> When we went camping. </connor>
<connor> And like, you know, </connor>
<connor> because you're in a camping field, right. </connor>
<connor> Not a lot of like, and especially when you're in a </connor>
<connor> big camping field and there's no one else there, </connor>
<connor> it's just a lot of like really empty, flat land. </connor>
<connor> So my dad was like, son, you wanna take it for a spin? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, sure dad, </connor>
<connor> and I get in the seat and in my head I'm like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, this is gonna be easy. </connor>
<connor> There's literally nothing around except one tree. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] No. </connor>
<joey> - But like any, any person will tell you, </joey>
<joey> it's like, just don't go towards the tree. </joey>
<joey> Just go to this entire open area where there is nothing. </joey>
<joey> And in my head I was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> just don't go over to the tree. </joey>
<joey> What do I do immediately go towards the tree. </joey>
<connor> - Did your dad not like pull the wheel? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, he did. - Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> - He was like, son. </connor>
<connor> - Did you hit it? - No, I didn't. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, dude. I wouldn't be alive if I hit the tree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think my dad would kill me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my dad would have hundred percent killed. </connor>
<connor> But like I don't know what it was, </connor>
<joey> it was like in my stupid 12 year old head, </joey>
<joey> the entire time I was like, don't go towards the tree, </joey>
<joey> don't go towards the tree. </joey>
<joey> My hands are like, go towards trees, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a homing missile. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like target locked on. </joey>
<connor> - I actually flipped my friend's quad bike over. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my that's dangerous. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that was dangerous. </joey>
<joey> We were riding quad bikes in like the mud. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, this is the coolest fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> And like, you know, I was like 12 </connor>
<connor> and then he was like don't go too fast though. </connor>
<connor> And I was like a danger kid. </connor>
<connor> I would just like, love going too fast and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> And yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think they also call that an idiot. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I should won a Darwin award back day. </joey>
<connor> And so I'm like fucking this fucking quad bike. </connor>
<connor> I start doing like donuts with this quad bike </connor>
<connor> and then yeah, it just flips over. </connor>
<connor> And I flip in it, but I'm so small that like, </connor>
<joey> I like get down in the arch </joey>
<connor> and like, when I fall to the side, like don't hit my head </connor>
<connor> or anything, just fall over. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause, like, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I think like quad bike accidents, like deaths, </joey>
<connor> are very common. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it wasn't like super fast. </connor>
<joey> It was just me being stupid and turning </joey>
<joey> but fault I just fell off. </joey>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Dumb, dumb, dangerous, dangerous. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Don't do that. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't flip quad bikes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I remember like, I never, </joey>
<joey> like I knew one person in my school </joey>
<garnt> who owned like a quad bike </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like the fucking cool kid, right. </garnt>
<connor> - If you have like farms, everyone, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of people had them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like the only reason </garnt>
<garnt> this guy had a quad bike or this kid had a quad bike </garnt>
<garnt> was because his dad had won the lottery, right. </garnt>
<connor> So he was like. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) why is it when you get too rich </garnt>
<joey> you buy a quad bike. </joey>
<connor> There's no practical use for a quad bike, right. </connor>
<joey> - It's just to have, isn't it. </joey>
<joey> - If you have too much land, you get a quad bike, </joey>
<joey> so you can get around the land. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. So he was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> he was the cool kid because he was the kid </garnt>
<garnt> that owned a quad bike. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, it was like the kid that </garnt>
<joey> like you'd want to be friends </joey>
<joey> because you'd knew like you'd made it </joey>
<joey> when he'd invite you around his house. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, you'd hear stories about how people </joey>
<garnt> went to this kid's house and like I went on a quad bike. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's either that one kid that owns a quad bike </connor>
<connor> or that one kid whose dad works in an IT company </connor>
<joey> and owns every game console ever. </joey>
<joey> Everyone had that one friend. </joey>
<connor> - My friend was both. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh really? Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - His dad was a farmer, so he had all the quad bike </connor>
<connor> and all that stuff. </connor>
<connor> But he also had all the game consoles </connor>
<connor> and I always used to love going. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he had Pokemon call on the game cube. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this is insane. </connor>
<connor> You can, the Pokemon are like three. What, what? </connor>
<connor> So we'd have a day of like quad biking </connor>
<joey> and then his mom would make amazing food </joey>
<joey> and then I'd to play on soon. </joey>
<joey> Yeah and so I just like never wanted to leave his house. </joey>
<joey> And luckily like I slept over to his house, </joey>
<joey> so many god damn times and I loved staying at his house. </joey>
<joey> - I had that one friend too. That was like that. </joey>
<joey> - It was amazing, we had so much fun. </joey>
<connor> I loved going to his house. </connor>
<connor> That was like the best child of memories. </connor>
<connor> Except when I nearly died on that quad back, of course. </connor>
<connor> That was my own fault. </connor>
<joey> That was my own fault. - That's fair enough. </joey>
<joey> - But quad bikes are fun though. </joey>
<garnt> There was really, they're so fun. </garnt>
<connor> They're pretty easy to drive. </connor>
<garnt> - Have I been on one? </garnt>
<connor> I don't think I have been on one actually. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a stable bike. </connor>
<connor> - Until it flips over. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> So like we used to go to like, </joey>
<garnt> you know what I was saying about like the kayaking thing? </garnt>
<garnt> There was another place that was kind of a similar thing, </garnt>
<garnt> had like swimming pool and all that. </garnt>
<garnt> And it also had quad bikes. </garnt>
<garnt> That you were allowed to ride, </garnt>
<connor> but they put like safety pins or something in it. </connor>
<connor> That limited the speed. </connor>
<connor> So you couldn't go above a certain speed </connor>
<connor> and it was painfully slow. </connor>
<connor> And one of the kids who owned the quad bike </connor>
<connor> knew how to remove it. </connor>
<connor> And then we were all doing laps, right. </connor>
<connor> Going really slow on these bikes </connor>
<connor> suddenly is this one kid's turn. </connor>
<connor> And the teachers like looked away for a second </connor>
<connor> and they go back, this kid's going like </connor>
<connor> fucking tearing up all the like dirt, </connor>
<connor> flinging it at all the teachers and stuff, </connor>
<connor> like absolutely tearing up the track </connor>
<connor> and they couldn't stop him. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he's going too fast. </connor>
<connor> Like you couldn't like get in the way. </connor>
<joey> And so he is going super fast </joey>
<joey> to get to the ball king of his life. </joey>
<connor> But it was so funny just watching him like </connor>
<connor> destroy this like gland that had been finally made. </connor>
<garnt> He was like tearing up the mud and shit. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Destroy it all. - So funny. </connor>
<connor> - Do you guys have any experiences </connor>
<garnt> with motorbikes or anything like that? </garnt>
<connor> - No. I wish I'd love to drive a motorbike. </connor>
<joey> - I've been on the back of a motorbike many times, </joey>
<joey> but it's scary. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna learn how to ride one. </joey>
<joey> - I've thought about it. </joey>
<connor> But then I've also heard of every single person </connor>
<connor> I've ever known who used to ride a motorbike </connor>
<connor> is it's all past tense. </connor>
<connor> They used to ride a motorbike </connor>
<connor> because most of the time they get in horrible accidents. </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna ride one. I just wanna know how to drive one. </connor>
<connor> What if I'm like, I just need to ride a motorcycle one day. </connor>
<joey> - I was tempted to get like in Japan, </joey>
<joey> like getting like a motorbike license. </joey>
<connor> Because apparently you can get it in like one day. </connor>
<connor> It's like super easy. </connor>
<connor> You just have to do like a test </connor>
<joey> and if you pay like 60 bucks or something. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey and Connor] 60, 60, 60, 60. </joey>
<joey> - You pay like 60 bucks for a test </joey>
<joey> and then you can just get it in like a couple of hours. </joey>
<connor> They just have to buy a motorbike. </connor>
<connor> - If you like James Bond, chase, </connor>
<joey> you need to drive a motorcycle. you know. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna drive a moped. (indistinct chattering) </joey>
<garnt> - Stop you immediately like Joey where you going man? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause like if you go to Thailand, </connor>
<connor> you are probably going to have to ride a motorcycle. </connor>
<connor> And when I say motorcycle, it's not like a Harley Davidson </connor>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<joey> It's the Southeast Asian like kind of like Moped motorcycles </joey>
<joey> where it's like, - [Joey] like a scooter right? </joey>
<connor> - Like a scooter. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I thought motocross is really cool as well right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like that kind of bike, I guess. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but like I've been on enough fucking crazy ass </connor>
<connor> fucking Moped motorbike taxi drivers. </connor>
<connor> That is just put me off from ever wanting to learn </connor>
<connor> a motorbike. </connor>
<connor> And like the one time that I tried learning </connor>
<connor> how to ride a motorbike, which was one of these bikes, </connor>
<connor> mind you. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, of course it was in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> And like, I remember like, if you want to get around, </connor>
<connor> but not want to own a car, </connor>
<connor> then you'd learn to drive a motorcycle. </connor>
<connor> That's the cheap way to go about it. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's why in top gear </connor>
<connor> and the Vietnam special, they didn't have cars. </connor>
<connor> They had motorbikes, right. </connor>
<connor> - Do they get stolen a lot? - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - Do they get stolen a lot? </connor>
<connor> - I assume I've never owned one. So I would assume so. </connor>
<joey> - Probably. </joey>
<joey> - But like I remember like the only time </joey>
<joey> I've tried to learn how to ride one </joey>
<joey> I've had like enough scary experience with motorbikes </joey>
<joey> that I've just never wanted to learn how to ride one. </joey>
<joey> And I remember when my dad was just like, </joey>
<connor> come on, son you gotta learn how to drive one, </connor>
<connor> come on we're in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> You gotta learn how to drive one eventually. </connor>
<connor> And I remember he like builds this ideal up, </connor>
<connor> my entire family, like build this idea up </connor>
<connor> of me having to like, at least give it a try </connor>
<connor> of how to learn, how to ride a motorbike. </connor>
<joey> And I remember this one time I was like, okay, fine. </joey>
<joey> I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try. </joey>
<joey> It's just like riding a bike, right. </joey>
<joey> Just like riding a bike. </joey>
<connor> And it was like a one for one recreation </connor>
<joey> of like my car experience, right. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember my dad after building up </joey>
<joey> all this courage, we have like my cousin's motor bike </joey>
<garnt> that I could try out and just start learning with. </garnt>
<garnt> And my dad like brings me over to the bike </garnt>
<garnt> and goes, okay, just sit on this bike, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And what you need to do. Just try- </garnt>
<connor> - Your dad like give you that much confidence. </connor>
<connor> He's like stuck you on it. </connor>
<garnt> - He stuck me on it and he's just like, </garnt>
<connor> just twisted a bit, just twist it a bit. </connor>
<connor> Just give it a bit of a rev </connor>
<connor> and me like a one for one thinking </connor>
<garnt> a little bit of a twist is 50%. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Garnt, you can't like do this. </connor>
<connor> You can only do like 50%. </connor>
<garnt> - And so 50% means 180 degrees. </garnt>
<joey> - So I go like, okay, I'll give a little twist. </joey>
<joey> 50% power. </joey>
<joey> Like that immediately rev forward. </joey>
<joey> I immediately fall down </joey>
<garnt> and like, the motorbike falls down on me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, alright, no, I'm never getting on one again. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just reminded of all those videos </joey>
<joey> of like where they, thank you. </joey>
<connor> Where they like rev the motorbikes </connor>
<connor> and then motorbike comes over them. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, I really wanna learn, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, like a lot of dangerous vehicles. </joey>
<joey> I'd love to learn how to drive. </joey>
<joey> I really wanna learn how to drive a speedboat. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, I've never even been in a, </joey>
<connor> like a speedboat. </connor>
<joey> - I've been in a speedboat and it's terrifying. </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna learn how to drive one, that look so fun. </connor>
<joey> - Because in Australia or at least in Sydney, </joey>
<connor> we used to have like, </connor>
<connor> we had like a fairy service </connor>
<connor> because we were like in a bay. </connor>
<connor> But you'd also get, what's called a water cat, </connor>
<joey> which is basically think of like, </joey>
<connor> it's a taxi. - I think I know. </connor>
<joey> - Like a water taxi, but it's instead of a taxi </joey>
<connor> it's speedboat. - I think I know the one. </connor>
<connor> - And you get on boat, dude those things are fucking scary. </connor>
<joey> - They look so fun. - They're so fast. </joey>
<connor> - Like, I wanna ride a jet ski. </connor>
<joey> I've never rid jet ski in my life. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna ride a jet ski. I've heard jet skis are fun. </joey>
<joey> - That's like the college fra boy ass hole. </joey>
<garnt> I just wanna ride one. It looks so fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's do it in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> It's very, very easy to get jet skis in Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember I sure a sheet that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like accidents by race or something. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like 100% of accident, like some part of the U.S </garnt>
<connor> was like all white people or something. </connor>
<connor> And it was for jet ski. </connor>
<joey> 100% of jet ski accidents for white people. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yeah, that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That checks out. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the second was like skiing or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh yeah. - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] What's third golf? </joey>
<connor> - I've always wanted to try surfing. </connor>
<garnt> Surfing was one thing I've always wanted to try. </garnt>
<joey> - I've done surfing and- - It seems hard. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course you're Australian, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought I would enjoy it, but I weirdly didn't. </joey>
<connor> - It seems really hard. </connor>
<connor> - It's really, really hard. </connor>
<connor> It's not even so much about like, </connor>
<joey> you know, it's not like snowboarding </joey>
<joey> where like the biggest obstacle is your being scared </joey>
<joey> to just like go fast or whatever. </joey>
<joey> It's literally just like, </joey>
<joey> it's the act of standing up from a really like </joey>
<joey> rickety, like where the floor isn't still right. </joey>
<joey> And you do that a couple of times </joey>
<connor> and you can't even like, get on your knees </connor>
<connor> and then you fucking fall over </connor>
<connor> and then you just snap. </connor>
<connor> You're like, fuck it. I can't do it. </connor>
<connor> Because like the one time you can actually like stand up. </connor>
<garnt> It's actually pretty easy to control. </garnt>
<garnt> Because just think of it like snowboarding board </garnt>
<connor> with less friction. </connor>
<connor> So it's pretty easy to do. </connor>
<connor> It's the standing up part, </connor>
<connor> that's like fucking impossible for me. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> And then when you flip in a surfboard, it hurts. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah I can imagine. </connor>
<connor> - Because the one I'm always afraid of is like, </connor>
<connor> what if I flip off and then the board just smacks on. </connor>
<connor> Like I've seen that happen to people </connor>
<joey> and it looks like it really fucking hurts. </joey>
<garnt> - Seeing them ride that wave is just so fucking cool. </garnt>
<garnt> I really wanna do it again I've never had the opportunity. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never had the opportunity. </connor>
<connor> Like, cause we live in the England, </connor>
