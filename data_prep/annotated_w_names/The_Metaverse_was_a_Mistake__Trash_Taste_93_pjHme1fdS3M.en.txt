<joey> around one though that's your life </joey>
<connor> insurance no uh does your life insurance </connor>
<connor> cost go up if you own like a venomous </connor>
<joey> spider or a snake you might have to give </joey>
<joey> maybe like double vaccination you know </joey>
<connor> like double </connor>
<connor> like double life insurance </connor>
<joey> it's like can i can i like double what </joey>
<joey> i'm sure </joey>
<garnt> like the delta strain of like the cobra </garnt>
<joey> wouldn't it be so cool if like and like </joey>
<joey> you know uh anti-venom just like work </joey>
<joey> like that or you know antidotes for </joey>
<joey> venomous poison it just works like yeah </joey>
<joey> let me see </joey>
<joey> can i get the cobra </joey>
<joey> even if you did you wouldn't get it </joey>
<joey> because like why would you why would any </joey>
<joey> normal person need like 100 different </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] snake </joey>
<joey> uh infection venom i don't [ __ ] know </joey>
<joey> what are we doing we're not [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> killer from hunter hunter well you know </joey>
<joey> poison training no but like what if </joey>
<joey> you're like going to like a specific </joey>
<joey> like area of the world that has like </joey>
<connor> yeah they do it's like if you go to like </connor>
<connor> uh certain places that have like really </connor>
<connor> bad uh mosquitoes or something yeah you </connor>
<joey> get like right now </joey>
<connor> so why so why not like people who say </connor>
<connor> like you know decide like oh i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> go to the australian outback be like all </connor>
<connor> right just give me like i don't think </connor>
<joey> it's that much of a concern well yeah i </joey>
<joey> feel like i think i feel like you've </joey>
<joey> seen you hear about people dying i feel </joey>
<joey> like you have more chance of getting hit </joey>
<connor> in like by a car in the airport than you </connor>
<connor> do from getting so i feel like we should </connor>
<joey> ban cars before we sydney airport </joey>
<garnt> that place is a [ __ ] mess it feels </garnt>
<joey> like the dumbest superpower anyone could </joey>
<joey> hope for yeah </joey>
<joey> it's just like that one guy in like </joey>
<joey> mayhew academy who has quirks against </joey>
<joey> like every anti-venom and he's only </joey>
<garnt> useful in australia like everywhere and </garnt>
<garnt> else in the world he's just useless he's </garnt>
<joey> like born in the uk he's like what [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i can't use this at </joey>
<joey> though it just takes all [ __ ] long </joey>
<garnt> time yeah exactly yeah yeah i mean you </garnt>
<garnt> can like you can build up some </garnt>
<garnt> resistances to like some venoms i don't </garnt>
<connor> know how much you can build up </connor>
<connor> resistance because i don't know if </connor>
<joey> there's been any studies of like anyone </joey>
<joey> who's like tried to build up enough </joey>
<garnt> resistance like take on like a back </garnt>
<garnt> black cobra or something like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but i don't think you'd need to yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like alcohol isn't it you just get </garnt>
<connor> more used to it </connor>
<garnt> but it's it's like that's uh </garnt>
<joey> the more you get bitten the more </joey>
<connor> resistant </connor>
<connor> i assume if there is like uh something </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> makes i don't know like there's those </connor>
<joey> ants or something that like make you </joey>
<joey> really in pain maybe if you just like </joey>
<joey> what aunt specific like </joey>
<joey> like like the bullet what if you got </joey>
<garnt> bitten by one every single day surely </garnt>
<joey> after a while is you wouldn't phase you </joey>
<connor> after like ten years maybe she wants to </connor>
<garnt> try this </garnt>
<garnt> well no because like i'm experimenting </garnt>
<joey> well we want to be bitten by [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> every day for the next day isn't there </joey>
<garnt> that tribe that is like revolved around </garnt>
<garnt> putting a glove of bullet hands on your </garnt>
<connor> i'm pretty sure it's like a </connor>
<connor> thing that they do during ceremonies </connor>
<joey> it's like to initiate like a kid into ch </joey>
<connor> adulthood </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah but like from what i can </garnt>
<connor> understand like the people in the tribe </connor>
<connor> are more resistant to that venom than </connor>
<connor> other people who have tried it oh yeah </connor>
<joey> obviously yeah so i mean i don't know </joey>
<joey> why they like who who decided that </joey>
<garnt> who decided that they would do that as a </garnt>
<garnt> ceremony you know what let's just get a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of [ __ ] answers thing you yeah </garnt>
<joey> you're a man now i want to hear like the </joey>
<joey> the council meeting of like when they </joey>
<joey> decided that they were like all right so </joey>
<joey> so jim's just turned 18 you know he's </joey>
<joey> he's been he's ready to bear children </joey>
<joey> he's ready to be a dad um yeah but we </joey>
<joey> need like a ceremonious thing some guy's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> maybe just share a beer with him it's </joey>
<joey> like yeah that's kind of like what if we </joey>
<joey> though </joey>
<joey> hear me out </joey>
<joey> put his hands </joey>
<connor> into a fire ant nest </connor>
<connor> genius i probably gets it i'm i </connor>
<joey> understand why i mean you know i'm not </joey>
<connor> here to be like wow </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<joey> the only difference is that we just </joey>
<garnt> agree you talk about like astrology yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah i'm joking </joey>
<garnt> you're like oh i'm gonna get married </garnt>
<connor> tomorrow apparently yeah oh </connor>
<garnt> i thought i thought i was just like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think angry is a star no no no you </garnt>
<connor> could be angry right from the start </connor>
<joey> i gotta put the [ __ ] snake glove on </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like i you know they probably </joey>
<joey> thought that it had some meaning and it </joey>
<connor> and it probably carries some value of </connor>
<joey> course like i'm sure right here's the </joey>
<joey> thing we know that like jumping in a </joey>
<connor> cold </connor>
<joey> bath or something is good for you yeah </joey>
<joey> we know that because of science like </joey>
<joey> showers but before if there was no </joey>
<joey> science backing this up and you were </joey>
<joey> like connor jump in the math for some </joey>
<connor> for health reasons i'm like [ __ ] off i'm </connor>
<connor> not jumping on a cold back why would i </connor>
<connor> jump in a cold bear i'm not doing that </connor>
<joey> it's stupid i mean why would that help </joey>
<joey> me i wouldn't do it even if i knew those </joey>
<joey> whole threesomes but like it's like you </joey>
<joey> know now that there is right and so i </joey>
<joey> can understand why maybe these people </joey>
<joey> have this notion that like i'm sure </joey>
<joey> there might even be health benefits to </joey>
<garnt> getting bitten by our heads i don't know </garnt>
<connor> maybe there is we haven't we just </connor>
<garnt> haven't researched it there's so many </garnt>
<garnt> things that haven't been researched we </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i don't i don't think this is </garnt>
<connor> worth researching personally what if i </connor>
<connor> told you that like if you like you know </connor>
<connor> uh inflated your uh your big toe once a </connor>
<joey> year would help with curing alzheimer's </joey>
<joey> you're probably like well [ __ ] i'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna do that but thanks </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean there's so many </joey>
<joey> things that can help ex disease or help </joey>
<joey> stop things right </joey>
<joey> i'm just not going to do that well like </joey>
<joey> when they're like that one paper came </joey>
<joey> out that one time that was like research </joey>
<joey> suggests eating no more than five french </joey>
<joey> fries at a time to lower the risk of </joey>
<joey> cancer it's like let's be honest i'm </joey>
<joey> never gonna eat less than five french </joey>
<connor> fries that's just impractical i'm just </connor>
<garnt> not gonna </garnt>
<joey> i think like at the end of the day </joey>
<connor> people just don't care </connor>
<joey> like if they couldn't convince smokers </joey>
<joey> to stop smoking by like actual </joey>
<joey> scientific research that proved that it </joey>
<joey> heavily increases your chance to get </joey>
<joey> cancer the more you smoke you know if if </joey>
<joey> they couldn't convince humanity to stop </joey>
<joey> smoking after that then </joey>
<joey> then what would like five french fries </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> five like eating less than five french </garnt>
<joey> fries because like the moment you're </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah you should probably stop </joey>
<joey> smoking because you know it could give </joey>
<joey> you every type of lung cancer or you </joey>
<joey> know just cancer in general there's just </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> a cool life i think that's it but as </connor>
<connor> humans like we're so [ __ ] at uh </connor>
<joey> recognizing </joey>
<joey> long-term effects and by long-term in </joey>
<joey> like more than like a week yeah like </joey>
<joey> something in fact we just don't think </joey>
<joey> it'll affect us yeah because it's like </joey>
<joey> oh it's a week away anything could </joey>
<joey> happen </joey>
<connor> tomorrow we just we just ignore the fact </connor>
<connor> that bad stuff can happen to us by doing </connor>
<joey> it yeah but yet isn't it so weird that </joey>
<joey> there's such like a a disposition </joey>
<joey> between people who are like that where </joey>
<joey> they're like oh it's happening in like </joey>
<joey> three days from now that's basically </joey>
<joey> never going to happen to people who you </joey>
<joey> know say believe in things like </joey>
<joey> astrology where they're like oh in 73 in </joey>
<joey> years and four days time i'm going to </joey>
<joey> get hit by a car well [ __ ] i better stop </joey>
<joey> preparing </joey>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<joey> you know like those kinds of like space </joey>
<garnt> like systems right like you know not to </garnt>
<garnt> like you know not to throw anyone's </garnt>
<garnt> belief system under the bus you can </garnt>
<joey> believe whatever the [ __ ] you want right </joey>
<joey> but like that was one thing i always had </joey>
<joey> trouble </joey>
<joey> you know coming to terms with with that </joey>
<joey> kind of stuff right where it's like it's </joey>
<joey> so up in the air that it really and it's </joey>
<joey> not backed up by science in any way as </joey>
<joey> of right now that it's like </joey>
<joey> you know how why would you even think </joey>
<joey> about something like that whereas like </joey>
<joey> with smoking for example it's like </joey>
<joey> well yeah um </joey>
<joey> i had like seven of my [ __ ] grant you </joey>
<joey> know friends granddads died because of </joey>
<joey> lung cancer probably due to smoking so </joey>
<joey> you should you know if that doesn't </joey>
<joey> convince you </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i guess i guess it comes </garnt>
<joey> down to the point where like it's it's </joey>
<joey> like even now science </joey>
<joey> as sad as it is science in the </joey>
<garnt> in this day and age isn't always like </garnt>
<garnt> the determining factor over whether </garnt>
<garnt> people listen to uh listen to what </garnt>
<garnt> science says or not because nowadays </garnt>
<joey> it's because science is the government </joey>
<joey> dude and you don't want to trust the </joey>
<garnt> government well i think science the </garnt>
<garnt> problem is with science and you know the </garnt>
<garnt> this age of like misinformation and just </garnt>
<garnt> not knowing what one is one is a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> misinformation out there not knowing </garnt>
<garnt> which sources to trust and number two </garnt>
<garnt> science has just got so advanced that </garnt>
<garnt> the normal person isn't going to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to follow along with what science says </garnt>
<joey> because the logic is so past what a </joey>
<joey> normal person would be able to </joey>
<joey> understand that you might as well be </joey>
<joey> talking about god or [ __ ] or [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> stars in the sky because like you know </joey>
<joey> how am i gonna understand what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> scientists are researching when it comes </joey>
<joey> to like making mini black holes in the </joey>
<joey> cern like institute or whatever like and </joey>
<joey> they're like [ __ ] firing protons at </joey>
<joey> each other like yeah the [ __ ] do i know </joey>
<joey> about that yeah you know you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean that's that's so fuc they're so far </joey>
<joey> beyond my knowledge of understanding </joey>
<joey> just sounds like science fiction it </joey>
<connor> literally sounds like science fiction </connor>
<connor> unfortunately we're a sucker for a good </connor>
<connor> answer and an easy solution yeah so </connor>
<joey> especially when like you know the top </joey>
<joey> researchers and scientists in the world </joey>
<joey> are like you know when explaining like </joey>
<joey> how does gravity work and they're just </joey>
<joey> like we don't know then they're like ha </joey>
<joey> i told you must be jesus yeah you know </joey>
<joey> like just like because we hate it when </joey>
<joey> we don't know something </joey>
<joey> like no matter how significant or </joey>
<joey> insignificant it is and so when </joey>
<joey> immediately when we're thrown into that </joey>
<joey> kind of situation humans are just very </joey>
<joey> good to being like well it's magic </joey>
<joey> must be magic a lot of times we just </joey>
<connor> garner towards what feels right or what </connor>
<connor> we want to believe you know it's like we </connor>
<connor> like to believe that we're all like </connor>
<connor> unbiased robots who only go with pure </connor>
<connor> facts and logic but a lot of the times </connor>
<connor> we are very biased towards our beliefs </connor>
<garnt> and it takes </garnt>
<garnt> i guess i guess it takes a lot more </garnt>
<garnt> effort to unbelieve and unlearn </garnt>
<garnt> something than it is to just you know </garnt>
<garnt> than it is to </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> learn something fresh or just like build </garnt>
<joey> up your beliefs fresh well i'm sure that </joey>
<joey> happens in like between scientists as </joey>
<joey> well right like as much as you think </joey>
<joey> scientists are just like purely like </joey>
<joey> facts and logic based only no emotion </joey>
<joey> thrown into whatsoever i'm sure you know </joey>
<joey> there's been instances where like a </joey>
<joey> scientist or you know let's say like a </joey>
<joey> physicist like comes up and be like all </joey>
<joey> right i've got this new theory yeah </joey>
<joey> about how the universe was created what </joey>
<joey> do you think here's here's a bunch of </joey>
<joey> theoretical things that you know we've </joey>
<joey> been researching all that kind of stuff </joey>
<joey> i'm sure there's been a couple of </joey>
<joey> scientists who are like </joey>
<joey> no yeah that sounds dumb as [ __ ] because </joey>
<connor> i don't like you yeah </connor>
<joey> that happens a lot right and you know a </joey>
<joey> lot of scientists are also religious a </joey>
<joey> lot of them you know because there's a </joey>
<joey> lot of </joey>
<joey> we don't know </joey>
<joey> a lot of things and also science isn't </joey>
<joey> about </joey>
<joey> um having concrete answers it's about </joey>
<joey> attempting and trying everything and </joey>
<joey> then proving that there's no other way </joey>
<joey> yeah it could be anything else right i </joey>
<joey> think that's the problem is that a lot </joey>
<joey> of people have this rigid view of </joey>
<joey> science is like it can only be </joey>
<joey> science is a hundred percent right all </joey>
<joey> the time and it's not we're just </joey>
<joey> eliminating things that we know for sure </joey>
<joey> it isn't yeah yeah and so a lot of the </joey>
<joey> time when theories are uh presented or </joey>
<joey> hypotheses or whatever you know we have </joey>
<joey> so so many examples of history being </joey>
<joey> incorrect and yeah we fix it when we </joey>
<joey> realize it and the problem is is that </joey>
<joey> a lot of the time </joey>
<joey> that kind of gets galvanized into being </joey>
<joey> like all right well look science is </joey>
<joey> wrong sometimes i get it wrong and it's </joey>
<joey> like no we never science is never ever </joey>
<connor> presented to know everything it's we're </connor>
<garnt> building the most it's the most accurate </garnt>
<connor> representation that we have at this </connor>
<garnt> current time we're building up a library </garnt>
<joey> of what we think i think i think like </joey>
<joey> tim mentioned said it the best way he </joey>
<joey> said like science adjusts its views </joey>
<joey> based on what's observed yeah and faith </joey>
<joey> is the denial of observation so that </joey>
<joey> belief can be preserved yeah and i'm </joey>
<joey> like that's pretty much it because it's </joey>
<joey> like science as you said like science </joey>
<joey> changes all the [ __ ] time because we </joey>
<joey> don't know everything in the world right </joey>
<joey> so it's like so we have to kind of make </joey>
<joey> compromises for what we now know which </joey>
<joey> could completely change what you know </joey>
<joey> like say like 500 years ago when people </joey>
<joey> legitimately believed that like the sun </joey>
<joey> rotates around the earth and not the </joey>
<joey> other way around and then when they </joey>
<joey> discovered that they were like well [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> all these sites what have all these </joey>
<joey> science has been doing for the past 500 </joey>
<connor> years wasting our time the problem is </connor>
<connor> that we're really bad as like humans of </connor>
<joey> understanding </joey>
<joey> stuff we don't know yeah uh you know </joey>
<joey> because if you'd have back then it would </joey>
<garnt> make total sense that we the sun </garnt>
<joey> revolves around ours because it looks </joey>
<joey> like it does and yeah we </joey>
<joey> don't have any other way of even </joey>
<joey> remotely comprehending that it couldn't </joey>
<joey> revolve around us </joey>
<joey> but once you find out it's like oh well </joey>
<joey> of course of course of course we revolve </joey>
<joey> around it yeah that makes so much sense </joey>
<joey> yeah so it's really easy to </joey>
<connor> believe in the the thing that you your </connor>
<connor> makes sense that makes most like logical </connor>
<garnt> sense in your brain because like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like i said like i said before like </garnt>
<garnt> science now has got to a point where a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of the more advanced concepts uh </garnt>
<garnt> where the normal person is not going to </garnt>
<garnt> be able to comprehend and so at that </garnt>
<garnt> point you're going to have your just </garnt>
<garnt> putting your faith in a person of </garnt>
<garnt> authority that their understanding is </garnt>
<garnt> good enough that they can you know take </garnt>
<garnt> what these studies say and present that </garnt>
<garnt> in a manner which you can understand but </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the day you're still </garnt>
<garnt> putting a trust your trust into </garnt>
<garnt> something that you don't fully </garnt>
<garnt> understand yourself </garnt>
<garnt> which uh i mean getting back to the </garnt>
<garnt> getting back to like the habits and the </garnt>
<garnt> things you uh believed even if you know </garnt>
<garnt> science is like disproved there like do </garnt>
<garnt> you guys have like any like wives tales </garnt>
<garnt> or like anything that any habits that </garnt>
<garnt> was formed from basically at a childhood </garnt>
<garnt> age where like your parents said </garnt>
<garnt> something oh yeah and you like you you </garnt>
<garnt> did it as a kid because you your mum or </garnt>
<joey> dad said so dude dude i have a japanese </joey>
<joey> grandma they are nothing but wife </joey>
<garnt> like okay so like to this day like </garnt>
<connor> whenever i get ill right </connor>
<connor> i eat a [ __ ] ton of oranges right like i </connor>
<connor> eat like a pack of oranges oranges </connor>
<connor> and like because because when i was </connor>
<connor> young um my mom said oh vitamin c is </connor>
<connor> good for the immune system uh when it's </connor>
<connor> comfortable i don't know where that came </connor>
<connor> from i'm pretty sure there is some </connor>
<garnt> science back to it but like i think i've </garnt>
<garnt> read into it once and yes vitamin c does </garnt>
<garnt> improve the immune system but that's </garnt>
<garnt> like one i believe okay this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> all my memory so you know feel please </garnt>
<garnt> fact check this </garnt>
<joey> it also might have just been god's </joey>
<garnt> health it might it might have just been </garnt>
<garnt> my my household but one i believe that's </garnt>
<garnt> to like </garnt>
<garnt> like prevent illness so it like boosts </garnt>
<garnt> your immune system so it's more a more </garnt>
<joey> healthy immune system and two there's </joey>
<joey> only so much </joey>
<joey> vitamin c intake you can uh you can you </joey>
<joey> can do to really have a big effect on </joey>
<joey> your immune system so but like that </joey>
<joey> doesn't matter in my mind because in my </joey>
<joey> mind i'm like i've been conditioned to </joey>
<joey> think i am ill i need to eat a [ __ ] ton </joey>
<garnt> of oranges to in take this vitamin c </garnt>
<garnt> to have these [ __ ] basically just </garnt>
<garnt> like a pavlovian i think yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> right right it's like it coughs once </joey>
<connor> where are the oranges </connor>
<joey> that's so weird because in my house it </joey>
<connor> was if you were starting to get sick or </connor>
<connor> you were sick my mom and my granddad my </connor>
<joey> grandma especially my grandma would make </joey>
<joey> me eat a shitload of ginger and spring </joey>
<joey> onion </joey>
<joey> i don't know why </joey>
<joey> um it just it just seems like a healthy </joey>
<joey> alternative but yeah it's just one of </joey>
<joey> those things where it has that taste to </joey>
<garnt> it that you're like this has to be </garnt>
<garnt> helpful </garnt>
<connor> i don't know why but this has to be </connor>
<joey> because it's causation </joey>
<joey> it's because it tastes like medicine </joey>
<joey> yeah like it tastes like medicine before </joey>
<joey> even like being put in a dish you know </joey>
<joey> yeah another one i had a lot was uh like </joey>
<garnt> if i got like a cut on like my knee or </garnt>
<garnt> something yeah uh then you'd uh my </garnt>
<connor> grandma would tell me to put wasabi on </connor>
<connor> it what what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that's a very famous japanese one though </connor>
<connor> a lot of a lot of uh what that's a very </connor>
<connor> famous where did that come from i don't </connor>
<joey> know maybe it's because like you know </joey>
<connor> when you put like an antiseptic on right </connor>
<joey> and it starts to sting yeah but that </joey>
<connor> means it's like killing the bacteria </connor>
<joey> right so someone probably thought well </joey>
<joey> wasabi does that regularly is that where </joey>
<connor> the stinging kind of thing i think the </connor>
<joey> singing is part of killing bacteria i </joey>
<joey> think she's like no </joey>
<joey> i don't know if that's even a lifestyle </joey>
<connor> either but like i did i did like when i </connor>
<joey> was little like you know i i was running </joey>
<joey> around in the park and then i [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> slid and scratched my knee and you know </joey>
<connor> it was fine until i got home and my </connor>
<connor> grandma grandmother was like oh [ __ ] we </connor>
<joey> gotta patch you up dog so then she went </joey>
<joey> into the kitchen and i was like uh the </joey>
<joey> bandages are over here she's like no no </joey>
<joey> no i got this </joey>
<joey> pulls out a [ __ ] chewable wasabi and </joey>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<joey> grandmother what are you doing oh no no </joey>
<joey> no no no and she's like all right just </joey>
<joey> just hold still </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] pulls you know squirt someone to </joey>
<joey> a finger and just starts like rubbing my </joey>
<joey> knee oh and uh </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] hurts </joey>
<joey> no [ __ ] like a lot and uh </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> i wouldn't exactly say it worked um if </joey>
<garnt> anything it just added an extra step of </garnt>
<garnt> oh now it hurts and i have to shower </garnt>
<garnt> and it burns now and it burns my my </garnt>
<connor> regular skin that's not affected by the </connor>
<connor> cut </connor>
<connor> yeah so that was the moment i was like </connor>
<connor> grandma you should probably like you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> read up on like some you know basic </joey>
<garnt> first aid i'm just wondering where that </garnt>
<joey> started from because like i can imagine </joey>
<joey> it's something similar to like putting </joey>
<joey> salt on a wound right which is you know </joey>
<joey> it's uh it sterilizes the wounds uh </joey>
<joey> as well as it could as well as it could </joey>
<connor> do does it i thought it was just painful </connor>
<garnt> no it does i think we google this i </garnt>
<joey> don't know by the </joey>
<joey> way somewhat anti-bacterial okay yeah </joey>
<connor> but if i pissed on your leg it'd be </connor>
<connor> somewhat hand-tied back to you the </connor>
<connor> problem is that this is the problem when </connor>
<joey> you when when these things get some form </joey>
<joey> of like it's like yeah you're one </joey>
<garnt> percent right one percent right </garnt>
<joey> right i heard right i heard right i </joey>
<joey> better add that to my five-minute daily </joey>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah is is salt uh like a like a kind of </garnt>
<joey> like an anticipated supposedly it </joey>
<connor> creates conditions that make it </connor>
<joey> difficult for bacteria to grow </joey>
<garnt> supposedly written by the same person </garnt>
<connor> you did that because you want to like </connor>
<connor> be painful like you would torture </connor>
<connor> someone what </connor>
<joey> what do you mean well you think it's </joey>
<joey> like people in the painting that's why </joey>
<connor> we say salt on the wound because it's </connor>
<garnt> like all right let's say i [ __ ] you </garnt>
<connor> over to put salt in the wound i'll do it </connor>
<garnt> to [ __ ] someone over it it is painful </garnt>
<connor> but i'm pretty sure where do they </connor>
<connor> originate from salt on the wound can you </connor>
<garnt> google this i'm pretty sure it's not </garnt>
<connor> meant it's not medical already it's like </connor>
<garnt> it's to add more pain to it i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> think it came from like salt is like a </garnt>
<garnt> preserver right so it kind of makes it </garnt>
<garnt> hard for bacteria to grow it preserves </garnt>
<connor> the wound </connor>
<connor> this is complete [ __ ] you're making </connor>
<garnt> this up now okay actually i don't know </garnt>
<joey> where i know this from [ __ ] the idiom </joey>
<joey> means what you </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> is is it so </garnt>
<garnt> does putting salt in a wound make it </garnt>
<garnt> worse at all does it do anything doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> make it hurt more yeah i know that i </garnt>
<garnt> know that </garnt>
<joey> i know that more but it's also like you </joey>
<garnt> know it makes it difficult with bacteria </garnt>
<garnt> because it does that yeah it makes it </garnt>
<connor> difficult it's so vague though that's </connor>
<connor> like there's a different scene of </connor>
<joey> treatment and something yeah just put </joey>
<joey> some antiseptic on it sure if i cut my </joey>
<connor> leg off it'd be harder for me to walk </connor>
<joey> like i'm you know it's put some just put </joey>
<joey> some salt </joey>
<garnt> that's why like you wash wounds with </garnt>
<joey> like saline solution as well yeah you </joey>
<joey> don't do it with salt </joey>
<joey> yeah but sailing solution is salt water </joey>
<connor> yeah it's salt water that's if you don't </connor>
<connor> put like you're not putting on those </connor>
<connor> like the [ __ ] rocks rubbing it in </connor>
<garnt> there we're done </garnt>
<connor> that's not what i said </connor>
<connor> the saying isn't put saline on them </connor>
<joey> if i'm like lost in the wilderness or </joey>
<connor> something and i'm like fight like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] miles away from </joey>
<connor> some rocks yeah just just like just like </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<connor> now </connor>
<garnt> and just like just </garnt>
<joey> sprinkle it on sprinkle japan japan </joey>
<joey> though is full of so many of those kinds </joey>
<connor> of idioms taking medical advice from </connor>
<connor> idioms oh no no no </connor>
<garnt> but like there's a lot of like idioms </garnt>
<garnt> like that especially in japan where it's </garnt>
<garnt> like you know one of them that my </garnt>
<garnt> grandma used to tell me all the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> time was like don't whistle at night </joey>
<joey> because snakes will come yeah and it </joey>
<joey> wasn't until a couple years later i </joey>
<joey> found out snakes are deaf so </joey>
<connor> yeah and then i started whistling like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] during the night time you </connor>
<connor> know so it's like where do they come </connor>
<connor> from i don't know it's like uh yeah like </connor>
<connor> i said step on the crack break your </connor>
<joey> break your mother's back why okay i i </joey>
<joey> and as a kid i even i i was when i'd </joey>
<joey> heard this i was like no </joey>
<joey> that doesn't make any sense how fragile </joey>
<garnt> is my mother's dark i was like i've </garnt>
<garnt> stepped on many cracks </garnt>
<connor> intentionally after hearing this to test </connor>
<connor> the theory out um would am i a bad </connor>
<joey> person probably if you go home you're </joey>
<connor> most like riding on the ground oh no no </connor>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> everyone has collectively stepped on a </joey>
<joey> crack at some point isn't the earth just </joey>
<connor> one big crack that's it's just it's all </connor>
<connor> one big tectonic plate also what old </connor>
<joey> japan is a crown also what defines as a </joey>
<connor> crack like if i were to step on an ass </connor>
<connor> crack would i still break my mother's </connor>
<joey> back off </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty sure </joey>
<connor> for a second </connor>
<joey> how how amazing how this uh you know </joey>
<joey> scientific fact actually just rhymes as </joey>
<joey> well yeah wow </joey>
<joey> also uh but other stuff that i don't </joey>
<garnt> really believe in anything like that and </garnt>
<garnt> even as a kid i remember that whenever i </garnt>
<garnt> heard these i was like no that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> sound right why what like a cat crossing </garnt>
<joey> under an uh going under a ladder oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> or a black cat crossing your path is bad </garnt>
<garnt> i think that's more like superstition </garnt>
<connor> though that's a superstition yeah that's </connor>
<joey> what is this is </joey>
<joey> chugging a bunch of oranges not </joey>
<joey> superstition </joey>
<joey> i guess sorry it is they're all </joey>
<joey> superstitions i don't know if wait what </joey>
<garnt> is it what's the difference </garnt>
<connor> what's the difference between a </connor>
<joey> superstition in an idiom </joey>
<connor> say um uh well idioms are more to </connor>
<connor> explain like it's </connor>
<joey> like an example uh raining cats and dogs </joey>
<joey> but oh yeah so yeah all of these okay </joey>
<joey> replace eating with soups yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> these are all superstitions so you know </connor>
<connor> i i guess it's superstitious of you to </connor>
<garnt> consume a bunch of oranges in the hope </garnt>
<garnt> that it will cure your illness right </garnt>
<joey> that's superstitious i feel like there's </joey>
<garnt> no other word you have no no because </garnt>
<joey> it's it's </joey>
<joey> cause it's purely based on like </joey>
<garnt> hearsay and information you've heard and </garnt>
<garnt> stuff yeah but but i feel like this </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's so superstitious though right </connor>
<connor> that's what it originates from it's all </connor>
<connor> underneath that right </connor>
<garnt> it's come from like someone's experience </garnt>
<garnt> that has been passed down superstition </garnt>
<garnt> feels more like supernatural right where </garnt>
<garnt> you know like uh like opening up your </garnt>
<garnt> umbrella ins indoors is good it's bad </garnt>
<garnt> luck i don't know where that came from </garnt>
<garnt> but like at least like i don't do that </garnt>
<joey> anyway because why would you do that </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you're opening indoors oh </joey>
<joey> like what if you're in like an umbrella </joey>
<joey> store and you want to test it out right </joey>
<joey> yeah they have umbrella stores </joey>
<joey> yeah in japan you never get to open it </joey>
<joey> though do you yeah you know what yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> i'm cracking that bad boy okay i cracked </joey>
<joey> that bad boy that's you know come on i </joey>
<joey> found my own house and then every </joey>
<connor> middle-aged woman in that store looked </connor>
<joey> at me like superstition </joey>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<joey> in japan though a lot of people do do </joey>
<garnt> they really yeah a lot of people do i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like in asia the culture around </garnt>
<garnt> superstition is like very very prevalent </garnt>
<garnt> because everything everything is </garnt>
<connor> superstitious </connor>
<connor> it has some kind of merit to it well </connor>
<joey> because everything like you know because </joey>
<joey> the whole belief system is very like </joey>
<joey> spiritual based right so i think a lot </joey>
<connor> of superstitions are more widely </connor>
<connor> believed there's like a i'd say a scale </connor>
<garnt> of like yeah stepping on a crack or </garnt>
<garnt> break your mind yeah yeah that's like </garnt>
<garnt> that's the lower end of body yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah whereas maybe i've heard this from </joey>
<garnt> many people the vitamin c thing yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah which i i don't know if there's any </joey>
<garnt> merit i don't know if it does i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know it's just like there is some like </garnt>
<garnt> really really basic logic around it that </garnt>
<garnt> you're like i can kind of see that it's </garnt>
<connor> like saying like it's like i have this </connor>
<connor> theory that drinking water </connor>
<connor> will help me feel better and it's like </connor>
<connor> you're right but i feel like you're </connor>
<connor> vastly </connor>
<garnt> like over simple it's kind of like the </garnt>
<garnt> same thing with say you you like your </garnt>
<connor> experience with like manuka honey right </connor>
<connor> i'm just like yeah that is superstitious </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm just like is there any science </connor>
<connor> behind that but like when i had when i </connor>
<connor> had covered i was like [ __ ] spooning </connor>
<connor> these this manuka honey like nobody's </connor>
<connor> business it actually like helped my </connor>
<garnt> throat </garnt>
<garnt> it felt it felt a lot better </garnt>
<garnt> what's it called what's called uh the uh </garnt>
<garnt> placebo yeah that's like a placebo it </garnt>
<joey> could be which is like i'd argue is a </joey>
<garnt> branch of the superstitious tree because </garnt>
<garnt> that's different </garnt>
<joey> placebo is the documented effect that it </joey>
<joey> actually has an effect yes yes </joey>
<joey> your your brain is </joey>
<connor> making up for some form of [ __ ] thing </connor>
<joey> that you think placebo is so interesting </joey>
<joey> because it's like it hasn't been like </joey>
<joey> properly studied and a lot of scientists </joey>
<joey> reckon and like a lot of psychologists </joey>
<joey> reckon there is like something </joey>
<connor> legitimate there but we just don't know </connor>
<connor> what it is because we we don't we don't </connor>
<connor> know the [ __ ] because it's like we don't </connor>
<joey> know if it's actually a thing that works </joey>
<joey> or if it's just coincidence yeah like </joey>
<garnt> what the placebo effect is that it does </garnt>
<garnt> work we just don't know how yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> don't we don't know how talking about </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the whole um remember the uh </garnt>
<joey> life flashing before your eyes thing </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah and how i was telling you </garnt>
<joey> guys recently there was an article that </joey>
<joey> said they were scanning someone's brain </joey>
<joey> on on a table we're just collecting </joey>
<joey> scans we didn't talk about this podcast </joey>
<joey> in the taxi i remember this oh yeah </joey>
<joey> the superstitious we mentioned that in </joey>
<joey> the episode before i knew that but joey </joey>
<joey> didn't go on it for too long so i was </joey>
<joey> like i won't say anything anyway </joey>
<joey> the guy was getting a scan a brain scan </joey>
<joey> right and </joey>
<joey> you know he's having a regular scanned </joey>
<joey> brain checking what's going on the brain </joey>
<joey> oh what's going on there and during this </joey>
<joey> generic scan that they were doing the </joey>
<joey> guy died of a heart attack and whilst </joey>
<joey> they were scanning him </joey>
<joey> while he was dying i assume they try to </joey>
<joey> help him actually they're just leaving </joey>
<joey> like now hold on let's just get him oh </joey>
<joey> this date is hold on hold on </joey>
<joey> um they did find out that apparently </joey>
<joey> right before he died it was the part of </joey>
<joey> his brain that was responsible for </joey>
<joey> memories was like firing like crazy yeah </joey>
<joey> which would although not proven because </joey>
<joey> it's only one instance it would back up </joey>
<joey> the theory that </joey>
<joey> your life </joey>
<joey> before your eyes at least all these </joey>
<joey> memories start flashing right yeah which </joey>
<joey> is makes which is one of those things </joey>
<joey> where it's like okay </joey>
<joey> i guess that makes sense because a lot </joey>
<joey> of people have said that it's happened </joey>
<joey> and yeah although there's no way to </joey>
<joey> solidly prove it but that's that's </joey>
<joey> until then it was </joey>
<joey> not superstitious we only have yeah we </joey>
<joey> only have testimonies from people who </joey>
<joey> have been like near-death experiences </joey>
<connor> yeah right right like you know and then </connor>
<connor> we have some kind of not 100 proof but </connor>
<connor> some evidence to indicate that the </connor>
<connor> theory holds more well yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's uh we can kill people </garnt>
<joey> right now basically like right before </joey>
<connor> they just like plug them out they just </connor>
<joey> feel like quick get on the cat's game </joey>
<garnt> right now edge more </garnt>
<connor> where they literally edged their life </connor>
<garnt> at the whole thing oh that was that was </garnt>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>

<connor> like a dumb horror movie but not like </connor>

<connor> you're not gonna let this guarantee no </connor>
<connor> because because </connor>
<connor> just like talking about it just reminded </connor>
<garnt> me about uh the time where i kind of got </garnt>
<garnt> an ulcer i believe and so like have you </garnt>
<joey> you've had a mouth also before right so </joey>
<joey> how do you deal with it i put like ulcer </joey>
<garnt> cream on it okay what do what if you </garnt>
<joey> don't have ulcer cream like what did i </joey>
<joey> just don't try not to touch it </joey>
<connor> toothpaste toothpaste i thought </connor>
<joey> toothpaste works is that a suggestion </joey>
<garnt> okay so like as a kid my mom was just </garnt>
<connor> like oh just gargle salt water or like i </connor>
<connor> believe </connor>
<garnt> sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry damn it </garnt>
<joey> sorry i was like </joey>
<joey> i was i was legitimately right about to </joey>
<garnt> say when you said i was like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> how do we go from saltwater to diesel we </garnt>
<garnt> have a million </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i would either like gargle </garnt>
<garnt> salt water or mouthwash and then one day </garnt>
<joey> my ulcer was like so bad </joey>
<joey> that uh the salt water wasn't doing </joey>
<joey> anything right yeah so like as like a </joey>
<joey> teenager i'm just like what if uh what </joey>
<joey> if uh instead of just doing salt water </joey>
<joey> which is basically just diluted salt </joey>
<joey> what if i just go straight to the sauce </joey>
<joey> and there's just [ __ ] pour salt on it </joey>
<joey> right and </joey>
<joey> uh that i swear to god that's uh so </joey>
<joey> that's what i did i i i just i just like </joey>
<joey> got some like salt and just poured it </joey>
<joey> all all over this ulcer and it's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's standing like nobody's [ __ ] bro </joey>
<joey> it sounds like it's not like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hell </joey>
<joey> like burnt over in my mouth but then it </joey>
<joey> kind of numbs the wounds and i remember </joey>
<joey> waking up the next day and it was a lot </joey>
<joey> less painful it started healing straight </joey>
<joey> away now i don't know if there's any </joey>
<joey> science behind this i have googled it </joey>
<garnt> and i know like some other people do it </garnt>
<garnt> as well but there's no like i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if there's any back science behind it </garnt>
<garnt> but like after that i started putting </garnt>
<garnt> salt on my ulcer whenever i get a mouth </garnt>
<garnt> water and it seemed to like </garnt>
<garnt> it seemed to heal it i'm sure there is </garnt>
<joey> like some kind of science behind it but </joey>
<garnt> like i feel that's like </garnt>
<garnt> probably the more extreme method of </garnt>
<joey> things like you basically just napalmed </joey>
<connor> your mouth yeah the science says you're </connor>
<joey> completely wrong yeah yeah it could be </joey>
<joey> good so i remember one could also just </joey>
<joey> be a coincidence </joey>
<joey> yeah one day connor just come into the </joey>
<joey> office and complaining about a mouth </joey>
<joey> ulcer and i was like i have the perfect </joey>
<joey> solution just walks into the kitchen </joey>
<joey> just pour a bunch of salt on it it's </joey>
<joey> it's easy i do it all the time do it all </joey>
<joey> the time i remember coming in him coming </joey>
<garnt> in like the next day or something and he </garnt>
<garnt> was like gone why did you you literally </garnt>
<garnt> just convinced me to pour salt in a </garnt>
<garnt> wound that's all you've done didn't help </garnt>
<connor> any it didn't i remember it didn't help </connor>
<connor> at all really just like it stopped the </connor>
<joey> pain for like two hours </joey>
<joey> in exchange for like one burst of </joey>
<joey> immense pain yeah but like it didn't do </joey>
<joey> anything you basically just pre-ordered </joey>
<joey> i think that gaunt would have healed </joey>
<joey> naturally without the soul and i think </joey>
<joey> he just poured saul and happens to </joey>
<joey> remember that it then went away </joey>
<joey> basically just didn't like ulcer </joey>
<joey> hardcore </joey>
<joey> illnesses that go away yeah right like </joey>
<joey> you know obviously in very serious </joey>
<joey> illnesses the pseudoscience is uh very </joey>
<joey> harmful yeah and very [ __ ] up that </joey>
<joey> people try and sell solutions that are </joey>
<joey> like you know they'll be like just take </joey>
<joey> our herbs and your cancer will go away </joey>
<joey> yeah like that's [ __ ] up yeah you're </joey>
<joey> even telling people yes but </joey>
<joey> i think the reason why with generic </joey>
<joey> illnesses so many superstitions come </joey>
<joey> about is because they go anyway on their </joey>
<joey> own and if you're doing [ __ ] and it </joey>
<connor> happens to go away you're probably your </connor>
<connor> mind is aha i was sick one time and then </connor>
<connor> i i i played with my poop for 20 minutes </connor>
<connor> in my hands like play-doh and it went </connor>
<connor> away the next day and it's like well no </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> now i've got three other illnesses yeah </joey>
<joey> you can do things </joey>
<joey> anything yeah do it every single time </joey>
<joey> you get sick with a generic illness that </joey>
<joey> will go away anyway after 48 hours yeah </joey>
<joey> and then you'll remember that you did </joey>
<joey> that thing and then it went away yeah so </joey>
<joey> this probably happened with like the </joey>
<joey> vitamin c you probably maybe have a </joey>
<joey> little bit of placebo effect as well and </joey>
<joey> then boom it goes away and you're like </joey>
<joey> well it must be vitamin c because every </joey>
<connor> time i take vitamin c my cold goes as if </connor>
<connor> if you did nothing your vitamin c </connor>
<connor> wouldn't go away but it it's not how it </connor>
<joey> works it would go away anyway but i want </joey>
<joey> like an experiment of like especially </joey>
<joey> with the vitamin c thing of like catch a </joey>
<joey> cold one time do the vitamin c thing and </joey>
<joey> then catch a cold a second time and </joey>
<joey> don't do the vitamin c thing which one </joey>
<connor> you'll see you need to do this like a </connor>
<connor> hundred times to get any data worth </connor>
<joey> considering well there's plenty of sick </joey>
<joey> people today </joey>
<connor> you'd need the same person over and over </connor>
<joey> yeah even then it wouldn't matter </joey>
<connor> because we could just like view the </connor>
<connor> immune system anyway with the things </connor>
<connor> that we do we're gonna dedicate my whole </connor>
<joey> life to see if oranges work during the </joey>
<connor> flow </connor>
<connor> turns out we don't know yeah science </connor>
<joey> sucks because science is boring as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it takes a long time and people don't </joey>
<garnt> like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately maybe we can make it they </garnt>
<connor> want results now yeah of course it's </connor>
<connor> like yeah maybe we can we can go to </connor>
<connor> another planet in 200 years it's like oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm not going to be around for that </connor>
<garnt> so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's the problem back back to humans </garnt>
<garnt> are just so incapable of like really </garnt>
<garnt> caring about things that happen in like </garnt>
<connor> the far future and like overwhelming </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's the reason why we're so [ __ ] with </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> it's not gonna affect me tomorrow so </joey>
<garnt> that's [ __ ] whatever yeah i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean we've talked about something </garnt>
<garnt> similar before where like talking about </garnt>
<garnt> just imagining five years in the future </garnt>
<garnt> or like where you're going to be five </garnt>
<joey> years or ten years in the future can you </joey>
<joey> imagine what 2027 is going to be like no </joey>
<joey> yeah because everyone thought in 2012 </joey>
<joey> that 2022 was like yeah flying cars i </joey>
<garnt> couldn't imagine being 30 and here i am </garnt>
<garnt> for 31. like how the [ __ ] did that </garnt>
<garnt> happen you know i basically did i'm </garnt>
<joey> basically dead </joey>
<connor> i think same with that exercise right </connor>
<joey> like i can't i i know exercise is good </joey>
<joey> for me yeah and i like it when i do it </joey>
<joey> yeah but i just can't </joey>
<joey> i can't visualize the benefits to my </joey>
<joey> life exactly </joey>
<joey> that's why it's so hard to maintain yeah </joey>
<joey> that's why it's so hard to keep it up </joey>
<joey> even though i feel amazing when i do it </joey>
<joey> i normally have so much energy i feel </joey>
<joey> great i know and i can feel the </joey>
<joey> immediate tangible benefits yeah but for </joey>
<joey> some reason i just can't convince myself </joey>
<joey> long term that i can visualize that hey </joey>
<connor> when i'm 70 maybe i'll be a lot better </connor>
<connor> off for it if i just put in the work now </connor>
<joey> even not even that it's just like you </joey>
<connor> know you could be like yeah you could be </connor>
<connor> like working out right and like a week </connor>
<joey> later you'd look down your body and be </joey>
<connor> like why do i still look exactly the </connor>
<connor> same that yeah that's nice as well dude </connor>
<joey> like it's it blows you get that pump on </joey>
<joey> you you go hard and you're like why why </joey>
<joey> but then you eat like two weeks of </joey>
<joey> mcdonald's and you're like wow nothing </joey>
<joey> changed amazing which you love it you </joey>
<joey> love that nothing changes but then you </joey>
<garnt> get angry when it doesn't change </garnt>
<garnt> we suck as humans i know yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's what sucks right is that if if </garnt>
<garnt> you want to gain weight fast oh look get </garnt>
<joey> get ripped fast you also have to accept </joey>
<connor> the fact that maybe one binge drinking </connor>
<joey> weekend yeah [ __ ] your body to death </joey>
<joey> speaking of human sucking i uh i saw </joey>
<connor> this recent thing okay uh that uh </connor>
<connor> what a segway i mean because i i looked </connor>
<joey> at this and i thought oh my god humans </joey>
<connor> suck but there was an article that came </connor>
<connor> out uh not too long ago i'll just write </connor>
<connor> yahoo who by who's the article first uh </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of different articles that </connor>
<connor> came out uh all over the place but uh </connor>
<connor> i'll just read the i'll just read the </connor>
<connor> title of this article because it </connor>
<connor> explains everything go for it lonely ape </connor>
<connor> has just launched a dating app for nft </connor>
<joey> collectors a dating app a dating app </joey>
<joey> somebody has developed a dating app </joey>
<joey> specifically for nft bros </joey>
<joey> to date nft hoes </joey>
<connor> i don't i i think the problem with this </connor>
<joey> is is that everything there is or </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<garnt> but let's now let's i'm going to take a </garnt>
<garnt> second okay what do you reckon the </garnt>
<garnt> demographic of people who have nfts are </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay jojo esque dating app it's </garnt>
<garnt> gonna work no no no no no let's look at </garnt>
<joey> this positively okay </joey>
<joey> so what you're saying is we're going to </joey>
<connor> be removing people with nft profiles </connor>
<joey> from our dating pool </joey>
<garnt> i think i think that's the positive </garnt>
<garnt> right surely surely </garnt>
<joey> but that means that we're just like </joey>
<joey> forcing these kinds of people to </joey>
<joey> reproduce </joey>
<joey> should not be allowed to reproduce no </joey>
<joey> i'm not saying that but you know </joey>
<joey> you're implying </joey>
<connor> well that's okay they they go on the </connor>
<joey> metaverse it's fine just like just like </joey>
<joey> reading through this article just made </joey>
<joey> me have like several aneurysms uh there </joey>
<joey> is no need to enter uh or display </joey>
<joey> personal information instead one can </joey>
<joey> link their crypto wallet to access the </joey>
<joey> app </joey>
<joey> once logged in the user can display </joey>
<joey> their net worth and nft pro portfolio </joey>
<joey> what you can also filter your matches by </joey>
<garnt> their cryptocurrency value and the nft </garnt>
<garnt> collection </garnt>
<connor> if i had a dollar for every time i saw </connor>
<connor> an article about something to do with </connor>
<garnt> nfts that i despised i wouldn't need to </garnt>
<garnt> buy anything everywhere i was like why </garnt>
<garnt> didn't you probably own it </garnt>
<joey> i've not seen a single good thing with </joey>
<joey> an article it's never like nft owners </joey>
<joey> pledge to uh stop global warming to save </joey>
<joey> the world and it's like no it's like nft </joey>
<joey> owners pledge to have a yacht club where </joey>
<connor> they all wank each other off or </connor>
<connor> something that's all it ever is it's </connor>
<connor> like the uh the nft restaurant thing </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> it's are you just making uh </connor>
<connor> are you just trying to make some kind of </connor>
<connor> tangible effect that you own an nft it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> there's some reason there's some reason </joey>
<joey> wait so so explain what this restaurant </joey>
<connor> you need to own an nft to go into the </connor>
<garnt> restaurant yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's it that's it that's it that's it </garnt>
<joey> it's like so you just like you just go </joey>
<joey> up to the bounce and you'll be like </joey>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<joey> it's getting to the point where it's </joey>
<garnt> just like classism with extra steps now </garnt>
<joey> actually it's not even any extra steps </joey>
<connor> it's just </connor>
<connor> we've hated on fts like so many times i </connor>
<connor> i just yeah it sucks it sucks yeah i </connor>
<joey> just i just saw that going on i'm like i </joey>
<connor> i legitimately thought it was an onion </connor>
<connor> article at first because yeah it sounds </connor>
<connor> like one yeah i realized oh the sad </connor>
<connor> reality that's a real thing even if they </connor>
<connor> you know they could turn around and when </connor>
<connor> people back onto nfts which i don't </connor>
<joey> think they can </joey>
<joey> i i just can't see them </joey>
<joey> winning the public faith back in it </joey>
<joey> again now yeah since everyone has just </joey>
<joey> seen how much of a mess it's been i </joey>
<joey> don't you know and whatever you think </joey>
<joey> about the technology or whatever you </joey>
<joey> think about what it can be done with it </joey>
<joey> you have to recognize that the the nft </joey>
<garnt> like this kind of landscape that it had </garnt>
<garnt> has become right now yeah such a mess </garnt>
<garnt> ripe with scams [ __ ] up [ __ ] money </garnt>
<garnt> laundering just every kind of awful </garnt>
<garnt> thing you can imagine yeah it has had </garnt>
<garnt> such a bad public wrap that it would not </garnt>
<joey> only need to come up with something </joey>
<joey> revolutionary that is actually good it </joey>
<joey> would then have to win people back over </joey>
<joey> by fixing its image which i don't think </joey>
<joey> it can because the internet doesn't want </joey>
<connor> to to make it more regulated it doesn't </connor>
<connor> want to make it more it also just they </connor>
<joey> like how free it is yeah it also just </joey>
<joey> seems like that community doesn't really </joey>
<joey> care about it either no they do they do </joey>
<connor> do they yeah because they push it on to </connor>
<connor> everyone and everything well then how </connor>
<joey> come they're not how come they're not </joey>
<joey> trying to do anything to better their </joey>
<joey> image and instead make these [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dating apps and restaurants it's a </joey>
<joey> free-for-all right now every company and </joey>
<joey> every person is trying to grab a part of </joey>
<joey> like it's a gold rush right everyone </joey>
<joey> wants that bit of it yeah so the reason </joey>
<joey> why everyone is shoving it down </joey>
<joey> everyone's throat is because they they </joey>
<garnt> have investments they want to make sure </garnt>
<connor> they don't lose their money okay onto </connor>
<garnt> the next sucker who comes in too late </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and it's like it's it's also so </garnt>
<joey> weird did you see the clip where it was </joey>
<joey> like think i think jimmy fallon like </joey>
<joey> presenting his nft with paris hilton </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> huh oh of course yeah yeah it's it's uh </connor>
<connor> is it a meme at least or is it like no </connor>
<garnt> no no it is serious okay so </garnt>
<connor> i believe i believe it's jimmy fallon </connor>
<connor> but uh jimmy fallon and paris hilton uh </connor>
<connor> well paris hilton was on the jimmy </connor>
<connor> fallon show and they started talking </connor>
<connor> about nfts and how paris hilton </connor>
<connor> convinced jimmy fallon to buy a broad </connor>
<garnt> ape nft what a nice scenario </garnt>
<garnt> it's so it was so weird because it's </garnt>
<garnt> like i've never seen a clip of two </garnt>
<garnt> people more out of touch </garnt>
<garnt> with like the wider world so they they </garnt>
<garnt> like like so jimmy finally brings out </garnt>
<garnt> his like he's like bored but it's bought </garnt>
<joey> april that's the name yeah yeah he </joey>
<joey> brings out yeah the monkeys yeah he </joey>
<joey> brings out </joey>
<garnt> and he goes isn't this beautiful look at </garnt>
<garnt> this it's amazing and like you can hear </garnt>
<connor> the audience clapping i've seen this </connor>
<connor> image i thought it was a meme really no </connor>
<garnt> no no it is a real image on the picture </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i've i've never heard such a </garnt>
<garnt> applause where it was so obvious that </garnt>
<garnt> there was a big light saying applause </garnt>
<garnt> please because you could tell the </garnt>
<garnt> audience had no idea what the [ __ ] they </garnt>
<connor> were talking about </connor>
<connor> another massive problem with the whole </connor>
<connor> nft landscape right is that it benefits </connor>
<connor> the people who have big platforms right </connor>
<joey> if you have a big platform it's free </joey>
<joey> money for you that's why people are </joey>
<joey> doing this </joey>
<joey> the moment something is advertised to </joey>
<joey> you as you should buy it is the moment </joey>
<joey> it's too late for you anything </joey>
<joey> you know the moment that consumers are </joey>
<joey> seeing big names promoting it it's too </joey>
<joey> late to make money yeah some people </joey>
<joey> might make money the majority of people </joey>
<joey> are not going to make money no and the </joey>
<joey> majority of people are going to lose </joey>
<joey> money and the people who get money are </joey>
<joey> people like jimmy fallon people like uh </joey>
<joey> people already range </joey>
<joey> people who have the platform the power </joey>
<joey> to push people towards their investment </joey>
<joey> it's it's a glorified pyramid scheme in </joey>
<joey> many ways right because it's like how do </joey>
<joey> you get your money by getting more </joey>
<joey> people into it yeah right it's it's </joey>
<joey> that's how it works and that's why </joey>
<joey> you're seeing like when i tweet anything </joey>
<joey> or men or or mentioned in anything nft </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter what the comment is </joey>
<joey> these these verified nft accounts like </joey>
<joey> everything with the with the phrase nft </joey>
<joey> in it yeah they don't i could be saying </joey>
<joey> nfts suck and they can gargle on my nuts </joey>
<joey> and and someone who supports nft will </joey>
<joey> like that comment just because they've </joey>
<joey> googled nft and they like everything </joey>
<joey> because they're trying to get followers </joey>
<joey> they're trying to get engagement so then </joey>
<joey> they can push it more and have more </joey>
<joey> biggest fear of influence what if they </joey>
<garnt> just like gargling or nuts they might </garnt>
<garnt> call themselves they probably probably </garnt>
<joey> do yeah they do yes please </joey>
<joey> i hate it i hate it so much because it's </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> obviously a scam like the moment that </joey>
<connor> you are being </connor>
<connor> advertised to about buying an investment </connor>
<joey> is the moment that you've you've already </joey>
<joey> you can't make money and i think that's </joey>
<joey> what's so [ __ ] disappointing as well </joey>
<joey> especially with you know as you said </joey>
<joey> like big influences right like getting </joey>
<joey> in on it like [ __ ] you know when i </joey>
<joey> when i saw that like eminem bought like </joey>
<garnt> an nft of just what looks like a monkey </garnt>
<joey> version of himself i was like why would </joey>
<garnt> you do that </garnt>
<garnt> because never before every childhood </garnt>
<joey> you have a big sphere of influence it's </joey>
<garnt> just free money exactly and in their </garnt>
<joey> eyes it's low risk public image because </joey>
<joey> you're not asking your </joey>
<joey> you don't have to it's not like you're </joey>
<joey> begging your followers for money but </joey>
<joey> what you're doing is making them pay for </joey>
<joey> something yeah that makes your thing </joey>
<joey> more valuable it's heavy incentivizing </joey>
<connor> right and and you can claim </connor>
<joey> just that you it's just an investment </joey>
<joey> it's like buying a stock it's not like </joey>
<joey> buying a house it's not like buying a </joey>
<joey> stock it's different right there's rules </joey>
<joey> around buying for reasons right yeah </joey>
<joey> even though </joey>
<garnt> sometimes the rules are a bit [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah still </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean like passionately about this </connor>
<garnt> and i i hate the system so much well i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like the the only thing i have to add to </garnt>
<garnt> this is like do you think this negative </garnt>
<joey> image is purely you know it's purely </joey>
<joey> based on like the western circle and </joey>
<joey> just like our perception of the internet </joey>
<joey> definitely because because like i've </joey>
<joey> heard like of like nfts have a very very </joey>
<joey> different perception in like the </joey>
<joey> japanese circles and uh </joey>
<joey> and you know the japanese especially the </joey>
<joey> art communities as well because they see </joey>
<joey> it as </joey>
<joey> from what i've read at least they've </joey>
<joey> they they have a much more positive view </joey>
<joey> of nfts and they see it as like an </joey>
<joey> opportunity to of course give uh you </joey>
<joey> know ownership to artists and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> that which is a lot you know given the </garnt>
<garnt> cultures i understand why maybe japanese </garnt>
<garnt> people would be more </garnt>
<garnt> more accepting of this idea because it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like for japanese people and </garnt>
<garnt> japanese artists it's a lot bigger </garnt>
<garnt> problem than it is </garnt>
<joey> i'm awful giving rights to artists and </joey>
<joey> whatnot but you know i feel there are </joey>
<joey> other ways that you can do it if the </joey>
<joey> systems were you know properly </joey>
<joey> implemented not to mention that in japan </joey>
<joey> like you know the the whole copyright </joey>
<joey> laws in japan especially are just like </joey>
<joey> on the next level of outdated yeah right </joey>
<garnt> like it's so like i think if anything </garnt>
<garnt> the reason why japanese are gonna yeah </garnt>
<connor> of course of course the japanese are </connor>
<connor> gonna look at nfts and things like oh </connor>
<garnt> this is perfect like this this gets </garnt>
<joey> around everything that we've believed in </joey>
<joey> and done in like a really cool way that </joey>
<joey> supports artists like more more ways to </joey>
<joey> copyright [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah bring it </joey>
<connor> in yeah yes please that requires the </connor>
<joey> good faith of </joey>
<joey> all parties involved though yeah like </joey>
<joey> everyone has to be using it correctly </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and the problem is is that </joey>
<joey> they're not english we're definitely not </joey>
<joey> you know and there is there's some very </joey>
<joey> valid reasons to to own nfts or bitcoin </joey>
<joey> or any any of these currencies right </joey>
<joey> like if you live in a </joey>
<joey> if you're like a russian person right </joey>
<joey> now and all your money was in the ruble </joey>
<joey> yeah you're [ __ ] yeah like your </joey>
<joey> money's gone yeah you just don't you </joey>
<joey> don't own much money anymore if you had </joey>
<joey> that all in a bitcoin wallet yeah you'd </joey>
<joey> still be very wealthy right so that </joey>
<joey> makes more that in those scenarios it </joey>
<joey> makes a lot of sense problem is it's </joey>
<joey> kind of replicated </joey>
<joey> what the fine art world was before </joey>
<joey> to like the big private investors right </joey>
<joey> it was basically fine art it was this </joey>
<joey> glorified </joey>
<joey> money </joey>
<joey> money laundering and money </joey>
<joey> transactioning thing right yeah and now </joey>
<joey> in the west people figured out huh </joey>
<joey> you can make a lot of money and money </joey>
<joey> that you can hide very easily </joey>
<joey> by doing this nft [ __ ] and so it's kind </joey>
<joey> of turned into more of a democratized </joey>
<joey> fine art </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] for people right like uh like </joey>
<joey> the whole uh you've watched like tenant </joey>
<joey> did you watch tennant yeah i watched </joey>
<joey> tenants you know like the art that was </joey>
<joey> held in the um </joey>
<connor> in the airports because it couldn't be </connor>
<garnt> text that's actually real thing i know </garnt>
<garnt> that's a real thing was that a major </garnt>
<connor> part of tenant that was a big uh plot </connor>
<connor> point and tenant is where they steal the </connor>
<connor> the they steal the artwork and all the </connor>
<connor> valuable stuff from the airport uh </connor>
<connor> holding uh the tax haven in the airport </connor>
<joey> clearly this movie really made an </joey>
<joey> impression on god </joey>
<garnt> i just remember things going backwards </garnt>
<connor> like that's like things looking cool </connor>
<joey> that's like the first time in like media </joey>
<joey> that i can recall that has like told </joey>
<connor> people that these things exist yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> people didn't know these existed before </joey>
<garnt> um you know it's just was that a massive </garnt>
<garnt> part of tenon i feel like i would have </garnt>
<garnt> remembered that which scene which which </garnt>
<garnt> scene was this in was this in the first </garnt>
<joey> scene i don't remember that i'm never </joey>
<connor> gonna know the full [ __ ] playlist of </connor>
<joey> ten and i don't know what [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> happened i just like they had a big </joey>
<connor> there was a big plot point about them </connor>
<connor> doing a heist </connor>
<connor> in the first half of the movie </connor>
<connor> was there oh my [ __ ] the only thing i </connor>
<joey> know is that the one's been wrong </joey>
<joey> he basically did oh my god </joey>
<joey> when he dies like his life doesn't flash </joey>
<garnt> before his eyes just 10 at the movies </garnt>
<garnt> i remember them being in an airport but </garnt>
<garnt> i don't remember them </garnt>
<connor> pulling another one </connor>
<joey> why were they in the airport </joey>
<connor> why they're in an </connor>
<connor> airport </connor>
<connor> maybe uh they were getting a flight or </connor>
<connor> something no they were investigating the </connor>
<connor> they were this is a complete [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> tangerine because they were going into </connor>
<connor> they were investigating the phenomena </connor>
<connor> right that uh that you know the </connor>
<garnt> phenomena where time moves backwards or </garnt>
<garnt> something that's that's all i remember </garnt>
<garnt> ish i can't remember they're stealing </garnt>
<garnt> something they're just holding because </garnt>
<garnt> and in the holding places they normally </garnt>
<garnt> have art because you can't we could </garnt>
<garnt> basically buy and sell in this area </garnt>
<garnt> because it doesn't yeah yeah it's not </garnt>
<garnt> under any jurisdiction yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> taxpayer right so you can no i i </connor>
<connor> remember there being pain i remember the </connor>
<garnt> paintings there i just don't know i just </garnt>
<garnt> don't remember that being like a massive </garnt>
<connor> part of the plot point but </connor>
<connor> it was just like it was like i brought </connor>
<connor> it up because it was like the first time </connor>
<connor> it had been addressed or like brought up </connor>
<connor> in like uh prominent media yeah um well </connor>
<garnt> these things exist yeah well they've </garnt>
<garnt> existed for like a very very long time </garnt>
<garnt> and it's not just like fine arts but </garnt>
<garnt> like and like it's not just paintings </garnt>
<garnt> any valuable thing like after stuff in </garnt>
<garnt> the british museum </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's normally the place where </garnt>
<garnt> they come from you know like </garnt>
<garnt> the point was is that it's </garnt>
<joey> i just think with the way that nfts are </joey>
<joey> structured right now it's just this is </joey>
<joey> this was obviously going to happen yeah </joey>
<joey> it was it's just been ripe with scams </joey>
<joey> like half this [ __ ] is awful like yeah </joey>
<joey> there's some legitimate uses the </joey>
<joey> technology seems somewhat promising </joey>
<joey> right now the fact that it uses more </joey>
<joey> than like most countries the entire like </joey>
<joey> bitcoin network uses more electricity </joey>
<joey> than countries </joey>
<joey> is very concerning yes um </joey>
<joey> and that there are more you know they're </joey>
<joey> making new coins they're making new ways </joey>
<joey> that are much more efficient and stuff </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah we get it but it's not there </joey>
<joey> right now yeah it's not it's not doing </joey>
<joey> that right now it's not working right </joey>
<joey> now in a way that works for the world do </joey>
<joey> you think it will never work out yeah it </joey>
<joey> definitely will at some point obviously </joey>
<joey> the idea of having </joey>
<joey> a way that you can 100 own something </joey>
<joey> digitally is going to be very convenient </joey>
<joey> at some point yes </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> right now it just doesn't the way that </connor>
<garnt> it's being used is like a joke no i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like it's weird it's weird seeing how </garnt>
<garnt> fast they just came from like basically </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere to everyone talking about them i </garnt>
<joey> mean crypto because it's been just so </joey>
<joey> like it's just been shoved down every </joey>
<garnt> once in a while </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was literally last year where i </garnt>
<joey> had not heard of the word nft until like </joey>
<joey> may or april and then i couldn't stop </joey>
<joey> hearing it i was like i remember being </joey>
<garnt> like i mean i only found out what it was </garnt>
<joey> like a couple i'm on the [ __ ] podcast </joey>
<connor> podcast yeah yeah i'm i'm so envious of </connor>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> because i i think i just like yeah i </joey>
<joey> just avoided all that [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<garnt> follow anyone who is now there's the </garnt>
<garnt> metaverse that's coming along </garnt>
<connor> well have you seen that these companies </connor>
<joey> are buying like space in like the </joey>
<joey> metaverse they're buying like plots of </joey>
<connor> land in the metaphase yeah yeah i've </connor>
<garnt> seen that yeah so they're why they're </garnt>
<joey> buying digital land yeah </joey>
<joey> dude that's like i mean i feel like it </joey>
<joey> is just that's some sci-fi territory i i </joey>
<garnt> feel like the past year uh has opened up </garnt>
<garnt> basically the age of like the digital </garnt>
<connor> gold rush is this what it must have felt </connor>
<connor> like to see like the dot-com bubble i </connor>
<garnt> think i think i think so that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's must have been what it felt like </garnt>
<connor> where you see millions of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> dollars being invested in the dumbest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah yeah in like </connor>
<garnt> fuckingkittens.com or something like i </garnt>
<joey> don't [ __ ] know and now kittens.com </joey>
<connor> is worth millions yeah right i don't </connor>
<connor> know if this is true but you're in the </connor>
<connor> metaverse right they don't have legs </connor>
<connor> have you seen that no they don't have uh </connor>
<joey> they only have two like torsos this is </joey>
<joey> very much similar with me with nfts i </joey>
<connor> know nothing about the metaphors so do </connor>
<garnt> do you know why sort art online by </garnt>
<connor> facebook yeah yeah that's all i know do </connor>
<connor> you want to take a guess why they only </connor>
<joey> have torsos in this world why is it for </joey>
<joey> people who perhaps are in wheelchairs </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that or it's a very noble </connor>
<joey> thought yeah unfortunately it's not </joey>
<joey> maybe inclusive </joey>
<joey> you can fetch this actually but to my </joey>
<joey> understanding it was to stop people like </joey>
<joey> doing like implying sexual acts and </joey>
<joey> stuff and doing things </joey>
<connor> from what i understand from what i </connor>
<joey> understand that is the reason why i mean </joey>
<joey> it is like i read somewhere that like </joey>
<joey> foot fetishes are like i think the most </joey>
<joey> common fetish in like like the world </joey>
<joey> what's going to do with facebook </joey>
<joey> because of the legs but it's like </joey>
<joey> digital feet it's like yeah </joey>
<connor> i was just master chief i was like are </connor>
<connor> you going with this </connor>
<connor> features </connor>
<garnt> them sims feet though </garnt>
<garnt> delicious why didn't they just delete </garnt>
<connor> the feet then if they </connor>
<connor> just have no one for you </connor>
<joey> everyone just looks like kirby you know </joey>
<garnt> just stubs and knobs apparently it's a </garnt>
<garnt> technical issue like the cameras can't </garnt>
<garnt> capture the whole body mm-hmm [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> i don't think is there anything </connor>
<connor> mentioned about sexual stuff </connor>
<joey> can you google sexual mark zuckerberg </joey>
<joey> metaverse no legs </joey>
<joey> so apparently uh as well there's like a </joey>
<joey> you have like your own bubble you can't </joey>
<joey> come into your space </joey>
<joey> but to me it's weird right because i </joey>
<connor> don't know if i'm just like stupid but </connor>
<connor> it just looks like </connor>
<joey> really [ __ ] vr chat that's what i saw </joey>
<joey> and i was like so is this like a game </joey>
<garnt> that facebook is developing or just </garnt>
<garnt> looks like vr chat but just less fun and </garnt>
<connor> uh like vr chat has really good games in </connor>
<joey> it have you seen this no there's like </joey>
<joey> games in vr chat and it's nuts i was </joey>
<joey> playing super monkey ball the other day </joey>
<joey> oh wow in vrc yeah vr chat how were you </joey>
<joey> not sick i don't know i guess and there </joey>
<joey> was also like i could sing playing </joey>
<joey> regular </joey>
<joey> like uh </joey>
<connor> like a tron game where you throw discs </connor>
<connor> and they bounce around you'll dodge it </connor>
<garnt> that's pretty cool i hit the other </garnt>
<garnt> person it just seems like a vr game in a </garnt>
<connor> vr game yeah so it is and there's like </connor>
<connor> there's a whole cooking game right in a </connor>
<connor> vr game and it's like free it's like why </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] would anyone want how does vr </garnt>
<garnt> chat work i never because i've never </garnt>
<garnt> played vr chat but is it is it like kind </garnt>
<connor> of like an open source kind of thing </connor>
<connor> where people can create </connor>
<garnt> their own their own games and their own </garnt>
<joey> spaces and stuff like that oh okay it's </joey>
<joey> all user generated okay that's why it's </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] good it's like yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because you'll be in a lobby and yeah </joey>
<joey> does it is it annoying that you get in </joey>
<joey> the lobby and there's like 10 year olds </joey>
<joey> screaming yeah that's annoying and i </joey>
<joey> think mark zuckerberg is trying to </joey>
<joey> address that by making it like age uh </joey>
<joey> only like i don't know over a certain </joey>
<joey> age allowed to join yeah </joey>
<joey> but vr is still really good like it's </joey>
<joey> it's genuinely good so okay so so going </joey>
<garnt> back to the whole like buying digital </garnt>
<joey> plots of land on on meta okay right like </joey>
<garnt> how does that work </garnt>
<joey> like what i don't know </joey>
<connor> the question of why well if you own </connor>
<garnt> digital land it's it's like the </garnt>
<connor> metaverse is being marketed as this </connor>
<joey> place that is kind of like just a new </joey>
<joey> virtual reality world that everyone's </joey>
<joey> going to go to right so you can </joey>
<joey> literally live like a second life or </joey>
<joey> even like you know your online media </joey>
<joey> life </joey>
<joey> in this virtual place that's called the </joey>
<joey> metaverse so what are companies doing </joey>
<garnt> they're literally buying plots of land </garnt>
<garnt> in this virtual land for </garnt>
<garnt> treating it like they're blind they're </garnt>
<garnt> buying real lands that exists in the </garnt>
<garnt> real world </garnt>
<joey> this is just lane this is </joey>
<joey> legitimately scary you want to hit like </joey>
<joey> the most depressing thing ever please </joey>
<joey> investors are playing paying millions </joey>
<joey> for virtual land in the metaverse </joey>
<joey> and um apparently uh </joey>
<connor> uh a company recently dropped 2.5 </connor>
<connor> million dollars on a patch of land in </connor>
<connor> decentral land one of the most popular </connor>
<connor> metaverse worlds and the prices have </connor>
<connor> gone up 400 to 500 percent in the past </connor>
<connor> few months how much land are we talking </connor>
<connor> like how many digital how many digital </connor>
<connor> square meters are we talking i don't </connor>
<connor> fully understand it </connor>
<connor> another person uh spent 4.3 million on a </connor>
<connor> parcel of virtual land </connor>
<connor> oh my god um i </connor>
<joey> oh my god is this what happens when you </joey>
<joey> just have too much money yes i think </joey>
<connor> this is what i think what's happening is </connor>
<joey> that a lot of companies with a lot of </joey>
<joey> money are like let's just throw </joey>
<joey> something into it all right if it fails </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter if it if it goes up </joey>
<joey> tenfold big money right yeah i think </joey>
<joey> that's what's going on and i think </joey>
<joey> people in companies are hearing whispers </joey>
<joey> of it and i think i i also imagine as </joey>
<joey> well that facebook is doing a really </joey>
<joey> good job at convincing these companies </joey>
<joey> oh yeah that that this is going to be a </joey>
<joey> big deal yeah when i feel like anyone </joey>
<joey> who is in the tech space </joey>
<joey> looks at metaverse and is like i just </joey>
<joey> don't see how this can become a thing </joey>
<joey> that's like good yeah </joey>
<connor> because how the [ __ ] are you going to </connor>
<connor> convince everyone </connor>
<connor> to get a virtual headset do you know how </connor>
<connor> annoying they are to i'm i love my tech </connor>
<connor> and i gotta admit virtual reality </connor>
<joey> headsets are a pain in the [ __ ] ass </joey>
<garnt> yeah absolutely well it comes with the </garnt>
<joey> uh assumption that </joey>
<joey> virtual reality headsets will be at one </joey>
<joey> point more streamlined than they already </joey>
<connor> are </connor>
<garnt> um which they really really need to be </garnt>
<garnt> because like the barrier of entry for </garnt>
<garnt> our virtual headset is like [ __ ] done </garnt>
<connor> great obviously yeah that is facebook </connor>
<joey> yeah and that that is probably the most </joey>
<joey> user-friendly headset yeah but it's </joey>
<joey> still like it's not perfect it's not </joey>
<joey> perfect </joey>
<joey> you don't want to have a business [ __ ] i </joey>
<joey> do not want to have a business meeting </joey>
<joey> without a [ __ ] headset on it's like </joey>
<joey> honey where's my headset i need to get </joey>
<joey> into business one of the main pictures </joey>
<joey> of like the metaverse like you could </joey>
<connor> have a a meeting with your co-workers </connor>
<connor> have you had a virtual reality headset </connor>
<connor> on for more than two hours no it is i </connor>
<garnt> have it's awful it's it gets </garnt>
<joey> sweaty it's like it's bulky the only </joey>
<joey> reason why i haven't done a stream on my </joey>
<joey> oculus is because i can't wear that </joey>
<joey> thing for more than 20 minutes without </joey>
<joey> feeling sick </joey>
<joey> that's what it also it also depends on </joey>
<joey> the game yeah because i remember like i </joey>
<joey> remember hearing about these rumors that </joey>
<joey> people get motion sickness from wearing </joey>
<joey> headsets yeah </joey>
<joey> superstitions </joey>
<connor> superstitions now i'm just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you're not sick and i'm just like they </connor>
<connor> must just be weak-minded i ain't like </connor>
<connor> that i remember like the first time i </connor>
<connor> got like my uh </connor>
<joey> valve index uh one of the first games i </joey>
<joey> bought was like uh pavlov i think right </joey>
<connor> it was like the it's like the basically </connor>
<connor> a virtual reality cs go okay yeah and i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> walking in that for like 10 seconds and </connor>
<connor> i just got immediate [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> motion sickness like like my brain </connor>
<connor> searched through like my the entire </connor>
<connor> history of humanity to like see if there </connor>
<connor> was any any kind of experience that </connor>
<connor> could like help regulate what i was </connor>
<connor> going through and it was just like yeah </connor>
<connor> nope i don't know what's going on right </connor>
<joey> now you're just gonna you're just gonna </joey>
<garnt> feel sick right now </garnt>
<joey> like the thing is i get motion sickness </joey>
<joey> even if it's like not a very like </joey>
<joey> movement intensive game like i get i get </joey>
<joey> sick after like 20 minutes of beat sable </joey>
<joey> yeah and like you you're not even </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] moving in that game yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm i'm totally fine in the motion </connor>
<joey> sickness part yeah i've only had one </joey>
<joey> one game that's given me motion sickness </joey>
<joey> yeah or like my emotions like make me </joey>
<garnt> feel like oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah it was like this ninja game santiro </joey>
<garnt> or something yeah like you jump around </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty sick but like you you jump </garnt>
<joey> in the air yeah really [ __ ] high yeah </joey>
<joey> you can change direction in the air </joey>
<joey> again in any direction oh so you can </joey>
<joey> imagine it's like jump up fly back and </joey>
<joey> it's it's yeah i'm getting sick just </joey>
<joey> hearing it um but it's good um but i the </joey>
<joey> thing that i have difficulty with is </joey>
<joey> these headsets are not light yeah </joey>
<joey> they're uh they are uncomfortable to </joey>
<garnt> wear </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah the index i love the </garnt>
<connor> index amazing great piece of hardware it </connor>
<connor> is heavy and also the wires can suck my </connor>
<joey> dick i hate the wires yeah um what i </joey>
<joey> like about the oculus there's no wires </joey>
<garnt> yeah like the thing the thing is that i </garnt>
<garnt> can't play a virtual or i haven't been </garnt>
<garnt> able to play a virtual reality game more </garnt>
<garnt> than a few hours before either like my </garnt>
<garnt> head gets tired or i just want to chill </garnt>
<garnt> out and i just want to like because like </garnt>
<garnt> i start sweating a lot because you're </garnt>
<garnt> wearing i swear yeah yeah you you start </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like you were basically wearing a </garnt>
<garnt> sink on your head </garnt>
<connor> it's not comfortable at all and like i i </connor>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> i don't think i don't know if this is </connor>
<garnt> just like booming me talking but </garnt>
<garnt> i i can't see it being a real substitute </garnt>
<garnt> for just face-to-face interactions to me </garnt>
<joey> at least no it won't i mean like you </joey>
<joey> know again like in order for the </joey>
<joey> metaverse thing to really pop off it </joey>
<connor> needs to be like vi headsets need to be </connor>
<connor> common enough in every household as much </connor>
<joey> as like say a computer is today right </joey>
<connor> and i just don't see it happening for a </connor>
<joey> while the oculus just isn't it isn't </joey>
<garnt> quite there and it's also expensive </garnt>
<joey> i think the oculus is 300 bucks yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and yeah that's that's uh that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's steep for a lot of people yeah um </garnt>
<joey> i think you know if you look at the the </joey>
<joey> the progress we've made in the past what </joey>
<joey> 10 years when did the htc revive come </joey>
<joey> out that was the first big one wasn't </joey>
<joey> the first big yeah what was that when </joey>
<joey> did the htc vive get released nationally </joey>
<connor> you can even look htc what </connor>
<joey> i thought it was the oculus rift was the </joey>
<garnt> first like real </garnt>
<connor> big one that's the first one i heard was </connor>
<connor> that like the one that was with steam </connor>
<garnt> yes that was that's the oculus rift that </garnt>
<garnt> was like the the og oculus rift that was </garnt>
<connor> before facebook facebook with the mouse </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah htc vive was unveiled in march </joey>
<connor> 2015. okay what about the oculus rift </connor>
<joey> the original yeah the original oculus </joey>
<joey> rift was along with the roller coasters </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i thought the the htc vive was </connor>
<joey> the first time vr headsets became like </joey>
<joey> somewhat vulnerable like a thing like to </joey>
<joey> play games like seriously </joey>
<joey> watch 2016. oh okay </joey>
<joey> know i could be totally wrong i don't </joey>
<joey> you could google what the first vr heads </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> i think it's fair to say at least to my </joey>
<joey> memory at least </joey>
<garnt> that i think the htc vive was the first </garnt>
<garnt> headset that came out that like made </garnt>
<garnt> gaming seem like it </garnt>
<garnt> made sense yeah on that on a it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> just a gimmick it was like you could </garnt>
<garnt> actually play games like super hot was </garnt>
<garnt> amazing uh some of the demos are really </garnt>
<garnt> good and there were games coming out </garnt>
<garnt> here and there that were pretty good as </garnt>
<connor> well yeah </connor>
<connor> no you know i think we thought there was </connor>
<connor> going to be a big boom </connor>
<connor> but it there really hasn't been it's </connor>
<garnt> just many games in the past seven years </garnt>
<connor> it's just because the money isn't there </connor>
<joey> right now because it's so hard </joey>
<joey> there's so many barriers of entry um for </joey>
<joey> buying like a vr game so like the only </joey>
<joey> big game i can think of is half-life </joey>
<joey> um that's that's the only like game </joey>
<joey> where i look at this vr game and it's </joey>
<joey> like stands up as like a game game you </joey>
<joey> know it's like a lot of games that i </joey>
<connor> play on on vr it seems like a tech demo </connor>
<joey> with like it seems like a glorified tech </joey>
<connor> demo but like half-life actually feels </connor>
<connor> like a game and that's because you know </connor>
<connor> valve like invested in it and i don't </connor>
<connor> even like i can't believe they made </connor>
<connor> profit on it at all like because i feel </connor>
<garnt> like that was more of just them flexing </garnt>
<garnt> to be like guys we still made games </garnt>
<garnt> remember remember remember we made games </garnt>
<garnt> we were a [ __ ] real [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> uh game developer back in the day we </garnt>
<connor> could still do it we could still be good </connor>
<connor> we still got a video i played a lot of </connor>
<joey> games on the vr and super hot is still </joey>
<joey> probably the best yeah </joey>
<joey> that's the game that i get when people </joey>
<joey> come to my house and i'm like you want </joey>
<connor> to try out yeah super hot is the game </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah try this yeah because it's so </garnt>
<connor> good yeah it's so good super hot and </connor>
<connor> beat saber which is the best vr </connor>
<garnt> experience i've probably had yeah </garnt>
<connor> so far it's </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<joey> i understand because like setting up the </joey>
<joey> valve index is like it's the best </joey>
<garnt> headset right if you want performance </garnt>
<joey> yeah gaming </joey>
<joey> but my god but like i i i think the k </joey>
<joey> one it is set that thing up and you need </joey>
<garnt> a space big enough yeah which is another </garnt>
<connor> reason why it like in japan is like not </connor>
<garnt> popular at all no yeah i think my </garnt>
<garnt> problem with vr gaming that i've had so </garnt>
<garnt> far is that it turns gaming </garnt>
<garnt> uh for like for me gaming is like a </garnt>
<joey> passive activity but vr gaming is </joey>
<joey> definitely an active activity for me </joey>
<joey> where i you know you feel physically </joey>
<joey> involved it doesn't feel like i like it </joey>
<joey> no i i do like that as well but like </joey>
<joey> that you know </joey>
<joey> when you have like a [ __ ] eight-hour </joey>
<joey> 10-hour gaming session i don't want to </joey>
<joey> that that's like there's only so long i </joey>
<connor> can have yeah i can do something active </connor>
<connor> right for that period of time like to me </connor>
<garnt> a lot of games are a passive activity </garnt>
<garnt> where you sit down on the couch or sit </garnt>
<garnt> at your pc you just like chill there i </garnt>
<joey> think it also depends on like the the </joey>
<joey> demographic as well right like because </joey>
<joey> i'm sure like you know the average 10 </joey>
<connor> year old has a lot more [ __ ] energy </connor>
<connor> to move around for eight to ten hours </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah versus like you know </connor>
<joey> someone who's in like their 40s when i </joey>
<connor> played a gorilla tag </connor>
<joey> yeah it's just all like 10 year olds </joey>
<connor> yeah it's all 10 year olds well like you </connor>
<connor> know i think back to like when i was </connor>
<connor> well i think back to when i was 10 and </connor>
<joey> the [ __ ] uh you remember the i toy </joey>
<joey> the camera on ps2 </joey>
<connor> like when that [ __ ] came out and you had </connor>
<connor> to like physically move around and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like you know that like as a 10 year old </connor>
<joey> that's like [ __ ] yeah i could do this </joey>
<joey> for hours if you got me an eye toy now </joey>
<joey> i'd probably be like an hour and a half </joey>
<garnt> and i'm done yeah without that to me </garnt>
<garnt> that was always like a gimmick you know </garnt>
<garnt> like that that one time you go to like </garnt>
<garnt> your cousin's house and they pull out </garnt>
<connor> the ddr map and you're like oh okay </connor>
<connor> we're having a ddr virtual boy yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah right right </connor>
<connor> matt that like barely registered yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like yeah you got a [ __ ] stamp </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> after like one like like one use or </garnt>
<connor> something it's a shame because i think </connor>
<connor> that like vr gaming </connor>
<joey> is some of the most </joey>
<joey> fun and rewarding gaming </joey>
<joey> out </joey>
<joey> there there's no incentive for people to </joey>
<joey> develop games for it like it's hard and </joey>
<joey> also it's like you know when you're a </joey>
<joey> kid and you i don't know if you've ever </joey>
<joey> had them uh i don't know what they're </joey>
<joey> called in australia but in the uk the </joey>
<joey> brand calls like uh scale electrics it's </joey>
<joey> like the you know those cars you have to </joey>
<joey> lay out that track yeah and then you </joey>
<joey> have the oh hot wheels all right maybe </joey>
<joey> kind of like hot wheels you lay out the </joey>
<joey> track and then you have those things </joey>
<joey> that like you turn the buttons and they </joey>
<connor> go </connor>
<connor> around the [ __ ] thing what are they </connor>
<connor> called and what's the generic name for </connor>
<connor> them i think you're right </connor>
<joey> it's like that that's what vr feels like </joey>
<joey> right now </joey>
<joey> it needs to get to the point where </joey>
<garnt> current gaming is where it feels like oh </garnt>
<joey> did you put on the headset you're good </joey>
<joey> to go yeah right now it's like i have to </joey>
<garnt> turn on the two base stations i have to </garnt>
<garnt> make sure all the cables are plugged in </garnt>
<garnt> oh i gotta install this update oh the </garnt>
<joey> tracking's off i gotta fix the tracking </joey>
<joey> it's like it's such a it's like going </joey>
<joey> back to that feeling as a kid where you </joey>
<joey> set up that that track you set it all up </joey>
<joey> just for that like 30 minutes of </joey>
<joey> enjoyment yeah and then you got to put </joey>
<joey> it all away yeah so like and until it </joey>
<joey> gets to the point where it doesn't feel </joey>
<joey> like a slog to set up it's not that it's </joey>
<joey> active i think i think it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> like a pain in the ass to set up and i </joey>
<joey> know it is i've got mine set up now to </joey>
<joey> the point where it's as painless as </joey>
<joey> possible and it's still a pain in the </joey>
<joey> air yeah like </joey>
<joey> that five minutes of me turning </joey>
<connor> everything on and doing it all it's just </connor>
<connor> a little bit annoying for my my lazy </connor>
<connor> gamer brain to want to do well because </connor>
<joey> you're so used to just the the turn on </joey>
<joey> immediately start yeah right right yeah </joey>
<joey> that makes sense yeah uh it's called </joey>
<joey> skeleton uh that's the brand of yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah is there a generic name </connor>
<joey> for that kind of product or i think it's </joey>
<joey> just motorized cars yeah just like that </joey>
<joey> yeah you know how like as a kid i think </joey>
<joey> we had a really dodgy one and it was </joey>
<connor> just a whole event setting it up yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it took so long yeah but like you </joey>
<connor> as i remember as a kid you had way more </connor>
<joey> patience you know right like not not </joey>
<connor> even as a kid but as a teenager as well </connor>
<joey> you know like you know i like you know i </joey>
<joey> tell people about the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> uh the [ __ ] efforts i had to go </joey>
<joey> through to even just [ __ ] watch anime </joey>
<joey> or play some visual novels and you have </joey>
<joey> to you have to like download like seven </joey>
<joey> million zip files </joey>
<joey> three tutorials about how to like </joey>
<joey> install this game </joey>
<joey> i think back to that now i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> man imagine like imagine trying to do </garnt>
<garnt> that now we can just press one button on </garnt>
<garnt> steam to like play play a lot of these </garnt>
<garnt> like japanese underground games and all </garnt>
<joey> that well even like console games right </joey>
<joey> like you had to like go into the bin to </joey>
<connor> look for the cartridge of the game and </connor>
<joey> then you had to [ __ ] put it in oh </joey>
<connor> it's not working pull it out blow on it </connor>
<garnt> a little bit put it back in turn it on </garnt>
<garnt> wait for it to load now you just [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> turn on your switch and the download </joey>
<connor> game is right there yeah but like i </connor>
<joey> thought i mean i buy my games cartridge </joey>
<joey> yeah oh really yeah i actually give them </joey>
<joey> to my like other people when i'm done </joey>
<garnt> with them oh okay </garnt>
<joey> but like a big thing that i've kind of </joey>
<joey> like felt recently is that </joey>
<joey> like i've kind of like thought what is </joey>
<joey> the direction that gaming is going to go </joey>
<joey> right what because i've uh i've recently </joey>
<joey> procured myself a playstation 5. i know </joey>
<joey> all right hello guys i know i know oh </joey>
<joey> you're the lucky few yeah the lucky few </joey>
<joey> and the reason i did that was entirely </joey>
<joey> because i was like i'm not gonna i don't </joey>
<joey> need a ps5 yet i don't need a ps5 and </joey>
<joey> then </joey>
<joey> horizon uh forbidden west came out and </joey>
<joey> horizon zero dawn is like one of my </joey>
<joey> favorite games of all time so i'm like </joey>
<garnt> all right this kind of deserved the </garnt>
<garnt> special treatment i'll try and go out my </garnt>
<garnt> way to get a ps5 in order to play this </garnt>
<garnt> game yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> the game looks [ __ ] amazing it looks </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fantastic right um but is it </garnt>
<garnt> is it that different from playing it on </garnt>
<joey> a ps4 i wouldn't really say so you know </joey>
<joey> i i i feel like hyper realism in video </joey>
<joey> games has almost reached the limit to </joey>
<joey> the point where it's like yeah we can't </joey>
<joey> get any better graphics don't look that </joey>
<connor> much different yeah yeah um like eight </connor>
<joey> years ago yeah they don't they they </joey>
<garnt> can't get any better than this like i </garnt>
<joey> remember jumping from like i remember </joey>
<joey> the first time i got my n64 and i played </joey>
<joey> super mario 64. and like my mind [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> blew yeah it was like i was like like </garnt>
<garnt> running around in 3d after </garnt>
<garnt> after 2d mario or all this time like i </garnt>
<garnt> could not comprehend yeah i was such an </garnt>
<joey> experience </joey>
<joey> like up is forward </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> what how does that work </joey>
<connor> and and now i'm just like i think there </connor>
<joey> are extra pixels that i'm that my eye is </joey>
<joey> seeing right now right i feel like you </joey>
<joey> have like a 12k like tv like yeah </joey>
<joey> i feel like it's a bit smoother because </joey>
<joey> there are slightly more frames but it's </joey>
<joey> only it suddenly isn't like the </joey>
<garnt> mind-blown kind of experience that i </garnt>
<joey> felt before but that's what i'm saying </joey>
<joey> like that that's why i feel like we've </joey>
<joey> almost reached that limit when it comes </joey>
<joey> to like amazing graphically how games </joey>
<joey> can be and that's why i feel like </joey>
<joey> especially the indie scene for the past </joey>
<connor> like 10 years has been more focused on </connor>
<connor> making these more like stylized games </connor>
<connor> like pixel games and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> like you know what i want back i want </connor>
<connor> cell shading in games back </connor>
<connor> can we have that back has it ever left </connor>
<connor> i think it's like it used to be in the </connor>
<connor> forefront i feel of like all the main </connor>
<connor> line games or like the main streams </connor>
<connor> in the way it was i think so i think for </connor>
<joey> like certain demographics like you know </joey>
<joey> like when like wind waker came out for </joey>
<joey> example everyone [ __ ] hated it at </joey>
<joey> first until they played and they </joey>
<garnt> realized how amazing it was yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> remember when everyone when wind waker </garnt>
<garnt> came out and there was so much </garnt>
<garnt> discussions in like magazines to be like </garnt>
<garnt> this is a step down </garnt>
<connor> like this is a graphical step that's </connor>
<connor> what the trend was right it was realism </connor>
<joey> really yeah it wasn't real and then and </joey>
<joey> then when we started getting used to the </joey>
<joey> cell shader [ __ ] like with um what's it </joey>
<joey> uh lollipop chainsaw is like another </joey>
<joey> game series that's like very cell shaded </joey>
<joey> very stylized right yeah people were </joey>
<joey> also like oh man this game looks </joey>
<joey> too [ __ ] weird like it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> not </joey>
<joey> pretty enough and then people </joey>
<joey> immediately when they played the game </joey>
<joey> they found out oh you know what this is </joey>
<joey> pretty but just on a different caliber </joey>
<garnt> of pretty yeah i mean like i would say </garnt>
<garnt> like wind waker has aged the best </garnt>
<joey> visually in terms like i i i would argue </joey>
<joey> like pretty much every zelda game yeah </joey>
<garnt> you know i mean i think it looks better </garnt>
<joey> than pokemon and the best thing yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly and the best thing is those </joey>
<joey> kinds of styles a lot of the times are </joey>
<joey> ageless yeah like like a cuphead yeah oh </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly or like you know like wind </connor>
<connor> waker looks just as good in even in </connor>
<connor> today's standards because it's so </connor>
<connor> stylized whereas if you go back to like </connor>
<connor> you know uh ocarina of time right you </connor>
<joey> you're like you're like oh </joey>
<garnt> not as pretty as my 12 year old my </garnt>
<connor> background i thought it was a fugly game </connor>
<joey> yeah it's not a pretty so if you have </joey>
<connor> the context you know the setting and </connor>
<joey> stuff it makes sense of course you know </joey>
<joey> people who say like you know with all </joey>
<joey> those n64 games who are like no no it </joey>
<joey> looks just as good today or obviously </joey>
<joey> they're just operating off nostalgia </joey>
<joey> yeah right but like anyone can look at </joey>
<joey> mario 64 and go </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] me that's an ugly game yeah you </connor>
<connor> know yeah it just think mario's foot </connor>
<joey> looks kind of good </joey>
<joey> you see compared to like ocarina well </joey>
<garnt> yeah like if you look at something like </garnt>
<garnt> goldeneye goldeneye looks awful oh that </garnt>
<garnt> looks beautiful </garnt>
<garnt> and you know and ocarina of time i think </garnt>
<joey> it looks awful i don't know mario 64 </joey>
<connor> like i i don't know why i think it looks </connor>
<connor> okay it i don't think it aged as bad as </connor>
<joey> you might think i think you you should </joey>
<joey> probably take like a closer look i have </joey>
<connor> i have i have because i was bouncing </connor>
<connor> looks like [ __ ] okay i'll give you that </connor>
<joey> bowser looks like [ __ ] the peach in the </joey>
<joey> opening scene i'm just like ah </joey>
<garnt> what is that that is true actually </garnt>
<garnt> because when i when i think of mario 64 </garnt>
<joey> for some reason i go to mario sunshine </joey>
<joey> yeah because that was like i guess my my </joey>
<joey> childhood marriage yeah yeah i remember </joey>
<joey> and mary sunshine has aged a lot better </joey>
<garnt> visually visually than mario 64 million </garnt>
<joey> times better yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah because uh with yeah i feel like </garnt>
<joey> that generation of games like um </joey>
<joey> i wouldn't say ps1 because like i look </joey>
<joey> back at like metal gear solid one and i </joey>
<connor> i look back at like pixels talking to </connor>
<connor> each other like snake's face does he </connor>
<connor> doesn't have detail it's like one </connor>
<connor> triangle it's just a triangle and i </connor>
<connor> remember thinking how the [ __ ] did i get </connor>
<garnt> invested in these cut scenes of the </garnt>
<garnt> snake going articon and it's just like a </garnt>
<garnt> pixel going </garnt>
<garnt> you know but like i i feel like the ps2 </garnt>
<garnt> gamecube era was kind of when we started </garnt>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> really getting to </joey>
<joey> getting to the point where i couldn't </joey>
<joey> see that much of a big jump in graphical </joey>
<joey> fidelity yeah yeah and then afterwards i </joey>
<joey> did see a difference with ps3 </joey>
<joey> ps3 to me is when it kind of like peaked </joey>
<joey> you know where you know what last of us </joey>
<joey> originally came out on the ps3 right and </joey>
<joey> i was just like i to me like the </joey>
<garnt> original last of us </garnt>
<garnt> like pretty much every game looks about </garnt>
<garnt> the same as last year yes you know even </garnt>
<garnt> though i could tell they look </garnt>
<garnt> graphically better they're not that much </garnt>
<garnt> graphically better that i think my god </garnt>
<garnt> this is a [ __ ] mind-blowing amount of </garnt>
<connor> improvement yeah </connor>
<connor> he looks pretty bad though </connor>
<joey> that's because the wii had like very </joey>
<joey> limited hardware where are we in um </joey>
<joey> isn't it 480p the wii u i think i think </joey>
<joey> so it has a native resolution of 40. </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's just upscale yeah it looks </joey>
<joey> rough when you go back and play it </joey>
<joey> you're like oh because i remember as a </joey>
<joey> kid when super smash brothers melee no </joey>
<joey> uh brawl came out yeah remember i </joey>
<joey> thought dude this is like the pinnacle </joey>
<joey> i thought i thought that was a twilight </joey>
<joey> princess yeah insane yeah and i looked </joey>
<joey> back like a like a year ago and i was </joey>
<joey> like what the [ __ ] it looked like that </joey>
<joey> the entire time </joey>
<joey> i think because i'm i'm remembering the </joey>
<joey> rendered cutscenes for that game yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah the cut scenes look amazing yeah </joey>
<connor> because they're coming because of course </connor>
<joey> they're [ __ ] yeah but i think with in </joey>
<joey> the case with that generation of </joey>
<connor> consoles like the wii i think it depends </connor>
<connor> on the game as well because like </connor>
<connor> twilight princess still looks great even </connor>
<joey> though that's a wii game that's it i </joey>
<joey> think it still looks great i haven't </joey>
<connor> liked it but the competitor i think </connor>
<connor> every single footage i've seen try </connor>
<connor> princess of late has been the uh hd </connor>
<joey> remix </joey>
<joey> but if you look at it comparatively like </joey>
<joey> a lot of these like hd remasters i don't </joey>
<joey> really see the point of calling them hd </joey>
<joey> remasters because if you put them side </joey>
<joey> by side they're really unless you're </joey>
<joey> like a [ __ ] you know pixel snob like </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna see like you know when </joey>
<joey> uh final fantasy 10 remastered came out </joey>
<joey> right like the hd remaster yeah i played </joey>
<joey> it and i was like how does this look any </joey>
<joey> different to the ps2 version oh it's </joey>
<connor> like did you just did you see the uh the </connor>
<joey> gta </joey>
<joey> uh three remastered no that was a </joey>
<joey> disaster really it was like the game </joey>
<garnt> load worse </garnt>
<joey> did you all see this i didn't see this </joey>
<joey> it was like a massive controversy no i </joey>
<joey> didn't say this at all they like took </joey>
<joey> off the original grand theft auto and </joey>
<joey> you couldn't buy it right the original </joey>
<joey> third one yeah and they were like you </joey>
<joey> have to buy the remake they they </joey>
<joey> reversed it a little bit i can't </joey>
<joey> remember exactly what they did </joey>
<joey> but they released this remake and it </joey>
<joey> looked worse than the original it was </joey>
<joey> like they just turned like the </joey>
<joey> smoothness option on like everything had </joey>
<joey> just been smooth right right people just </joey>
<joey> looked even weirder in the cut scenes </joey>
<joey> and all of it looked have you not seen </joey>
<joey> the oh okay let me quickly grab a few </joey>
<joey> images and show you i'm going to type in </joey>
<joey> uh grandpa auto </joey>
<connor> gta 3 remaster </connor>
<connor> um images images </connor>
<connor> comparison </connor>
<connor> comparison okay </connor>
<connor> yeah so like look at this </connor>
<connor> this is the original and this is the </connor>
<connor> remastered </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<garnt> that's gross that's just uncanny yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there's also yeah um there's so many </garnt>
<garnt> where like it doesn't look </garnt>
<joey> like that much better yeah yeah it's </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> i i i'd say the original has more </garnt>
<connor> character to it yeah yeah a lot of the </connor>
<connor> cut scenes the characters just look </connor>
<connor> worse yeah it was really weird i just </connor>
<joey> don't understand but that's the thing </joey>
<joey> with like again that's the thing with </joey>
<joey> like hd remasters right like when they </joey>
<joey> did this theory master of wind waker i </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> this legitimately looks no different it </joey>
<connor> still looks just as good it does look a </connor>
<connor> bit crisper yeah </connor>
<joey> it's very minute though i would say </joey>
<connor> right like like you know compared to </connor>
<garnt> like final fantasy vii and final fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> vii remake right like you know yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly like you know that's that's a </joey>
<connor> big that's a big jump yeah it's like </connor>
<joey> jumping it's a different remake and a </joey>
<joey> rematch right right it's true well yeah </joey>
<joey> they just kind of like </joey>
<connor> upped the contrast and smoothed it all </connor>
<connor> out and made it probably just higher </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah higher higher resolution but </joey>
<connor> like it's like a style it's so stylized </connor>
<joey> yeah that like in terms of like actual </joey>
<joey> graphical updates or upgrades it's like </joey>
<joey> it's not something to write home about </joey>
<connor> yeah if you look at the images it just </connor>
<connor> looks like the edges are smoother yeah </connor>
<joey> like rtx has been turned on well you </joey>
<joey> know you're not going to see that big of </joey>
<connor> a difference when you're playing the </connor>
<joey> game it wouldn't make a difference </joey>
<connor> experience play in the game not at all </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i guess that's talking about </garnt>
<garnt> like the graphical differences as well </garnt>
<garnt> but in terms like gameplay differences i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like the gaming industry as a whole </garnt>
<garnt> has just like optimized pretty much like </garnt>
<garnt> 90 of everything they can that can be </garnt>
<garnt> optimized and you know every so often we </garnt>
<garnt> get something like uh breath of the wild </garnt>
<garnt> that completely changes the way you look </garnt>
<garnt> at like an open world for example yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and now every open world game has a </garnt>
<garnt> glider for some reason even if it </garnt>
<connor> doesn't need it </connor>
<garnt> i feel like the technology is </garnt>
<garnt> less so focused on </garnt>
<garnt> making the things very uh high graphics </garnt>
<joey> or making the textures more advanced </joey>
<joey> it's like i think right now a lot of the </joey>
<joey> technology from what i understand is </joey>
<joey> focused on like um like the the lighting </joey>
<joey> and stuff right so yeah making it so </joey>
<joey> when you put a character in a world that </joey>
<joey> you can add all of the effects naturally </joey>
<joey> so instead of having a beam of light and </joey>
<joey> you programming like the light is here </joey>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> you program the room and then you have a </joey>
<joey> bunch of options to like turn on the </joey>
<joey> i've got the name of the lighting thing </joey>
<joey> is it's like it's like lighting where it </joey>
<joey> uses like the calculations like figure </joey>
<joey> out what would happen if like a ball </joey>
<joey> went in the way yeah reflection stuff i </joey>
<joey> think that's where a lot of the </joey>
<joey> advancements are being made not so much </joey>
<joey> in like the individual </joey>
<joey> um like assets makeup because yeah the </joey>
<joey> models that we have of characters in </joey>
<joey> games are very very high quality oh they </joey>
<garnt> are yeah and they have been for a while </garnt>
<joey> yeah the only thing that's left is </joey>
<joey> making how the models interact with the </joey>
<garnt> world </garnt>
<garnt> more realistic if they want that or you </garnt>
<garnt> know whatever they want to do and so now </garnt>
<garnt> it's about making the machines that can </garnt>
<joey> do these animations or do these things </joey>
<joey> built in and do them smoother from what </joey>
<connor> i understand i could be totally wrong </connor>
<joey> someone might correct that that's what i </joey>
<garnt> want to know right it's like what's the </garnt>
<joey> once we've perfected that hypothetically </joey>
<garnt> what's the next step well that's why i </garnt>
<garnt> do look to vr because i do remember the </garnt>
<garnt> first time i tried beat saber and the </garnt>
<garnt> first time i tried superhot i did get </garnt>
<garnt> that same kind of feeling that i got </garnt>
<garnt> playing super mario 64 for the first </garnt>
<joey> time which is just like your brain has </joey>
<joey> never experienced something like this </joey>
<joey> before and it's just [ __ ] pure </joey>
<joey> cocaine it was like </joey>
<joey> like the first time i played super vr </joey>
<joey> was like it's like one of the funnest </joey>
<joey> gaming experiences i've ever had yeah </joey>
<joey> like period absolutely but like that was </joey>
<garnt> that was an hour or so or however long </garnt>
<connor> it took me to play super bowl there's no </connor>
<connor> big games in vr actually yeah they're </connor>
<joey> all really good like one to three hours </joey>
<joey> where's the next mark where's the mario </joey>
<joey> vr game dude </joey>
<connor> i want to mario vr game where i am mario </connor>
<connor> it means that movement is limited </connor>
<joey> movement yeah you if you let like mario </joey>
<joey> kart vr was mario kart v yeah yeah it </joey>
<connor> could be i think there are racing games </connor>
<joey> in vr well they did it in uh they did it </joey>
<joey> in mario land so why can't they do it in </joey>
<connor> an oculus that was not very good though </connor>
<connor> that wasn't very good but </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean right like if we </connor>
<joey> get like a mario kart vr </joey>
<connor> i think right now like movement is </connor>
<joey> really hard yeah and when movement is </joey>
<joey> realistic it's not good </joey>
<joey> that's not what you want right but also </joey>
<joey> if you add unrealistic movement to your </joey>
<joey> character it becomes really hard to make </joey>
<joey> it feel real like that game i mentioned </joey>
<joey> where you jump around yeah you don't </joey>
<joey> jump around you just point the stick and </joey>
<joey> press jump because you can't do that </joey>
<joey> movement there's no i can't i can't jump </joey>
<joey> in my [ __ ] room like an engine right </joey>
<garnt> i wish i could you know </garnt>
<garnt> i want to be on the sidelines watching </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah i wish i could i will never </garnt>
<garnt> get bored of like the random [ __ ] every </garnt>
<garnt> like random clips like that sometimes </garnt>
<connor> get recommended on my youtube of like </connor>
<connor> grandma's trying vr for the first time </connor>
<connor> and like them doing like the balance </connor>
<garnt> beam game or something just like jumping </garnt>
<garnt> head first into a wall jumping </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> or like the grandma who like oh i think </joey>
<joey> it was a grandma or grandpa who did like </joey>
<joey> the the climbing one and uh they like </joey>
<joey> slowly fell </joey>
<garnt> like they fell into like a table or </garnt>
<connor> something </connor>
<connor> i know there's some places you can do it </connor>
<joey> and it's like an activity </joey>
<garnt> the vr headsets that the cables go up to </garnt>
<joey> the roof yeah and it's like a treadmill </joey>
<garnt> you're standing yeah yeah yeah yeah like </garnt>
<joey> an omni directional oh yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah you can't have a gun and then you </connor>
<joey> like run around </joey>
<joey> i know if there's one place in shinjuku </joey>
<joey> i think you can do that really yeah with </joey>
<joey> the treadmills </joey>
<joey> i know there's a few in america yeah it </joey>
<garnt> looks really cool it looks really nice </garnt>
<garnt> really i like to try that out yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> imagine it's one where it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> trampoline that gives you like feedback </garnt>
<garnt> based on how much pressure you put on </garnt>
<garnt> the trampoline or something </garnt>
<garnt> kind of thing yeah because like i feel </garnt>
<joey> like you're in gravity and the </joey>
<garnt> trampoline gets stiffer yeah yeah and if </garnt>
<joey> it's like less you know you're on like a </joey>
<connor> swan planet like yeah </connor>
<garnt> that'd be cool i don't know how you do </garnt>
<garnt> that because like i've heard like one </garnt>
<garnt> technique that people use to combat </garnt>
<connor> motion sickness in vr games right is to </connor>
<connor> literally drinking uh vitamin c </connor>
<joey> eating a [ __ ] ton of oranges eating a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] heart pouring some salt </connor>
<connor> in their wounds </connor>
<connor> but uh also actually just like walking </connor>
<joey> like walking in the spot you know like </joey>
<joey> like just literally just literally </joey>
<joey> you're like just moving your legs to </joey>
<joey> make it feel like you're walking and </joey>
<joey> it's just weird that that just like </joey>
<joey> that is enough streak your brain into </joey>
<garnt> thinking oh okay this is this is real </garnt>
<garnt> walking now i can understand this right </garnt>
<connor> i've never done that before i should try </connor>
<connor> it i should try that i don't know </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean like it's it's vr right now </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> at the very new stages i'm very </garnt>
<garnt> interested to see </garnt>
<garnt> how and like if if gaming gets to a </garnt>
<garnt> point where this kind of does become </garnt>
<garnt> mainstream and we get some like actual </garnt>
<garnt> aaa games with vr games because yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right now </garnt>
<garnt> it seems like a very overpriced piece of </garnt>
<garnt> tech for a lot of tech demos </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's a shame because i really </connor>
<garnt> like it i really want it to evolve </garnt>
<joey> but i think it's going to be where i i </joey>
<connor> think it would be really sick and </connor>
<connor> mainstream for like another 10 years at </connor>
<joey> least i'm just waiting man i want sword </joey>
<garnt> online </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to be jamming in vr when it's </garnt>
<garnt> out man oh yeah yeah i want to be that </garnt>
<garnt> that dad that is like in like doing his </garnt>
<connor> pc stuff all the time playing games i'm </connor>
<joey> i'm going to be that dad of course of </joey>
<joey> course we're going to be the generation </joey>
<joey> when we're retired we're like oh finally </joey>
<joey> i can get started on that back catalog </joey>
<garnt> of games right yeah aren't we getting </garnt>
<garnt> close to the year that sword arsenal </garnt>
<garnt> line was set now as well 2025 i think </garnt>
<connor> yeah something like that i mean it could </connor>
<joey> be done just like i don't know how i </joey>
<connor> remember just like just hook a wire up </connor>
<joey> to your like pc or something that like </joey>
<joey> electrocutes you if you die in the game </joey>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> like you actually just like gives you </joey>
<joey> like a like like a shock </joey>
<joey> it gives you a lethal voltage if you die </joey>
<joey> in the game like we could just do we </joey>
<joey> could probably do it now we just don't </joey>
<joey> because we're scared of what we could </joey>
<connor> create i'm sure there's something we're </connor>
<joey> scared of in advancements in technology </joey>
<joey> 2022 so this year oh this year actually </joey>
<garnt> this </garnt>
<joey> is this year let's go </joey>
<garnt> i i actually read i think they're </garnt>
<joey> releasing like someone's releasing an </joey>
<garnt> mmo the first vr mmo </garnt>
<joey> oh my god it's real it's real it's real </joey>
<joey> we can barely make good mmos </joey>
<connor> now i hope i get selected as a beater </connor>
<joey> you are a better chance </joey>
<connor> but yeah i hate to date the video but uh </connor>
<joey> i just want to talk about this one thing </joey>
<connor> uh that i saw on twitter this morning </connor>
<joey> right uh </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> old news by the time so probably all </connor>
<connor> news by the time this comes out but i </connor>
<connor> just couldn't [ __ ] believe it um </connor>
<joey> snoop dogg </joey>
<joey> has joined faze clan </joey>
<joey> what i'm not even joking </joey>
<joey> he has joined face clan as </joey>
<joey> faze snoop </joey>
<garnt> okay okay what do you think about okay </garnt>
<joey> okay i might be out of touch here yeah </joey>
<joey> what is a face client well like i know </joey>
<connor> face clan but </connor>
<garnt> i don't know facetime what are face clan </garnt>
<connor> like like what is a phase called what </connor>
<connor> it's um you know it's a it was </connor>
<joey> originally a youtuber organization and </joey>
<joey> now it's an esports organization right </joey>
<connor> yeah and then so so they always had it </connor>
<joey> was back in the day when cod started </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah that's how it started i </garnt>
<garnt> followed it then but like they've seemed </garnt>
<garnt> to like </garnt>
<garnt> just gone out of that little bubble i </garnt>
<joey> don't know what phase is anymore i don't </joey>
<joey> know either are they just like a like a </joey>
<connor> youtube house </connor>
<connor> no it's like a brand and you know if you </connor>
<garnt> if you're </garnt>
<joey> anointed interface anointed </joey>
<joey> united interface you get uh </joey>
<garnt> you do genuinely get a lot of success </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah it's a very powerful brand </joey>
<joey> yeah with younger audiences normally </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> not </joey>
<connor> a lot of people </connor>
<connor> our age watch facebook are they still 15 </connor>
<garnt> 16 yeah are they still an esports </garnt>
<garnt> organization or yeah they do everything </garnt>
<connor> it's kind of like a brand you know </connor>
<garnt> there's okay that's kind of what that </garnt>
<joey> that's it's like an agency yeah so it's </joey>
<joey> from what i understand it's more of an </joey>
<joey> agency right but but all of the esports </joey>
<joey> brands </joey>
<joey> are all kind of going that way right now </joey>
<joey> because they realize that relying only </joey>
<joey> on esports is not the best for business </joey>
<joey> yeah because you can you know if your </joey>
<joey> team competes only four times six times </joey>
<joey> a year that's you you have to you can </joey>
<joey> only monetize the sponsors and then </joey>
<joey> those events yeah whereas if you're </joey>
<joey> you're an entertainer you can monetize </joey>
<connor> every time they upload or do something </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean now it just seems like a lot of </garnt>
<connor> esports organizations are just streamer </connor>
<connor> organizations because that's that's what </connor>
<connor> i feel would like with phase phase clan </connor>
<connor> now i'm just like are they still the </connor>
<garnt> esports organization or the uh </garnt>
<garnt> entertainment i always thought it was </garnt>
<joey> like amazing i always thought it was </joey>
<joey> like you know kind of like uh factioned </joey>
<joey> off whereas like these like we have a </joey>
<joey> bunch of face clan members who are like </joey>
<joey> the esports players who don't go on </joey>
<joey> twitch or youtube or anything yeah and </joey>
<joey> then we have the youtubers and then we </joey>
<joey> have the twitch streamers and then you </joey>
<connor> know well a lot of the time as well they </connor>
<connor> they want to get </connor>
<connor> the the best players in </connor>
<joey> a game or a genre because </joey>
<joey> normally the best players at any game if </joey>
<joey> they stream they will have an audience </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> not necessarily always but they've a lot </joey>
<joey> better chance of getting an audience </joey>
<joey> right right you know yeah you can kind </joey>
<connor> of help them and coach them through it </connor>
<joey> well they're definitely going to get a </joey>
<joey> bigger audience now now that snoop doo </joey>
<garnt> double g has joined i don't know for </garnt>
<joey> some reason when i heard that i'm just </joey>
<garnt> like that doesn't sound surprising to me </garnt>
<connor> i don't know why i don't know why i'm </connor>
<connor> just like does some interesting </connor>
<joey> i'm sure the deal is very good for snoop </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i'm sure it's an extremely good </joey>
<joey> deal i'm sure he needs the money </joey>
<garnt> well to me has the same energy of uh do </garnt>
<joey> you remember like back when you know uh </joey>
<joey> when e3 happened and you'd see like </joey>
<joey> these press conferences and then like at </joey>
<joey> every like e3 presentation they'd be </joey>
<joey> they'd have this like run one random </joey>
<joey> celebrity come on to promote their games </joey>
<joey> like i don't know like [ __ ] drake </joey>
<joey> promoting madden or something you know </joey>
<joey> what i mean yeah that it has the same </joey>
<joey> energy as that for me it does yeah where </joey>
<joey> you just get like this random </joey>
<joey> whether this random celebrity to promote </joey>
<joey> your brand or to your game </joey>
<joey> um and it wouldn't make any sense but </joey>
<garnt> you know i just it makes </garnt>
<garnt> it it makes sense because it's so it's </garnt>
<garnt> such meme worthy that people are going </garnt>
<garnt> to talk about it anyway oh yeah of </garnt>
<garnt> course and sleep dog has done plenty of </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah i mean he's so </joey>
<connor> amazingly in touch with like internet </connor>
<joey> audiences and just meme culture that </joey>
<connor> like he's it's just like a win for him </connor>
<joey> it's just i don't know there's something </joey>
<joey> weird about </joey>
<joey> this is something weird about when he's </joey>
<connor> always we have to call him face snoop </connor>
<joey> now he's always posting on instagram and </joey>
<joey> stuff and all that </joey>
<joey> and he like like doxed his uber driver </joey>
<joey> or something what he like doxxed his </joey>
<joey> like delivery or door dash person yeah </joey>
<joey> because they didn't like deliver the </joey>
<garnt> food right he like showed a picture in </garnt>
<garnt> their first name </garnt>
<garnt> to all of his followers oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> because he was shown the interaction </garnt>
<joey> that he i think super dog was upset that </joey>
<joey> they didn't deliver the food and i think </joey>
<joey> snoop was trying to tell him where to go </joey>
<joey> all right because obviously snoop lives </joey>
<joey> in like a </joey>
<garnt> gated community right it's probably a </garnt>
<joey> bit harder to give it to him yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and he was like complaining on his </joey>
<joey> twitter and showed the face and name of </joey>
<joey> the person and this guy got like a lot </joey>
<joey> of hate i think jesus poor guy poor guy </joey>
<joey> i don't know just </joey>
<joey> for me it's like really fascinating just </joey>
<joey> watching these like very </joey>
<connor> traditional celebrities and like music </connor>
<connor> artists and whatnot like kind of really </connor>
<connor> dig their heels into things like twitch </connor>
<connor> and youtube and stuff like that you know </connor>
<connor> like when i found out like you know </connor>
<connor> t-pain </connor>
<connor> regularly streams on twitch and he has </connor>
<connor> like a pretty [ __ ] massive order he </connor>
<garnt> plays streams on twitch yeah t-pain </garnt>

<joey> he's just streaming like dead mouse as </joey>
<garnt> well he's just streaming on twitter i </garnt>
<garnt> know deadmau5 streams on twitch and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just i don't know it's really bizarre </garnt>
<joey> that like uh at least i find it very </joey>
<joey> bizarre to see these like people who </joey>
<joey> usually ever see yeah the people you'd </joey>
<joey> only ever see on like tv shows and like </joey>
<connor> music videos and stuff like that it's </connor>
<connor> just suddenly being like </connor>
<connor> oh yeah you know i just dropped a five </connor>
<joey> dollar donation to t-pain the other day </joey>
<joey> on twitch you know </joey>
<connor> this is weird to say out loud i don't </connor>
<connor> know d-pain stream </connor>
<garnt> he's streamed 1400 hours he's got the </garnt>
<garnt> analytics up i'm looking at i'm looking </garnt>
<garnt> at a real streamer boy here yeah </garnt>
<joey> he's uh </joey>
<joey> he's active normally one day a week one </joey>
<joey> day okay and normally uh </joey>
<connor> he shoots quite well i think i'm sure </connor>
<joey> he's i'm sure he's busy doing other </joey>
<garnt> things sure he's streaming </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> he's </garnt>
<connor> oh wow yeah he's quite active yeah </connor>
<joey> i was surprised i just ran because i </joey>
<joey> remember i was just like going through </joey>
<joey> twitch one day and you know like the </joey>
<joey> channels you should watch thing you know </joey>
<joey> came up and on the top of it it just </joey>
<joey> said t-pain i was like that can't be the </joey>
<connor> same t-pain right the guy who wrote </connor>
<connor> through the fire in flames </connor>
<joey> oh the guitarist for dragon force yeah </joey>
<connor> he streams the guitarist and the drummer </connor>
<connor> actually </connor>
<connor> really regularly i remember they wanted </connor>
<connor> to perform their song but they couldn't </connor>
<joey> for copyright reasons yeah yeah that's </joey>
<connor> that sounds like it sounds like the age </connor>
<connor> of the internet yeah right copyright </connor>
<joey> laws are broken yeah no like i remember </joey>
<joey> like when uh </joey>
<connor> well they weren't </connor>
<connor> yeah when like gordon ramsay replied to </connor>
<garnt> xqc or something </garnt>
<garnt> about the cooking thing that that was so </garnt>
<connor> surreal </connor>
<connor> i don't think that's called i'm pretty </connor>
<connor> sure that's just someone managing his </connor>
<connor> account but i think gordon has very good </connor>
<garnt> people in charge i don't know because </garnt>
<garnt> gordon's pretty active on like tick tock </garnt>
<garnt> right he's pretty active on like social </garnt>
<connor> media platforms </connor>
<connor> that he's he's he's keeping up with it </connor>
<garnt> yeah i think gordon has a very good team </garnt>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> zoomers </joey>
<joey> like teaching him and telling him what </joey>
<joey> to do because like in this in one of his </joey>
<joey> videos he just kept talking about uncle </joey>
<connor> roger and i was like you obviously have </connor>
<connor> someone who's like keeping you in touch </connor>
<garnt> and telling you </garnt>
<garnt> well obviously yeah we've talked about </garnt>
<garnt> how whoever they've hired for like the </garnt>
<garnt> kitchen nightmares um titles on youtube </garnt>
<joey> right yeah like top ten times the food </joey>
<garnt> was busting yeah </garnt>
<connor> like that was like an actual youtube </connor>
<garnt> title like what is happening </garnt>
<connor> and it worked it worked it got so many </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] views yeah it's like a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> decade old show now or something </garnt>
<connor> the people running </connor>
<joey> his accounts are like on top of their </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] oh yeah i i i don't even want to </joey>
<joey> know how much the kitchen nightmares </joey>
<joey> youtube account makes cause i've noticed </joey>
<joey> as well the youtube kitchen nightmares </joey>
<joey> account </joey>
<joey> literally just repost the same clips </joey>
<joey> with different titles and different </joey>
<joey> montages all the time really they'll be </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> chopped ten times the burger was good </joey>
<joey> and then i'll then next we'll be like </joey>
<joey> top ten times the food was good and </joey>
<joey> they'll just reuse the same clips yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so they just keep making different </joey>
<joey> lists and then </joey>
<connor> timeline there i always got time i would </connor>
<garnt> even if i've seen this clip like 10 </garnt>
<joey> million times before all right how </joey>
<connor> awesome is it actually i gotta find out </connor>
<connor> nightmares </connor>
<garnt> oh my god and i think another one was </garnt>
<garnt> like when the food wasn't busted top ten </garnt>
<garnt> times the food wasn't busting </garnt>
<joey> right kitchen nightmares gets </joey>
<joey> on average or uh fluctuates from </joey>
<joey> anywhere between </joey>
<joey> 30 to 70 million views a month holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> that's probably in the range of like uh </joey>
<connor> it could be anywhere from like a hundred </connor>
<connor> to two hundred grand a month well yeah </connor>
<joey> knowing how well food channels do yeah </joey>
<connor> it's probably two hundred thousand two </connor>
<garnt> hundred </garnt>
<garnt> dollars yeah which is what which makes </garnt>
<garnt> me wonder why don't more reality tv </garnt>
<garnt> shows post as many [ __ ] clips as they </garnt>
<joey> possibly can well because a lot of the </joey>
<joey> production team are out of touch or </joey>
<connor> maybe some copyright issues </connor>
<connor> probably a mixture of things also </connor>
<joey> probably a lack of faith that they'll do </joey>
<connor> well yeah yeah you know kids nightmares </connor>
<connor> brand is still very strong </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> like what what show were you thinking of </joey>
<joey> specifically like pretty much any </joey>
<garnt> reality tv show i feel like big brother </garnt>
<joey> like 90 day fiance yeah you know like </joey>
<joey> any basically anything made by tlc </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] the bachelor like [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> that like i feel like reality tv in like </garnt>
<garnt> especially reality tv was meant to be </garnt>
<garnt> watched in a group well tlc uploads </garnt>
<connor> clips </connor>
<garnt> all the time that's why they're so they </garnt>
<connor> do so well because they upload all the </connor>
<connor> clippable moments that's that's how 90 </connor>
<joey> day fiance got big to begin with right </joey>
<garnt> it's because the clips went viral i </garnt>
<garnt> would like i i wonder if it would do </garnt>
<garnt> even better on like if they </garnt>
<garnt> not only uploaded whole episodes but </garnt>
<garnt> like uploaded a whole episode uploaded </garnt>
<garnt> clips uploaded like [ __ ] montages </garnt>
<garnt> like with the kitchen nightmare things </garnt>
<garnt> because it feels like </garnt>
<joey> this kind of content is just infinitely </joey>
<joey> recyclable because it's content that </joey>
<joey> you're gonna [ __ ] watch whenever you </joey>
<joey> have like a lunch and you need to sit </joey>
<joey> down and you're like what clip do i want </joey>
<joey> to watch oh maybe i'll just watch </joey>
<joey> kitchen nightmares maybe i'll just watch </joey>
<joey> nine state fiance again the same [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> big head clip or whatever you know </joey>
<joey> you never get tired of them you're just </joey>
<connor> you'll just never get tired of that yeah </connor>
<connor> the clip of somebody who's over like 600 </connor>
<connor> pounds yeah </connor>
<joey> or someone with like a gross uh you know </joey>
<connor> obsession or yeah </connor>
<connor> coffee animal i like smelling butt holes </connor>
<garnt> thank you </garnt>
<garnt> was it like what was that show like my </garnt>
<garnt> weird my session </garnt>
<joey> gets me every time i'm just like there's </joey>
<joey> no way someone actually does that and </joey>
<joey> they do </joey>
<garnt> and like gross the one thing that makes </garnt>
<garnt> me cringe the most for some reason is </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<connor> it was this one british woman who eats </connor>
<connor> concrete </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah yeah and it wasn't the fact </connor>
<connor> that she was just better than british </connor>
<connor> food </connor>
<garnt> that is a british delicacy right </garnt>
<joey> developing a strong jawline with that </joey>
<connor> one yeah yeah you told me they were like </connor>
<connor> why do legos have do not eat warnings </connor>
<joey> and british food doesn't </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> validate that's true no it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> the noise that it made when she was </garnt>
<connor> crunching oh she was crunchy </connor>
<connor> yeah i can hear she have any </connor>
<garnt> you know that feeling where you </garnt>
<joey> accidentally get sand in your mouth and </joey>
<connor> it's just like </connor>
<joey> i don't know it's just the worst problem </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> feeling alone that feeling i understand </joey>
<joey> anakin for that one for that one moment </joey>
<joey> where you accidentally get sand in your </joey>
<garnt> mouth and you just spend the next five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes just like oh there's just a </garnt>
<garnt> weird crunch in there yeah i can't get </garnt>
<joey> rid of it i think maybe the reason why </joey>
<joey> like a lot of like you know shows like </joey>
<joey> that reality tv shows don't post clips </joey>
<joey> and full episodes i think it's because a </joey>
<joey> lot of they're like this is just </joey>
<joey> speculation but i'm guessing a lot of </joey>
<joey> like the producers and the production </joey>
<joey> team and the people behind the actual </joey>
<joey> show still have some level of faith that </joey>
<joey> people still watch tv like they used to </joey>
<joey> back in the day and so they're like well </joey>
<joey> i mean we're still getting numbers maybe </joey>
<joey> not as big as you know back in the </joey>
<joey> oughts but you know people still </joey>
<joey> watching tv i also imagine that maybe if </joey>
<connor> you're producing a lot of shows i </connor>
<joey> imagine there has been a lot of shows </joey>
<joey> that just lost because they didn't </joey>
<joey> archive them properly or they didn't </joey>
<joey> yeah they didn't they don't have the </joey>
<joey> files or they they have them they just </joey>
<joey> don't know what which one's which i </joey>
<joey> imagine there's a lot of that going on </joey>
<joey> probably </joey>
<joey> copyright you know like maybe the </joey>
<joey> production team made it and then sold it </joey>
<joey> to a network and maybe the network </joey>
<joey> doesn't have the rights and the </joey>
<joey> production team doesn't uh maybe they </joey>
<connor> also don't have the rights for them and </connor>
<joey> i'm sure they didn't build those </joey>
<joey> contracts you know with the clause of </joey>
<joey> like oh you know if these go on youtube </joey>
<joey> then we hold all right sure they do now </joey>
<connor> a lot of networks pretty dear but i </connor>
<joey> don't i don't yeah but like a show from </joey>
<joey> the 2000s probably not </joey>
<garnt> yeah like i noticed right now especially </garnt>
<joey> like whenever i go on my netflix holy </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] they make a lot of reality tv shows </joey>
<joey> like with like every single genre right </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter yeah i remember when </joey>
<joey> netflix is like an occupation this is </joey>
<connor> probably a reality show </connor>
<garnt> you watched that one no no there's a </garnt>
<joey> glass one there's a glass blowing like </joey>
<joey> because there is like competition i </joey>
<connor> watched like the full series i don't </connor>
<joey> know why did i have like the reality tv </joey>
<connor> like interviews it was like masterchef </connor>
<connor> with glasgow oh my god and they had like </connor>
<connor> the archetypes of the glass-blowing </connor>
<connor> judges they were like the you know like </connor>
<connor> the gordon ramsay the </connor>
<joey> the nice one the mean one i can't </joey>
<joey> believe he just said that about my face </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> is it like exactly the same format and </joey>
<connor> everything like that yeah but like you </connor>
<connor> have now 30 minutes to make your your </connor>
<joey> glass it is literally like a master chef </joey>
<joey> but replaced with glass blood oh my god </joey>
<joey> it wasn't that bad because it got blown </joey>
<connor> away yeah blown away </connor>
<joey> blown away how many seasons have you got </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> let me see </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i remember when like netflix was like </garnt>
<joey> just [ __ ] out like five </joey>
<joey> documentaries a day and now they've </joey>
<garnt> they're like shutting out five different </garnt>
<joey> reality tv shows today </joey>
<joey> i've got a season two and no game no </joey>
<connor> life didn't like what the [ __ ] i'm </connor>
<connor> surprised that like every single </connor>
<joey> death in the us hasn't had a docu series </joey>
<joey> at this rate like </joey>
<joey> everything has been covered at this </joey>
<joey> point yeah honestly i just don't it's </joey>
<joey> crazy like i watched one the other day </joey>
<connor> about like some uh grandma who uh was </connor>
<connor> killing people in her house and i was </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> how are they finding this stuff who's </connor>
<joey> finding this this is insane why was this </joey>
<joey> not televised earlier i feel like i </joey>
<connor> should know about this grandma are </connor>
<garnt> killing people this feels like a yeah </garnt>
<joey> like a tv show plot yeah this happened </joey>
<garnt> on tv would be like unrealistic </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you don't watch enough true </garnt>
<garnt> crime documentaries or true crime </garnt>
<joey> podcasts or channels </joey>
<garnt> the obsession sometimes you're watching </garnt>
<garnt> true crime you're like </garnt>
<joey> and then you just get this moment of </joey>
<joey> like your your consciousness going don't </joey>
<joey> you think it's weird that you're </joey>
<joey> watching stories about people being </joey>
<joey> murdered and they're just shoving </joey>
<joey> cameras in their face and interrogating </joey>
<joey> people to tell tell us how they felt 20 </joey>
<joey> years ago when their family member died </joey>
<joey> like do you not get that when you watch </joey>
<joey> it yeah definitely i feel like i get </joey>
<connor> these moments i'll watch a full series i </connor>
<connor> won't get it every now and then i'll </connor>
<connor> just watch a series and it's always with </connor>
<connor> the family interviews where it kind of </connor>
<connor> makes me think </connor>
<connor> what why are they just making these </connor>
<joey> family members just like [ __ ] talk </joey>
<joey> about their [ __ ] and cry on camera </joey>
<joey> oh like they're like </joey>
<joey> i loved him and stuff and it's like it's </joey>
<joey> genuine right and i feel like these </joey>
<joey> these poor people who like yeah didn't </joey>
<joey> ever want to talk about this again have </joey>
<joey> just been shoved with it because they're </joey>
<joey> probably when someone was like here's 10 </joey>
<connor> grand talk about your dead cousin yeah </connor>
<connor> and how they were close to you and how </connor>
<connor> it was suspicious that that one guy who </connor>
<joey> never got caught was you know that </joey>
<joey> brutal myrtle that you saw in front of </joey>
<joey> your eyes recall that yeah word for word </joey>
<joey> and it's just the same formula as well </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know it feels like we've </joey>
<joey> turned it into a sort of </joey>
<joey> location like yeah we've glorified </joey>
<joey> murder and stuff and </joey>
<joey> yeah that's scary i feel like like </joey>
<connor> because sydney i've talked about this </connor>
<connor> before but sydney listens to a lot a lot </connor>
<connor> of like true crime videos true crime </connor>
<garnt> podcast whenever like she's doing her </garnt>
<garnt> makeup and stuff like that and like </garnt>
<connor> every so </connor>
<joey> and then david trapped sally in her </joey>
<joey> basement for two weeks and brutally </joey>
<joey> her before </joey>
<joey> her </joey>
<joey> but before i get to the next point i'd </joey>
<joey> like to bring up my sponsor for today's </joey>
<joey> video nordvpn and i'm just like brah </joey>
<joey> what is this right now okay like i i get </joey>
<joey> it like you know like the you know </joey>
<joey> i don't know if these guys like i don't </joey>
<garnt> even know if an expo i know rainbow has </garnt>
<garnt> sponsors and stuff like certainly i </garnt>
<garnt> understand like yeah i get it but it you </garnt>
<garnt> have to admit it </garnt>
<garnt> is it's so jarring when i just hear </garnt>
<connor> about this this like i love channels by </connor>
<garnt> the way i love your guys's videos </garnt>
<joey> but there's but there's right and wrong </joey>
<garnt> places to put it i don't know it's so </garnt>
<garnt> wet i don't think there's ever like uh </garnt>
<connor> unfortunately the topic i think just </connor>
<connor> doesn't lend one yeah it just doesn't </connor>
<garnt> land well but like there's there's been </garnt>
<garnt> weird transitions i mean we've done very </garnt>
<garnt> many weird transitions in i'm sure in </garnt>
<garnt> our careers with like just transitioning </garnt>
<garnt> to a uh sponsor that we've had for this </garnt>
<connor> video </connor>
<connor> the berserk thing one time right we were </connor>
<joey> talking about the passing of </joey>
<joey> uh oh yeah and because the way that we </joey>
<joey> recorded it uh there was an ad break </joey>
<garnt> that was put right in the middle of us </garnt>
<garnt> talking about </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> something that we looked over um </connor>
<connor> but there's yeah it's </connor>
<joey> not any like true crime </joey>
<joey> true crime youtubers they're i don't </joey>
<joey> know i don't think there is a right way </joey>
<joey> to transition from some of the stuff </joey>
<connor> they talk about to an advertiser yeah </connor>
<garnt> every time i hear it it's just like it </garnt>
<connor> just takes me out for a second it's just </connor>
<connor> like we've i don't know in a way i i </connor>
<garnt> it's totally fine and i don't think it's </garnt>
<garnt> like bad i'm not condemning it no i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not condemning it i like i like the </garnt>
<garnt> content yeah but like you have to admit </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you're watching it and you're </joey>
<joey> like it is strange how we've turned this </joey>
<joey> into like it's it's like the common </joey>
<joey> common day watch mojo yeah we've turned </joey>
<joey> in like that we've turned murders into </joey>
<joey> what we we like top tens used to fill </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> whereas top 10 used to fill that i'll </joey>
<joey> just put anything on kind of thing yeah </joey>
<joey> just like murder and horrible acts just </joey>
<joey> let it fill the void somehow </joey>
<connor> like there's a there's like channels i'm </connor>
<joey> surprised watching mojo hasn't gone into </joey>
<connor> that yeah there's top 10 like girls </connor>
<joey> who've been trapped in dungeons </joey>
<joey> there's probably something i know </joey>
<joey> there's people who do their makeup and </joey>
<joey> talk about true crime that's a call yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i've seen that a lot yeah </joey>
<connor> which is also a strange evolution but </connor>
<joey> impressive it's like get ready with me </joey>
<joey> while i talk about this it's horrible </joey>
<garnt> it's like cool </garnt>
<garnt> it's like next level mukbang right but </garnt>
<garnt> they're just </garnt>
<garnt> they're doing makeup and they're talking </garnt>
<garnt> about true questions i want to see a </garnt>
<joey> mukbang where they talk about true crime </joey>
<joey> as they're like just demolishing your </joey>
<connor> pilot </connor>
<connor> i bet you're saying this i bet it </connor>
<garnt> already exists </garnt>
<garnt> don't give nicaragua avocado any more </garnt>
<connor> ideas man don't don't come on nick is </connor>
<connor> publishing a live true crime whatever </connor>
<joey> he's doing his body is through [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> crime that's the true crime documentary </joey>
<joey> that's true crime what he's doing is </joey>
<joey> this digestive system jesus christ yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean again like i i watch a lot of it </joey>
<joey> i consume a lot of it but i do just get </joey>
<joey> those moments where i'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah the reality hits right yeah </joey>
<joey> it is weird especially where like i </joey>
<joey> thought about it the other day and i'm </joey>
<joey> like i don't know anyone </joey>
<connor> in my immediate circle or relatives or </connor>
<connor> anything </connor>
<connor> where somebody has had like something </connor>
<joey> really horrible happen to them or a </joey>
<joey> murderer i don't know do you know anyone </joey>
<joey> like a cousin who knows someone who's </joey>
<joey> been murdered or something like that no </joey>
<joey> not when it comes to murder and like </joey>
<joey> this this true crime stuff almost kind </joey>
<garnt> of like normalizes it in your mind i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like that this is a normal thing </garnt>
<connor> that happens i don't think in fact it </connor>
<garnt> isn't normal no and i think it </garnt>
<garnt> normalizes it it just desensitizes you </garnt>
<garnt> to it yeah well i mean it makes you </garnt>
<garnt> think that it is a normal thing that </garnt>
<garnt> happens really i've never heard of like </garnt>
<garnt> i've never listened to true crime and </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was a normal thing that </garnt>
<garnt> happened like you watch it these are </garnt>
<connor> real people like yeah yeah these people </connor>
<connor> these interviews this could be your this </connor>
<connor> could be your cousin this could be your </connor>
<joey> mom like this i think i think it's the </joey>
<joey> gravity at which they address that </joey>
<joey> particular topic where it's like they </joey>
<joey> they say like oh yeah so uh tim got </joey>
<joey> murdered like </joey>
<joey> in the same tone as like yeah so i met </joey>
<connor> up with bob the other day you know yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like i think yeah i think the </connor>
<connor> gravity of the situation is often lost </connor>
<joey> yeah in in the content because there's </joey>
<joey> so much content like that yeah yeah the </joey>
<connor> content is king and </connor>
<joey> yeah and i'm not saying that i want to </joey>
<joey> sit there and feel traumatized every </joey>
<joey> single time i watch something about true </joey>
<joey> crime i just think it's kind of </joey>
<joey> interesting and worth talking about the </joey>
<joey> fact that we don't consume it and we </joey>
<joey> don't </joey>
<connor> empathize </connor>
<joey> necessarily always yeah i mean it is </joey>
<joey> entertainment in </joey>
<joey> in a sense right it is entertainment we </joey>
<joey> do we don't watch it to really how can i </joey>
<garnt> say it's really s </garnt>
<garnt> we don't we don't watch it </garnt>
<garnt> to not sympathize but we don't watch it </garnt>
<joey> people don't watch these kinds of </joey>
<joey> documentaries and cry at the end of it </joey>
<joey> right is what you know like they don't </joey>
<joey> they're not like oh my god i feel so sad </joey>
<joey> for these like families start we watch </joey>
<garnt> out of morbid curiosities yeah like </garnt>
<connor> there's there's a sense of morbidness to </connor>
<connor> it where we want to know the gross </connor>
<connor> details did curiosity go though that's </connor>
<garnt> the question that's the question well </garnt>
<joey> that's when you start getting into the </joey>
<joey> weird [ __ ] right yeah yeah and uh that's </joey>
<joey> the part where it's like oh okay </joey>
<joey> yeah to the point where it's like oh </joey>
<joey> true you liking true crime documentaries </joey>
<joey> is nothing compared to like </joey>
<connor> some of the weirdest stuff you're into </connor>
<connor> sometimes i wonder like </connor>
<connor> like do </connor>
<connor> i think i'm consuming this content wrong </connor>
<joey> because i've watched some things where </joey>
<joey> it'll be like a documentary and it'll be </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah like a kid got like beat up </joey>
<joey> by his parents and no one helped him and </joey>
<joey> then the kid died and it's like i have </joey>
<joey> to like stop for the day yeah i'm like i </joey>
<joey> have to like take a yes i have to like </joey>
<joey> just step back and be like [ __ ] yeah i </joey>
<joey> can't do anything but then people will </joey>
<joey> watch like tons of these and i'm like </joey>
<joey> i'm wondering like what are they </joey>
<joey> experiencing that's different from me </joey>
<joey> yeah like that that makes it so that i </joey>
<joey> walk away from this just feeling drained </joey>
<joey> and exhausted yeah and they're like oh </joey>
<joey> next one </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> one thing i found really just want to </connor>
<joey> know like yeah one thing i found really </joey>
<connor> interesting is that japan doesn't have </connor>
<connor> any programming like that no they don't </connor>
<connor> they don't i've noticed that yeah and i </connor>
<connor> think it's because it's taboo yeah it is </connor>
<connor> it is taboo to like bring it back up and </connor>
<joey> talk about it and especially like you </joey>
<joey> know i can't imagine a [ __ ] tv </joey>
<joey> program being like knock knock knock hey </joey>
<connor> your son got murdered 10 years ago talk </connor>
<joey> about it like you know like they want to </joey>
<joey> respect the families right yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like not saying that you know all of </joey>
<joey> these like two true crime documentary </joey>
<connor> makers have no respect on the families </connor>
<connor> or whatever but it is scarily like </connor>
<connor> it is it feels invasive at times yes it </connor>
<garnt> does </garnt>
<garnt> it feels very </garnt>
<garnt> intimate yeah and it's scary that no one </garnt>
<joey> who watches that kind of programming </joey>
<joey> second guesses </joey>
<joey> that invasiveness but also i understand </joey>
<connor> maybe if somebody was your family was </connor>
<joey> murdered i can also understand the the </joey>
<joey> opposite where being able to talk about </joey>
<joey> it and express your faith </joey>
<joey> can help you get like grieve and help </joey>
<joey> you kind of get the story out there and </joey>
<connor> you feel like i've told my case i've </connor>
<connor> told people what it is and i'm sure both </connor>
<joey> sides yeah and i'm sure you know the </joey>
<joey> ones who think that oh if i just talk </joey>
<joey> about it on camera and get it off my </joey>
<joey> chest and let people hear it it would </joey>
<joey> make me feel better they're the ones </joey>
<connor> that turn into documentaries that's why </connor>
<connor> i kind of get worried with these sorry </connor>
<joey> i've interrupted like three times in a </joey>
<joey> row now </joey>
<joey> the final time i promise i promise </joey>
<garnt> unprofessional i know i remember what i </garnt>
<connor> said like most of the time i had like a </connor>
<connor> point and it was gone and i was like oh </connor>
<joey> man i have no appointments </joey>
<connor> connor let god [ __ ] you speak </connor>
<joey> you know that's another thing addressed </joey>
<joey> him i think a few of them here and there </joey>
<joey> is like this is where i i start to get a </joey>
<joey> bit weirded out with true crimes when </joey>
<connor> there's the true crime investigators </connor>
<connor> online that go around and then start you </connor>
<connor> know pushing buttons and sending emails </connor>
<connor> and asking people questions who don't </connor>
<connor> want to talk about it it's like i think </connor>
<garnt> people have it right board warriors </garnt>
<connor> keyboard investigation detectives what </connor>
<joey> was that [ __ ] what was that one where </joey>
<joey> that guy </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] which one was it there was this guy </joey>
<garnt> who's like that the head detective for </garnt>
<garnt> the online and um do you know what have </garnt>
<connor> you watched this was sydney's probably </connor>
<garnt> definitely [ __ ] laughing i got acid </garnt>
<garnt> they don't [ __ ] with cats </garnt>
<garnt> that was the only one i know well that </garnt>
<connor> was actually a good one yeah there's </connor>
<connor> been another one where a guy </connor>
<joey> was just like a 4chan user or something </joey>
<joey> i needed i don't feel confident saying </joey>
<connor> about it i need to go and check </connor>
<joey> what it was on netflix there's one where </joey>
<joey> this guy was basically like like in </joey>
<joey> charge because the police weren't </joey>
<joey> helping that much but the police have to </joey>
<joey> go through you know systems and right </joey>
<joey> they don't always do the best job </joey>
<joey> obviously they have to go through the </joey>
<joey> procedure this guy kind of like </joey>
<joey> kind of steamrolled in and was like i'll </joey>
<joey> help you family i'll be the detective </joey>
<joey> and it was kind of weird watching this </joey>
<joey> documentary what was the family like </joey>
<joey> they were like oh yes they liked it </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> they were in a vulnerable spot you know </joey>
<joey> this guy was selling them the thing that </joey>
<joey> i can help you know that's not cool but </joey>
<joey> but i think the guy genuinely believed </joey>
<joey> he could help i don't think he was a </joey>
<connor> scam or anything because there was no </connor>
<connor> money involved he was like i will help </connor>
<connor> you but it just felt kind of weird okay </connor>
<joey> i was about safe like he was like i'll </joey>
<connor> help you solve the game </connor>
<connor> he was like an internet guy who's just </connor>
<joey> really into true crime and he was going </joey>
<joey> about being like i will solve this i'll </joey>
<joey> help you do it okay [ __ ] i need to </joey>
<connor> figure out what this is i've i have a </connor>
<connor> such a vivid image of this guy i don't </connor>
<joey> know do you do you think that's morally </joey>
<joey> correct to do or </joey>
<garnt> it might have been um i don't know it </garnt>
<joey> really depends on the situation because </joey>
<joey> was this guy deluded or did this guy </joey>
<joey> actually help out i don't know what </joey>
<joey> grounds i guess what </joey>
<joey> what uh from what has described what </joey>
<garnt> grounds did he have to uh come to a </garnt>
<garnt> family and was like i can solve this </garnt>
<joey> crime did he want the clout </joey>
<joey> right so the next time he's on a true </joey>
<connor> crime </connor>
<connor> so uh you might have heard of this case </connor>
<joey> that was me it's from tiger king 2 oh </joey>
<joey> there's this guy who was like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm i'm definitely certain that uh </joey>
<joey> carol basking killed it yeah i'll help </joey>
<joey> the family and stuff i'm just weird it </joey>
<joey> was just like this guy's clearly just </joey>
<joey> inserting himself yeah in the situation </joey>
<joey> he just wants to be part of the </joey>
<joey> storyline it's just like it was just </joey>
<connor> like i just </connor>
<joey> i just </joey>
<joey> i don't know just leave it up to the </joey>
<garnt> professionals yeah like to me i think i </garnt>
<garnt> get too invested in true crime stories </garnt>
<garnt> which is why i've never fully like been </garnt>
<connor> into true crime uh because like i i </connor>
<connor> would hear some of the stuff that sydney </connor>
<connor> listens to or something and sometimes </connor>
<joey> they like actually play like the 9-1-1 </joey>
<connor> call that is made about this crime and i </connor>
<joey> hear this [ __ ] and i'm like i'm just </joey>
<joey> like fresh out of the shower ready for </joey>
<garnt> my day or something and i got like a </garnt>
<garnt> like like a kid [ __ ] crying on the </garnt>
<garnt> phone telling like the police that her </garnt>
<joey> mother's been murdered or something i'm </joey>
<joey> like and then you immediately feel dirty </joey>
<joey> i'm just like sydney i want to cry now </joey>
<garnt> can we not listen to what she's like </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i'm </connor>
<joey> how far have you guys gone with like </joey>
<connor> your morbid curiosities right because </connor>
<connor> the internet is a wonderful but </connor>
<connor> sometimes a terrifying place where you </connor>
<connor> can see anything you want to see yes </connor>
<connor> right um and i know a lot of people a </connor>
<garnt> lot of kids went through a phase where </garnt>
<garnt> they they stumbled upon like the darker </garnt>
<joey> sides of the internet right like you </joey>
<joey> know because i'm not even gonna pretend </joey>
<joey> to sugarcoat the fact that like yeah you </joey>
<joey> know at one point when i was in high </joey>
<joey> school someone was like do you know of </joey>
<garnt> this thing called tor and i was like no </garnt>
<garnt> what's that and so i downloaded it and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like oh it's a gateway to the dark </garnt>
<garnt> web </garnt>
<garnt> and you know i spent an afternoon one </garnt>
<garnt> afternoon on tour you know going through </garnt>
<garnt> the dark web just to see how [ __ ] up </garnt>
<joey> it was and uh </joey>
<joey> can confirm that's a [ __ ] up [ __ ] on </joey>
<garnt> there yeah cause like for me like i like </garnt>
<joey> i didn't do anything like no no no </joey>
<garnt> i didn't enjoy it joey incriminates </garnt>
<joey> himself i didn't do anything i just i </joey>
<joey> saw a lot of things that i probably </joey>
<garnt> shouldn't have seen right yeah like like </garnt>
<joey> even to me like my baseline i could not </joey>
<joey> go on like if i see a live league thing </joey>
<joey> i'm clicking off that video no no i just </joey>
<joey> i just like i've never had that kind of </joey>
<garnt> part of myself where i was morbidly </garnt>
<garnt> curious enough to see something that i </garnt>
<joey> probably would regret i can live the </joey>
<connor> rest of my life not seeing this i've </connor>
<connor> seen the worst things on twitter </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah that's i'll be honest </joey>
<connor> with you the most [ __ ] up videos i've </connor>
<garnt> ever seen have been on twitter actually </garnt>
<garnt> that's true some </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] up things and i'm i </garnt>
<connor> thought you were just like being </connor>
<connor> facetious there i thought i thought </connor>
<garnt> i thought you were just like oh i had </garnt>
<garnt> this tweet i saw the other day like </garnt>
<connor> friends like like people who i i </connor>
<joey> followed and i knew they'd like retweet </joey>
<joey> and be like oh this is horrible it's a </joey>
<joey> video of like some people getting shot </joey>
<connor> and stuff yeah yeah yeah i've seen that </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] why are you sharing this yeah i've </garnt>
<joey> i've actually seen that as well i </joey>
<garnt> thought you would be physicians to be </garnt>
<joey> like i saw this tweet the other day and </joey>
<garnt> said that demons better than jesus </garnt>
<joey> oh my god </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> i definitely saw the most haunting stuff </joey>
<joey> being shared on twitter yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> twitter is very slow to get rid of this </joey>
<joey> stuff yeah yeah it's nearly as good as </joey>
<joey> other platforms </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah all the [ __ ] [ __ ] there </joey>
<joey> man i yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i've never been on net </joey>
<connor> i've never been on the dark web i don't </connor>
<connor> really have an interest i </connor>
<joey> don't weirdly enough like </joey>
<joey> the stuff i saw on the dark web just </joey>
<joey> like just based on like what you see as </joey>
<connor> an image or whatever is not as [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> as some of the stuff you'd see on like </connor>
<connor> reddit the second page of google i'm </connor>
<connor> just i'm kidding </connor>
<connor> no one talks about kidding yeah </connor>
<connor> no it's just like i think it's just like </connor>
<joey> i think the thing that's like [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> about the dark web from my experience on </joey>
<joey> going on it is just like there's </joey>
<joey> conceptually a lot of [ __ ] up things </joey>
<joey> yeah like when you read into it it's </joey>
<connor> like oh how about you people buying </connor>
<connor> drugs </connor>
<connor> that's like ninety percent that's like </connor>
<joey> the people selling an ftc </joey>
<joey> you know there's </joey>
<connor> but like you know there's like a lot of </connor>
<joey> other stuff you'd look into and it's </joey>
<connor> like oh where it's like okay i probably </connor>
<connor> didn't want to know that that was an </connor>
<connor> operation that is currently functioning </connor>
<connor> right now it's somewhere out there in </connor>
<connor> the world you know levels are [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> whereas like you go live link in twitter </connor>
<connor> it's like you're immediately exposed to </connor>
<joey> something that's like oh that's oh i </joey>
<joey> shouldn't have seen like i didn't want </joey>
<joey> to see a guy's head explode on live leak </joey>
<garnt> but i just did yeah well it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> there's one of the few times that a </garnt>
<garnt> video like that or a picture has like </garnt>
<joey> like gone through the cracks you know </joey>
<joey> it's just like it's never not been </joey>
<joey> haunting for me in like every way shape </joey>
<joey> from like i remember every [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up thing i see because i see it </joey>
<joey> once and i'm just like that is now like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ingrained in my mind and that </joey>
<joey> would be a point where i'm in the shower </joey>
<joey> i have like a [ __ ] flashback to that </joey>
<joey> video i'm like my day is just infinitely </joey>
<joey> worse and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> but there's a part of me there where </joey>
<joey> like i know this is reality and i know </joey>
<joey> like the internet is filtered so yeah it </joey>
<joey> is more friendly but like there's a part </joey>
<joey> of me where i'm just like i don't want </joey>
<joey> to be desensitized to this thing you </joey>
<joey> know because i know i i've met some </joey>
<joey> people who are just like you think </joey>
<joey> that's baby [ __ ] i've seen the real [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i've seen the [ __ ] up [ __ ] i've seen </joey>
<joey> the snuff film why and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> to me like </joey>
<joey> i like being sensitive to this stuff </joey>
<joey> right because this [ __ ] is it grounds me </joey>
<joey> yeah this [ __ ] grounds you and like the </joey>
<joey> true crime stuff as well like to me at </joey>
<garnt> least like to me i don't want to be too </garnt>
<garnt> desensitive to the group to the true </garnt>
<garnt> crime stuff in case </garnt>
<garnt> in case this happens in my real life and </garnt>
<garnt> i know someone that has that has </garnt>
<garnt> happened </garnt>
<garnt> that it happens to you i don't i don't </garnt>
<joey> want to be desensitized to that in my </joey>
<joey> mind so let's be real like you know if </joey>
<joey> some person comes up to you and says </joey>
<joey> like oh well that's that's some [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i've seen the more [ __ ] up stuff </joey>
<joey> i'm like that's not a brag </joey>
<joey> like why do you think you're cool </joey>
<connor> because you've seen like a bunch of live </connor>
<connor> league videos and you're not facebook i </connor>
<joey> want to leave yeah like that doesn't </joey>
<joey> make that that's not going to make me be </joey>
<connor> like oh my god what an absolute [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mega chat this guy is like sitting </connor>
<connor> through a bunch of lively playlists it's </connor>
<joey> like no that just makes me not want to </joey>
<garnt> be near you because you're [ __ ] weird </garnt>
<joey> is it lovely shut down now yes </joey>
<garnt> i believe it has really since when </garnt>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> what a good thing damn missed out </connor>
<joey> yeah no it's horrible but yeah i don't </joey>
<connor> know it's just like because there was </connor>
<garnt> you know especially during like the the </garnt>
<garnt> peak of like right at 50 50 right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the </garnt>
<garnt> mid-2010s remember when that was the </garnt>
<garnt> crosstalk explain what we read at </garnt>
<joey> i i don't i kind of don't want it </joey>
<connor> because i don't want people going on to </connor>
<connor> it is this still a thing i don't know </connor>
<connor> i think it's salty but red 5050 is </connor>
<connor> basically it's this subreddit where </connor>
<connor> people post this like link </connor>
<connor> uh where it's like it's like you have a </connor>
<connor> 50 50 chance when you click the link of </connor>
<connor> it's a really nice thing or it's a </connor>
<connor> really bad thing and when i say nice and </connor>
<joey> bad i mean like really nice and like the </joey>
<joey> worst nf nsfl [ __ ] you will ever see </joey>
<joey> like straight from lively so there's you </joey>
<joey> know an example would be like </joey>
<joey> uh write a 50 50. uh five cute puppies </joey>
<joey> or five decapitated heads </joey>
<joey> and you won't know which one it is until </joey>
<joey> you click the link yeah yeah and uh in </joey>
<joey> the 2010s that was a game people like </joey>
<joey> kids used to play you know like i </joey>
<joey> remember some of my [ __ ] high school </joey>
<garnt> friends or like you know in a skype call </garnt>
<garnt> back in the day was like you want to do </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit of red 5050 as if they're </garnt>
<garnt> inviting me to like a minecraft server </garnt>
<connor> you know like it's like yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just casual gaming you know </connor>
<joey> and uh you know poor naive me the first </joey>
<connor> time around uh i was like no what's </connor>
<connor> reddit 50 50. biggest mistake in my life </connor>
<connor> i did that for five minutes i was like i </connor>
<joey> don't wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna </joey>
<joey> talk to you guys ever again for letting </joey>
<joey> me sit through that because i was </joey>
<joey> horrible </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah and then it became a big </joey>
<garnt> thing on [ __ ] youtube yeah which is </garnt>
<garnt> why i feel sorry for like like the one </garnt>
<joey> of the worst jobs i could imagine is the </joey>
<joey> people who work for moderate rate of </joey>
<connor> feed </connor>
<connor> nice [ __ ] stuff right yeah yeah you </connor>
<garnt> have to have to have to go through every </garnt>
<garnt> video that's been flagged oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> in facebook </joey>
<joey> there was a video i saw of like </joey>
<garnt> something it's not it was a vice versa </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah like like one of </joey>
<joey> these people who had been interviewed </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> they had to like go through that job </connor>
<joey> seems like the worst job on earth it's </joey>
<joey> just like completely desensitized like </joey>
<joey> just hearing them talk they're just like </joey>
<connor> apparently yeah obviously you'd have to </connor>
<connor> like go through a bunch of uh really </connor>
<joey> horrific views and </joey>
<joey> really uh [ __ ] up really right </joey>
<joey> opinions i think i think yeah apparently </joey>
<joey> like a lot of them would like get really </joey>
<connor> desensitized and become like really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up the more they do this job i </connor>
<joey> think i think it was that vice </joey>
<joey> documentary where like the girl said </joey>
<joey> that like oh yeah once you apply for </joey>
<joey> this position you just like immediately </joey>
<joey> like get therapy yeah like it just comes </joey>
<joey> with the package it comes with the </joey>
<joey> package yeah that there is a therapist </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> like maybe on slime maybe online i don't </connor>
<connor> know but like a terrifying thought i </connor>
<garnt> know there's a job out there that </garnt>
<garnt> immediately requires you to have therapy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we're kind of like you they need </garnt>
<joey> the like they're they're the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> real heroes oh yeah there needs to be </joey>
<joey> someone out there that makes the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> internet safer for people like us that </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to see that on our timeline </garnt>
<joey> otherwise you know what's the difference </joey>
<joey> between the normal web and the dark web </joey>
<joey> at that point right like yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly just exactly the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> exactly right i just hope they're </garnt>
<joey> getting treated [ __ ] fairly and </joey>
<joey> treated well and getting paid well i </joey>
<joey> hope this is a [ __ ] horrible job i </joey>
<garnt> hope they get the best [ __ ] therapist </garnt>
<garnt> that's a that's a sad thing right my god </garnt>
<joey> if they don't have the best [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> therapists on the planet like jesus </joey>
<garnt> christ it's not worth </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't mean to make uh the ending of </garnt>
