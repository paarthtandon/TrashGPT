<connor> so connor was like it's 20 minutes home </connor>
<connor> on a comfy taxi </connor>
<connor> so then we get in the taxi taxi's </connor>
<connor> driving fine and </connor>
<joey> then just some random police officer </joey>
<joey> just walks out onto the street and kind </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> flags us down there's like four </joey>
<connor> policemen surround this like old </connor>
<joey> poor old man yeah and i asked the taxi </joey>

<connor> first week we've skipped of recording a </connor>
<garnt> trash taste yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it felt weird it felt like my it felt </garnt>
<garnt> weird like </garnt>
<garnt> because normally we record on tuesdays </garnt>
<garnt> people probably figured this out </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know how you figured out </garnt>
<garnt> like tr some people have figured out the </garnt>
<garnt> entire trash taste schedule </garnt>
<connor> mentioned it in passing yeah what we </connor>
<connor> think is a passing comment people </connor>
<joey> like remember i remember i got a tweet </joey>
<joey> as well i was randomly </joey>
<connor> checking twitter like right before about </connor>
<connor> to start and someone tweeted at me </connor>
<connor> saying like what are you going to talk </connor>
<joey> about today joey </joey>
<connor> i was just like where are you </connor>
<garnt> you're watching me yeah and people have </garnt>
<garnt> figured out like some like the recording </garnt>
<garnt> order as opposed to like the airing </garnt>
<garnt> order as well there's probably like a </garnt>
<garnt> watch order </garnt>
<garnt> the official trash taste watch order </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere on reddit i don't know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because some of them </garnt>
<connor> get mixed around right yeah sponsors and </connor>
<connor> whatnot but yeah </connor>
<connor> in general you could figure out based on </connor>
<connor> who's sitting where </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah normally in general </garnt>
<connor> unfortunately god doesn't have a guest </connor>
<connor> today </connor>

<garnt> no i'm just i'm just here i've just got </garnt>
<garnt> the space by myself on the table and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just good it's good to be on the </garnt>
<connor> hosting side </connor>

<connor> thing tastes like [ __ ] and you know i'm </connor>
<connor> not gonna be forced to consume something </connor>
<garnt> that tastes like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this is for a challenge and i lose then </garnt>
<garnt> it's my fault right </garnt>
<garnt> so how are you enjoying your christmas </garnt>
<connor> holiday boys well that's when we're </connor>
<connor> recording this right yes </connor>
<joey> we are recording this during the </joey>
<joey> christmas holidays we've we've had our </joey>
<joey> christmas episodes but uh we are </joey>
<garnt> enjoying our christmas holidays right </garnt>
<garnt> now even though we're still technically </garnt>
<garnt> working </garnt>
<connor> i took two days off and then i was like </connor>
<connor> right a whole two days back back to it </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<connor> back to youtube i don't know i i really </connor>
<connor> i even like going one day without </connor>
<joey> youtube i'm like [ __ ] i want to do </joey>
<joey> something </joey>
<joey> yeah i want to make something yeah i </joey>
<joey> want to entertain i want to be a clown </joey>
<joey> i don't know why you're a clown every </joey>
<joey> day it's all right i think yeah there's </joey>
<joey> pretty some deep </joey>
<connor> insecurity that happened during my </connor>
<joey> childhood that makes me strive to want </joey>
<connor> to entertain i don't know why but </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know it was nice it was fun </connor>
<connor> i it's nice having actually i think </connor>
<connor> what the difference between like a </connor>
<connor> holiday that is everyone's holiday </connor>
<connor> yeah and one that you set for yourself </connor>
<connor> is that when it's like a like a national </connor>
<connor> holiday you're like well [ __ ] i have to </connor>
<connor> i guess </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're like </joey>
<joey> obligated yeah yeah but then sometimes </joey>
<joey> you know you're not your headspace isn't </joey>
<connor> it you're like man i kind of want to </connor>
<connor> take a vacation but like i don't want to </connor>
<connor> but then when if you do it yourself you </connor>
<connor> hype yourself up for it you're like i'm </connor>
<connor> taking this time off no one's going to </connor>
<connor> tell me what to do but on christmas </connor>
<connor> you're like [ __ ] i kind of want to like </connor>
<connor> i don't want to like make a video i want </connor>
<garnt> to [ __ ] around yeah i don't know what it </garnt>
<garnt> is about the christmas holidays i've </garnt>
<connor> well i've always ended up working during </connor>
<connor> the christmas holidays because i've had </connor>
<connor> my yearly videos that probably won't </connor>
<connor> happen this year but </connor>
<connor> that's probably that's mostly what i'm </connor>
<connor> working on during the christmas holidays </connor>
<connor> um and then i've realized that </connor>
<connor> you know as youtubers you need to take a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] break right yeah yeah and yeah </connor>
<connor> it feels i don't know what it is but do </connor>
<connor> you ever get </connor>
<connor> you know sometimes we take breaks during </connor>
<connor> the weekdays right to us we don't like </connor>
<connor> weekends don't technically exist but i </connor>
<connor> found that </connor>
<connor> taking breaks on the weekends feels a </connor>
<connor> lot better than taking breaks </connor>
<connor> in during the weekdays because it just </connor>
<connor> feels nice when you know that </connor>
<connor> everyone else in the country is on a </connor>
<connor> break as well you know </connor>
<connor> well except for most hand where yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah except in japan where christmas day </joey>
<connor> is just a regular workout yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> also weekends are a suggestion </connor>
<connor> to stop working yeah they're not </connor>
<garnt> enforced every holiday is a suggestion </garnt>
<connor> let's be honest i went up to uh to </connor>
<connor> the north of japan for about three or </connor>
<connor> four days to go see chris </connor>
<connor> yeah um and that was really nice there's </connor>
<connor> so much [ __ ] snow </connor>
<connor> did he make you drink shitty sacking uh </connor>
<joey> no he made me drink good suck </joey>
<joey> oh yeah and also that's an oxymoron for </joey>
<joey> connor though yeah </joey>
<joey> also it was the first time ever i did </joey>
<garnt> like a proper japanese christmas aka kfc </garnt>
<garnt> how was it it's just kfc this is </garnt>
<garnt> exactly what i thought it's just chicken </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's just like a trip to kate </garnt>
<garnt> although it was kind of weird because </garnt>
<garnt> chris had to </garnt>
<garnt> schedule it like or book it book kfc </garnt>
<garnt> king kfc yeah we have to watch the world </garnt>
<garnt> come to </garnt>
<garnt> like two two or three weeks in advance </garnt>
<garnt> right and it's also weird it's not just </garnt>
<garnt> like a </garnt>
<garnt> you not only have to book it but you </garnt>
<garnt> have to book like a day in time to go </garnt>
<garnt> and pick it up </garnt>
<garnt> yeah as well so it's like not only do </garnt>
<garnt> you have to come in on debt on a certain </garnt>
<connor> day to a certain store but it's like </connor>
<connor> come between a 2 to 3 p.m time bracket </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and this and we went there and there was </connor>
<connor> just like a group of about maybe like </connor>
<joey> five or six families just lining up to </joey>
<joey> get their christmas chicken from the </joey>
<connor> colonel and i </connor>
<connor> would rather die than line up for a </connor>
<joey> chaos yeah and i mean you know it was </joey>
<joey> like what </joey>
<connor> we got like a full bucket of like just a </connor>
<connor> bunch of chicken wings </connor>
<connor> as you do but also at the bottom of the </connor>
<connor> bucket there was like this </connor>
<connor> kind of christmas cake or like christmas </connor>
<connor> pudding right </connor>
<connor> i don't know because i don't think </connor>
<connor> anyone had a slice of it but it was at </connor>
<connor> the bottom of the thing we're like oh </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<garnt> a little weird that it's just been </garnt>
<garnt> sitting underneath this like greasy </garnt>
<garnt> greasy [ __ ] chicken that's no way </garnt>
<garnt> you'd want to put a cake no </garnt>
<garnt> it was the last thing we were expecting </garnt>
<garnt> at the bottom of the the bucket to be </garnt>
<joey> fair </joey>
<joey> and uh it was like 5 000 yen for it and </joey>
<joey> it could feed maybe about </joey>
<joey> three or four people you paid 50 bucks </joey>
<joey> for kfc </joey>
<joey> on christmas yeah oh my god i mean i </joey>
<joey> didn't kristen you could have had a nice </joey>
<garnt> roast dinner for that oh no we ordered </garnt>
<joey> all the food as well okay </joey>
<connor> but we were like just because it was the </connor>
<connor> first time for all of us we've never had </connor>
<connor> a japanese christmas before </connor>
<connor> so we're like you know what [ __ ] it </connor>
<garnt> let's do it and uh wouldn't do it again </garnt>
<garnt> to be honest it's just </garnt>
<garnt> it's just kfc isn't it i just go wrong </garnt>
<garnt> because the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> like this is i think the fourth year </garnt>
<garnt> that i've been in </garnt>
<garnt> asia celebrating christmas and i gotta </garnt>
<garnt> say i you don't </garnt>
<joey> really understand the entire the entire </joey>
<joey> like height behind this </joey>
<joey> oh the the christmas spirit you know </joey>
<joey> yeah i thought that was just like </joey>
<joey> i thought that was just my [ __ ] meme </joey>
<joey> it's just a marketing point yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i didn't understand that until i started </joey>
<joey> spending christmas outside of you know </joey>
<joey> where you know countries that normally </joey>
<connor> celebrate christmas </connor>
<connor> and you know you can do a lot of things </connor>
<connor> to make it feel christmassy but having </connor>
<connor> spent a few christmas </connor>
<connor> christmases in asia i kind of miss that </connor>
<connor> christmas spirit because </connor>
<connor> there's there's a few things you know </connor>
<connor> you can put on the christmas songs and </connor>
<connor> you can do whatever you know put up the </connor>
<connor> tree </connor>
<garnt> but there's just something missing i </garnt>
<garnt> can't put my finger on it but it just </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't feel fully christmassy i think </garnt>
<joey> it just has to do with the fact that at </joey>
<connor> least in japan </connor>
<connor> christmas is not a family thing yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like a romantic thing </connor>
<connor> yeah and also everyone's working so it's </connor>
<garnt> like yeah yeah like i got a delivery </garnt>
<garnt> on like as we were having our roast </garnt>
<connor> dinner and it was like the least </connor>
<connor> it was like the immersion breaking </connor>
<connor> christmas right the moment where </connor>
<connor> simulation ruined yeah yeah i had an </connor>
<garnt> amazon package and i was like this is </garnt>
<connor> not christmas that's the door on your </connor>
<connor> red hat </connor>
<connor> like i i refuse to have this wine in </connor>
<joey> hand </joey>
<joey> yeah christmas simulation over it was </joey>
<garnt> like that rick and morty episode where </garnt>
<garnt> you're just trapped in an ultimate like </garnt>
<connor> like this this like reality yeah is it </connor>
<connor> like to me </connor>
<connor> christmas is like going back and </connor>
<connor> reluctantly having to talk to family </connor>
<connor> members about like oh i do youtube you </connor>
<joey> know this is what i yeah </joey>
<joey> naked online yeah yes i make this much </joey>
<joey> per year thank you uncle for asking me </joey>
<connor> for the seventh time </connor>
<connor> you're investing right in the pension </connor>
<connor> right yes yes i am </connor>
<connor> no i don't know yeah i don't know it </connor>
<joey> felt it felt odd because i feel like </joey>
<connor> normally </connor>
<connor> i didn't i didn't appreciate christmas </connor>
<connor> that much because i didn't realize that </connor>
<connor> it was a really good way of like </connor>
<connor> in my head at least i don't know if this </connor>
<connor> is because i've been this is how i </connor>
<connor> taught </connor>
<garnt> it was like this is the end of the year </garnt>
<connor> yeah now now go and restart it </connor>
<connor> and then build up to all of this again </connor>
<garnt> because it was it's not just christmas </garnt>
<connor> it's that period between christmas </connor>
<connor> christmas and new year's yeah that is </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> the blank period we don't do anything </connor>
<connor> where it's just like what rules </connor>
<connor> what what are the rules nobody knows </connor>
<connor> what's going on are the buses running i </connor>
<connor> don't know are the trains running </connor>
<connor> our shops open it's [ __ ] anarchy and </connor>
<connor> i love that period because it's </connor>
<connor> google how how long can i have leftovers </connor>
<connor> for </connor>
<garnt> how many christmas dinners yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> that was like </garnt>
<garnt> living in england that was like one of </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite parts of the year </garnt>
<garnt> it was just it was just as you said like </garnt>
<joey> the reset of the year it was like the </joey>
<joey> entirety the entire society was just </joey>
<garnt> kind of goes into cooldown right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly right whereas here it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> businesses business as usual like </garnt>
<garnt> supermarkets and convenience stores are </garnt>
<joey> open </joey>
<connor> literally 24 7. even on new year's day </connor>
<connor> my mum won't shut up about kfc christmas </connor>
<connor> to me she's </connor>
<connor> fascinated by it she's like i heard they </connor>
<connor> have kfc for christmas is it true and </connor>
<connor> i'm like yes they do mom it's like wow </connor>
<connor> how crazy is that and i'm like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> kind of weird </connor>
<connor> it's too fair it is bizarre yeah it is </connor>
<connor> weird it's like </connor>
<connor> you know just all the things that japan </connor>
<connor> has </connor>
<connor> no interest in from like the west right </connor>
<joey> yeah we bring our finest things they're </joey>
<joey> like no no none of that none of that </joey>
<joey> and then suddenly the colonel rocks up </joey>
<joey> and he's like listen how about let me </joey>
<joey> picture this like greece </joey>
<joey> let me take this absolutely nothing to </joey>
<joey> do with christmas food and somehow make </joey>
<connor> it christmas food </connor>
<connor> who did like oh my god like how do they </connor>
<connor> pull this off like i'm sure someone </connor>
<connor> knows the history behind it but like to </connor>
<connor> me even if you explained to me how it </connor>
<connor> was done </connor>
<connor> yeah the kfc marketing department did </connor>
<joey> this i mean i explained it to you last </joey>
<joey> time right but even then it </joey>
<connor> still doesn't make sense to me it's like </connor>
<joey> i researched it and it doesn't make </joey>
<garnt> sense </garnt>
<garnt> it was like the marketing heist of the </garnt>
<connor> century like i swear in japan like just </connor>
<connor> normal marketing things they just don't </connor>
<connor> care about that like advertisements </connor>
<connor> everywhere </connor>
<connor> don't care about that oh oh there's a </connor>
<connor> collaboration where i can get my </connor>
<connor> favorite character </connor>
<connor> poorly printed on a latte oh well a </connor>
<connor> hundred bucks hello </connor>
<joey> that drives me insane dude when you see </joey>
<joey> it on paper it just sounds like a great </joey>
<joey> pretender episode </joey>
<garnt> how do they pull this off this is like </garnt>
<garnt> heist five now this is like the ova </garnt>
<garnt> episode man </garnt>
<garnt> when they sell christmas to the japanese </garnt>
<connor> actually like it is it's [ __ ] it's </connor>
<connor> like some ocean's 11 [ __ ] with every </connor>
<connor> marketing department and like </connor>
<connor> they they do collaborations with stuff </connor>
<connor> so this is a really common thing japan </connor>
<connor> where </connor>
<connor> they don't just market things normally </connor>
<connor> you can't have adverts it's like you </connor>
<connor> have to collaborate with businesses </connor>
<connor> yeah like i went to the supermarket and </connor>
<connor> i saw like washing detergent </connor>
<connor> there's like a bungo stray dogs </connor>
<joey> collaboration oh yeah we got one with </joey>
<joey> levi on it yeah and i was like </joey>
<connor> okay levi that makes sense yeah but like </connor>
<joey> some shows it's like why </joey>
<joey> why does bongo stray dogs have a </joey>
<connor> collaboration with washing detergent to </connor>
<connor> be fair </connor>
<garnt> it works i'm a weeb it works i see i see </garnt>
<garnt> like i see evangelion i see oscar's face </garnt>
<garnt> plus </garnt>
<garnt> plastered on some coffee i'm like i need </garnt>
<connor> no no no no this is why i hate it </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> to me right you don't go to a fine </connor>
<connor> dining like restaurant for example right </connor>
<connor> yeah and they </connor>
<connor> they draw a [ __ ] smiley face on your </connor>
<connor> hamburger you'd be insulted wouldn't you </connor>
<connor> you'd be like no no no where's my steak </connor>
<connor> why is there a smiley on it </connor>
<connor> this is the way i see stuff and like if </connor>
<connor> you put like characters on it or you put </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] smiley faces i hate it when </connor>
<connor> disneyland does that by the way when </connor>
<connor> they put [ __ ] smiley faces on your </connor>
<connor> food </connor>
<connor> it's like what is my food a joke to you </connor>
<connor> i want to eat it [ __ ] okay never mind </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna get it off around </connor>
<connor> but like to me you're making the product </connor>
<connor> seem more childish by putting stuff on </connor>
<connor> it so when i see these collaborations </connor>
<connor> like most the time with like especially </connor>
<garnt> with the animes at the cafes i'm like </garnt>
<connor> this is all disgusting right you're </connor>
<garnt> selling me a three dollar latte for 10 </garnt>
<connor> times the price </connor>
<garnt> i mean i'm offended i mean i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's it's very similar to what </garnt>
<garnt> they do in the west with celebrities but </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> you know you don't get like a kim </connor>
<connor> kardashian latte um </connor>
<connor> didn't travis scott just do like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] collaboration with mcdonald's </connor>
<garnt> i wasn't that insanely like successful </garnt>
<connor> as well yeah but wait okay first of all </connor>
<connor> i'm near certain correct me if i'm wrong </connor>
<connor> they didn't plaster his like face on it </connor>
<garnt> i'm pretty sure they had like a specific </garnt>
<garnt> menu </garnt>
<joey> and i thought okay fine yeah it's ten </joey>
<connor> dollars by the way yeah </connor>
<connor> which is [ __ ] ridiculous yeah but </connor>
<joey> with stuff like that but you have to </joey>
<connor> understand that </connor>
<joey> the fans will pay any amount of money </joey>
<connor> right for that one photo right right </connor>
<connor> right so then i i you know i go i go </connor>
<connor> to have it and i gotta drink it and then </connor>
<connor> as i drink this latte </connor>
<connor> like this film of like the plastic [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that they printed it </connor>
<connor> goes in my mouth and i'm like like god </connor>
<connor> it's disgusting </connor>
<connor> it's vile i i don't have to peel [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> off my coffee </connor>
<connor> to eat it so i'm here scooping it out </connor>
<connor> ruining this picture they printed on it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and i just ended up hating all </connor>
<joey> of it i don't care how much for a fan i </joey>
<joey> am of something i don't want that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> printed on my food i mean that's kind of </joey>
<joey> on you then for going to that cafe right </joey>
<joey> like you could have easily just gone to </joey>
<joey> starbucks right here yeah that's the </joey>
<joey> thing is if you go to the exhibition or </joey>
<connor> whatever you go to these things i don't </connor>
<connor> mean not that like there's like enough </connor>
<connor> there if you're a fan right but yeah </connor>
<connor> like you have to you have to obligatory </connor>
<joey> go to the gift shop on the cafe because </joey>
<joey> you know yeah of course you have to and </joey>
<joey> you know the gift shop sometimes has </joey>
<joey> some good stuff but some stuff that i </joey>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> care about like they're obsessed with </connor>
<connor> making coasters of characters </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's it's it's not just the </garnt>
<garnt> coasters i've noticed that as well </garnt>
<joey> because </joey>
<connor> it's they they're putting gacha into it </connor>
<joey> as well because the blind box </joey>
<connor> so if you want to collect the character </connor>
<connor> you actually like you gotta you gotta </connor>
<connor> buy more [ __ ] right you gotta buy </connor>
<connor> an extra meal because that was exactly </connor>
<garnt> the same thing as when i went to the </garnt>
<garnt> fate museum as well </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like being a kid all over again </garnt>
<garnt> with the the happy meal toys </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah man i remember one time i like </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> really there burger king were doing this </garnt>
<connor> collaboration with like spongebob toys </connor>
<connor> and i was like mom listen this is the </connor>
<joey> third i need to go destroy this is the </joey>
<joey> third patrick star i've had mom can you </joey>
<connor> please go and do like a karen thing and </connor>
<connor> get me the the other toy </connor>
<joey> yeah my my parents used to do that all </joey>
<joey> the time you would always go up and ask </joey>
<connor> but sometimes they'd be like no </connor>
<joey> really yeah i've never heard of someone </joey>
<garnt> saying no yeah really yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they're usually just like whatever i </garnt>
<garnt> don't get paid enough yeah yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> it's like i don't control the gotcha </joey>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] guarantee i don't care i </connor>
<joey> get paid six dollars an hour i'm just </joey>
<joey> give it to you </joey>
<connor> but yeah i just i'm not a big fan of the </connor>
<connor> collaboration cafes i just feel like </connor>
<connor> you don't really get that good of an </connor>
<garnt> experience of the show i feel like the </garnt>
<connor> collaboration cafes </connor>
<connor> are a bit [ __ ] a bit tactical a bit </connor>
<connor> tacky </connor>
<connor> no yes it's tacky like which i i feel </connor>
<connor> like most anime cafes are </connor>
<connor> like that i've never been i've met never </connor>
<garnt> been to like an anime cafe and been </garnt>
<garnt> impressed by it </garnt>
<connor> because no it's it's like you go in this </connor>
<connor> room that's like a normal sized cafe and </connor>
<connor> you're like oh </connor>
<connor> they've just plastered paintings of the </connor>
<connor> characters in the shows on the wall </connor>
<joey> wow look at this like they don't even </joey>
<joey> get creative with it like i i would say </joey>
<connor> i've been to quite a few because aki </connor>
<connor> likes to do videos </connor>
<connor> yeah but i'd say the only i've only ever </connor>
<connor> been to two collaborative cafes where i </connor>
<connor> was just like i would go back and that's </connor>
<connor> the pokemon cafe and the kirby cafe </connor>
<connor> but that's just because nintendo has </connor>
<connor> just so much bigger of a budget </connor>
<joey> yeah that they can afford to get a </joey>
<joey> little more creative with it right yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah there's so many of them you go and </connor>
<connor> watch a youtube video of someone like </connor>
<connor> going to a cafe </connor>
<joey> and it's like you could see these </joey>
<joey> youtubers desperately trying to get like </joey>
<joey> seven minutes out of this cafe yeah at </joey>
<joey> the end of the day it's just like it's </joey>
<connor> literally just paintings on a wall yeah </connor>
<joey> i went to the weathering with you cafe </joey>
<joey> and that [ __ ] was so </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's because it's the same </garnt>
<joey> formula every time </joey>
<connor> and you if you like if you come to japan </connor>
<connor> come to like one anime cafe </connor>
<connor> and then realize that that's that's the </connor>
<joey> experience for every cafe you know that </joey>
<joey> you the way i see it is that you come </joey>
<joey> once as a tourist and you're like </joey>
<joey> that was cool yeah and then you just </joey>
<garnt> don't go to any others because they're </garnt>
<joey> all the same </joey>
<joey> no no i was gonna say like also how they </joey>
<joey> get you with all these like anime cafes </joey>
<connor> is that they </connor>
<connor> they're only open for limited amounts of </connor>
<connor> time right because they would [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> make money </connor>
<connor> yeah there's a sense of urgency where </connor>
<connor> it's like oh the promised netherlands </connor>
<connor> cafe is only open for two weeks </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i would promise neverland </connor>
<connor> let's go and then you go and you get </connor>
<connor> disappointed and before you can </connor>
<garnt> file a complaint it's it's gone the food </garnt>
<garnt> was vile as well oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's all microwaved food or whatever the </garnt>
<garnt> kirby cafe that had some really good </garnt>
<garnt> food </garnt>
<joey> i was like i was like i was actually </joey>
<joey> like wow i've never had someone be like </joey>
<joey> you must try this souffle you must you </joey>
<joey> must go to the square innings </joey>
<connor> collaboration cafe for the best it's </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not like going to the jojo </garnt>
<connor> bar where there was obviously like a fan </connor>
<joey> of jojo who like </joey>
<joey> personalized these cocktails </joey>
<joey> it's all sponsored it's all corporate </joey>
<connor> businessmen stamping like </connor>
<connor> yes collaboration yeah what can we do </connor>
<connor> coasters </connor>
<garnt> let's print the character on a latte and </garnt>
<garnt> put some anime posters up </garnt>
<garnt> and then sell a bunch of clear files i </garnt>
<connor> realize you're probably like </connor>
<connor> like breaking so many dreams right now </connor>
<garnt> by explaining how [ __ ] they are </garnt>
<connor> listen if you come here on a like a </connor>
<joey> visiting you'll probably find it </joey>
<joey> interesting if there's a show you really </joey>
<joey> like but in general </joey>
<connor> yeah like like the cafe is always the </connor>
<connor> lowest point to any like big anime event </connor>
<connor> because i went </connor>
<connor> i went to the faye cafe but that was the </connor>
<joey> fake cafe </joey>
<joey> in the fate museum and the museum the </joey>
<joey> exhibition actually </joey>
<joey> was [ __ ] awesome oh yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because you got to see the entire </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] history of this franchise </joey>
<garnt> like of not just fake but like the </garnt>
<garnt> entire like type moon universe and </garnt>
<joey> everything yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> see that's cool if it's like a like </joey>
<joey> because i went to the corner super cafe </joey>
<garnt> yeah but that was in par with the corner </garnt>
<garnt> super movie </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so you you can only go to this cafe </garnt>
<garnt> if you bought tickets to the movie yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<connor> that was like okay you know it's like a </connor>
<garnt> little bonus thing but i wouldn't go all </garnt>
<connor> the way to central tokyo </connor>
<garnt> to go to a [ __ ] corner no no no it's </garnt>
<garnt> just not worth it like i i definitely </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't recommend going to any pop-up </garnt>
<garnt> cafes if something's limited time then </garnt>
<garnt> they have not put effort into it no no </garnt>
<connor> dude the </connor>
<connor> the best cafe i went to is actually like </connor>
<connor> the one i made a video on which is like </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> 3d latte art yeah that cafe is so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good i went to suck your own </connor>
<garnt> dick there </garnt>
<connor> just like yeah i must say the only good </connor>
<joey> cafe i've been to is the one that i made </joey>
<connor> i wouldn't make a video on if i didn't </connor>
<joey> think it was good right like yeah but </joey>
<joey> that again that's like a permanent cafe </joey>
<connor> that's right yeah that's bad because you </connor>
<connor> can literally the best part about that </connor>
<connor> thing is you can take in like anything </connor>
<connor> that you want you're like </connor>
<connor> make it 3d yeah like they'll find a way </connor>
<connor> to do it it's so [ __ ] cool </connor>
<connor> also that guy on twitter shitpost like </connor>
<joey> crazy the owner is so good </joey>
<joey> so funny yeah that's the thing it's like </joey>
<garnt> again like again the reason why i like </garnt>
<garnt> the pokemon cafe and the kirby cafe so </garnt>
<garnt> good is because they're permanent yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they're also </garnt>
<connor> every every season they're like oh we </connor>
<connor> can bring out something a little bit </connor>
<joey> more experimental if it doesn't work </joey>
<connor> take it out yeah nintendo are really </connor>
<connor> good at doing like i mean have you seen </connor>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<garnt> the the new uh theme park they're </garnt>
<connor> releasing yeah yeah yeah it's opening </connor>
<garnt> february right my god i saw that i saw a </garnt>
<garnt> picture of that i thought wow legoland's </garnt>
<connor> really improved </connor>
<connor> i didn't think it was real at first </connor>
<garnt> think we've talked about that okay so i </garnt>
<garnt> watched the video of uh </garnt>
<connor> uh what's the guy's name shigeru mimoto </connor>
<connor> oh yeah like having a tour of it </connor>
<connor> and you get like a bracelet that you can </connor>
<connor> like hit [ __ ] with and like there's like </connor>
<connor> keys and stuff </connor>
<connor> really dude it looks badass yeah like i </connor>
<connor> felt like a 10 year old watching him </connor>
<joey> like talk about it i'm like yeah </joey>
<connor> sorry i saw a japanese youtuber who got </connor>
<connor> like first access ever as a youtuber but </connor>
<connor> he's also been </connor>
<connor> it's in the japanese of course but he's </connor>
<joey> been sponsored by usj </joey>
<joey> and nintendo in the past he's literally </joey>
<connor> like japan's like youtuber oh he cooking </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah because one time the </joey>
<joey> like i had a policeman that was asking </joey>
<joey> me like what do you do and i was like </joey>
<connor> youtuber he's like oh like hikakin </connor>
<joey> like no i'm not like hika i'm like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah dude yeah whatever </joey>
<connor> like hikakin and youtuber are like </connor>
<joey> synonymous yeah yeah they're pretty much </joey>
<joey> strange but uh yeah what's the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> we've never talked about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so this is how you get tickets in japan </garnt>
<connor> basically yeah </connor>
<joey> that's better than scalping let's go </joey>
<joey> what's golfing </joey>
<connor> scalping is people who buy a [ __ ] ton of </connor>
<joey> things and then just jump on prices </joey>
<garnt> i mean people do that too i mean it's </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's in theory to stop that from </garnt>
<joey> happening right </joey>
<joey> but like for example the when the </joey>
<joey> olympics for example uh </joey>
<joey> we don't know if that's going to be </joey>
<joey> happening next year but uh we've already </joey>
<connor> announced that it will be </connor>
<joey> yeah we'll see i reckon it'll happen no </joey>
<connor> matter what but it'll be interesting to </connor>
<joey> see how they'll do it yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly but like with the olympics for </joey>
<joey> example they did it it's so dumb so they </joey>
<joey> do a lottery </joey>
<joey> that you enter and it's like a lottery </joey>
<joey> to get a certain amount of tickets so </joey>
<joey> this is how we do it so like uh when i </joey>
<joey> went to the persona 5 </joey>
<joey> uh concert yeah it was a lottery system </joey>
<joey> but it was really weird because it was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you go into the lottery to get a certain </joey>
<joey> number of tickets </joey>
<joey> and they're different lotteries so it's </joey>
<joey> like if you want to go just by yourself </joey>
<joey> you enter the lottery to get one ticket </joey>
<joey> but there's another lottery to get two </joey>
<joey> tickets or three tickets or four tickets </joey>
<joey> and just because you enter into one of </joey>
<joey> them it's not </joey>
<joey> guaranteed that you're gonna get those </joey>
<joey> tickets yeah but then </joey>
<joey> what it is is that you might think oh </joey>
<joey> okay so if you win the lottery </joey>
<joey> then you just get the tickets right no </joey>
<joey> you get the right to purchase the </joey>
<garnt> tickets </garnt>
<garnt> japan have figured out a way to gachify </garnt>
<garnt> every process </garnt>
<connor> possible man yeah i mean it's also i </connor>
<connor> also saw that you could get some of the </connor>
<connor> tickets but you could only be entered </connor>
<connor> into some of them if you bought like a </connor>
<joey> panasonic device </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah they were like giving </connor>
<connor> away some of the tickets to i was like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> and also and also the shitty thing as </joey>
<joey> well is that like say you enter the </joey>
<connor> lottery to get four tickets right </connor>
<connor> but you're not sure if you're gonna get </connor>
<connor> it so you want to enter multiple times </connor>
<connor> but here's the kicker say you win twice </connor>
<connor> right in that four ticket lottery you're </connor>
<joey> forced to pay for those eight tickets </joey>
<joey> you can't back out of that [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> you're actually forced like even if </joey>
<joey> it's only four people that you're going </joey>
<joey> with and you just did another lottery </joey>
<joey> for backup </joey>
<joey> you have to buy eight tickets it just it </joey>
<joey> just doesn't make sense to me it just </joey>
<joey> doesn't make sense i mean i </joey>
<joey> i i understand in theory why they do it </joey>
<garnt> but i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> this is this this is like trying to put </garnt>
<garnt> out a fire with cooking oil </garnt>
<joey> you know what i mean it's just the most </joey>
<joey> roundabout [ __ ] time-consuming way </joey>
<joey> to do it and i guarantee nintendo line's </joey>
<connor> going to do the same thing </connor>
<connor> yeah probably i mean nintendo haven't </connor>
<connor> got the best rep at the moment </connor>
<connor> they've been like [ __ ] everything up </connor>
<joey> i can't believe that man </joey>
<joey> nintendo and dmca are like that right </joey>
<connor> now yeah with the stuff with the smash </connor>
<connor> tournament did you see that as well that </connor>
<joey> was a while back yeah yeah did you not </joey>
<connor> see that no i didn't see that </connor>
<connor> basically they like just uh cease and </connor>
<connor> desisted a big tournament they've been </connor>
<connor> going on for a while </connor>
<connor> and everyone was like the [ __ ] because </connor>
<connor> they were using um </connor>
<connor> um so the obviously the netcode of the </connor>
<connor> switch smash brothers is pretty garbage </connor>
<connor> yeah so people fan modded their own </connor>
<garnt> version of it that's much better </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's called like slippy or something </garnt>
<garnt> and they didn't allow that and because </garnt>
<garnt> they were going to use </garnt>
<joey> that it's called slippy yeah because it </joey>
<joey> like actually runs smoothly because </joey>
<joey> nintendo online sucks </joey>
<joey> yeah and always has sucked and the fact </joey>
<joey> they pay for it is kind of a joke yeah </joey>
<joey> um because you don't really get anything </joey>
<joey> out of it like it's awful it's so bad </joey>
<joey> like i love nintendo but god damn is </joey>
<joey> that online </joey>
<joey> sock yeah they're really going to fix </joey>
<joey> that and so they cease and desist of </joey>
<joey> them </joey>
<joey> and then they were also sponsoring a </joey>
<connor> splatoon tournament </connor>
<connor> right and guess how much the what guess </connor>
<connor> what the prize was for the so they were </connor>
<connor> giving the prize </connor>
<connor> like sanctioned event yeah they're </connor>
<connor> giving the top prize for a team of five </connor>
<garnt> versus five was a </garnt>
<garnt> 25 nintendo eshop gift card </garnt>
<garnt> and then oh my god they're dead they </garnt>
<garnt> they </garnt>
<garnt> they canceled the event because one of </garnt>
<joey> the teams had something like </joey>
<joey> free smash or something it was like like </joey>
<joey> had something </joey>
<joey> along the lines of like nintendo over </joey>
<connor> there i'd like to for solidarity with </connor>
<joey> the smash bros </joey>
<joey> prize you can't even pay for whatever </joey>
<connor> you can't even split that you can't even </connor>
<joey> pay for the game </joey>
<joey> your [ __ ] tournament is it's just </joey>
<connor> funny because it's like </connor>
<connor> for some reason nintendo just wants </connor>
<connor> their [ __ ] eyepiece to die like i </connor>
<garnt> don't get it dude </garnt>
<garnt> right games are sweating man they're </garnt>
<garnt> just like oh there's a new competitor in </garnt>
<connor> the esports scene now </connor>
<connor> it's it's wild to me because you just </connor>
<garnt> see the like the complete difference </garnt>
<garnt> again like you said riot right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you have the [ __ ] what is it the </garnt>
<joey> baron pat red bull pack </joey>
<garnt> the red bull mercedes drive to victory </garnt>
<joey> like they're fully embracing like </joey>
<connor> becoming sports and nintendo's like none </connor>
<garnt> of that </garnt>
<garnt> games the state farm analyst desk god i </garnt>
<garnt> remember watching worlds this year </garnt>
<joey> and it was so weird just seeing like </joey>
<connor> literally everything monitored it's </connor>
<connor> literally like watching </connor>
<connor> i say that drinking my g fuel out of my </connor>
<joey> g4 </joey>
<connor> thank you for sponsoring trash taste </connor>
<connor> their meal and i said it </connor>
<connor> yeah it is it is funny how it's become </connor>
<connor> like american football where like </connor>
<joey> every single part of the game is like </joey>
<joey> sponsored and then you again you have </joey>
<joey> the complete opposite where nintendo's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> yeah we don't want to put any of this </joey>
<connor> because because nintendo could make </connor>
<joey> money off it if they really wanted to </joey>
<joey> they only be in charge of this but they </joey>
<joey> just have no interest in it no i mean </joey>
<connor> you know </connor>
<joey> we've i mean they're probably already </joey>
<joey> making enough as is well that's that </joey>
<connor> that's the japanese mindset isn't it </connor>
<joey> yeah like we've made enough </joey>
<connor> doing it the way we like you don't want </connor>
<connor> to make more money yeah but like </connor>
<connor> i guess which is so odd for a business </connor>
<connor> to </connor>
<connor> say because i think what was it like </connor>
<connor> last year nintendo was the most </connor>
<connor> cash-rich company in japan yeah </connor>
<garnt> which is insane i i i think there's </garnt>
<garnt> something is slightly wrong with that </garnt>
<garnt> statement it's not that they don't want </garnt>
<garnt> to make more money </garnt>
<garnt> because from like my experience working </garnt>
<garnt> with japanese money </garnt>
<garnt> japanese companies they want to make as </garnt>
<garnt> much money as possible that they but </garnt>
<garnt> they only </garnt>
<garnt> want to make as much money as possible </garnt>
<garnt> using the methods </garnt>
<joey> it's not that they don't want to make </joey>
<garnt> money is that they don't know how to </garnt>
<joey> make money in other ways exactly </joey>
<joey> exactly because they like esports well i </joey>
<connor> think it's </connor>
<connor> i think it's where if you ask someone </connor>
<connor> like you know if you ask me connor you </connor>
<connor> can make </connor>
<connor> ten dollars guaranteed or connor you can </connor>
<joey> make a hundred dollars by you know </joey>
<joey> pushing yourself </joey>
<joey> being a little crazy and it might it </joey>
<joey> might might go horribly wrong of course </joey>
<joey> every time i'm gonna be like 100 bucks </joey>
<joey> let's do it yeah of course but </joey>
<joey> the japanese companies don't see it that </joey>
<joey> way yeah yeah japanese companies like </joey>
<joey> yeah there's one person in the company </joey>
<joey> that wants to get creative but he has to </joey>
<joey> ask 60 other people for yes </joey>
<garnt> yeah you know and that might take a </garnt>
<garnt> while but by the time they always say </garnt>
<connor> yeah our new trends come out </connor>
<connor> i get it because almost you know if </connor>
<connor> you're the you're the head of these </connor>
<connor> companies you don't want to </connor>
<connor> get make a hundred odd people lose that </connor>
<connor> job yeah right so you're getting a safe </connor>
<connor> route </connor>
<connor> but sometimes the safe route can just </connor>
<connor> lead to being stacked yeah but also it's </connor>
<joey> like how </joey>
<connor> detrimental could it be if like one </connor>
<connor> thing doesn't work out right like again </connor>
<connor> nintendo is the most cash rich company </connor>
<joey> in japan right it's like how much do </joey>
<connor> they have to lose </connor>
<connor> it sucks because you just everyone like </connor>
<joey> wants nintendo to just </joey>
<joey> do this [ __ ] yeah because everyone </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loves everyone wants to </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] scene into everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> cheering for nintendo just to do the </garnt>
<garnt> right thing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i mean it's literally the </garnt>
<garnt> opposite of like ea where everyone just </garnt>
<garnt> wants the a to keep [ __ ] up and keep </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] up to the point where laws have </connor>
<connor> to be made but with nintendo everyone </connor>
<connor> just wants to see </connor>
<connor> and it's it's like in the sh you know </connor>
<connor> you have those typical shows where </connor>
<connor> you know the brother is addicted to </connor>
<connor> drugs and the whole family is super nice </connor>
<connor> and he's like come on </connor>
<connor> just please stop just come on get get </connor>
<connor> back on your feet man come on </connor>
<connor> nintendo yeah how many chances do we </connor>
<connor> have to give you how many rehabs do we </connor>
<connor> need to put you through </connor>
<joey> to see you get back on track especially </joey>
<joey> after all the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> w's that they were taking these last </connor>
<connor> couple of years yeah they were just like </connor>
<connor> killing every e3 everyone was like yep </connor>
<connor> nintendo king yeah exactly [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> everybody else and now they just like </connor>
<joey> we haven't had a nail in a while let's </joey>
<joey> let's let's give that a couple of them </joey>
<joey> people [ __ ] lost their [ __ ] when they </joey>
<connor> brought out literal cardboard like </connor>
<connor> like this is a company that can release </connor>
<connor> cardboard and we'll eat it up </connor>
<connor> like this this is how much all right </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i completely forgot about that yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> okay at the end of the day they do like </garnt>
<garnt> the coolest [ __ ] [ __ ] like they do </garnt>
<garnt> nintendo are just doing their own thing </garnt>
<garnt> man yeah like i played ring fit and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<joey> who what kind of crackhead came up with </joey>
<joey> this idea to like just [ __ ] exercise </joey>
<joey> with a ring </joey>
<joey> and like and it works and it's good like </joey>
<garnt> who came up with this [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> this is insane we've never seen this </connor>
<garnt> from any other company it's it seems </garnt>
<connor> like creatively </connor>
<connor> they will take any [ __ ] risk possible </connor>
<connor> yeah but like on a business sense </connor>
<connor> they're like </connor>
<connor> no no we do not do business here yeah we </connor>
<garnt> don't we only we only make things </garnt>
<joey> business is not allowed this episode is </joey>
<joey> sponsored by expressvpn when you use the </joey>
<garnt> bathroom you can always close the door </garnt>
<joey> behind you right </joey>
<joey> no no no you never actually never do oh </joey>
<joey> my god </joey>
<joey> proud with the door open well [ __ ] that </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] up the next line of this </joey>
<joey> but i'm gonna say it anyway you don't </joey>
<joey> want a random passerby looking in on you </joey>
<garnt> unless you're these boys so why would </garnt>
<garnt> you let people look in on you when you </garnt>
<garnt> go online </garnt>
<garnt> using the internet without expressvpn is </garnt>
<garnt> like going to the bathroom </garnt>
<garnt> without closing your door that's a </garnt>
<connor> nightmare did you know that your </connor>
<connor> internet service provider like comcast </connor>
<connor> verizon </connor>
<joey> knows every single website you visit i </joey>
<joey> didn't connor but thank you for letting </joey>
<connor> us know </connor>
<connor> and what's worse i'm told is that they </connor>
<connor> can sell this information to ad </connor>
<garnt> companies and tech giants who will use </garnt>
<connor> your data </connor>
<garnt> to target you i don't believe it but </garnt>
<joey> don't worry expressvpn can put a stop to </joey>
<joey> that it creates a secure encrypted </joey>
<joey> tunnel between your device and the </joey>
<joey> internet so that your online activity </joey>
<garnt> can't be seen by anyone i use expressvpn </garnt>
<garnt> on all my devices it works on everything </garnt>
<garnt> phones laptops even routers so everyone </garnt>
<connor> who shares your wi-fi and the best part </connor>
<connor> is using expressvpn is as easy as </connor>
<connor> closing the bathroom door </connor>
<connor> you just fire up the app click one </connor>
<connor> button and you're protected expressvpn </connor>
<connor> is the world's </connor>
<connor> number one rated vpn by cnet wyatt the </connor>
<connor> verge and countless others </connor>
<garnt> so if you're like me believing your </garnt>
<garnt> online activity should be </garnt>
<garnt> your business like when you take a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> secure yourself by visiting </garnt>
<garnt> expressvpn.com trash taste today </garnt>
<garnt> that's expressvpn.com trash taste where </garnt>
<connor> you can get extra </connor>
<joey> three three months that's expressvpn.com </joey>
<joey> taste links down in the description </joey>
<connor> below i think i think the creative they </connor>
<connor> obviously trust their creative </connor>
<connor> people at nintendo and they obviously </connor>
<connor> let them do the crazy ideas like they </connor>
<garnt> released the </garnt>
<garnt> mario kart like ar uh did you see that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah basically like get your own rc </garnt>
<garnt> cars with cameras in them that can </garnt>
<garnt> oh no i saw that which is again another </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] call </garnt>
<joey> okay yeah it's so cool and 99 people </joey>
<joey> can't do this because i don't have the </joey>
<connor> living room </connor>
<connor> actually i actually i actually do but i </connor>
<joey> mean most people come people </joey>
<connor> yeah i also the thought of having to put </connor>
<connor> a track down and then clean it up </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly i mean you know just the </joey>
<connor> whole concept of mario maker right </connor>
<garnt> yeah that's like it's like clearly </garnt>
<joey> they're embracing like their fans </joey>
<connor> creative side </connor>
<connor> yeah i love watching mario make your </connor>
<joey> videos yeah they're so cool </joey>
<joey> but no on the but but at the same time </joey>
<joey> they're like </joey>
<joey> mario party online no i've never heard </joey>
<connor> of that oh </connor>
<garnt> you just said you just said three </garnt>
<garnt> magical words that i didn't think i </garnt>
<garnt> needed to hear and then i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> why why why have i never thought of this </garnt>
<joey> before it's like that meme of like </joey>
<joey> whisper the three sexiest words into my </joey>
<connor> ears </connor>
<connor> i can't believe they released super </connor>
<connor> mario party on like two in 2018 </connor>
<connor> yeah and it didn't have online play and </connor>
<connor> had like four maps </connor>
<connor> and they were [ __ ] sorry i yeah i was so </connor>
<connor> disappointed because i [ __ ] love </connor>
<joey> mario park i mean my body's still good </joey>
<joey> land </joey>
<joey> but yeah you know online would be </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> okay do you feel that some part of the </garnt>
<connor> married party experience is being next </connor>
<garnt> to each other and just </garnt>
<connor> ah i get that but i would like the </connor>
<joey> option to play online for streaming </joey>
<connor> right if i need to </connor>
<connor> but also like you know it's the same </connor>
<connor> thing with like smash right like yeah </connor>
<connor> playing smash </connor>
<connor> land like next to your friends and </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on them irl is fun as [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah but they we very quickly found out </joey>
<joey> that online is also just as fun </joey>
<connor> it's gonna sound like a discord call </connor>
<connor> like that's fun as far as it's just sad </connor>
<connor> i mean i i feel like </connor>
<connor> they just hate happiness sometimes it's </connor>
<joey> like and i thought when when super mario </joey>
<joey> party released it's getting way too much </joey>
<joey> detail they had like four maps and they </joey>
<joey> were all mid and i was like okay well </joey>
<joey> they'll release new ones right they'll </joey>
<joey> update it they'll have dlc </joey>
<joey> right like i'm a [ __ ] liar yeah so </joey>
<joey> that never happened so i guess </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] dude i'm so sad about that that </connor>
<joey> game could have been something good </joey>
<joey> i'm always just hoping next mario </joey>
<joey> parties is the one that's gonna be </joey>
<garnt> online because i think </garnt>
<garnt> the thing is the problem with it is like </garnt>
<joey> everyone else is playing jess and </joey>
<joey> they're just playing [ __ ] hungry </joey>
<joey> hippos or something like that </joey>
<joey> and sometimes sometimes it's [ __ ] fun </joey>
<joey> as [ __ ] but other times you're just like </joey>
<connor> can you just go back to like a little </connor>
<joey> bit of chess you know like </joey>
<connor> play by the rules just a little bit you </connor>
<connor> know i don't get it because </connor>
<connor> you know we live in japan and they they </connor>
<connor> develop the games i do not know of any </connor>
<connor> japanese people who go around to each </connor>
<connor> other's houses </connor>
<connor> what do you mean you never hear of </connor>
<connor> people japanese people </connor>
<connor> meeting in their other people's houses </connor>
<joey> it's always an izakaya or another place </joey>
<joey> yeah maybe it's just because you don't </joey>
<connor> have that many japanese the ones i do </connor>
<connor> have never do that </connor>
<joey> oh i do that with my japanese friend do </joey>
<joey> you actually yeah i stand correctly i </joey>
<connor> mean not obviously not this year </connor>
<joey> but nowhere near as often as like going </joey>
<connor> out to like eat in an izakaya </connor>
<joey> oh yeah of course but like there's been </joey>
<joey> a lot of cases where i would go out to </joey>
<joey> eat and then we would go back to </joey>
<connor> someone's place yeah right but it's like </connor>
<connor> i feel like in in the west right we are </connor>
<connor> like 90 of the time it's like meet up at </connor>
<connor> each other's house get </connor>
<connor> you know future yeah because it's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] expensive to eat out in the west </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah whereas here it's like just </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah it's like the opposite where it's </connor>
<connor> like i feel like for a country that </connor>
<connor> should value what seems to be like </connor>
<connor> online play more yeah </connor>
<garnt> for some reason they don't include it no </garnt>
<garnt> because they don't need more </garnt>
<garnt> like reasons to stay at home that's </garnt>
<connor> that's already a big enough problem </connor>
<connor> they're like this is how we get them to </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] invite them </connor>
<connor> why is merlin's face like look like i </connor>
<joey> said something super racist </joey>
<joey> mario party and chill </joey>
<connor> they don't have netflix they'd rather </connor>
<connor> create like the next [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> tron vr sex machine toy than the word </garnt>
<garnt> mario party online let's be honest guys </garnt>
<joey> what was the thing we were talking about </joey>
<garnt> before again it was the </garnt>
<garnt> it was the tengah that the tank operates </garnt>
<connor> with vr </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah have you seen that no </garnt>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<joey> so for to explain i can't believe i'm </joey>
<garnt> explaining tango tenga </garnt>
<garnt> so tenger is just like an owner hole or </garnt>
<joey> like flashlight a fleshlight a </joey>
<joey> fleshlight basically you see </joey>
<garnt> a penis in it but it's but it's branded </garnt>
<joey> so it doesn't look like a fleshlight no </joey>
<joey> it's like really way too overly stylish </joey>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> it's a classic uh it's a classic it's </connor>
<connor> like a deodorant bottle yeah it's like a </connor>
<connor> classy pocket [ __ ] that's what it is </connor>
<connor> we're gonna call it that first first </connor>
<joey> class </joey>
<joey> i hate that word pocket [ __ ] that's why </joey>
<joey> i feel </joey>
<connor> it a tenga right just call it a tango </connor>
<garnt> yeah but basically tenga came out with </garnt>
<connor> this thing where </connor>
<connor> it would it's machine operated with like </connor>
<connor> ai in it </connor>
<garnt> and it works in tandem with vr porn </garnt>
<garnt> so you'd be watching vr so you put this </garnt>
<garnt> thing on your wheelie </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't have to touch it at all </garnt>
<garnt> you start the vr pawn </garnt>
<connor> and the thing will move in time with </connor>
<garnt> what you're seeing on the vr pawn that's </garnt>
<connor> funny i don't want to man i'm just like </connor>
<connor> i don't want that i don't want that </connor>
<connor> go to a brothel bro that's the first </connor>
<garnt> thing i think i'm like just </garnt>
<joey> at that point just go get laid by a real </joey>
<garnt> person please </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's like you're probably </garnt>
<joey> paying more for that tech </joey>
<connor> i think one session out of bro do you </connor>
<connor> feel like they're you know going to a </connor>
<connor> brothel is a bit different i think </connor>
<connor> you gotta you gotta you know you gotta </connor>
<connor> be the kind of person who's like i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna go to a brothel </connor>
<connor> i get it you know you're probably if you </connor>
<connor> want sex that badly but you're too </connor>
<connor> shameful to go to a brothel i get it </connor>
<connor> you're gonna pay like well i don't know </connor>
<connor> 20 grand </connor>
<connor> then it's in your house right right you </connor>
<connor> should never have visitors over yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<joey> what is that what is that like medieval </joey>
<connor> device you have in the corner </connor>
<joey> oh that's that's my section no i dude i </joey>
<joey> saw like a video of it it's straight up </joey>
<joey> looks like a torture device if you don't </joey>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> if you don't know what it is i'm good i </connor>
<connor> saw that on the news they had a thing </connor>
<connor> here where </connor>
<connor> the government was commissioning like ai </connor>
<connor> companies to like match people together </connor>
<connor> because the birth rate is declining so </connor>
<garnt> low but then i also feel like </garnt>
<garnt> that's going into like dystopian worlds </garnt>
<connor> yeah but then i i'm george </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you can't have a world that </connor>
<connor> exists where we're ai matching each </connor>
<connor> other but then also having </connor>
<connor> sex machines that cater for your every </connor>
<connor> need yeah why would i </connor>
<garnt> why would i sign up to the ai management </garnt>
<garnt> like 50 shades of grey in like 2050 is </garnt>
<garnt> just like this guy </garnt>
<garnt> just brings out his vr sex machine </garnt>
<connor> why would i sign up for an ai matchmaker </connor>
<garnt> which tango would you like </garnt>
<connor> he's not romancing a real girl he's </connor>
<connor> romancing an anime girl </connor>
<connor> why would i need to sign up for ai </connor>
<connor> matchmaking when i have the like </connor>
<connor> kumtron 7000 in my office you know what </connor>
<joey> i mean what even would the ai determine </joey>
<connor> like how do you even determine that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i don't know what did you see your star </connor>
<joey> signs seem to be matched very well </joey>
<joey> capricorns and sagittarius tend to [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> very rough knowing knowing the </connor>
<joey> japanese it'll probably be something </joey>
<connor> like it'll be yeah </connor>
<connor> it'll be blood type earning and male to </connor>
<connor> female and it'll be </connor>
<connor> right that's good you're compatible with </connor>
<connor> half the population fantastic </connor>
<joey> nothing has changed i don't get japan's </joey>
<joey> obsession with blood types man that's </joey>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah what is i don't you know your </garnt>
<connor> blood type i don't know i don't </connor>
<connor> know i think </connor>
<connor> is that good well i mean i know there's </connor>
<connor> three different types right there's o a </connor>
<connor> b and a b </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah one right a b is the real one </connor>
<connor> i mean i i should know because i have </connor>
<connor> like a blood disease so i i used to have </connor>
<connor> a medical bracelet </connor>
<garnt> yeah you probably shouldn't you know you </garnt>
<connor> should know shouldn't you i just have a </connor>
<connor> medical bracelet </connor>
<connor> uh that would be like you know if i if i </connor>
<joey> i'm bleeding please give me this thing </joey>
<joey> specifically </joey>
<joey> do you know what your parents are uh no </joey>
<connor> but then i lost that i lost the medical </connor>
<connor> bracelet so i don't know where it is </connor>
<joey> so uh the one thing you probably </joey>
<connor> shouldn't lose i haven't got a </connor>
<connor> replacement it's been like a few years </connor>
<garnt> now so </garnt>
<garnt> are you meant to like wear that always </garnt>
<connor> not meant to it's just like a suggestion </connor>
<connor> from the doctor </connor>
<joey> what blows my mind what blows my mind </joey>
<joey> though is that in japan at least like in </joey>
<garnt> japanese schools like </garnt>
<garnt> you can get bullied for your blood type </garnt>
<garnt> that's right damn man that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's next level bullying it's like </garnt>
<joey> it's like oh you're an a type that's </joey>
<garnt> just racism with extra steps man </garnt>
<connor> yeah that does sound like an excuse it's </connor>
<connor> like i thought he's a filthy old type </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> you can't hang out with us oh times </joey>
<connor> because you're an a type right and like </connor>
<joey> because </joey>
<connor> why why does everyone know each other's </connor>
<connor> blood type yeah i think i think it's </connor>
<connor> because like when you do like uh </connor>
<connor> health checks oh yeah we did that yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i haven't done mine yet it should be </joey>
<connor> written on your thing that was that was </connor>
<garnt> so strong so so to explain since we're </garnt>
<garnt> starting with geeks plus we are </garnt>
<garnt> technically under their health insurance </garnt>
<connor> and their company policy is that we have </connor>
<connor> to get a </connor>
<connor> health checkup once a year which </connor>
<connor> everyone in japan has to do is work </connor>
<connor> everyone in japan </connor>
<connor> twice a year okay twice we've been here </connor>
<garnt> for </garnt>
<garnt> one year already mail in but we've </garnt>
<garnt> already had one checkup how does that </garnt>
<joey> work </joey>
<garnt> okay okay so we're supposed to go twice </garnt>
<joey> but we've only just been once um and </joey>
<joey> it was weird because i it was weird </joey>
<joey> seeing how efficient a health </joey>
<joey> system can be yeah how long did it take </joey>
<garnt> because i haven't gone yet it took about </garnt>
<connor> 20 minutes to get 30. it's like 30. okay </connor>
<garnt> well so still that's </garnt>
<garnt> so in 30 minutes you do an x-ray </garnt>
<connor> uh your blood pressure you get weighed </connor>
<connor> you get blood taken </connor>
<connor> uh you do a hearing and uh sight test </connor>
<connor> yeah you talk to a doctor who'll talk to </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<joey> and then you do a cardiogram and a </joey>
<connor> cardiogram yeah wow 30 minutes </connor>
<connor> all inside it was like it was like speed </connor>
<connor> running we </connor>
<connor> we were speed running health checks and </connor>
<connor> they even had like [ __ ] splits as </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> because there's a gold split on that </connor>
<joey> x-ray x-ray split done all right </joey>
<joey> blood taking split let's go it literally </joey>
<joey> felt like that because it was like </joey>
<joey> because i was about like uh because i </joey>
<joey> had some problems with my forms i had to </joey>
<joey> fill out my form again so i was only </joey>
<joey> about like five to ten minutes behind </joey>
<joey> connor yeah and by the time i had just </joey>
<connor> like just started my </connor>
<connor> like i'm gonna call it a conveyor belt </connor>
<garnt> because that's what it felt like it felt </garnt>
<garnt> like i was in chicken run being </garnt>
<garnt> processed </garnt>
<garnt> um so i was i i just started the process </garnt>
<garnt> and connor was almost done </garnt>
<connor> wow it was the most efficient </connor>
<joey> because i saw the list of all the things </joey>
<joey> that get checked up and i was like oh </joey>
<connor> this is going to be like an old day yeah </connor>
<connor> you also have to pee the night before </connor>
<joey> and bring it with you which i just </joey>
<joey> always feel weird </joey>
<joey> oh yeah carrying a a violence </joey>
<joey> who knows what might arise so you go </joey>
<garnt> into this room and it's like this really </garnt>
<garnt> busy place in like shinjuku which i </garnt>
<garnt> imagine a lot of people will go to the </garnt>
<garnt> world in japan </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's uh like you go to this </garnt>
<garnt> uh reception area there's like 12 desks </garnt>
<connor> like come here you hand the form like </connor>
<connor> right go upstairs you go upstairs yeah </connor>
<connor> everyone's in like medical gowns yeah </connor>
<connor> like a really fancy office looking thing </connor>
<connor> right it's really odd </connor>
<connor> and it's basically just a small room not </connor>
<connor> even that big with like couches in the </connor>
<connor> middle </connor>
<connor> and then you can see the like sections </connor>
<connor> like it's a food court of like what's </connor>
<connor> going to do what </connor>
<connor> you can see everyone getting you can see </connor>
<connor> everyone you see everyone doing </connor>
<connor> everything yeah yeah and then </connor>
<connor> you they're like all right go in this </connor>
<connor> room get changed you put the medical </connor>
<connor> camera you come back in and then like </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> you have a number so you're literally </connor>
<joey> like a chicken in a farm it's like </joey>
<joey> actually chicken </joey>
<connor> like a piece of meat being like passed </connor>
<connor> around the different things </connor>
<connor> yeah you gotta get sanitized and so you </connor>
<connor> just they basically just come in they're </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> number 124 and then you go in and then </joey>
<joey> you just have to like </joey>
<connor> hopefully understand what they're saying </connor>
<joey> in general yeah they tell you </joey>
<connor> yeah it was just fast it was like boom </connor>
<joey> boom boom wow but i was like [ __ ] dude i </joey>
<joey> hate blood tests i hate getting my blood </joey>
<joey> taken yeah god i haven't done that in a </joey>
<connor> while </connor>
<joey> and then i was like i was just yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i got to do my next week </joey>
<connor> yeah that's fun it's fun is it no it's </connor>
<connor> not </connor>
<garnt> it's it's as fun as a health check can </garnt>
<connor> be because i it was something </connor>
<connor> that was so alien for me especially </connor>
<connor> coming from the uk which you know </connor>
<connor> pick up the nhs forgiving giving </connor>
<connor> everyone everyone free health care but </connor>
<connor> the price you pay </connor>
<connor> for that is that you have to wait for </connor>
<joey> everything yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah and when i say everything even </connor>
<connor> just going to the [ __ ] gp </connor>
<connor> it's sometimes yeah sometimes you're </connor>
<connor> like you got a fever or something i've </connor>
<connor> phoned up my gp </connor>
<connor> and they're like oh we can't six days </connor>
<connor> yeah we can't book you in until next </connor>
<connor> week and i'm i'm just like </connor>
<connor> great i guess i'll just try to sleep off </connor>
<connor> this i guess </connor>
<connor> for an entire week and by the time you </connor>
<connor> can see the gp you've already most of </connor>
<garnt> the time </garnt>
<connor> you've already recovered yeah i think i </connor>
<connor> never see the doctor in london but i </connor>
<connor> booked </connor>
<connor> three times to see it when i was like </connor>
<connor> dying and every time before the </connor>
<connor> appointment i got better and i had to </connor>
<connor> cancel it </connor>
<connor> because it was like i'm already better </connor>
<connor> right it literally takes a week at least </connor>
<connor> in london it's even </connor>
<connor> it's worse but i remember like i would </connor>
<connor> like i think i thought i broke my arm </connor>
<connor> one time when i was a kid and i was </connor>
<connor> i was in the emergency room and i'm like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] dude i'm gonna have to get an x-ray </connor>
<connor> and they're like yep so uh </connor>
<connor> come back in a week and a half and we'll </connor>
<connor> give you an x-ray and i'm like what </connor>
<connor> like what do i just do in a week like </connor>
<connor> what about my arm yeah like yeah </connor>
<connor> come back in a week and a half i'm like </connor>
<connor> but what do i do till then but like oh </connor>
<connor> just don't do anything to it i'm like </connor>
<connor> what do you mean don't do anything to it </connor>
<connor> all right what i should do for a week </connor>
<connor> and a half not move my arm that's </connor>
<garnt> so stupid man well yeah and it was so </garnt>
<garnt> weird going to the japanese health </garnt>
<connor> checkup </connor>
<connor> and they like they started off with the </connor>
<connor> x-ray because like when i think x-ray </connor>
<connor> i'm just like </connor>
<connor> in in my head i'm just like i'm not </connor>
<connor> getting an x-ray unless it's something </connor>
<connor> serious so this is obviously like the </connor>
<connor> big checkup this is the x-ray but no </connor>
<connor> they [ __ ] lubed us up lubed us up </connor>
<connor> with a [ __ ] x-ray man </connor>
<connor> like we went in there and we just like </connor>
<connor> they go please go to the x-ray machine </connor>
<connor> it's just like a a rectangle on a wall </connor>
<connor> and you just put your chest against it </connor>
<joey> yeah it's really odd oh because when i </joey>
<joey> imagine x-ray i </joey>
<connor> imagine like the light yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i always had that it was </connor>
<joey> bizarre </joey>
<joey> i've never i've never had an x-ray done </joey>
<garnt> before so yeah what was weird actually </garnt>
<garnt> was the </garnt>
<joey> cardiogram which uh where you like i've </joey>
<joey> never had that before yeah i've never </joey>
<joey> had that before </joey>
<joey> it's like lie down on the bed and you </joey>
<connor> kind of feel like a mental patient about </connor>
<connor> to get lobotomized </connor>
<connor> because they put these suckers on you </connor>
<connor> they put these suckers on you and then </connor>
<connor> they they put these </connor>
<connor> appendages on your uh on your heart and </connor>
<connor> your arms and legs </connor>
<connor> right and yeah it just kind of feels </connor>
<garnt> like you're about to get the bottom i </garnt>
<connor> was waiting for like the electric shock </connor>
<connor> to come </connor>
<connor> i was like go hit me but no nothing </connor>
<connor> happened then they did they </connor>
<connor> like they had to lube me up as well yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah they just put like lube </connor>
<garnt> on you because like i think i had chest </garnt>
<connor> hair </connor>
<garnt> all right so it doesn't go what maybe </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> what do you mean it's it's a natural </joey>
<connor> medicine </connor>
<connor> is uh i'm not talking about my in-depth </connor>
<garnt> colonoscopy maybe </garnt>
<garnt> mainland's off screen just like blushing </garnt>
<connor> which by the way which by the way like </connor>
<garnt> the smallest details i was i was told if </garnt>
<joey> you're over 35 </joey>
<joey> every year you have to have a </joey>
<connor> colonoscopy really yeah every year you </connor>
<joey> have to have a colonoscopy </joey>
<joey> it's because it's because uh japan in </joey>
<joey> japan hemorrhoids is a really common </joey>
<joey> problem </joey>
<joey> i'm legit i'm legit serious like i think </joey>
<joey> it's i think i saw something like crazy </joey>
<joey> like one in </joey>
<garnt> four men in japan have hemorrhoids yeah </garnt>
<garnt> conor was telling me afterwards that he </garnt>
<garnt> he doesn't want a colonoscopy because </garnt>
<garnt> he's </garnt>
<joey> afraid that he'll it'll awaken something </joey>
<connor> all i'm saying is like what if i dig it </connor>
<joey> man </joey>
<joey> what are you gonna like crack a fat on </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> surgeon i don't know man </connor>
<connor> because i was i was momentarily confused </connor>
<connor> i was like on my way </connor>
<connor> i'm like which end is that </connor>
<joey> i'm like because i thought about it </joey>
<joey> would you rather something go up your </joey>
<joey> ass or down your throat oh yeah cause i </joey>
<garnt> asked i think </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i thought he thought he was going </garnt>
<garnt> down your throat so they check your </garnt>
<connor> throat or down like this </connor>
<joey> what's that called that's a different </joey>
<connor> thing something else and i was like i </connor>
<connor> was like totally down i'm like all right </connor>
<connor> fine put it on my ass </connor>
<connor> down my throat whatever up my ass no no </connor>
<connor> um then also when we were doing this </connor>
<connor> health checkup as well they would like </connor>
<joey> we had like the the blood pressure thing </joey>
<connor> which yeah </connor>
<joey> like the thing in it which also always </joey>
<joey> feels weird that squeezes your arms yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and then the doctor was like yeah you </joey>
<joey> did you did good on that and i'm like </joey>
<joey> what does that mean </joey>
<joey> what does that mean what is doing bad </joey>
<joey> i'm like i'm like </joey>
<joey> explain what did good means like your </joey>
<joey> numbers are good i'm like yeah explain </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] numbers to me what is this </connor>
<connor> supposed to mean </connor>
<joey> i got that was like i put all my </joey>
<joey> attention into my arm to change my blood </joey>
<connor> pressure yeah i was i was doing </connor>
<connor> something like hunter hunter men [ __ ] on </connor>
<connor> that thing i'm like </connor>
<joey> heart rate zero you did like avatar </joey>
<joey> blood bending [ __ ] it's just like yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i will now make my heart rate zero so my </connor>
<connor> enemies cannot find me </connor>
<garnt> then we got a blood taken and i remember </garnt>
<connor> we were before we got a blood team we </connor>
<connor> were talking about you know </connor>
<connor> yeah we were talking about how the </connor>
<connor> japanese health system had we've had </connor>
<connor> we've all had pretty good </connor>
<connor> experiences with the japanese health </connor>
<connor> system because we all have like i don't </connor>
<connor> know why we all have like that inherent </connor>
<connor> fear that you know everyone's had a </connor>
<connor> shitty </connor>
<connor> shitty experience when they have taken </connor>
<connor> the blood and they've just missed the </connor>
<connor> vein </connor>
<connor> right yeah and that happened to me </connor>
<connor> that really yeah that like it was </connor>
<connor> foreshadowing that happened to me </connor>
<connor> because i </connor>
<connor> i knew it as soon as he stuck the needle </connor>
<connor> in because you know you you can feel it </connor>
<connor> when when like it goes straight to your </connor>
<connor> vein </connor>
<connor> it feels exactly like the doctor </connor>
<connor> describes it's just like a prick right </connor>
<connor> yeah and it just comes out </connor>
<connor> so he sticks this needle in and i could </connor>
<connor> feel immediately </connor>
<connor> that something was wrong because it was </connor>
<connor> like that's not a vein that's muscle and </connor>
<connor> you start feeling pain </connor>
<connor> and i felt sorry for anyone who has like </connor>
<connor> a needle phobia because i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> i'm not uh like so i can feel him like </connor>
<connor> kind of </connor>
<connor> twitching the needle around my arm and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like i'm just like how do i </connor>
<connor> tell him he's not there how do i tell </connor>
<connor> him it's not there </connor>
<connor> and he does it for like a full like </connor>
<garnt> minute before he realizes </garnt>
<garnt> oh there's no blood coming out and i </garnt>
<connor> look and i look how he's just pulling up </connor>
<garnt> fat like yeah i mean </garnt>
<connor> i look over and there's like you know </connor>
<connor> you know like the vial of blood </connor>
<connor> yeah there's like the viola the vile was </connor>
<connor> filled up that much </connor>
<connor> like the minute he was poking my arms </connor>
<garnt> like scar tissue yeah </garnt>
<garnt> god [ __ ] done it man i knew it so i </garnt>
<connor> felt so embarrassed i was like [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> want to be cool and not like like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> myself here </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but then i was like oh god and </connor>
<connor> i was like oh no the nurse is cute oh no </connor>
<joey> i can't i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> i think with needles i feel needles are </joey>
<joey> the only time where you can bring out </joey>
<joey> your inner [ __ ] and just be like </joey>
<garnt> i don't i don't know i i can't look at </garnt>
<garnt> the needle going in </garnt>
<joey> i like oh i i have to look at the needle </joey>
<garnt> going you do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i i like it's on the contrary for me if </garnt>
<joey> i if he's like all right we're gonna go </joey>
<joey> in and if i don't see it and i feel a </joey>
<joey> prick that scares me joey's </joey>
<connor> jerry's just like he's like it's going </connor>
<joey> in yeah no legit i have to go like </joey>
<garnt> hard i'm just being like do it do it now </garnt>
<connor> wait so what about wait what about </connor>
<connor> staring at you being like pierced helps </connor>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> because i know when the pain is coming </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<garnt> you know what i mean like no no because </garnt>
<garnt> because when you're ex </garnt>
<joey> then you're expecting the pain no no </joey>
<joey> what's worse for me is unexpected pain </joey>
<joey> where i'm just like i'm just chilling </joey>
<connor> with this like ow you barely feel it if </connor>
<joey> you don't look though </joey>
<joey> no no no i feel a more if i don't yeah </joey>
<garnt> because that's that's like </garnt>
<garnt> have you have you ever like cut yourself </garnt>
<garnt> or have like an injury you don't feel it </garnt>
<garnt> all day </garnt>
<joey> yeah and then suddenly you look at it </joey>
<joey> and you're like wow there's a cut and </joey>
<garnt> then suddenly you start feeling it </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah that's me that's me a needle </joey>
<joey> really because every time i get cut it's </joey>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> a pain like i can't imagine seeing blood </garnt>
<garnt> literally gush out of my veins and </garnt>
<garnt> thinking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's uh that looks like it's not </garnt>
<joey> gonna lie like during the summer for </joey>
<joey> instance like because like during the </joey>
<joey> summer your blood pressure is a lot </joey>
<joey> higher yeah </joey>
<joey> so when the blood comes out it kind of </joey>
<joey> just like gushes out and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> oh that looks sick </joey>
<joey> i like looking at that it's kind of cool </joey>
<connor> huh i missed one i remember </connor>
<joey> like whoa that's coming out of my body </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i remember as a kid they would just </joey>
<joey> give me this like contraption that was </joey>
<connor> just like filled with like paint oil and </connor>
<connor> it would just like all of it would like </connor>
<connor> you would flip it over and </connor>
<connor> start playing like crazy yeah you should </connor>
<connor> do that to distract to distract yourself </connor>
<joey> because i was like wow look at that </joey>
<joey> thing going to look at the vial i'm like </joey>
<connor> whoa that's cool </connor>
<connor> that's weird i can't do that really i </connor>
<connor> was just like i put my hand on the table </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> go ahead </connor>
<joey> why'd you have to like smack it i'm like </joey>
<connor> come on get ready boy belt in the mouth </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm like using mine we're using </joey>
<garnt> mine </garnt>
<garnt> it was weird for me because because </garnt>
<garnt> normally when i get my blood taken i'm </garnt>
<joey> used to it being like </joey>
<joey> uh like a private place if you know what </joey>
<joey> i mean </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm sorry so we had our blood taken </joey>
<connor> it's like a conveyor and i was just like </connor>
<connor> eyeing up the next guy </connor>
<connor> the guy next to me again three of us </connor>
<connor> right here </connor>
<connor> was getting our blood taken he was very </connor>
<garnt> odd neither of us could look at the </garnt>
<garnt> look at the blood getting taken and we </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] like met eyes and just like </garnt>
<joey> all right well it's it's kissed yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like meeting guys in a urinal </joey>
<garnt> but you know it's just like so this is </garnt>
<garnt> awkward how's your day going oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's a </garnt>
<garnt> that's you look like a no-type there </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] you like </connor>
<garnt> what are you trying to say right trying </garnt>
<connor> to strike up any conversation i guess it </connor>
<joey> is odd that we kind of </joey>
<joey> made it into a private thing in the west </joey>
<joey> right like does it really need to be </joey>
<connor> private getting your blood taken </connor>
<garnt> like if i mean it doesn't but i would i </garnt>
<connor> feel more i think i think it's that </connor>
<connor> people would prefer it right </connor>
<connor> like i prefer it but if if that means </connor>
<connor> that you know i get medical tests way </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] quicker in the uk yeah by all </connor>
<joey> means do my colonoscopy in front of the </joey>
<joey> other patients i i </joey>
<joey> do not mind like let's get this done </joey>
<joey> it's like oh you cracked the fat too </joey>
<joey> high if that means i can get it done 20 </joey>
<joey> faster and i can get on with my day yeah </joey>
<joey> i'll i'll i'll get it i'll get my blood </joey>
<connor> if i faint in front of a group of 20 </connor>
<joey> people who cares that's that's why in my </joey>
<connor> head i was like oh this is going to be </connor>
<joey> an all day thing </joey>
<connor> anywhere else is definitely an all day </connor>
<connor> thing right yeah yeah well i think the </connor>
<joey> worst part was that you couldn't eat </joey>
<joey> uh or drink anything the night before oh </joey>
<joey> really after like 8 p.m you have to stop </joey>
<joey> eating and drinking and yeah </joey>
<joey> normally that wouldn't be a problem but </joey>
<joey> when you tell me i can't eat and drink </joey>
<connor> i'm like well [ __ ] now i want to well no </connor>
<joey> i want to just wait you can't even drink </joey>
<connor> water are you drinking </connor>
<garnt> i was going to say that but water's the </garnt>
<connor> only thing you can drink alcohol </connor>
<connor> yeah basically no substance like in your </connor>
<garnt> bloodstream </garnt>
<garnt> um substance yeah what are you what are </garnt>
<connor> you taking </connor>
<joey> god god's like you gotta put the belt </joey>
<joey> and spoon away </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's god damn it they're going to </garnt>
<joey> see my heroine veins and everything man </joey>
<joey> please make sure to hit the heroin pain </joey>
<garnt> don't worry i got this i've done this </garnt>
<connor> before </connor>
<garnt> i'm kidding </garnt>
<joey> in case you don't get sarcasm none of us </joey>
<joey> have done heroin okay </joey>
<connor> yet unless that's that's the the dark </connor>
<connor> arc of the trash table </connor>
<garnt> trailer trash table stop joking oh my </garnt>
<garnt> god i heard you guys had an exciting </garnt>
<connor> taxi journey yeah so i i convinced joey </connor>
<connor> to get a taxi because joey wanted to get </connor>
<connor> the train home because it's about like </connor>
<connor> half the price </connor>
<joey> but you know it was like midnight it was </joey>
<joey> the day where connor and i were </joey>
<connor> streaming at the trash chase office if </connor>
<joey> you guys saw on our twitch </joey>
<connor> yeah but it was like 11 p.m when we </connor>
<connor> finished yeah and i was like [ __ ] get in </connor>
<connor> the train home come on j let's get a </connor>
<connor> taxi here let's be comfortable let's </connor>
<joey> you know it's late you know we destroyed </joey>
<joey> you i don't know why you like have this </joey>
<connor> massive thing about like </connor>
<connor> the comfort in taxi it's not that much </connor>
<connor> it's not comfortable it's just that much </connor>
<joey> so much more comfortable </joey>
<connor> you say it as if it's like business </connor>
<connor> class versus economy honestly that's the </connor>
<connor> way i see it like no </connor>
<connor> no because also right now with the rona </connor>
<connor> going on i don't if i can avoid getting </connor>
<connor> a train i'll avoid getting the train i i </connor>
<garnt> understand that </garnt>
<connor> but for me like i would most like nine </connor>
<connor> percent of the time i would rather get </connor>
<connor> like have have a longer journey that i </connor>
<connor> can actually do stuff on because i can't </connor>
<connor> do anything on a taxi i like </connor>
<connor> i can do more on attack i look at my </connor>
<connor> phone and i immediately just get caught </connor>
<connor> up through anything on a train in japan </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean you can watch </garnt>
<joey> youtube videos you can be on twitter no </joey>
<joey> no no no because i get carsick </joey>
<joey> because i don't know why i'm sorry that </joey>
<joey> your natural selection didn't favor you </joey>
<joey> jerry that's not my problem </joey>
<joey> well i'm not the only one getting asked </joey>
<garnt> to do that yeah i don't think this </garnt>
<garnt> cast yeah is what i how do you get i'm </garnt>
<connor> focusing on </connor>
<connor> the the youtube video whether it's </connor>
<joey> because it's because you can't see </joey>
<joey> outside so the inertia just [ __ ] you up </joey>
<garnt> yeah because that's how you get casting </garnt>
<joey> i'm not sure about the exact signs of </joey>
<joey> car sickness but i've </joey>
<joey> like cars are the only vehicle i get </joey>
<garnt> motion sickness in yeah anything else i </garnt>
<garnt> can like </garnt>
<garnt> read i can vote boats well that's not </garnt>
<joey> carsick is it it's yeah that's just a </joey>
<garnt> vehicle </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think i get seasick really yeah </garnt>
<connor> i get c6 i guess slightly seasonable </connor>
<connor> because normally people who are carsick </connor>
<joey> gets seasick yeah yeah i mean i don't </joey>
<connor> get carsick that </connor>
<connor> easily though unless you're watching </connor>
<joey> something unless but if i'm looking down </joey>
<garnt> on my phone or like i can't yeah no no </garnt>
<garnt> like like i i don't get car sick if i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just sitting there </garnt>
<connor> listening to me hell then </connor>
<joey> yeah that's why i i think that's why </joey>
<joey> i've conditioned myself to be able to </joey>
<joey> sleep so </joey>
<garnt> easily in cars yeah because i literally </garnt>
<garnt> can't do anything in cars but </garnt>
<joey> listen to music i can do the exact same </joey>
<joey> thing on a bus and not get sick </joey>
<connor> on a bus yeah i could be on a bus and </connor>
<connor> watch youtube </connor>
<connor> or whatever i will read i can look at </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> but i can't but i but if i do that in </joey>
<garnt> the car i think it's five minutes in </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's the smaller the vehicle the </garnt>
<connor> more likely i'm </connor>
<connor> to get sick i don't know what the </connor>
<connor> science is behind that yeah but if it's </connor>
<connor> like a like this if it's like a small </connor>
<joey> taxi </joey>
<joey> especially if it's a small taxi and </joey>
<joey> we're like squeezed in then </joey>
<joey> the back seat right and if you're in the </joey>
<garnt> backseat yeah i just get immediately i </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to go in the front of the </garnt>
<connor> taxi i don't want to i don't want to </connor>
<connor> make eye contact with the taxi driver </connor>
<connor> you don't have to </connor>
<joey> what do you think you're just going to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] do these things sometimes you </joey>
<connor> know you might find yourself wandering </connor>
<connor> and you look at him and it's an awkward </connor>
<garnt> moment of like </garnt>
<connor> hi i did no i never driving good driving </connor>
<garnt> what do you like i'm awkward i don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to make eye contact </garnt>
<connor> i have the same problem in the back seat </connor>
<connor> where i accidentally sometimes look at </connor>
<connor> like no </connor>
<connor> that's the way i say sometimes look at </connor>
<connor> the rear </connor>
<connor> the worst is when they're a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> awful driver as well you gotta pretend </connor>
<connor> like they're doing a good job </connor>
<joey> and they're just [ __ ] yeah and that's </joey>
<joey> why i prefer to be in the front because </joey>
<connor> i'm less likely to get sick in the front </connor>
<connor> from [ __ ] driving yeah </connor>
<connor> in the back because you're [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> thrown around in the back anyway the </garnt>
<garnt> story so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we were talking about the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> things yeah okay let's go back into taxi </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so anyway so connor was like </connor>
<connor> look it's </connor>
<joey> it's 20 minutes home on a comfy taxi </joey>
<joey> it's quicker by only like five times </joey>
<connor> closer to our house because we don't </connor>
<connor> have to go to the station </connor>
<joey> walk right not that much yeah so i was </joey>
<joey> like all right [ __ ] i'll humor your </joey>
<joey> taxi ride </joey>
<joey> so then we get in the taxi taxi's </joey>
<joey> driving fine </joey>
<joey> and then we go on to this like kind of </joey>
<joey> bridge thing </joey>
<joey> and uh and then just some random police </joey>
<joey> officer just </joey>
<joey> walks out onto the street and kind of </joey>
<joey> flags us down </joey>
<joey> right and tells us to go into one of the </joey>
<joey> roads and immediately the </joey>
<joey> taxi driver was like does the japanese </joey>
<connor> equivalent of oh [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> he's like this nine year old dude just </joey>
<garnt> being like oh </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] and he pulls in and connor and i </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is going on </connor>
<connor> and i asked the taxi driver i'm like </connor>
<connor> something wrong and he's like </connor>
<connor> i was speeding i was like </connor>
<connor> what you got stopped for speeding and </connor>
<connor> he's like yeah i was doing 80 down to </connor>
<connor> 60. </connor>
<joey> and this [ __ ] old dude just like </joey>
<joey> walks out of the taxi [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> you know aussie osborne stuff just like </joey>
<joey> kind of stumbles out </joey>
<connor> like four policemen surround this like </connor>
<joey> old poor old man yeah </joey>
<joey> and like in the middle of the night is </joey>
<joey> he's filling out this paper work and </joey>
<joey> connor and i just kind of sitting there </joey>
<connor> being like </connor>
<joey> oh we could have been home by now if we </joey>
<joey> weren't on the train huh the one time i </joey>
<connor> humaned this man to get on a taxi listen </connor>
<connor> the first time i've ever had a taxi </connor>
<connor> driver been pulled over by the police </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<joey> because i was like i was like i was just </joey>
<joey> hoping that they wouldn't be like all </joey>
<joey> right let's have a look what these these </joey>
<joey> boys in the back look pretty foreign </joey>
<joey> let's see what's going on with esports </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i was like far come on yeah no i i was </connor>
<joey> afraid that might happen as well so </joey>
<connor> immediately like before the police </connor>
<connor> officer even </connor>
<connor> started talking to us i just immediately </connor>
<connor> busted that japanese being like what's </connor>
<connor> going on </connor>
<connor> yes i am japanese they they the police </connor>
<connor> officers asked us they were like is it </connor>
<connor> okay if we stop you for now </connor>
<joey> like the driver yeah yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> i was like what what </joey>
<connor> what if we said no yeah i'm like what </connor>
<connor> are you supposed to say to that like </connor>
<joey> we're in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere </joey>
<joey> there's no taxis anywhere what do you </joey>
<connor> expect us to do like they pulled us over </connor>
<connor> over some bridge so there wasn't like </connor>
<connor> much there so it was just like some </connor>
<connor> water </connor>
<connor> right like a bunch of like a power plant </connor>
<connor> nearby so it was like nothing it was </connor>
<garnt> really odd </garnt>
<garnt> so four police officers like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> down this decrepit </connor>
<connor> there's two other police officers just </connor>
<connor> standing there doing nothing because </connor>
<garnt> that's what they do here </garnt>
<garnt> every police officer every police store </garnt>
<garnt> i've heard in japan is </garnt>
<garnt> is all about how many police officers </garnt>
<garnt> you need versus how many was actually </garnt>
<connor> needed </connor>
<connor> they literally sent like six police </connor>
<connor> officers to like you know someone </connor>
<connor> falling over on a bike yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> it's insane they're so bored here they </connor>
<connor> have nothing to do </connor>
<joey> yeah or they need you know spotters </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> i got you bro nice policing you're doing </joey>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> yeah because normally in the uk it's </connor>
<garnt> always like two people like it's always </garnt>
<garnt> a squad yeah exactly but one yeah one in </garnt>
<garnt> your partner right yeah that's normally </garnt>
<garnt> how it should be right and you don't </garnt>
<garnt> because also this i i don't know if this </garnt>
<garnt> is on purpose but it's very intimidating </garnt>
<connor> when four or five policemen are crowding </connor>
<connor> around you and you haven't done anything </connor>
<connor> and they're asking you questions they </connor>
<joey> all look pissed off and i'm like well </joey>
<joey> come on </joey>
<connor> what's going on here then yeah all right </connor>
<joey> i thought i saw this about i felt so bad </joey>
<connor> for the old dude because he </connor>
<joey> he looked like he was about to get </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and beaten up by his police </joey>
<joey> officers </joey>
<joey> because they literally was just crowding </joey>
<joey> around him just like looking down at the </joey>
<connor> paperwork </connor>
<connor> i've never been in this situation as </connor>
<connor> well this is the first time where i've </connor>
<joey> been </joey>
<joey> near police where they haven't asked for </joey>

<joey> this episode back to the show but in </joey>
<connor> general </connor>
<connor> uh i i do find taxis a little i don't </connor>
<connor> know awkward </connor>
<garnt> i don't know there's somebody again who </garnt>
<garnt> thinks about things a lot socially i </garnt>
<garnt> like to think of like the perfect social </garnt>
<joey> situations </joey>
<connor> what's what's awkward about them yeah </connor>
<connor> well i don't know okay well actually </connor>
<joey> talk so highly </joey>
<connor> of taxis right in japan in japan it's </connor>
<connor> good because i know they'll they'll </connor>
<garnt> actually know some of them do actually </garnt>
<garnt> try and talk to me yeah that's not </garnt>
<garnt> saying none of them would talk to me but </garnt>
<garnt> some of them some of them will </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel some of the older ones they </garnt>
<garnt> bust out of conversations yeah yeah some </garnt>
<connor> of some people who </connor>
<connor> also like maybe learned english in </connor>
<garnt> college especially i've noticed taxi </garnt>
<connor> drivers in the countryside </connor>
<connor> to me oh yeah they love they love </connor>
<connor> talking yeah yeah in the city it's just </connor>
<garnt> like all right </garnt>
<garnt> you're a customer i am a taxi driver i </garnt>
<connor> will not communicate in any way </connor>
<connor> it's charming um in in japan i think </connor>
<connor> when the taxi driver is trying to talk </connor>
<connor> to you because </connor>
<connor> especially in english when they try and </connor>
<connor> talk to you it's like oh damn you were </connor>
<connor> you're putting on the work but please </connor>
<connor> focus on driving but you know go ahead </connor>
<joey> the best the best taxi driver i ever had </joey>
<joey> was in um it was in okinawa </joey>
<garnt> and uh we were going from what </garnt>
<garnt> constitutes a good taxi driver yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's a good question </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah it was a good taxi driver do </connor>
<joey> you like it when your tax drivers talk </joey>
<garnt> to you </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i gotta be in the right mood </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah same here like sometimes i'm </garnt>
<connor> just so [ __ ] like you know if it's </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] 3am right yeah and i'm like </garnt>
<connor> either drunk or just tired or both yeah </connor>
<garnt> and i'm stepping in i don't want to have </garnt>
<joey> a [ __ ] conversation with the texture </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah some sometimes sometimes you </garnt>
<joey> get a taxi driver and they ask how your </joey>
<connor> day is going and i'm just like </connor>
<joey> i'm just saying can you not control by </joey>
<connor> the way here we go </connor>
<connor> here we go i mean it depends if i'm </connor>
<joey> alone or with friends have you ever </joey>
<joey> have you ever had a taxi driver who </joey>
<joey> bought into a conversation between you </joey>
<joey> and friends oh yeah </joey>
<connor> that i hate that yeah yeah i'm like hold </connor>
<joey> on hold on </joey>
<joey> this isn't a social invitation sir </joey>
<joey> the best taxi ride i had was in okinawa </joey>
<joey> because we were we were going to go </joey>
<joey> we were going from our hotel to this </joey>
<joey> like one uh castle </joey>
<joey> in naha and it was like a 30 minute taxi </joey>
<joey> ride </joey>
<joey> right um and the dude was like you know </joey>
<garnt> obviously an older </garnt>
<garnt> gentleman yeah but he clearly had been </garnt>
<garnt> there his entire life so </garnt>
<garnt> and he knew immediately he's like oh </garnt>
<garnt> foreigners you clearly </garnt>
<garnt> don't know a whole lot about this place </garnt>
<garnt> huh and he started talking and he took </garnt>
<garnt> us on this really </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] scenic route oh like throughout </connor>
<connor> all these like </connor>
<connor> places but he said he's like i took you </connor>
<connor> on the scenic route but i'll charge you </connor>
<connor> for the regular </connor>
<connor> oh so he was nice enough so he would </connor>
<connor> like actually like kind of stop the car </connor>
<connor> and kind of be like this is this and you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> that mental tour guide </connor>
<garnt> i actually had something very similar </garnt>
<garnt> happened to me when i went to koshi </garnt>
<connor> valley because we wanted to go to the </connor>
<connor> taxi drivers just part-time like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> tourists </garnt>
<garnt> i think they're just happy because they </garnt>
<joey> just have one they're happy to have </joey>
<joey> tourists there yeah </joey>
<joey> because i'm pretty sure business has not </joey>
<joey> been banging this year yeah um so yeah </joey>
<joey> we </joey>
<joey> me and sydney were on his taxi drive uh </joey>
<connor> on his taxi ride to get to this winery </connor>
<connor> and he's like let me give you a tour of </connor>
<connor> the other wineries in the area as well </connor>
<connor> just in case you want to go </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah who you want to go to and yeah </connor>
<connor> he only charged us for the taxi ride </connor>
<garnt> to the one winery but yeah we got a tour </garnt>
<connor> of like </connor>
<connor> everyone right now just show me these </connor>
<joey> taxi drivers i mean again like i feel </joey>
<joey> taxi drivers like that though really </joey>
<joey> only exist in the countryside </joey>
<connor> yeah dude in tokyo they're [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> miserable yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i would be too to be honest i also </joey>
<connor> there's uh </connor>
<connor> what's the oh it's in roppongi there's a </connor>
<joey> big cemetery </joey>
<joey> um i'll find it oh yeah yeah you know </joey>
<joey> what the name of giant i'll send you a </joey>
<joey> picture of mudan but </joey>
<connor> um there's this whole area right next to </connor>
<connor> this giant cemetery right there's a </connor>
<garnt> big stretch of road yeah taxi drivers </garnt>
<connor> just sleep there </connor>
<connor> really there's hundreds of taxis parked </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and they all park and they all just </connor>
<connor> sleep and like change clothes </connor>
<connor> in this area it's on a busy road in a </connor>
<joey> really busy area right </joey>
<joey> they all just sleep there that's so </joey>
<joey> bizarre yeah you can do that here you </joey>
<joey> can just park your car </joey>
<joey> on the on a busy road and you sleep yeah </joey>
<connor> like people do that </connor>
<connor> it's so weird yeah you can't do that in </connor>
<joey> the uk </joey>
<joey> no i feel most countries you can't do </joey>
<connor> that no even in the countryside that'd </connor>
<connor> be weird someone would like come and </connor>
<connor> stop you be like yo you're okay </connor>
<joey> have you by the way seen i couldn't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] believe this but have you seen </joey>
<garnt> uh those like rare taxis that you can </garnt>
<garnt> get in tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> rare taxis i can't believe japan has </garnt>
<joey> actually done this but </joey>
<joey> they've literally turned taxis into </joey>
<garnt> gacha </garnt>
<joey> like of course they have of course i </joey>
<connor> forgot the exact name of it but i think </connor>
<connor> it's called </connor>
<connor> like sakura taxis right so you know how </connor>
<connor> like in most taxis in tokyo and this is </connor>
<connor> only a tokyo thing </connor>
<connor> uh but like you know how on taxis like </connor>
<connor> they usually have like the signs on top </connor>
<connor> of the car yeah like show </connor>
<connor> you know whether the taxis open or </connor>
<garnt> whatnot yeah apparently out of i think </garnt>
<connor> like the </connor>
<connor> 7 400 taxi cars in the greater tokyo </connor>
<connor> area </connor>
<garnt> there are five taxis that have </garnt>
<garnt> like a sakura thing on top of it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and supposedly that's like the ssr of </garnt>
<connor> taxis </connor>
<connor> and it's like and and what did you get </connor>
<connor> no because one of my because one of my </connor>
<connor> friends actually got it the other day </connor>
<connor> yeah um and when you enter into the taxi </connor>
<connor> it's a lot lot </connor>
<connor> nicer and like actually like first class </connor>
<connor> of taxis and inside there's like a </connor>
<connor> little sheet of paper that says </connor>
<joey> congratulations you found one of five </joey>
<connor> ultra rare taxis [ __ ] i hate that i </connor>
<connor> think that's so [ __ ] cool yeah i </connor>
<joey> think that's so [ __ ] cool and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like i really want to kind of </joey>
<joey> go around now trying to find this </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] mythical taxi this ssr taxi </connor>
<garnt> dude my [ __ ] my my [ __ ] gotcha </garnt>
<connor> pool it's the gacha pool of taxis now </connor>
<connor> oh my god already he's like oh my god </connor>

<connor> yeah you're just like </connor>
<joey> come on give me the give me the ssr give </joey>

<garnt> right congratulations let's get more </garnt>
<garnt> taxes </garnt>
<connor> just calling them taxi after this house </connor>
<connor> and they're all just parked up </connor>
<garnt> are you the reason i see it no don't </garnt>
<garnt> worry i don't need a taxi it's like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] his blue bag blew back he's like </garnt>
<joey> come on give me the gold bag give the </joey>
<connor> gold bag </connor>
<joey> well i just think that's so [ __ ] cool </joey>
<connor> that like that's just like one extra i </connor>
<connor> guess like piece of enjoyment you can </connor>
<connor> have as a taurus right like </connor>
<connor> knowing that now when you come to japan </connor>
<connor> and you go on a taxi </connor>
<joey> like you can you can look forward to </joey>
<joey> that being like finna pull the ssrs on </joey>
<garnt> taxis </garnt>
<garnt> it's the one reason that's the tourists </garnt>
<garnt> used to use a taxi because god damn </garnt>
<joey> they're expensive injury </joey>
<joey> oh in tokyo they're [ __ ] expensive </joey>
<joey> they get pissed off if you take a short </joey>
<joey> journey yeah yeah yeah i've taken </joey>
<joey> sometimes i've had like too much [ __ ] to </joey>
<joey> carry so i've had to get like it's like </joey>
<joey> a short walk from the station to my </joey>
<joey> house but </joey>
<connor> i remember like a few times and i've </connor>
<connor> gotten the taxi because i had like too </connor>
<connor> much stuff to carry </connor>
<garnt> they were like oh there okay oh here </garnt>
<connor> and then i said yeah yeah and then i say </connor>
<connor> like thank you when i leave and they </connor>
<garnt> don't say it back and i'm like </garnt>
<connor> wow okay in japan that's like the </connor>
<joey> biggest [ __ ] you yeah </joey>
<joey> didn't say thank you back the audacity </joey>
<joey> that's like the equivalent of flipping </joey>
<joey> the boat </joey>
<connor> literally yeah i didn't realize that </connor>
<connor> until someone pointed out that it </connor>
<connor> happened another time as well they were </connor>
<connor> like wow that was really rude i'm like </connor>
<connor> well is he yeah </connor>
<garnt> i thought he was just driving well he </garnt>
<garnt> didn't say thank you back whatever what </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] what a [ __ ] [ __ ] the first </connor>
<garnt> time it happened was a similar situation </garnt>
<garnt> where it was like a very short journey </garnt>
<connor> it was like </connor>
<connor> an eight dollar journey yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and then i got out and </connor>
<connor> the other person with me was like wow </connor>
<connor> that was so rude and i'm like what was </connor>
<joey> rude </joey>
<joey> he just drove us he didn't say anything </joey>
<joey> he's like yeah i said thank you you </joey>
<joey> didn't say it back i'm like yeah oh okay </joey>
<connor> okay the audacity of this [ __ ] i'm </connor>
<connor> afraid to get back in that car and give </connor>
<joey> him a slap you know </joey>
<joey> like no but like that's the thing it's </joey>
<connor> like it's just tokyo taxis that are just </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] expensive because like </connor>
<connor> if you think about it catching a taxi in </connor>
<connor> tokyo is a luxury </connor>
<connor> because trains are just so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> convenient tokyo whereas the moment </connor>
<joey> you're out of the greater tokyo area </joey>
<joey> a lot of places without a taxi yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> it depends i think it depends where </connor>
<connor> you're going because there's some </connor>
<connor> if you're on the outskirts of tokyo </connor>
<connor> right sometimes going if you're going in </connor>
<connor> like an art like a </connor>
<connor> quarter circle let's say they don't </connor>
<connor> really have trains that go like like </connor>
<connor> london right it's the exact same where </connor>
<connor> trains go in and out </connor>
<connor> and they don't go around normally right </connor>
<connor> right so if you want to go the outskirts </connor>
<joey> not some most the time to get like just </joey>
<joey> you know a 15-minute taxi drive away </joey>
<joey> it might require you to go in all the </joey>
<joey> way to central and then go out yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> that's like 50 minutes and yeah </joey>
<connor> well you know how much is 45 minutes of </connor>
<connor> my time worth of 30 minutes </connor>
<joey> right but i think like the majority of </joey>
<connor> people central tokyo </connor>
<connor> care about that right yeah yeah if </connor>
<connor> you're like you know going to </connor>
<connor> whereas in okinawa there's literally one </connor>
<connor> tram line that goes for </connor>
<connor> five stops and that's the only train </connor>
<connor> line that they have on the entire island </connor>
<connor> so that's why the taxis are like half </connor>
<connor> the price that you get in tokyo </connor>
<connor> yeah if the people rely on it the local </connor>
<joey> government will yeah </joey>
<joey> like the 30 minute tax free ride in </joey>
<joey> auckland i was talking about was like </joey>
<joey> 2000 yen oh [ __ ] seriously yeah it's </joey>
<joey> really really in tokyo that would be </joey>
<garnt> about </garnt>
<connor> like 60 70 bucks i'm convinced </connor>
<connor> that's right that in tokyo they don't </connor>
<connor> they don't make people retire they make </connor>
<garnt> them become taxi drivers </garnt>
<garnt> most taxi drivers when i see a young </garnt>
<joey> taxi driver i'm like wow you've made a </joey>
<joey> career choice </joey>
<joey> you made some examples of career choice </joey>
<connor> here what's going on because i speak to </connor>
<connor> people and </connor>
<connor> they like i swear to god they look they </connor>
<connor> look at taxi drivers like mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> workers here </connor>
<connor> yeah like it's like it's it's uh because </connor>
<joey> yeah because it's like you don't need </joey>
<joey> any qualifications except thrive which </joey>
<connor> you know they expect you to do yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just like a throwaway job that they make </connor>
<joey> or gsans do </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah basically it's like i've i </joey>
<joey> think the average age of a taxi driver </joey>
<connor> here is like seven years it's like you </connor>
<connor> can retire or you be </connor>
<joey> in japan yeah you need to see yourself </joey>
<connor> retire or become a taxi driver it's like </connor>
<connor> it's either taxi driver or like a </connor>
<connor> construction worker but not actually </connor>
<joey> construction just like holding the signs </joey>
<connor> and being like this way please </connor>
<connor> it's nuts how fast they build houses </connor>
<connor> here it's like crazy </connor>
<garnt> yeah we had a we had like a whole school </garnt>
<garnt> bee built right next to the apartment </garnt>
<garnt> i'm living in </garnt>
<garnt> in the span of the year i was living </garnt>
<connor> here which is [ __ ] insane </connor>
<connor> they built a full like three-story house </connor>
<connor> next to me in like two months </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i was like what the [ __ ] what </connor>
<joey> the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> no it is crazy like especially like say </joey>
<connor> when you go into like the city or </connor>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<garnt> and you haven't been for maybe like a </garnt>
<garnt> couple of months it's surprising the </garnt>
<garnt> amount of things that have changed </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like oh this building was </garnt>
<garnt> completely different two months ago </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that was just magically here going </garnt>
<garnt> back to taxi drivers though </garnt>
<garnt> have you ever had any weird or like bad </garnt>
<garnt> taxi </garnt>
<connor> experiences worldwide oh yeah definitely </connor>

<connor> i've had very pleasant experiences with </connor>
<connor> uber in l.a yeah but </connor>
<connor> there's this one there's sometimes i get </connor>
<garnt> a really odd experience and it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> okay so the oddest experience i've ever </garnt>
<garnt> had with uber in l.a it was uh during ax </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> and we were all we were it was me and uh </garnt>
<garnt> two other friends and all we were doing </garnt>
<garnt> was we wanted to take a taxi </garnt>
<garnt> to the convention hall and this was late </garnt>
<garnt> at night by the way so it was uh it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like the daytime it was like </garnt>
<connor> let's say 7 8 p.m so it's kind of night </connor>
<connor> time the time </connor>
<connor> the sun was down so we get we we call </connor>
<connor> this uber </connor>
<connor> and this like this car just rocks up and </connor>
<connor> it's like a [ __ ] decrepit </connor>
<connor> broken car like i was just like how how </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> has like how the [ __ ] has this passed </connor>
<connor> like uber standards i'm pretty sure </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure they're </connor>
<connor> like a dead body had been them there </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean so we so we're like </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> this this is this is the uber oh okay so </connor>
<connor> we we were like whatever it's like a </connor>
<connor> 5-10 minute journey anyway it doesn't </connor>
<connor> really matter that much so we're getting </connor>
<connor> this taxi driver and immediately he </connor>
<connor> opens his mouth and </connor>
<connor> you can kind of feel that he's he's not </connor>
<connor> all there in the head yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> he has a yeah he has a screw loose right </connor>
<connor> right why what was he saying </connor>
<connor> so i mean so at the beginning he was </connor>
<connor> talking about guys i gotta i gotta ask </connor>
<connor> you a favor can you can you please give </connor>
<connor> me five stars for my journey </connor>
<connor> all i'm asking for is one </connor>
<joey> way to ask for a positive review but </joey>
<connor> sure sure well that is not how you get </connor>
<joey> fired </joey>
<joey> so sure we'll give you a five star so he </joey>
<joey> starts starts driving to this convention </joey>
<joey> hall right yeah </joey>
<joey> and he puts it in the gps go to the </joey>
<joey> la convention center and then it says to </joey>
<joey> go </joey>
<joey> it says to go on a turning right yeah </joey>
<joey> and then it says please turn right </joey>
<joey> doesn't listen he goes forward right </joey>
<joey> right and then </joey>
<joey> he goes and then so it's fine the gps </joey>
<joey> corrects itself and goes </joey>
<joey> please turn right at the next turning </joey>
<joey> ignores that one keeps going forward </joey>
<joey> and in in between him ignoring this gps </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> getting further and further away from </joey>
<joey> the convention center because i was like </joey>
<joey> on google maps because i was like what </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is this taxi driver doing </joey>
<joey> and he he goes and he he keeps talking </joey>
<garnt> about this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] five-star and one-star rant </garnt>
<garnt> right right he goes </garnt>
<garnt> if i get another bad review i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> lose it man </garnt>
<connor> i'm gonna lose it you're like hovering </connor>
<connor> the one star </connor>
<garnt> he keeps saying that i'm just i'm just </garnt>
<connor> like making eyes because i'm sitting in </connor>
<connor> the front </connor>
<connor> and my teammate's sitting in the back </connor>
<connor> and i'm just trying to make eyes to be </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> oh you're in the passenger yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> i'm just like yo if he </connor>
<connor> if he pulls the gun like you you got my </connor>
<connor> back right like if something happens you </connor>
<connor> got my back </connor>
<connor> and so the third time the gps tells to </connor>
<connor> turn right </connor>
<connor> and he misses it again and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] man something's gone wrong we need </connor>
<connor> to get out of this taxi right now </connor>
<connor> i'd rather get another uber than get </connor>
<connor> further and further away from safety </connor>
<connor> which is the convention center </connor>
<connor> and stay one second longer than this </connor>
<connor> taxi so we're like don't worry man um </connor>
<connor> we're close enough to the convention </connor>
<connor> center we can just we can just stop here </connor>

<connor> you sure </connor>
<connor> you sure and so we're just like yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah please please stop </connor>

<garnt> star drives off </garnt>
<garnt> instant one i was gonna say i hope you </garnt>
<joey> can vote </joey>
<joey> yeah i hope it was a one star because </joey>
<connor> people like that i don't care how nice </connor>
<connor> you are you shouldn't [ __ ] be an uber </connor>
<connor> driver if you're pulling [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> that's that's </joey>
<joey> the equivalent of like getting a pizza </joey>
<garnt> delivered and the guy being like twenty </garnt>
<garnt> dollar tip right you gotta give me at </garnt>
<joey> least a twenty dollars </joey>
<garnt> ten dollars no no twenty but i i could </garnt>
<garnt> very much see during that experience why </garnt>
<garnt> people gave him one stars because </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i kind of feared for my safety </garnt>
<garnt> at one point during that taxi ride i </garnt>
<joey> mean it's like it's not even a matter of </joey>
<garnt> him just like ranting about like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna kill a [ __ ] if i get another one </garnt>
<joey> because yeah yeah it's the fact that he </joey>
<garnt> wasn't even going the right way </garnt>
<garnt> he wasn't going the right way and like i </garnt>
<garnt> was like okay </garnt>
<garnt> at the beginning when he asked for the </garnt>
<garnt> five stars like whatever it's the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] review i didn't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> but when he was like i'm gonna lose a </garnt>
<garnt> man </garnt>
<garnt> i was just like oh [ __ ] man this is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] terrifying </joey>
<connor> especially la you don't know what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] gonna happen yeah exactly oh </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<joey> pretty scary yeah i've never had </joey>
<joey> anything like that i i yeah i </joey>
<connor> sadly haven't had any crazy taxi </connor>
<connor> journeys really most of them are pretty </connor>
<connor> chill </connor>
<connor> i don't know i feel like it's really </connor>
<connor> hard to have a bad taxi journey although </connor>
<connor> someone gave you a one star once as a </connor>
<connor> customer on uber and i was confused </connor>
<connor> because really i don't think i've ever </connor>
<connor> done anything in a car but </connor>
<connor> maybe i did something that like ruined </connor>
<connor> this man's day and he gave me a one stop </connor>
<connor> oh wow </connor>
<joey> yeah i know i was i i had i had one like </joey>
<joey> really memorable </joey>
<connor> uh uber ride in la uh and it was again </connor>
<connor> from where we were staying to the </connor>
<garnt> convention center it was like </garnt>
<garnt> again another like 5-10 minute ride yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and uh and this cup </garnt>
<connor> this massive jeep rocks off right </connor>
<connor> there's only two of us i'm like okay </connor>
<connor> that's a bit overkill but whatever </connor>
<connor> jump in and it's just this like the </connor>
<connor> biggest black dude i've ever seen like </connor>
<connor> this guy like not not like fat like </connor>
<connor> built like he's got a [ __ ] </connor>

<garnt> like yup and it's like la convention </garnt>
<garnt> center all right i got you </garnt>
<garnt> like you know like super chill right </garnt>

<garnt> mad you scam you yeah and you got to be </garnt>

<connor> like right opposite where the hangar is </connor>
<connor> right and there's just this van </connor>

<garnt> all right thank god i mean i'm pretty </garnt>
<garnt> sure for like any country you want to go </garnt>
<garnt> to the official taxi stands yeah </garnt>
<connor> well some countries have way stricter </connor>
<connor> rules on taxis than others and like </connor>
<connor> even if you get one somewhere random </connor>
<connor> you're pretty yes a lot of countries </connor>
<connor> you'll still get like i mean japan you </connor>
<connor> get you get it anyway you're going to </connor>

<connor> the standard fare right right same in </connor>
<connor> like uh germany and </connor>
<connor> uk as well i'm pretty sure it was </connor>
<connor> awesome but yeah yeah it's uh </connor>
<joey> yeah we learned that less than that </joey>
<garnt> we're about to get i don't know where </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] is </connor>
<garnt> someone's vans literally what they warn </garnt>
<connor> against as you're a [ __ ] kid yeah </connor>
<connor> don't get in any van ever </connor>
<joey> yeah it was it was fast as [ __ ] but i </joey>
<joey> think like the craziest in terms of </joey>
<joey> driving </joey>
<joey> taxi drivers i've had uh probably </joey>
<joey> in china i remember there was this one </joey>
<joey> taxi driver had in china where </joey>
<joey> it was literally like i was in a crazy </joey>
<joey> taxi game you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> like like this this guy this guy was </joey>
<connor> full on [ __ ] he </connor>
<connor> he might as well have just been like </connor>
<connor> drifting initially right </connor>
<connor> and it was like he was in the middle of </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] shanghai </connor>
<connor> and whenever there would be like </connor>
<connor> pedestrians on the road he wouldn't slow </connor>
<connor> down </connor>
<connor> he would he was like he was like tapping </connor>
<connor> his horn like it was a [ __ ] quick </connor>
<connor> time event </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean that's how like </connor>
<connor> like he's dodged yeah </connor>
<connor> like he literally had one hand on the </connor>
<connor> steering wheel and one and the other </connor>
<garnt> hand on the horn </garnt>
<garnt> because that's how often he was tapping </garnt>
<garnt> it man oh my god i had never like feared </garnt>
<connor> for my life </connor>
<connor> you go to chinese driving school they're </connor>
<connor> like right so roll the window down </connor>
<connor> pretty so you get rid of the shower </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> make sure your hand is always on the </connor>
<connor> middle steering is optional </connor>

<garnt> yeah we were all fully prepared to like </garnt>
<garnt> pay the extra because it was taking us </garnt>
<garnt> around the scenic ride and he's like no </garnt>
<connor> no no it's okay standard price i'm just </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> bro come on i want you to go home </joey>
<joey> tonight treat yourself </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly get something nice exactly </joey>
<joey> like speaking of like giving like </joey>
<joey> five stars and one stars and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> that have you ever talked about what </garnt>
<garnt> like the reviewing mentality is here in </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<connor> it just tells us everything it's i </connor>
<connor> noticed that right away when i moved </connor>
<connor> here </connor>
<garnt> yeah how like nothing on amazon is above </garnt>
<garnt> four stars yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's not just not on amazon like </garnt>
<joey> everything on like google google maps </joey>
<joey> yeah and stuffing if </joey>
<garnt> like hardly anything is above four stars </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's it's like mostly is then it's only </joey>
<joey> like two reviews right yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> and also like they have a so they do use </connor>
<connor> google reviews </connor>
<joey> uh mainly for like restaurants and stuff </joey>
<joey> but there's also a thing called table </joey>
<joey> log </joey>
<joey> that they like a lot of people who think </joey>
<joey> their food critics </joey>
<joey> use and it's just it's it's like the </joey>
<joey> yelp of japan basically </joey>
<joey> it's it's insane because it's like these </joey>
<connor> people review </connor>
<connor> these food restaurants and like three </connor>
<connor> stars for a restaurant is considered </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<connor> yeah that's like it's done it it's it's </connor>
<garnt> impressive because i remember when i </garnt>
<garnt> first moved to japan and whenever you </garnt>
<connor> look up restaurants on google </connor>
<connor> you'd see like three 3.5 stars maybe the </connor>
<connor> occasional four yeah </connor>
<connor> and in england or in america when i see </connor>
<garnt> a three-star restaurant i'm like </garnt>
<connor> yo something's gone wrong if it's below </connor>
<joey> a four then i'm just like something's up </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> someone found a rat in their food or </connor>
<joey> something man like i don't know i don't </joey>
<joey> understand yeah i don't understand what </joey>
<joey> that it's like do the japanese think </joey>
<joey> that the stars on google reviews like </joey>
<joey> michelin stars like </joey>
<garnt> because i mean i understand it because </garnt>
<garnt> they actually i i respect that they have </garnt>
<garnt> a mentality where they literally </garnt>
<garnt> actually use </garnt>
<joey> every star in the review system right </joey>
<joey> because it's like the male review </joey>
<joey> right where anything below like i'm </joey>
<joey> pretty sure like now below seven is [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty sure like mao users don't </joey>
<joey> realize that like under five stars </joey>
<joey> actually exist </joey>
<joey> yeah um because it's either like seven </joey>
<garnt> if it's good </garnt>
<garnt> um six is really bad six is really bad </garnt>
<garnt> and like </garnt>
<garnt> five is the most awful animation ever </garnt>
<connor> like a restaurant </connor>
<connor> i the way i imagine it is like what </connor>
<joey> would i tell the owner if he was right </joey>
<joey> in front of me now </joey>
<joey> right would i genuinely sit there and be </joey>
<connor> like this is a three-star experience </connor>
<connor> because you know what i mean like </connor>
<connor> because yeah how are you going to do </connor>
<connor> that to the poor guys you should have </connor>
<connor> run a business right yeah because to me </connor>
<connor> you know if i go somewhere i really like </connor>
<connor> the food i have nothing bad about it </connor>
<connor> how in good faith can i be like yeah you </connor>
<connor> don't deserve five stars </connor>
<connor> yeah because there was nothing wrong </connor>
<connor> with it like this was exactly what i </connor>
<connor> wanted </connor>
<connor> i got what i needed yeah it wasn't fine </connor>
<connor> dining it wasn't crazy but like there </connor>
<joey> was nothing </joey>
<joey> oh sorry i was going to say like that's </joey>
<joey> the thing i want to ask about these like </joey>
<connor> super harsh japanese reviews right it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> what is a five star yeah yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> do you want to blow job from the share </joey>
<joey> cause this is like this is also another </joey>
<connor> thing where like </connor>
<connor> you how can you judge really a </connor>
<connor> restaurant the same way </connor>
<garnt> mcdonald's yeah because like because </garnt>
<garnt> what was what i was going to say is even </garnt>
<joey> like the fine dining restaurants are the </joey>
<joey> same </joey>
<joey> story yeah yeah that's because they </joey>
<joey> expect a fine dining experience </joey>
<connor> so if they get the fine dining </connor>
<connor> experience that's </connor>
<connor> that's that's standard that's standard </connor>
<connor> you've done the job and so that makes me </connor>
<garnt> wonder </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] would a fine dining </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant have to do to get a four or </garnt>
<connor> five star man </connor>
<connor> it's it blows my mind because like like </connor>
<connor> i said like comparing mcdonald's like a </connor>
<connor> fine dining experience </connor>
<connor> because they really shouldn't be on the </connor>
<connor> same scale right because </connor>
<joey> they're totally different things yeah </joey>
<joey> like so when you go to mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> what are you judging about mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> are you judging the place the food what </joey>
<joey> are you judging because the food isn't </joey>
<connor> going to change really </connor>
<joey> yeah it's probably not going to be any </joey>
<joey> different the only thing that determines </joey>
<joey> a good mcdonald's experience </joey>
<connor> or a bad one is like how fast the food </connor>
<connor> costs yeah this is what i see on google </connor>
<connor> reviews i'll see a two star mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> and i'll see a four star and i'm like </connor>
<connor> what is the difference </connor>
<connor> not like ultimately i cannot tell the </connor>
<joey> difference yes it might be dirtier i had </joey>
<joey> three less fries than i ordered </joey>
<connor> that's what confuses me because then i'm </connor>
<connor> then i'm also like okay </connor>
<connor> so if i rate this mcdonald's a five star </connor>
<connor> uh what am i rating it a five star on am </connor>
<connor> i rating it on a five star because </connor>
<garnt> compared to other mcdonald's compared to </garnt>
<garnt> a bigger question </garnt>
<garnt> is who the [ __ ] is raiding mcdonald's on </garnt>
<garnt> google </garnt>
<garnt> who are you who are you people who are </garnt>
<connor> that bored </connor>
<connor> i it must be the okay not to be rude but </connor>
<connor> you know people who are like yes it's my </connor>
<connor> only fine dining experience </connor>
<connor> i will review every mcdonald's i go to </connor>
<joey> people who call mcdonald's a restaurant </joey>
<joey> the same people call </joey>
<joey> motels hotels you know i've noticed that </joey>
<connor> every single </connor>
<connor> like really really high rated place in </connor>
<connor> japan </connor>
<connor> like four or five four point five or </connor>
<connor> higher yeah is normally like a </connor>
<connor> disgusting wait time to get the food </connor>
<connor> yeah yes because </connor>
<connor> when you get to that star in japan i </connor>
<garnt> feel like you get like almost like a </garnt>
<garnt> fandom like a hype around you yeah a </garnt>
<garnt> cult following </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so then and then everyone starts </garnt>
<garnt> telling everyone it's like yo yo this is </garnt>
<garnt> four point five yeah you gotta go there </garnt>
<garnt> early you gotta line up and it's like </garnt>
<connor> well [ __ ] now i can't enjoy the place i </connor>
<connor> gotta make a </connor>
<garnt> three day events resume no i noticed </garnt>
<garnt> that as well where there's </garnt>
<garnt> japan's restaurant culture especially if </garnt>
<garnt> something is like highly acclaimed it </garnt>
<garnt> all spreads via word of mouth </garnt>
<connor> where the japanese love lining up yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't get that </connor>
<connor> i mean as a british i mean i can </connor>
<connor> appreciate a good queue </connor>
<garnt> uh but there's as a british person i can </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate a good queue as well but not </garnt>
<joey> to a restaurant no you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> i can't [ __ ] stand cues dude yeah if </joey>
<garnt> i want to if i want to go to a good </garnt>
<connor> restaurant </connor>
<connor> that's exclusive please let me book it </connor>

<connor> i don't want another gotcha system i </connor>
<connor> don't want to line up </connor>
<connor> i want just to have a booking and a </connor>
<garnt> specific time i turn up </garnt>
<garnt> um or you could be like us and try to </garnt>
<garnt> book a </garnt>
<garnt> table at denny's completely </garnt>
<joey> fail because we because we always eat </joey>
<joey> denny's before uh we record a podcast </joey>
<joey> and we had like uh one of the guests </joey>
<joey> over </joey>
<joey> and we're like oh [ __ ] that's a lot of </joey>
<joey> people we might have to book a table at </joey>
<garnt> denny's so yeah we were like </garnt>
<garnt> which to give context it's like trying </garnt>
<joey> to book a table at mcdonald's yeah </joey>
<joey> so maylene called up denny's and was </joey>
<connor> like uh can we book a table for </connor>
<connor> six and the guy came back and was like </connor>
<connor> what is this is a denny's why are you </connor>
<joey> trying to book a [ __ ] table just just </joey>
<connor> come to the restaurant please man this </connor>
<connor> is denny's </connor>
<connor> wasn't it wasn't it like he called it he </connor>
<garnt> called like the manager or something </garnt>
<connor> like wait </connor>
<garnt> is yeah we don't have to </garnt>
<connor> do reservations yeah making danny's it's </connor>
<connor> so exclusive you have to turn up on the </connor>
<garnt> day </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's the most polite way you </garnt>
<garnt> can just say it's a [ __ ] denny's why </garnt>
<garnt> are you calling me </garnt>
<connor> what the [ __ ] wrong with you so even </connor>
<connor> like going back to like normal reviews </connor>
<connor> with products like </connor>
<connor> all the products are like that as well </connor>
<joey> and like yeah if you see something with </joey>
<joey> 45 stars on amazon with over like 20 </joey>
<joey> reviews you're like damn this must be </joey>
<joey> like the [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> because like oh they're paying for those </joey>
<joey> reviews yeah yeah true because i </joey>
<joey> remember when i was buying a like </joey>
<joey> going back last week buying a bed i </joey>
<joey> could not find a bed </joey>
<joey> over like three stars on amazon i </joey>
<joey> couldn't either i remember that </joey>
<joey> like there was no bed that was about </joey>
<joey> three stars and i'm like who how many </joey>
<joey> problems people having with beds and i </joey>
<joey> would go to the uh </joey>
<joey> the reviews to read what they were </joey>
<joey> saying and they were all saying that the </joey>
<joey> build was too long </joey>
<connor> and that was the problem that sounds </connor>
<garnt> like your problem i've had i've had some </garnt>
<connor> of the most pedantic reviews on japanese </connor>
<connor> amazon i've had like someone one-star </connor>
<garnt> product because the packaging was bad </garnt>
<joey> yeah completely fine the packaging was a </joey>
<garnt> bit off so </garnt>
<connor> they were like once that's what drives </connor>
<connor> me insane is that they they almost </connor>
<connor> always review the [ __ ] around what </connor>
<joey> you're actually reviewing yeah like all </joey>
<joey> the delivery man had a bad attitude </joey>
<connor> it's [ __ ] like i if the package is a </connor>
<connor> little beat up but the thing's totally </connor>
<joey> fine yeah fantastic are you gonna throw </joey>
<connor> out the packaging anyway yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> i don't give a [ __ ] like as long as i </connor>
<connor> can use the thing i need so what like </connor>
<connor> this shouldn't be a blight on the </connor>
<connor> company that send me it like this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] absurd i guess i remember </connor>
<connor> i actually brought it up to chris as </connor>
<connor> well because i was confused and chris </connor>
<connor> was telling me that ryotaro told him </connor>
<connor> it's something like </connor>
<connor> three is like what you expect </connor>
<connor> is good and then five is like like above </connor>
<connor> and beyond </connor>
<connor> yeah so he has to go to get five stars </connor>
<joey> it has to be beyond exception like </joey>
<connor> beyonce </connor>
<joey> whereas i think for me five stars should </joey>
<connor> be like all right this is what i paid </connor>
<connor> for yeah gave me exactly what i asked </connor>
<connor> for no problems </connor>
<connor> lifestyles i don't know weird weird i </connor>
<garnt> guess it's difficult </garnt>
<garnt> how do you guys feel about seasonal </garnt>
<garnt> products here in japan </garnt>
<joey> because you know every country in the </joey>
<joey> world has like </joey>
<joey> seasonal products and stuff but i feel </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<garnt> but yeah japan take it to the next level </garnt>
<garnt> whereas half the shelf sometimes i feel </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> like seasonal products yeah every </garnt>
<joey> everything is seasonal everything is </joey>
<connor> premium as well i mean i i get it now i </connor>
<connor> meant i </connor>
<connor> remember they would talk about it in the </connor>
<joey> animes they were like the enemies </joey>
<connor> they're like you don't know the pain </connor>
<connor> until your favorite item has been </connor>
<garnt> removed from the combini yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel that because i saw that as </garnt>
<garnt> well so many items that i just liked </garnt>
<connor> for some reason the the what the items </connor>
<connor> that i specifically like would just </connor>
<joey> randomly get removed yeah from the </joey>
<joey> completely yeah yeah i'd be like i'll be </joey>
<joey> like oh </joey>
<joey> it'll be back next week not gonna lie </joey>
<garnt> every time i walk into a corn beanie and </garnt>
<joey> i see something is like </joey>
<garnt> new yeah i'm just like oh </garnt>
<joey> i might grab one of those yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know because like i </joey>
<connor> i don't want to try it i don't want to </connor>
<garnt> get attached yeah that's exactly that's </garnt>
<connor> exactly how i'm </connor>
<connor> feeling i've been like so many times </connor>
<connor> living in japan i go to a company </connor>
<connor> i try out this new like oh this like new </connor>
<connor> product that's only available for spring </connor>
<connor> because it's like the spring special </connor>
<connor> winter special products try it </connor>
<connor> absolutely love it and then </connor>
<connor> a few months later it just got </connor>
<connor> disappointing i'm like [ __ ] man i want </connor>
<connor> it now </connor>
<connor> you've given me a craving and you've </connor>
<garnt> removed the craving and now i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> have to wait </garnt>
<garnt> all year for it to maybe come back yeah </garnt>
<garnt> for it to maybe come back because it </garnt>
<joey> might not even come back i hate that </joey>
<joey> when they like bring out like a new </joey>
<joey> strong zero flavor </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm just like man this is way </joey>
<joey> better than the standard flavors too bad </joey>
<joey> it's only around for </joey>
<joey> two weeks and i'll never see it again </joey>
<garnt> once it's gone because it's not just </garnt>
<garnt> like items sometimes there's like menu </garnt>
<joey> items on </joey>
<garnt> on in like restaurants yeah only </garnt>
<joey> available during certain seasons </joey>
<joey> i mean i feel the biggest problem with </joey>
<joey> that is that the one thing in japanese </joey>
<joey> like especially supermarkets and </joey>
<joey> restaurants they </joey>
<connor> love to do that whole like seasonal </connor>
<connor> premium [ __ ] is with fruits </connor>
<connor> oh god right we've gone out we've ranted </connor>
<connor> about for sure </connor>
<connor> but like i remember like i went to uh i </connor>
<connor> don't remember </connor>
<connor> no i was a royal host i went to a royal </connor>
<connor> host and they were doing this like </connor>
<connor> seasonal thing with </connor>
<connor> grapes right like the green grapes oh </connor>
<connor> yeah like the muskets </connor>
<connor> yeah and i tried a few of them because i </connor>
<connor> like green grapes and i was like oh this </connor>
<connor> is really nice </connor>
<garnt> went back the next week and it was gone </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like [ __ ] hell this is really </garnt>
<garnt> premium isn't it it's like </garnt>
<joey> i swear it was only on the menu for like </joey>
<garnt> three days and it's just gone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i swear they they take like limited </garnt>
<garnt> time sales to like another level here </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like a lot of things are just </garnt>
<garnt> very limited </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's a limited edition something </garnt>
<garnt> it's limited edition products i mean </garnt>
<joey> you know one can argue that that's like </joey>
<garnt> very good marketing it is very good </garnt>
<garnt> people will look at something premium </garnt>
<joey> being like well i guess if i can only </joey>
<connor> get it now i should get it now </connor>
<connor> it is it is kind of cool going into a </connor>
<connor> place and just having stuff be new </connor>
<connor> constantly but then there is also the </connor>
<connor> fact that like yeah i did really like </connor>
<connor> this one thing and you took it away from </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<garnt> yeah so i'm sorry it's like the same </garnt>
<garnt> thing whenever you travel to a new like </garnt>
<garnt> prefecture or something and there's </garnt>
<garnt> every pre like we talked about before </garnt>
<garnt> every prefecture has a specialty and an </garnt>
<garnt> item you can only get in that prefecture </garnt>
<joey> every prefecture will tell you that this </joey>
<garnt> is the best rice </garnt>
<joey> yeah in japan so every prefecture will </joey>
<garnt> tell you it's all the [ __ ] so like </garnt>
<garnt> definitely living in japan i've tried </garnt>
<garnt> more like i've gone out of my comfort </garnt>
<garnt> zone with trying </garnt>
<garnt> new products and new suites and new </garnt>
<garnt> views and everything but at the same </garnt>
<garnt> time i've just found more cravings that </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> can't get on a normal basis anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because it's only available from a </garnt>
<joey> certain preference what was the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> maple cakes </joey>
<connor> that we bought from yeah the manju that </connor>
<connor> we bought from like hiroshima oh </connor>
<connor> yeah those were so [ __ ] good yeah the </connor>
<joey> problem is you can only buy them in </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] hiroshima so it's just like cool </connor>
<garnt> i'm not really a sweet person but then i </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah we bought those and i ate one </garnt>
<connor> and i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i want to eat all of them </connor>
<connor> i like this stuff that i thought yeah i </connor>
<connor> only bought a tiny bag </connor>
<joey> could have gotten the pack of 24 but </joey>
<garnt> yeah i got the pack of eight but you </garnt>
<garnt> never know sometimes you go </garnt>
<garnt> you go you try out this new thing you're </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's all right it's it's mid </garnt>
<garnt> it's whatever right </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes you find that really </garnt>
<garnt> amazing product and you're like [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> but then but then on the contrary isn't </joey>
<joey> it amazing when you find that one </joey>
<garnt> regional thing that you think you're </garnt>
<garnt> never gonna see in tokyo and then just </garnt>
<garnt> one random shop sells it yeah yeah man </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah like i remember like uh in </connor>
<garnt> tochigi for example </garnt>
<connor> yeah they have this thing called lemon </connor>
<garnt> milk yeah which i [ __ ] love and it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> it was a regional specific thing for the </garnt>
<garnt> longest time and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> well [ __ ] i gotta make a trip up to </garnt>
<garnt> tortugi every time i want this yeah so i </garnt>
<garnt> would always buy it in bulk when i would </garnt>
<connor> come back home </connor>
<connor> but of course it doesn't last right and </connor>
<connor> then the craving comes back and i get </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] progressions </connor>
<connor> but then i remember uh i walked into </connor>
<connor> like a random company once and they were </connor>
<connor> just selling it </connor>
<connor> right and it was like [ __ ] oh it was </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] el dorado you know it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> the secret was here all along [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> bought all that [ __ ] and brought it back </connor>
<joey> and i was like all right no </joey>
<joey> put it on google maps this is the </joey>
<joey> company that sells the </joey>
<connor> the lemon milk man the the </connor>
<connor> sapporo special um thingy beer what is </connor>
<connor> it what's it called again </connor>
<connor> sapporo beer no no no no it's uh what's </connor>
<connor> the prefecture called hokkaido yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> we forgot for a second there </connor>
<connor> yeah hokkaido the sapporo beer is way </connor>
<joey> better when they have like the </joey>
<joey> the sapporo actual sapporo beer yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah this is so good i want to </joey>
<joey> bring so much back but </joey>
<connor> it's heavy does it actually make a </connor>
<connor> difference i genuinely think it tastes </connor>
<garnt> really better yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's weird i think sapporo in japan </garnt>
<garnt> tastes worse than i remember it tasting </garnt>
<garnt> abroad i don't know it's it's it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's cause i have it way more </garnt>
<garnt> often now but when i had sapporo like </garnt>
<garnt> on tap somewhere else i was like oh this </garnt>
<garnt> is so much better than the beer </garnt>
<garnt> that we that the other yeah yeah but i </garnt>
<joey> think it's because you're comparing it </joey>
<joey> to other beers right like i remember </joey>

<connor> but instead of </connor>
<connor> beer it's awamori which is essentially </connor>
<connor> just really </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] strong it's basically okinawan </joey>
<joey> vodka that's the only way to describe it </joey>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<connor> i i forget sometimes about the public </connor>
<connor> drinking lawsuit </connor>
<connor> which you can drink publicly publicly </connor>
<connor> here because i feel like </connor>

<connor> saying that </connor>
<connor> the pot noodles in the uk which should </connor>
<connor> be on screen are better than the ones in </connor>
<connor> japan i don't think that i think the </connor>
<connor> japanese ones are </connor>
<joey> superior in every way but there's </joey>
<joey> something familiar and comforting about </joey>
<joey> this it's nostalgic and also it's very </joey>
<joey> spicy which </joey>
<joey> unfortunately they're not that's hard to </joey>
<joey> come by yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's really spicy it's good [ __ ] i </joey>

<joey> it's like national pride or something it </joey>
<joey> is national prize </joey>
<garnt> i'm just [ __ ] awesome just a biscuit </garnt>
<connor> oh my goodness </connor>
<connor> get out of here i just i i think biscuit </connor>
<connor> is like the most </connor>
<connor> underwhelming sweet like it's it's hard </connor>
<connor> it's never satisfying </connor>
<connor> it is like soft cookies are way better </connor>
<connor> than hard cookies yeah like </connor>
<joey> what do you think i get i get that i get </joey>
<joey> that but like we also have like </joey>
<garnt> wait so do you guys consider tim tams to </garnt>
<garnt> be hard cookies no </garnt>
<garnt> biscuits biscuits oh hard biscuits right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah they're not soft </garnt>
<connor> what's the difference because that's a </connor>
<connor> soft biscuit to us because we have these </connor>
<connor> things eating rocks for harvesting we </connor>
<connor> have these things called anzac cookies </connor>
<connor> which are literally </connor>
<joey> rocks like i don't want to have too much </joey>
<garnt> break teeth you're trying to eat </garnt>
<connor> i don't want to have to worry that's not </connor>
<joey> a cookie if i have to worry about </joey>
<garnt> breakfast </garnt>
<joey> it's a cookie if i have to worry about </joey>
<connor> breaking my goddamn teeth it's not a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] cookie </joey>
<joey> antic biscuits are [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> australians watching this one though as </joey>
<garnt> biscuits are [ __ ] awesome it just </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like a health hazard it is a </garnt>
<garnt> health hazard because it sounds like </garnt>
<joey> it's like chewing it's like dude you can </joey>
<joey> work out your jawline eating this </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] cookie like it's so </connor>
<connor> tough we had these growing up i still </connor>
<garnt> have these in the uk obviously but </garnt>
<garnt> they're called digestives did you like </garnt>
<garnt> those </garnt>
<garnt> suggestions digestive biscuits </garnt>
<connor> digestives yeah they're called they're i </connor>
<connor> realized that they're not appealing </connor>
<connor> i realize that's not very fitting yeah </connor>
<connor> they were awful like nevertheless </connor>
<garnt> biscuit you can get and it's got like a </garnt>
<garnt> soft layer of chocolate covered on top </garnt>
<connor> and the chocolate is [ __ ] chocolate yeah </connor>
<garnt> the biscuit is like </garnt>
<garnt> just dry like a milk biscuit or no no no </garnt>
<connor> no it's like a wheat biscuit yeah that's </connor>
<garnt> what it looks like </garnt>
<connor> oh god that doesn't look good at all </connor>
<connor> yeah because </connor>
<garnt> you're supposed to like dip it with tea </garnt>
<connor> and uh coffee and stuff like that but </connor>
<connor> then sometimes you dip it in your hot </connor>
<connor> tea and it falls apart and your [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> teeth ruined </connor>
<joey> yeah but you can do that with a tim tam </joey>
<joey> as well i don't want to put anything </joey>
<joey> but i guess there's too much chocolate </joey>
<joey> to put in the tv there needs to be like </joey>
<joey> a perfect chocolate ratio </joey>
<joey> chocolate to biscuit ratio because tim </joey>
<joey> sounds like covered in chocolate right </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah and that </garnt>
<garnt> if it's too much chocolate starts </garnt>
<garnt> melting on your fingers as you dip it </garnt>
<joey> and see that's that's like you've never </joey>
<joey> had you've never done a tim tam straw </joey>
<connor> before </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that's like a thing that you did in </connor>
<connor> australia so it's always like you </connor>
<connor> haven't got a flip </connor>
<connor> kangaroo here's something there's some </connor>
<connor> australian culture for you all right so </connor>
<connor> you get a team </connor>
<connor> so it's like usually you do with a cup </connor>
<connor> of tea or a cup of coffee whatever you </connor>
<connor> prefer you get a team time you bite </connor>
<connor> both ends off right and then you use it </connor>
<joey> as a straw to suck up your tea and </joey>
<joey> coffee </joey>
<joey> and it's [ __ ] awesome is this some </joey>
<garnt> down under jokes </garnt>
<joey> yeah like what </joey>
<connor> when is something a culture and when is </connor>
<connor> it just like stupid </connor>
<joey> it's what we do that's what some people </joey>
<joey> do i did it once and i was like yeah </joey>
<joey> that's cool i don't do it every time but </joey>
<garnt> it's just a little thing you can do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know </garnt>
<joey> um we gotta find our own fun in </joey>
<garnt> australia right there isn't a lot to do </garnt>
<garnt> exactly all right but yeah i've like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't like biscuits </garnt>
<connor> at all no it's definitely like the worst </connor>
<connor> i i'm not really fond of cookies either </connor>
<garnt> i think cookies are over </garnt>
<garnt> it's just because uk cookies are just </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] okay no no no no no </connor>
<connor> uk the the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> store brand cookies are always [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> fresh cookies out the oven when they're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> they need to be soft and chewy </connor>
<connor> what i hate is if i bite on a cookie and </connor>
<connor> it crunches it goes everywhere yeah </connor>
<connor> and crumbs annihilate them if i have </connor>
<connor> crumbs </connor>
<connor> then i'm like this this is a [ __ ] cookie </connor>
<garnt> this is just a biscuit with extra steps </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i mean biscuit with </garnt>
<garnt> attitude yeah yeah yeah i like my </garnt>
<garnt> cookies to be </garnt>
<joey> gooey yeah i like it to be soft not </joey>
<joey> gonna lie i've never thought that deeply </joey>
<connor> about </connor>
<connor> excuse me because you know you grow up </connor>
<connor> in the uk you're watching american </connor>
<connor> cartoons and for some reason in american </connor>
<connor> cartoons cookies are like </connor>
<connor> like i don't know the the the thing that </connor>
<connor> fueled the world for </connor>
<connor> the kids generation cookies were what </connor>
<connor> the like the mayans used to </connor>
<connor> to barter and negotiate because they </connor>
<connor> these kids shows made cookies to be like </connor>
<connor> the godsend of like </connor>
<connor> everything so when i you know you grow </connor>
<connor> up and you can start buying your own </connor>
<connor> things you're like well </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean cookies are the best treat </connor>
<connor> when you start having them you're like </connor>
<connor> wait these are kind of </connor>
<joey> it's kind of [ __ ] it was it was always </joey>
<joey> like you know that mythical cookie jar </joey>
<connor> right there yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i didn't have it in my house </joey>
<joey> so i assume everybody else has </joey>
<joey> it it was just like cookies were like </joey>
<connor> insanely like valuable you know kids </connor>
<connor> were dying </connor>
<connor> fighting wars on the planet currency </connor>
<garnt> because yeah literally it's you know </garnt>
<garnt> because like for me whenever i get like </garnt>
<connor> baked cookies or someone who cooks fresh </connor>
<connor> cookies there's like as </connor>
<connor> soon as it comes out the oven the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] timer starts because </garnt>
<joey> when it's dry it's [ __ ] yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> because you because you've got to be </joey>
<joey> like 100 cookie speed right </joey>
<garnt> i gotta i gotta like enjoy this before </garnt>
<garnt> it starts hardening and it's like as </garnt>
<garnt> soon as it starts hardening </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of the few objects in the world </garnt>
<garnt> where moist </garnt>
<garnt> is a positive adjective you know what i </garnt>
<garnt> mean </garnt>
<connor> i get that yeah i feel bad when people </connor>
<joey> like make cookies like the day before </joey>
<garnt> and they bring them </garnt>
<garnt> like you want to try one of my home </garnt>
<garnt> baked cookies i'm like i could i could </garnt>
<garnt> try one of your homemade cookies but i </garnt>
<connor> will be sort of disappointed it's like </connor>
<garnt> those and brownies like </garnt>
<garnt> if i have like a dry brownie um it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a it's like the limped </garnt>
<connor> a drowning piece of brownies a brownie </connor>
<garnt> does need to be a little like </garnt>
<garnt> like wet yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> if it all that just [ __ ] crumbles </connor>
<connor> apart when i touch it i'm like well </connor>
<garnt> the structural integrity of this brownie </garnt>
<garnt> is appalling if it's flaky then </garnt>
<joey> it's it's if it's not making like a </joey>
<connor> sound </connor>
<joey> you know if it's not making that sound </joey>
<joey> that it's a bad brownie </joey>
<joey> i can't be the only one who thinks that </joey>
<joey> no you it needs to be like asmr levels </joey>
<connor> of like yeah you don't like smacking in </connor>
<connor> your ears for example </connor>
<joey> do your supermarkets in australia like </joey>
<joey> have bakery sections or they would bake </joey>
<joey> things yeah yeah yeah we did they used </joey>
<joey> it like in the uk to be fair they used </joey>
<garnt> to make pretty [ __ ] good cookies and </garnt>
<garnt> brownies </garnt>
<connor> do you do i think so wait sainsbury's </connor>
<garnt> like sainsbury's just have their own </garnt>
<garnt> bakery </garnt>
<garnt> okay so okay i've i've actually got i've </garnt>
<garnt> actually like i know the best ones it </garnt>
<garnt> goes </garnt>
<garnt> sainsbury's then tesco's then co-op </garnt>
<garnt> because those those are </garnt>
<connor> these all sound like just made up names </connor>
<garnt> yeah they do these are the supermarket </garnt>
<connor> chains in the uk </connor>
<connor> and all of them have their own bakery </connor>
<connor> and yeah you get like four fat ass </connor>
<garnt> cookies </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah right they were always </garnt>
<garnt> like freshly baked on the day and soft </garnt>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> they were [ __ ] good they were good </connor>
<connor> you could buy the like packaged ones but </connor>
<connor> like why would you do that when you </connor>
<connor> could go and get like a full box of </connor>
<connor> brownies like 16 little chunks </connor>
<connor> yeah like a quid right now and they're </connor>
<connor> freshly baked freshly baked </connor>
<garnt> really [ __ ] good yeah that sounds way </garnt>
<connor> better yeah i i'll tell you what i do </connor>
<connor> miss that i didn't think i would </connor>
<connor> dairy milk chocolate yeah i like dairy </connor>
<connor> milk like because i thought whenever i </connor>
<connor> came to japan on holiday and stuff i was </connor>
<connor> like i was like man the </connor>
<connor> chocolate his bomb i [ __ ] love the </connor>
<garnt> taste of chocolate here and then </garnt>
<garnt> after living here a year i just feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i've really </garnt>
<garnt> some something something homeless about </garnt>
<connor> dairy milk they've taken the american </connor>
<garnt> way of making </garnt>
<garnt> uh chocolate it does taste like america </garnt>
<garnt> because what they've done is instead of </garnt>
<garnt> having more milk </garnt>
<connor> and making it like a richer taste </connor>
<connor> they're like let's just substitute with </connor>
<connor> more sugar </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then you get this kind of </connor>
<connor> weird chemically taste which i like </connor>
<connor> hershey's </connor>
<connor> does hershey's tastes like just in my </connor>
<garnt> mind </garnt>
<garnt> like question marks with sugar like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know what this tastes like </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't taste like chocolate it </garnt>
<joey> tastes like a maid </joey>
<connor> i am not a fan of hershey's american </connor>
<garnt> chocolate does not taste like chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> i i used to </garnt>
<garnt> like really like hershey's like i i </garnt>
<garnt> still kind of do whenever whenever i'm </garnt>
<connor> like in the uk or whenever </connor>
<connor> it's not as rich so you can eat more of </connor>
<garnt> it yeah because what hershey's tastes </garnt>
<garnt> like it tastes like </garnt>
<joey> cooking chocolate right and i don't know </joey>
<joey> why i like the melting chocolate yeah i </joey>
<garnt> don't know why as a kid i [ __ ] loved </garnt>
<garnt> cooking chocolate because </garnt>
<connor> i it just it just like it's normally for </connor>
<connor> poorer quality yeah yeah exactly </connor>
<garnt> it's it's poor equality but as a kid i </garnt>
<joey> just like anytime we'd like cook </joey>
<joey> chocolate i just like </joey>
<joey> always have to dip my finger in it and </joey>
<joey> oh yeah </joey>

<connor> it's the most cautious word i've like i </connor>
<garnt> can think of off the top of my head it </garnt>
<garnt> just sounds so good i feel the monocle </garnt>
<connor> forming on my eyes </connor>
<garnt> because i feel like you you don't you </garnt>
<garnt> experience swish chocolate you don't eat </garnt>
<connor> swiss chard </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean you eat british </connor>
<connor> chocolate like it's saying you can just </connor>
<connor> eat </connor>
<garnt> you know what i mean the swiss don't do </garnt>
<garnt> drugs they do chocolate yeah oh </garnt>
<garnt> man i sometimes i like buy like a pack </garnt>
<garnt> of lint and i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> i'm i'm having i'm having a good day and </connor>
<connor> you eat all of the like lint package in </connor>
<connor> one go because i can't like because i </connor>
<connor> feel like i need a palette cleanser </connor>
<connor> every time i have like a rich chocolate </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> give me the the wine to go with it yes </connor>
<garnt> sir to empty the flavor </garnt>
<garnt> i have i have a like a problem where i </garnt>
<connor> have one it's enough you have a sweet </connor>
<connor> tooth though don't you i do not have a </connor>
<connor> sweet tooth [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> only in japan actually only in japan </connor>
<connor> because here's the thing i </connor>
<connor> i hardly ever used to snack i either i </connor>
<connor> either was that guy in england who would </connor>
<connor> eat a tub of ice cream </connor>
<joey> or not i'll go over that sweets for like </joey>
<joey> two weeks like i </joey>
<joey> i there was no between for me like only </joey>
<joey> in japan </joey>
<joey> have i ever like kind of embraced </joey>
<joey> snacking culture and that's just because </joey>
<joey> there are so many different kinds of </joey>
<garnt> sweets and snacks here yeah </garnt>
<joey> like kind of want to try something i </joey>
<joey> used to be a sweets guy back in </joey>
<joey> australia but then when i moved here i </joey>
<joey> realized that japan's </joey>
<connor> snack or like confectionery section </connor>
<connor> there's a lot more </connor>
<connor> savory [ __ ] yeah that just tastes way </connor>
<connor> better than the sweet [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> so i'm just i always just go for the </connor>
<connor> savory [ __ ] now it's easier to make </connor>
<connor> something that's </connor>
<connor> tastes good that's sweet though you just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] put a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] because </connor>
<joey> yeah but i also feel gross after eating </joey>
<garnt> it right because if you ever come to my </garnt>
<garnt> house in england if you ask for like </garnt>
<garnt> anything that's not savory snack i'm </garnt>
<connor> probably not gonna have it </connor>
<connor> because if i do have a lint like like a </connor>
<connor> chocolate </connor>
<connor> or like a lint box that's gone in like a </connor>
<connor> few hours most of the time </connor>
<connor> that's because i rarely buy but when i'm </connor>
<garnt> doing i'm like i'm like super craving it </garnt>
<joey> i don't know </joey>
<joey> i i mean i haven't had a ferrero rocher </joey>
<joey> in like probably like a year and a half </joey>
<connor> maybe do they sell them in japan oh yeah </connor>
<connor> do yeah yeah yeah you never see that </connor>
<joey> because if you go to like uh uh like </joey>
<joey> international shops </joey>
<connor> like they'll have it yeah oh because </connor>
<connor> like in in the uk that was like the </connor>
<connor> not expensive it's like the the if you </connor>
<connor> want to look expensive but not actually </connor>
<connor> spend too much money for error or shares </connor>
<connor> with the channel </connor>
<connor> it sounds fancy but the only thing that </connor>
<connor> isn't fancy is like the price tag i mean </connor>
<connor> they're expensive but </connor>
<connor> compared to like lin to lenore or </connor>
<garnt> something like that right i've had some </garnt>
<garnt> super super you talking about lint and </garnt>
<connor> ferro russia being like </connor>
<connor> i've really liked deep taste i've had </connor>
<connor> like shows aren't that intense </connor>
<connor> i've i've had some like the super </connor>
<connor> expensive chocolates are the ones i feel </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> you have to do you you're going you're </garnt>
<garnt> going on a [ __ ] battle with taking </garnt>
<joey> your bite out </joey>
<joey> forever shares like the premium </joey>
<joey> i'm like yeah it tastes like [ __ ] ash </joey>
<joey> do you like dark chocolate i do but </joey>
<joey> there's a limit like right </joey>
<joey> like it's like ninety percent couch yeah </joey>
<joey> because you'll go to play in these like </joey>
<joey> chocolatier places and they'll be like </joey>
<joey> it's amazing isn't it and it's like </joey>
<joey> eighty percent like </joey>
<garnt> and then you're like yeah that's great </garnt>
<connor> it's good sometimes i have like one bite </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i'm like oh i gotta [ __ ] battle this </connor>
<connor> like i'm having a [ __ ] battle with my </connor>
<garnt> mouth like trying to get this down </garnt>
<connor> like i get it if i was having like an </connor>
<joey> espresso or something to go with it </joey>
<joey> yeah perfect like they'll wash each </joey>
<joey> other out and you know i'll feel </joey>
<joey> happy but when you have one bite of </joey>
<joey> super dark chocolate </joey>
<joey> it [ __ ] stays with you for the rest </joey>
<joey> of the day yeah it does like think you </joey>
<garnt> can't you cannot get the taste out of </garnt>
<garnt> your mouth </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i don't want to feel like i've </garnt>
<garnt> just bleached my mouth i've never </garnt>
<garnt> thought about having chocolates with </garnt>
<garnt> like anything else actually really it's </garnt>
<connor> with coffee it's like the best yeah you </connor>
<connor> gotta have it with the coffee i don't </connor>
<connor> eat chocolate that's just with a hot </connor>
<garnt> drink </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i find it because for me </garnt>
<garnt> like coffee and tea </garnt>
<garnt> i just like by itself i've never tried </garnt>
<garnt> because if you dip something </garnt>
<garnt> into the tea that root that kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> changes </garnt>
<connor> i eat it you eat it when you drink it </connor>
<garnt> it's like a palate cleanser yeah because </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> if your mouth's too chocolatey you can't </connor>
<garnt> keep eating more chocolate i might want </garnt>
<connor> to give that a go then because i've </connor>
<connor> only never thought to combine the two no </connor>
<joey> because i never yeah i never thought </joey>
<joey> about it chocolate and tea </joey>
<garnt> like unspeakable like because chocolate </garnt>
<joey> has always been a snack for me </joey>
<connor> at a restaurant at like a fancy </connor>
<connor> restaurant they'll be like coffee and </connor>
<joey> dessert </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i just like coffee and </joey>
<connor> chocolate </connor>
<connor> yeah because they go together it's like </connor>
<joey> i thought </joey>
<joey> god's just like wow i didn't i thought </joey>
<joey> you're supposed to eat all the chocolate </joey>
<garnt> and then down your tea </garnt>
<garnt> are you telling me chocolate's meant to </garnt>
<connor> be just a snack </connor>
<connor> i'm not just a dessert because that's </connor>
<connor> that i guess that's the way i see all </connor>
<connor> chocolates right </connor>
<connor> it's not a like i said i don't i never </connor>
<garnt> used to snack it's like it was my </garnt>
<garnt> dessert i guess </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was like a full-on i'm either </garnt>
<connor> committed it's very sad to have a </connor>
<connor> chocolate bar and be like ah yes </connor>
<garnt> dessert my dessert my dessert yeah cause </garnt>
<garnt> like i </garnt>
<garnt> i actually like didn't start enjoying </garnt>
<joey> wine because </joey>
<joey> as a kid or like as as like a teenager i </joey>
<joey> would say wine was like the one alcohol </joey>
<joey> that i just couldn't get into yeah </joey>
<joey> i didn't understand why people liked </joey>
<joey> wine and then i remember the first time </joey>
<garnt> i tried </garnt>
<garnt> red wine or good red wine with good </garnt>
<garnt> steak and it was just like an instant </garnt>
<connor> eye-opening moment for me man i mean </connor>
<connor> let's be honest you can't you can't </connor>
<connor> really enjoy wine unless you're a bit of </connor>
<connor> a disposable income really </connor>
<connor> and i don't know about you growing up </connor>
<connor> but parents were like think that's a </connor>
<garnt> waste of time </garnt>
<garnt> unless you're here even before whenever </garnt>
<garnt> you know you've got </garnt>
<garnt> like your family or you're like one of </garnt>
<connor> your rich you know </connor>
<connor> relatives whatever you try this try this </connor>
<connor> good expensive wine and the only thing </connor>
<connor> you can think of this isn't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> worth 80 bucks </connor>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] kidding me and to be honest </connor>
<connor> i still think that i still think any </connor>
<connor> like i'm probably making some similar </connor>
<connor> cry here but i've never tasted like a </connor>
<garnt> wine beyond </garnt>
<garnt> above than let's say 50 bucks that's i </garnt>
<garnt> that has tasted a lot greater than some </garnt>
<garnt> of like the best wine </garnt>
<connor> yeah like a 60 wine tastes the same to </connor>
<connor> me as like a 200 wine yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly i mean i've had like you know </joey>
<joey> you can buy wine at convenience stores </joey>
<garnt> here for like </garnt>
<garnt> as cheap as four bucks </garnt>
<garnt> i can taste difference between that but </garnt>
<garnt> like the more expensive quote unquote </garnt>
<garnt> wines that you can buy like a 711 is </garnt>
<joey> like a thousand yen and those are </joey>
<joey> actually perfectly fine like i've had a </joey>
<joey> few of those where i'm just like </joey>
<joey> you know what this is actually pretty </joey>
<joey> good for a thousand yen wine it's i </joey>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's good for combini wine yeah but corn </garnt>
<joey> bean wine is the best you're gonna get </joey>
<joey> shout out to alpaca wine which is like </joey>
<connor> this that </connor>
<connor> alpaca wine is like what's like an </connor>
<connor> equivalent of like the cheap ones </connor>
<connor> echo fours is like the echo falls of </connor>
<connor> japan and in the uk it's a it's the </connor>
<joey> cheapest wine brand like a box wine </joey>
<connor> it's the uni but there is all the uni </connor>
<connor> it's about four pound for a bottle </connor>
<connor> right it's like always flavored like a </connor>
<joey> kid's drink </joey>
<joey> it's like lime and grapefruit and then </joey>
<joey> it just tastes like </joey>
<joey> antifreeze with grape hint yeah we have </joey>
